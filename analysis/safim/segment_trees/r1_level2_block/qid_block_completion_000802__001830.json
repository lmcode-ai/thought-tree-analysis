But the problem says: we need at most ceil(n/2) operations. For n=3, ceil(3/2)=2. The code for the else part:\n\n            d = math.ceil(n/2)\n            print(d)\n            i=1\n            j=3*n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                # TODO: output a swap: \n                #   for the k-th iteration (k from 0 to d-1), we swap (3*k+2) and (3*n - 3*k)\n                # But the code uses variables i and j? We see they initialize i=1, j=3*n. We can use a new variable k? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for k in range(d):\n                # swap (3*k+2) and (3*n - 3*k)\n                print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*n - 3*k}\")\n\n        But note: the variables i and j are defined but not used? We can ignore them? But the problem says: \"output one such shortest sequence of operations\"\n\n        And the known solution is to swap (2, 3*n) for the first operation, then (5, 3*n-3) for the second, then (8, 3*n-6) for the third? But wait, for k=0: 3*0+2 = 2, 3*n - 3*0 = 3*n.\n        for k=1: 3*1+2=5, 3*n - 3*1 = 3*n-3.\n        for k=2: 3*2+2=8, 3*n-6. But the example n=2: \n            d = ceil(2/2)=1. then we would output: 3*0+2=2, 3*2=6 -> \"2 6\", which matches. So the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n            for k in range(d):\n                print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*n - 3*k}\") But note: the variables i and j are defined but not used. We can remove them? But the problem says to output only the missing code.",

However, the problem constraints: total n over test cases <= 200,000. We can try to do:\n\n        best = 0 i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = 0\n        rsum = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if lsum == rsum:\n                best = i + (n - j - 1)   # because left has i candies (indices0..i-1) and right has n-1 - j candies (indices j+1..n-1) -> total = i + (n - j - 1)\n                # then we add the next candy to the left? lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            elif lsum < rsum:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n\n        # and then after the loop, if lsum==rsum, update best again? if lsum == rsum:\n            best = i + (n - j - 1)\n\n        print(best) But in the example [1,1]: \n        i=0, j=1: initially lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best = 0 + (2-1-1)=0 -> then we add arr[0] to lsum: lsum=1, i=1. then i=1, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do the else: rsum += arr[1]=1, j=0. then i=1, j=0: break. Then we check: lsum==rsum? 1==1 -> then best = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2. -> output 2. Correct. But what about [1,2]? \n        i=0, j=1: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best=0, then we add arr[0]=1 to lsum: lsum=1, i=1. then i=1, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do else: rsum += arr[1]=2, rsum=2, j=0. then i=1, j=0: break. Then check: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> not equal. Then output best=0. Correct. What about [10,20,10]? \n        i=0, j=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best=0, then add arr[0]=10 to lsum: lsum=10, i=1. then i=1, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=0 -> then we do else: rsum += arr[2]=10, rsum=10, j=1. then i=1, j=1: lsum=10, rsum=10 -> equal: best = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2. then we add arr[1]=20 to lsum: lsum=30, i=2. then i=2, j=1: break? then after the loop, lsum=30, rsum=10 -> not equal. So output best=2. Correct. What about [1,1,1,1]? \n        i=0, j=3: equal -> best=0, then add arr[0]=1 to lsum: i=1, lsum=1. then i=1, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> add to rsum: arr[3]=1 -> rsum=1, j=2. then i=1, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best = 1 + (4-2-1)=1+1=2. then add arr[1]=1 to lsum: lsum=2, i=2. then i=2, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> add to rsum: but j=2, so we add arr[2]=1 -> rsum=2, j=1. then i=2, j=1: break. then after the loop, lsum=2, rsum=2 -> update best = 2 + (4-1-1)=2+2=4.\n        output 4. Correct. But note: the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n        We want best=7. How does it work? We start: \n            i=0, j=7: equal -> best=0, then add 7 to lsum: i=1, lsum=7. Then: i=1, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=0 -> add to rsum: 1 -> rsum=1, j=6. Then: i=1, j=6: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> add to rsum: 11 -> rsum=12, j=5. Then: i=1, j=5: lsum=7, rsum=12 -> add to lsum: 3 -> lsum=10, i=2. Then: i=2, j=5: lsum=10, rsum=12 -> add to lsum: 20 -> lsum=30, i=3. Then: i=3, j=5: lsum=30, rsum=12 -> add to rsum: 8 -> rsum=20, j=4. Then: i=3, j=4: lsum=30, rsum=20 -> add to rsum: 10 -> rsum=30, j=3. Then: i=3, j=3: we break? Then after the loop, we check: lsum=30, rsum=30 -> update best = 3 + (8-3-1)=3+4=7. -> output 7. Correct. So the algorithm:\n\n        best = 0\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = 0\n        rsum = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if lsum == rsum:\n                best = i + (n - j - 1)   # record the current total candies (without the current pointers, because we haven't added them yet)\n                # then we add the left candy to lsum and move i\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            elif lsum < rsum:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = i + (n - j - 1)\n        print(best)\n\n   But note: in the initial code, we had:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[0]   # already added the first candy\n        rsum = arr[n-1] # already added the last candy And then we started the while loop with i<j.\n\n   We can either start with lsum=0 and rsum=0 and then use the above algorithm, or we can adjust. The current code in program1.py starts with:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[i]   # arr[0]\n        rsum = arr[j]   # arr[n-1]",

So the current code, with the TODO filled as:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   and then in the equal case, we update best and then move the left pointer, and we do not take the maximum?

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to complete the missing parts in two Python programs. The first program (`program1.py`) involves finding the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat while ensuring their total weights are equal. The second program (`program2.py`) involves minimizing the number of swaps required to ensure the string \"BAN\" does not appear as a subsequence in a repeated \"BAN\" string.\n\n### Approach for `program1.py`\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires Alice and Bob to eat candies from the left and right ends, respectively, such that the total weight of candies eaten by both is equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n2. **Intuition**: Use two pointers starting from the left and right ends. Move the left pointer right if the left sum is smaller, and the right pointer left if the right sum is smaller. When sums are equal, record the current total candies eaten and move the left pointer to explore potentially larger totals.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize pointers `i` (left) and `j` (right), and sums `lsum` and `rsum` with the first and last candy weights.\n   - While `i < j`, adjust sums by moving pointers:\n     - If `lsum < rsum`, move `i` right and add to `lsum`.\n     - If `rsum < lsum`, move `j` left and add to `rsum`.\n     - If sums are equal, record the total candies (left count + right count)",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The current code has a while loop that uses two pointers (i from left, j from right) and two sums (lsum and rsum). The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (by Alice from left and Bob from right) such that the total weight eaten by Alice equals that eaten by Bob.\n\nThe current code has a TODO in the branch for when rsum < lsum. We need to fill that in symmetrically to the case when lsum < rsum.\n\nAlso note: In the equal case, we update best and then we move the left pointer. However, we must also consider that after updating the left pointer, we might break the condition i<j? Actually, we must be cautious.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we can use two pointers.\n\nLet me explain the current code:\n\nWe start with:\n  i = 0, j = n-1\n  lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n  best = 0\n\nThen we enter a while loop (while i < j).\n\nIn the case lsum < rsum: we move i to the right (i += 1) and add arr[i] to lsum.\n\nIn the case rsum < lsum: we should similarly move j to the left (j -= 1) and add arr[j] to rsum.\n\nIn the case they are equal: we record the current total candies eaten: \n   candies from left: i+1 (because we have taken indices 0..i) -> but note: we started with i=0 and then we moved? Actually, initially we have taken one candy on the left and one on the right.\n\nBut note: the code in the equal case does:\n   best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n   then moves i: i += 1 and adds arr[i] to lsum.\n\nWhy +2? Because the left has taken i+1 candies? Actually, at the moment of equality, the left has taken from index0 to index i (which is i+1 candies) and the right has taken from index j to index n-1 (which is n-1 - j + 1 = n - j candies). So total candies = (i+1) + (n - j) = i + 1 + n - j = i + n - j + 1? But the code says: i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1 -> same.\n\nBut then after updating best, we move the left pointer? Why not also move the right pointer? Actually, we can choose to move either? But note: we are trying to find the maximum total candies. However, we can also try to continue? But the problem is that if we move only one, we break the equality. However, the problem does not require that we stop at an equality. We can have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total.\n\nBut note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So we must have disjoint sets.\n\nThe current approach: we start with the two pointers at the ends and then expand until we have an equality. Then we record the current total and then we move the left pointer? Why? Actually, we can also move the right pointer? But the problem is that we want to see if we can get a bigger total? However, if we move only one, we break the equality and then we might get a bigger total later? \n\nBut note: the problem is symmetric. We can also try to move both? Actually, the code in the equal case only moves the left. That might be a problem because we might miss a bigger total that uses the same left part and a different right part? \n\nHowever, the problem is that we are traversing from both ends. The idea is that when the sums are equal, we record the total and then we move the left pointer (so we break the equality and then we try to get a new equality with more candies). But note: we are allowed to have multiple equalities? Actually, we are only going to record the last equality? But we take the maximum? \n\nBut the code does not keep a list of all equalities? It only records the last one? Actually, we update best to be the maximum? But note: we are updating best only when we get an equality. And we are traversing until i<j. However, we are not storing all the equalities? We are updating best to the current total when we get an equality and then we move the left? \n\nBut what if we get multiple equalities? We want the maximum total? So we should update best to the maximum of the current best and the current total? Actually, the code currently does: best = ... and then moves. But we should do: best = max(best, i + (n-1-j) + 2) ?\n\nLooking at the note: the fourth test case: \n   weights: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n   total candies: 3+4 = 7.\n\nBut how does the two pointer work?\n   Start: i=0, j=7 -> lsum=7, rsum=1 -> lsum>rsum -> move j: j=6, rsum=1+11=12 -> lsum=7, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> move i: i=1, lsum=7+3=10 -> now lsum=10, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> move i: i=2, lsum=10+20=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=12 -> lsum>rsum -> move j: j=5, rsum=12+8=20 -> still less -> j=4, rsum=20+10=30 -> now equal: best = i=2 (so left has 3 candies) and j=4 (so right has 7-4+1=4 candies) -> total=3+4=7 -> then we update best=7. Then we move i: i=3, lsum=30+5=35 -> then we break because i=3 and j=4 -> then we move? Then we have lsum=35, rsum=30 -> then we move j? but j cannot move left because j=4 and i=3 -> then we break? \n\nBut what if we had moved the right pointer after the equality? Actually, the code moves the left pointer. But we can also move the right? However, the problem is that we are trying to maximize the total. After we have an equality at (i=2, j=4) we have 7 candies. If we move the left pointer, we break the equality. But we are not going to get a bigger total? Because if we move the left pointer, we add one candy to the left and then we have to remove some from the right? Actually, we are not removing, we are adding? \n\nWait, the two pointers are moving inward? Actually, we are starting from the ends and moving inward. The total number of candies we can get is the sum of the left segment and the right segment. The left segment is from 0 to i, and the right segment is from j to n-1. We want to maximize the total number of candies (i+1 + n-j) when the sums are equal.\n\nBut note: we are traversing the entire array? And we are updating best every time we get an equality? So we should update best to the maximum of the current best and the current total? Actually, the current code does not do that. It just sets best to the current total. But we might have a previous best that is larger? \n\nBut note: we are traversing and we might get multiple equalities? However, the way we move the pointers: we only move one at a time? And we are moving from the ends inward? The total number of candies we have at an equality is (i+1) + (n-j). As we move inward, the total number of candies we have is increasing? Actually, no: when we move the left pointer, we add one candy to the left and then we might have to move the right pointer to reduce the right segment? Actually, the total candies (i+1 + n-j) is decreasing as we move inward? \n\nWait: initially, we have one candy on the left and one candy on the right: total=2. Then if we move the left pointer, we add one candy to the left -> total becomes 3. Then if we move the right, we add one candy to the right -> total becomes 4. So actually, we are increasing the total? But then when we get an equality, we have a total of (i+1 + n-j). And then we move the left pointer: we add one more candy to the left, so the left part becomes bigger and we break the equality? Then we might have to move the right pointer to compensate? But the total candies then becomes (i+2) + (n-j) which is one more than before? But then we might get an equality again? \n\nActually, the total candies we are counting is the entire segment from the left and the entire segment from the right. The two segments are disjoint. The total number of candies is the count of the left segment plus the count of the right segment. And we are starting with small segments and then expanding? \n\nBut note: we start with the two ends. Then we add one candy at a time. The total candies is increasing by one each time we add a candy? \n\nHowever, when we get an equality, we record the total at that moment. Then we move one pointer (in the equal case, we move the left pointer). Then we are increasing the left segment by one candy. Then we might have to adjust the right segment? \n\nBut the problem is that we are trying to maximize the total. So we should record the maximum total we have seen so far? The current code does:\n\n   best = i + (n-1-j) + 2   [at the moment of equality]\n\nBut then we move the left pointer and then we might get a bigger total later? Actually, the total candies at the moment of equality is (i+1) + (n-j). Then we move the left pointer: now the left segment becomes i+2, and the right segment remains n-j. The total becomes (i+2) + (n-j) = (i+1) + (n-j) + 1 -> which is bigger? But we broke the equality. Then we have to add more candies? \n\nBut note: we are not limited to the same right segment? We might add more candies to the right? Actually, we are moving the pointers independently. \n\nHowever, the problem is that we are traversing the entire array. We are going to consider all possibilities? \n\nBut the current code does not take the maximum over all equalities? It just sets best to the last equality? \n\nWe should change: in the equal case, we update best to the maximum of the current best and the current total? \n\nBut note: the example test cases:\n\nTest case 1: [1,1] -> \n   i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (2-1-1) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 -> then we move i: i=1 -> then i<j fails? so we break -> output 2. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: [1,2,3,4,1,2] -> wait, the example says: \n   s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> but that's for program2. \n\nFor program1, the second test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> we saw that we get 7.\n\nBut what about the third test case: [10, 20, 10] -> \n   n=3, arr=[10,20,10]\n   i=0, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=10 -> equal: best = 0 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2 -> then we move i: i=1, lsum=30 -> then we have i=1, j=2: 30 and 10 -> then we move j? but j cannot move because j=2 and i=1 -> then we break? Then we output 2? But the example says 0? \n\nWait, the example says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\nBut we got 2? Why? Because we have two candies: the first and the last, each 10. That is 10 and 10. So why is the answer 0? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and we found 2 candies. But the example says the answer is 0? \n\nWait, the example: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\nBut we found a way? \n\nLooking at the note: the example test cases:\n\nTest case 1: [1,1] -> answer 2.\nTest case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer 6? but wait the example says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\" -> but wait, the example says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that would be [7,3,20] and [10,8,11]? but wait, the weights: \n   [7,3,20] = 30\n   [10,8,11] = 29 -> that doesn't match.\n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> the rightmost three: [1,11,8]? but that would be 1+11+8=20? \n\nActually, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are at the right? So the last three: [11,1]? wait, there are 8 candies: indices 0 to 7. The last three: indices 5,6,7: [8,11,1] -> 8+11+1=20? \n\nBut the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the first three when starting from the right? So the rightmost three: [1,11,8]? but that is 1, then 11, then 8? \n\nBut the example says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> that would be the three that are at the rightmost? So the last three in the array: [8,11,1]? but then the total is 8+11+1=20? \n\nBut the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, the example says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" \n\n7? How? \n\nLooking at the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] \n   Alice: first three: 7,3,20 -> 30\n   Bob: first three from the right: 1,11,8 -> 1+11+8=20 -> not 7.\n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are at the right? But then the total weight is 20, not 7.\n\nI see: the example says: \"the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are at the rightmost? But the example says the total weight is 7? \n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo? \n\nBut then the example says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\" \n\nSo they ate 6 candies? Then the entire array? But then the total weight for Alice: 7+3+20+5+10+8+11+1? That's 65, and Bob would have 0? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding: the problem says: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous segment from the left) and Bob eats from the right (any contiguous segment from the right). And they cannot overlap.\n\nSo in the second test case, the example says: Alice eats the first three from the left: [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats the first three from the right: [1,11,8] (total 20) -> that doesn't equal.\n\nBut the example says they both have 7? \n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that 7 must be a typo? It should be 20? \n\nBut then 30 != 20.\n\nAlternatively, the example might mean: \n   Alice: [7] -> 7\n   Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n   Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n   Bob: [1,11] -> 12\n\n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [1,11,8] -> 20\n\n   Alice: [7,3,20,5] -> 35\n   Bob: [1,11,8,10] -> 30\n\n   Alice: [7,3,20,5,10] -> 45\n   Bob: [1,11,8] -> 20 -> not the entire right? \n\nBut the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning he eats exactly three? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" (any contiguous segment from the right, starting from the rightmost). So he can choose to eat 1, 2, or 3, ... up to the entire right? \n\nSo the example solution: \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1 = 30 -> but that is the entire array? Then they have eaten all? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So if Alice ate the first three, then Bob can only eat the remaining? But the remaining are [5,10,8,11,1]? and Bob must eat from the right? So he can only eat a contiguous segment from the right? So he can eat [1], [1,11], [1,11,8], [1,11,8,10], [1,11,8,10,5]? \n\nSo if Bob eats [1,11,8,10] -> 1+11+8+10=30? Then that matches. So the total candies: Alice ate 3, Bob ate 4 -> total 7.\n\nBut the example says: \"the answer is 6\" for the second test case? \n\nWait, the example says: \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\nBut then in the fourth test case, the answer is 7.\n\nI see: the example second test case must be a different one? \n\nLooking back: the problem says: \n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nThis implies that the array has exactly 6 candies? \n\nSo the second test case: n=6, and the array must be such that the first three have sum 7 and the last three have sum 7? \n\nFor example: [1,2,4,4,2,1] -> \n   Alice: [1,2,4] = 7\n   Bob: [1,2,4] (the last three: [4,2,1] -> but wait, the last three: [1,2,4]? but that is the same as the first three? \n\nBut the array: [1,2,4,4,2,1] -> \n   Alice: [1,2,4] (the first three) -> 7\n   Bob: [1,2,4] (the last three: the last element is 1, then 2, then 4? but the array: \n        index0:1, index1:2, index2:4, index3:4, index4:2, index5:1.\n   Bob: from the right: first candy: index5:1, then index4:2, then index3:4 -> 1+2+4=7.\n\nThen they have eaten 6 candies? \n\nSo the array has 6 candies? \n\nTherefore, the second test case: n=6, array = [1,2,4,4,2,1] -> answer=6.\n\nBut then the example fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\nSo the third test case: [10,20,10] -> \n   We found: Alice takes the first (10) and Bob takes the last (10) -> total 2 candies? \n   But the example says 0? \n\nWhy? The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\nBut we found a way: 10 and 10. \n\nUnless the problem means that they must eat at least one candy? But the problem does not say non-zero? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" \n\nBut if they eat zero, that is also fair? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" -> if they eat zero, that's 0 candies. But we found 2 candies. \n\nSo why is the answer 0 for the third test case? \n\nLooking at the example: the third test case: [10,20,10] -> \n   If Alice eats the first candy (10) and Bob eats the last candy (10), then they both have 10. That is valid. \n\nBut the example says the answer is 0? \n\nI see: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> meaning she must eat a contiguous segment from the left? So she must start at the left and eat consecutively? Similarly, Bob must eat consecutively from the right.\n\nBut in the third test case: \n   If Alice eats the first candy (10), then she cannot then skip the second and then eat the third? Because she must eat in a row from the left. So she can only eat: \n        [] -> 0\n        [10] -> 10\n        [10,20] -> 30\n        [10,20,10] -> 40\n\n   Bob can only eat:\n        [] -> 0\n        [10] -> 10\n        [20,10] -> 30\n        [10,20,10] -> 40\n\n   Now, can they have the same non-zero weight?\n        Alice: [10] and Bob: [10] -> but note: the candy in the middle (20) is not eaten by either? That is allowed? The problem does not say they have to eat all candies.\n\n   But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". In this case, Alice ate the first candy (index0) and Bob ate the last candy (index2). The middle candy (index1) is not eaten by either. That is allowed.\n\n   So the answer should be 2.\n\n   But the example says 0.\n\n   I see: the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n   This implies that they cannot have non-zero weight? But we have 10 and 10.\n\n   Unless the problem requires that the entire candy sequence is contiguous? But the problem does not say that. \n\n   Alternatively, the example might have a different array? \n\n   The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n   So the array might be [10, 20, 30]? \n        Alice: [10] -> 10, Bob: [30] -> 30 -> not equal.\n        Alice: [10,20] -> 30, Bob: [30] -> 30 -> then they both have 30. Then total candies: 2+1=3.\n\n   But then the answer would be 3.\n\n   Or the array [1,2,3]? \n        Alice: [1] and Bob: [3] -> 1!=3\n        Alice: [1,2] and Bob: [3] -> 3 vs 3 -> equal? then total=3.\n\n   So why would the answer be 0? \n\n   The only possibility is that the array is such that no non-zero weight can be achieved? For example, if the array is [1,2,1]? \n        Alice: [1] and Bob: [1] -> 1==1 -> total=2.\n\n   Or [1,1,1] -> Alice [1] and Bob [1] -> 1==1 -> total=2.\n\n   I think the example third test case must be an array where no non-zero segment exists? For example, [1,2]? \n        n=2, arr=[1,2]\n        Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [2] -> 2 -> not equal.\n        Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [] -> 0 -> not equal.\n        Alice: [] -> 0, Bob: [2] -> 2 -> not equal.\n        So the only fair is both 0 -> 0 candies.\n\n   So the third test case must be [1,2]? \n\n   But the example says: \"For the third test case\" and the input n is at least 1, and the array has n integers. \n\n   The problem says: the first line of each test case contains n, then the next line contains n integers.\n\n   So the third test case: n=2, array=[1,2] -> then the answer is 0.\n\n   But our code for [1,2]:\n        i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> lsum<rsum -> move i: i=1 -> now i=1, j=1 -> break? \n        Then we output best=0.\n\n   But what if we consider Alice taking 0 and Bob taking 0? that is 0 candies. But our code does not consider that? \n\n   The problem says: they can choose to eat any number (including zero) from the left and any number (including zero) from the right. So the case of 0 candies is always possible. But we are looking for the maximum number of candies.\n\n   In the [1,2] case, we cannot get any positive number of candies that is fair? So the answer is 0.\n\n   But our code for [1,2] does not find an equality? So best remains 0 -> output 0. Correct.\n\n   Now, what about [10,20,10]? \n        i=0, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=10 -> equal: best = 0 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2 -> then we move i: i=1, lsum=30 -> then i=1, j=2: 30 and 10 -> then we move j: j=1 -> now i=1, j=1 -> break. Then output 2.\n\n   But the example says the third test case has answer 0? \n\n   So the third test case must be [10,20,30]? \n        i=0, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=30 -> lsum<rsum -> move i: i=1, lsum=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=30 -> equal: best = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2? \n        Actually: \n            i=1, j=2: \n                left segment: indices0 and 1 -> 10+20=30 -> so left has 2 candies.\n                right segment: index2 -> 30 -> 1 candy.\n                total = 2+1=3.\n                best = i + (n-1-j) + 2 = 1 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3? \n        Then we move i: i=2 -> then i and j become 2 and 2 -> break. Output 3.\n\n   But the example says 0 for the third test case? \n\n   I think the example test cases are:\n\n   Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n   Test case 2: n=6, [1,2,4,4,2,1] -> answer=6.\n   Test case 3: n=2, [1,2] -> answer=0.\n   Test case 4: n=8, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\n   So the third test case is n=2, [1,2].\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n   We must fix the TODO: in the branch \"elif rsum < lsum\", we should do:\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   Also, we must update best only when we have an equality? But we want the maximum total over all equalities. However, as we move the pointers, the total candies (i+1 + n-j) might increase and then decrease? Actually, we start with 2 candies (i=0, j=n-1) and then we add one candy at a time. The total candies is increasing? \n\n   But note: when we move the left pointer, we add one candy to the left, so the total becomes (i+2) + (n-j). Similarly, when we move the right pointer, we add one candy to the right, so the total becomes (i+1) + (n-j+1). So the total is increasing by one each time we move a pointer? \n\n   However, when we get an equality, we record the total. Then we move one pointer (in the current code, in the equal case we move the left pointer) and then the total increases by one? But then we might get another equality? \n\n   But we want the maximum total. So we should record every time we have an equality and take the maximum? \n\n   Therefore, we should change the equal case to:\n        best = max(best, i + (n-1-j) + 2)\n        then move the left pointer? \n\n   But why not move the right pointer? Or both? \n\n   Actually, we can move either? But if we move only one, we break the equality. But we want to see if we can get a larger total? \n\n   However, the total candies we are going to have in the next step is increased by one? And we might get an equality again? \n\n   But note: we are not guaranteed that we will get an equality again. \n\n   Alternatively, we can move both? \n\n   But the problem is that we are not limited to one move. We can try to move one and then the other? \n\n   However, the two pointers are independent. \n\n   But the standard solution for this problem (two pointers) is:\n\n        i = -1\n        j = n\n        left_sum = 0\n        right_sum = 0\n        best = 0\n        while i < j:\n            if left_sum == right_sum:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # total candies eaten\n                # then we move both? \n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    left_sum += arr[i]\n                    right_sum += arr[j]\n            elif left_sum < right_sum:\n                i += 1\n                left_sum += arr[i]\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n                right_sum += arr[j]\n\n        and then output best.\n\n   But note: in the equal case, we update best and then we move both pointers? \n\n   However, the total candies then becomes (i+1) + (n - j) which is the same as before? Because we added one on the left and one on the right? \n\n   Actually, we are increasing the count by 2? \n\n   But we want to record the total at the moment of equality. \n\n   And then we move both? \n\n   But the problem: what if after moving both, we get an equality again? Then we update best to a larger value? \n\n   For example: [1,1,1,1] -> \n        Initially: i=-1, j=4, left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal: best = 0 + (4-4)=0? \n        Then we move: i=0, j=3 -> left_sum=1, right_sum=1 -> equal: best = (0+1) + (4-3) = 1+1=2.\n        Then we move: i=1, j=2 -> left_sum=1+1=2, right_sum=1+1=2 -> equal: best = (1+1) + (4-2) = 2+2=4.\n        Then i=1, j=2 -> then we break? \n\n   But the entire array is eaten? \n\n   However, the problem: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. In this case, Alice ate the first two and Bob ate the last two? That is valid. \n\n   But the total candies is 4.\n\n   But what if we do not move both? \n\n   The problem is that we are allowed to have non contiguous segments? But Alice must eat contiguous from the left and Bob contiguous from the right. \n\n   The above solution is known from the problem \"Candies\" in Codeforces? \n\n   Actually, the problem is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1476/problem/B\n\n   But wait, the problem code is different.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        left_sum = 0\n        right_sum = 0\n        best = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if left_sum == right_sum:\n                best = i + (n - 1 - j)   # because left has i (0-indexed, so i candies: indices0..i-1) and right has n-1 - j (because j is the start of the right segment, so the right segment is j..n-1, which is n-1 - j + 1 = n - j) -> total = i + (n - j) \n                # but note: we haven't added the current candy? \n                # Actually, we are going to add one of them? \n                # Alternatively, we can record and then add.\n            ...\n\n   But the known solution for \"Alice and Bob and Candies\" (similar) is:\n\n        ans = 0\n        l = 0\n        r = n-1\n        suml = 0\n        sumr = 0\n        while l <= r:\n            if suml == sumr:\n                ans = l + (n - r - 1)\n            if suml <= sumr:\n                suml += a[l]\n                l += 1\n            else:\n                sumr += a[r]\n                r -= 1\n        if suml == sumr:\n            ans = l + (n - r - 1)\n        print(ans)\n\n   But this is from memory.\n\n   However, the problem constraints: total n over test cases <= 200,000.\n\n   We can try to do:\n\n        best = 0\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = 0\n        rsum = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if lsum == rsum:\n                best = i + (n - j - 1)   # because left has i candies (indices0..i-1) and right has n-1 - j candies (indices j+1..n-1) -> total = i + (n - j - 1)\n                # then we add the next candy to the left? \n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            elif lsum < rsum:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n\n        # and then after the loop, if lsum==rsum, update best again?\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = i + (n - j - 1)\n\n        print(best)\n\n   But in the example [1,1]: \n        i=0, j=1: initially lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best = 0 + (2-1-1)=0 -> then we add arr[0] to lsum: lsum=1, i=1.\n        then i=1, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do the else: rsum += arr[1]=1, j=0.\n        then i=1, j=0: break. Then we check: lsum==rsum? 1==1 -> then best = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2. -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   But what about [1,2]? \n        i=0, j=1: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best=0, then we add arr[0]=1 to lsum: lsum=1, i=1.\n        then i=1, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do else: rsum += arr[1]=2, rsum=2, j=0.\n        then i=1, j=0: break. Then check: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> not equal. Then output best=0. Correct.\n\n   What about [10,20,10]? \n        i=0, j=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: best=0, then add arr[0]=10 to lsum: lsum=10, i=1.\n        then i=1, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=0 -> then we do else: rsum += arr[2]=10, rsum=10, j=1.\n        then i=1, j=1: lsum=10, rsum=10 -> equal: best = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2.\n        then we add arr[1]=20 to lsum: lsum=30, i=2.\n        then i=2, j=1: break? \n        then after the loop, lsum=30, rsum=10 -> not equal. So output best=2. Correct.\n\n   What about [1,1,1,1]? \n        i=0, j=3: equal -> best=0, then add arr[0]=1 to lsum: i=1, lsum=1.\n        then i=1, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> add to rsum: arr[3]=1 -> rsum=1, j=2.\n        then i=1, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best = 1 + (4-2-1)=1+1=2.\n        then add arr[1]=1 to lsum: lsum=2, i=2.\n        then i=2, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> add to rsum: but j=2, so we add arr[2]=1 -> rsum=2, j=1.\n        then i=2, j=1: break.\n        then after the loop, lsum=2, rsum=2 -> update best = 2 + (4-1-1)=2+2=4.\n        output 4. Correct.\n\n   But note: the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n        We want best=7.\n\n        How does it work?\n        We start: \n            i=0, j=7: equal -> best=0, then add 7 to lsum: i=1, lsum=7.\n        Then: i=1, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=0 -> add to rsum: 1 -> rsum=1, j=6.\n        Then: i=1, j=6: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> add to rsum: 11 -> rsum=12, j=5.\n        Then: i=1, j=5: lsum=7, rsum=12 -> add to lsum: 3 -> lsum=10, i=2.\n        Then: i=2, j=5: lsum=10, rsum=12 -> add to lsum: 20 -> lsum=30, i=3.\n        Then: i=3, j=5: lsum=30, rsum=12 -> add to rsum: 8 -> rsum=20, j=4.\n        Then: i=3, j=4: lsum=30, rsum=20 -> add to rsum: 10 -> rsum=30, j=3.\n        Then: i=3, j=3: we break? \n        Then after the loop, we check: lsum=30, rsum=30 -> update best = 3 + (8-3-1)=3+4=7. -> output 7. Correct.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        best = 0\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = 0\n        rsum = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if lsum == rsum:\n                best = i + (n - j - 1)   # record the current total candies (without the current pointers, because we haven't added them yet)\n                # then we add the left candy to lsum and move i\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            elif lsum < rsum:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = i + (n - j - 1)\n        print(best)\n\n   But note: in the initial code, we had:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[0]   # already added the first candy\n        rsum = arr[n-1] # already added the last candy\n\n   And then we started the while loop with i<j.\n\n   We can either start with lsum=0 and rsum=0 and then use the above algorithm, or we can adjust.\n\n   The current code in program1.py starts with:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[i]   # arr[0]\n        rsum = arr[j]   # arr[n-1]\n\n   And then the while loop: while i < j.\n\n   We can modify to the known solution? But the problem says: we must fill in the TODO.\n\n   The TODO is in the branch: \"elif rsum < lsum\". We need to do:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But then what about the equal case? In the current code, when we get an equality, we update best and then we move the left pointer. But we should also consider updating best to the maximum? \n\n   However, the current code does not take the maximum, it just sets best to the current total. But we might have a larger total later? \n\n   For example, in [1,1,1,1]: \n        Start: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=0+(4-1-3)+2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then we move i: i=1, lsum=1+1=2.\n        Then: i=1, j=3: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> then we move j: j=2, rsum=1+1=2.\n        Then: i=1, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> equal: best=1+(4-1-2)+2 = 1+1+2=4 -> then move i: i=2, lsum=2+1=3.\n        Then: i=2, j=2 -> break. Output 4.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But what about [10,20,10]? \n        Start: i=0, j=2: lsum=10, rsum=10 -> equal: best=0+(3-1-2)+2=0+0+2=2 -> then move i: i=1, lsum=10+20=30.\n        Then: i=1, j=2: lsum=30, rsum=10 -> then move j: j=1 -> then i=1, j=1: break. Output 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   And [1,2]: \n        Start: i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> lsum<rsum? -> then move i: i=1, lsum=1+2=3 -> then i=1, j=1: break. Output best=0? because best was never set? \n\n   But initially best=0, and we never update? so output 0. Correct.\n\n   So the current code, with the TODO filled as:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   and then in the equal case, we update best and then move the left pointer, and we do not take the maximum? \n\n   Why is that correct? Because we are traversing and we will encounter the maximum total at the last equality? \n\n   But note: in [1,1,1,1] we had two equalities: first at (0,3) -> total=2, then at (1,2) -> total=4. And we updated best to 4 at the second equality.\n\n   So we are updating best every time we get an equality? and the last one is the largest? \n\n   Why is the last one the largest? Because we are adding candies one by one. The total candies is increasing? \n\n   Actually, the total candies at an equality is (i+1) + (n-j). \n        Initially: i=0, j=n-1: total = 1+1=2.\n        Then when we move, we add one candy either to the left or to the right? so the total increases by one? \n        But when we get an equality, we move the left pointer (so we add one to the left) and then the total becomes (i+2) + (n-j) -> which is one more than the previous total? \n\n   But then we break the equality. Then we might get an equality again? and then we update best to a larger value.\n\n   So the last equality we encounter will have the largest total? \n\n   But what if we have:\n\n        [1,1,2,1,1]\n\n        We want: \n            Alice: [1,1] -> 2\n            Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> total=4.\n\n        How does the code run?\n            i=0, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=0+(5-1-4)+2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then move i: i=1, lsum=1+1=2.\n            Then: i=1, j=4: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> move j: j=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> now equal: best=1+(5-1-3)+2 = 1+1+2=4 -> then move i: i=2, lsum=2+2=4.\n            Then: i=2, j=3: lsum=4, rsum=2 -> move j: j=2 -> break. Output 4.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   But what if we have:\n\n        [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n\n        We want: \n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n            Bob: [1,2,3] -> 6 -> total=6.\n\n        How does the code run?\n            i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=0+(6-1-5)+2=0+0+2=2 -> move i: i=1, lsum=1+2=3.\n            Then: i=1, j=5: lsum=3, rsum=1 -> move j: j=4, rsum=1+2=3 -> equal: best=1+(6-1-4)+2=1+1+2=4 -> move i: i=2, lsum=3+3=6.\n            Then: i=2, j=4: lsum=6, rsum=3 -> move j: j=3, rsum=3+3=6 -> equal: best=2+(6-1-3)+2=2+2+2=6 -> move i: i=3, lsum=6+3=9.\n            Then: i=3, j=3: break. Output 6.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO in program1.py is:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: we must be cautious: j might be at i+1? and then j-1 might be i? \n\n   The while loop condition: while i < j. So when we do j-=1, we get j>=i? But then we break the loop? \n\n   Actually, after we do j-=1, we then go to the next iteration? \n\n   So the code for program1.py is complete with that TODO filled.\n\n   However, the current code does not have the final check after the loop? But the examples above worked.\n\n   But consider [1,1]: \n        i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=2 -> then move i: i=1 -> then i=1, j=1: break. Output 2.\n\n   [1,2]: \n        i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> then we do the elif: rsum>lsum -> then we do the TODO: j-=1 -> j=0, then rsum += arr[0]? -> but j is now 0, and arr[0] is 1 -> rsum=2+1=3? \n        But wait, the current code in the TODO branch is:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But j was 1, then j becomes 0. Then we add arr[0] to rsum? But the right pointer is moving left, so we are adding the candy at index0? which is the leftmost? That is not the next candy on the right? \n\n        The right segment should be contiguous from the right. So we should add the candy to the right of the current j? \n\n        But initially, j=1 (the last candy). Then we move j to 0, and then we add arr[0]? That is the first candy? \n\n        But Bob is eating from the right: he starts at the last candy and then moves left. So the next candy he eats is the one at index n-2? \n\n        In the current code, we start with j=n-1, and we have already taken arr[j]. Then when we move j to j-1, we then add arr[j] (which is the new candy at the new j) to rsum.\n\n        But in [1,2]: \n            Initially: j=1, rsum=2.\n            Then we do: j -= 1 -> j=0, then rsum += arr[0] = 1 -> rsum=3.\n            Then we break? because i=0, j=0 -> i<j fails? \n\n        But then we output best=0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   So the TODO is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But note: the variable j is updated and then we use it to index the array? \n\n   However, we must be cautious: j might become negative? But the while loop condition is i<j, and j starts at n-1. We do j-=1 only when rsum<lsum and i<j. So j will be at least i+1? Then j-1>=i? \n\n   But then we break the loop? \n\n   Actually, after we do j-=1, we then go to the next iteration? \n\n   So the code for program1.py is complete.\n\n   But wait, the current code in the equal case does:\n\n        best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n\n   But what if i is already at n-1? Then i+1 would be n -> out of bounds? \n\n   The while loop condition: while i < j. So when we are in the equal case, we have i<j. Then we do i+=1 -> then i becomes i+1, which might be j? Then we break the loop? \n\n   But then we do lsum += arr[i] with i=j? \n\n   Example: [1,1] (n=2): \n        i=0, j=1: we do the equal case: \n            best = 0 + (2-1-1) + 2 = 0+0+2=2.\n            i += 1 -> i=1.\n            lsum += arr[1] -> lsum=1+1=2.\n        Then the next iteration: i=1, j=1 -> i<j fails -> break.\n\n   But note: the left segment now includes index0 and index1? But Alice is only allowed to eat from the left? and contiguous? But she has eaten the entire left? \n\n   However, the problem: Bob is also eating from the right. But if Alice eats the entire left, then Bob cannot eat any? \n\n   But in the equal case, we are not requiring that the segments are disjoint? \n\n   Actually, in the equal case, we have:\n        Alice has eaten from index0 to index i (which is 0) -> only index0? \n        Bob has eaten from index j (which is 1) to index n-1 -> only index1?\n        Then we update best to 2.\n\n        Then we move i to 1, and add arr[1] to lsum? That means Alice now has eaten index0 and index1? But then Bob has not moved? \n\n   But the problem: once a candy is eaten by Alice, Bob cannot eat it. \n\n   In the next iteration, we break. But we have recorded best=2. \n\n   But now, the candy at index1 is eaten by Alice? but Bob had already eaten it? \n\n   This is a flaw in the algorithm? \n\n   Actually, the two segments should be disjoint. In the state at the moment of equality, the segments are disjoint: Alice has [0..i] and Bob has [j..n-1] and i<j so they are disjoint. \n\n   Then when we move i to i+1, we are adding a candy that is currently not eaten by Bob? But Bob has eaten from j to n-1, and i+1 might be less than j? \n\n   In the [1,1] example: i=0, j=1: then we move i to 1. But 1 is the same as j? So we are adding the candy that Bob has already eaten? \n\n   This is a problem.\n\n   Therefore, we should not add the candy at index i+1 if i+1 is in Bob's segment? \n\n   But the algorithm should be designed so that the segments are always disjoint? \n\n   The known solution I described earlier starts with lsum=0 and rsum=0 and then adds the candies one by one, and the segments are built from the outside inward, so they are always disjoint.\n\n   The current code in program1.py starts with the first and last candy already taken. Then when we move the left pointer, we are taking the next candy to the right (which is not in Bob's segment because Bob's segment starts at j and we have i<j). Similarly, when we move the right pointer, we take the next candy to the left (which is not in Alice's segment).\n\n   But in the equal case, after we record the best, we move the left pointer: we take the next candy to the right. But that candy is not in Bob's segment? because Bob's segment is from j to n-1, and the next candy is at i+1, which is less than j? \n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   In [1,1]: \n        Initially: Alice has [0] and Bob has [1]. \n        Then we record best=2.\n        Then we move Alice to take [0,1]? But that is the entire array. But Bob has [1]? That is the same candy? \n\n   But note: when we move the left pointer, we are expanding Alice's segment to the right. But the candy at index1 is currently in Bob's segment? \n\n   This is a conflict.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm must be adjusted: we should not have overlapping segments.\n\n   The solution: in the equal case, we should not move the left pointer arbitrarily. We should move one of the pointers? but then we break the equality? \n\n   Alternatively, we can move both pointers inward? \n\n   But the problem: if we move both, then we are removing one candy from the left segment and one from the right segment? and then we add the next candy? \n\n   But that is not what we want.\n\n   The known solution that uses lsum=0 and rsum=0 and then builds the segments by adding one candy at a time from the ends is safer.\n\n   However, the problem says: we must fill in the TODO. And the TODO is only in the branch for rsum<lsum.\n\n   And the current code structure is:\n\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        lsum = arr[i]\n        rsum = arr[j]\n\n        best = 0\n        while i < j:\n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                # TODO: j -= 1; rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\n   And then after the loop, we print(best).\n\n   To avoid the overlap, we should not move the left pointer in the equal case if i+1>=j? \n\n   But the while loop condition is i<j, so i+1 might be j? \n\n   In the equal case, if i+1 == j, then after we move i to i+1, we break the loop? and we have added the candy at i+1 to Alice, but that candy is at j? which is the start of Bob's segment? \n\n   So we are taking a candy that was in Bob's segment? \n\n   This is a problem.\n\n   Therefore, in the equal case, we should only update best and then break? or move both? \n\n   But the problem: we want to see if we can get a larger total? \n\n   The known solution moves both pointers in the equal case? \n\n   We can change the equal case to:\n\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            # move both pointers? \n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But then in [1,1,1,1]:\n        i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=0+(4-1-3)+2=2.\n        then i=1, j=2: and then we add arr[1]=1 to lsum, and arr[2]=1 to rsum? \n        then lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+1=2 -> equal: best=1+(4-1-2)+2=1+1+2=4.\n        then i=2, j=1: break.\n\n   But then we output 4.\n\n   And in [1,1]:\n        i=0, j=1: equal: best=2, then i=1, j=0: break. Output 2.\n\n   And in [10,20,10]:\n        i=0, j=2: equal: best=2, then i=1, j=1: break. Output 2.\n\n   And in [1,2]:\n        i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> then we do the TODO: j-=1 -> j=0, rsum=2+arr[0]=3 -> then i=0, j=0: break. Output 0.\n\n   But what about [1,1,2,1,1]? \n        i=0, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best=2, then i=1, j=3, and then we add arr[1]=1 to lsum, and arr[3]=1 to rsum? \n        then lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+1=2 -> equal: best=1+(5-1-3)+2=1+1+2=4, then i=2, j=2: break. Output 4.\n\n   And the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n        i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> not equal? \n        then lsum<rsum? no, 7>1 -> then do TODO: j=6, rsum=1+11=12.\n        then i=0, j=6: 7<12 -> move i: i=1, lsum=7+3=10.\n        then i=1, j=6: 10<12 -> move i: i=2, lsum=10+20=30.\n        then i=2, j=6: 30>12 -> move j: j=5, rsum=12+8=20.\n        then i=2, j=5: 30>20 -> move j: j=4, rsum=20+10=30.\n        then i=2, j=4: equal: best=2+(8-1-4)+2=2+3+2=7.\n        then move both: i=3, j=3 -> break. Output 7.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But the problem: the current code in the TODO branch is not written. And the equal case we are changing.\n\n   However, the problem says: we must fill in the TODO. And we are allowed to change the equal case? \n\n   But the TODO is only in the branch for rsum<lsum. And the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n   But the missing code for program1.py is only the TODO part? \n\n   And the TODO part is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   But then the equal case is already written as:\n\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n   And this might cause overlap if i+1==j? \n\n   But the while loop condition is i<j. After we do i+=1, we have i might be j? Then we break the loop next time? \n\n   And the candy at i (which is now j) is added to Alice? but that candy was in Bob's segment? \n\n   This is a flaw.\n\n   Given the constraints of the problem (we must only fill the TODO), and the note that the known examples work (like [1,1] -> output 2, and [1,2] -> output 0) and the provided examples in the note work, we will assume that the intended solution is to move the left pointer in the equal case and hope that i+1 < j? \n\n   But in [1,1]: i=0, j=1: then i+1=1, which is j. Then we do lsum += arr[1] -> which is the same as the candy that Bob has. \n\n   So the total weight for Alice becomes 1+1=2, and for Bob remains 1. Then best was set to 2, but then we have an inconsistency.\n\n   However, after we move i to 1, we break the loop and then we output 2. And the segments at the moment of best=2 were: Alice: [0] and Bob: [1] -> which is valid. The later move is not affecting the best recorded.\n\n   So the best is recorded at the moment of equality. The later move is to try to find a larger total? but in this case, we break the loop and don't find any.\n\n   Therefore, the best=2 is output.\n\n   And the candy at index1 is added to Alice after we recorded best=2. But that is not used in the best=2 record. \n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   For program2.py:\n\n   The problem: remove \"BAN\" as a subsequence with minimum swaps.\n\n   The code structure:\n\n        if n==1:\n            print(\"1\")\n            print(\"1 2\")\n        elif n==2:\n            print(\"1\")\n            print(\"2 6\")\n        else:\n            d=math.ceil(n/2)\n            print(d)\n            i=1\n            j=3*n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The examples: \n        n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) -> \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\" -> no \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n        n=2: swap indices 2 and 6 -> \"BANBAN\" becomes \"BNNBAA\" -> no \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n   For n>=3, they ceil(n/2) operations.\n\n   The TODO: in the for loop, we need to output two indices for each operation.\n\n   The known solution: \n        We note that the string is \"BAN\" repeated n times: \n            BANBANBAN...BAN\n\n        We want to destroy every occurrence of \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        One known solution is to swap the 'A' and the 'N' in each \"BAN\" in every other occurrence.\n\n        Specifically, we can do:\n            For k in range(0, ceil(n/2)):\n                swap the 'A' in the (k)-th occurrence with the 'N' in the (n-1-k)-th occurrence.\n\n        How to index (0-indexed in the string, but the problem uses 1-indexed):\n\n            The k-th occurrence of \"BAN\" occupies positions: \n                B: 3*k\n                A: 3*k+1\n                N: 3*k+2\n\n            The (n-1-k)-th occurrence: \n                B: 3*(n-1-k)\n                A: 3*(n-1-k)+1\n                N: 3*(n-1-k)+2\n\n        Then we swap the A in the k-th occurrence (index = 3*k+1) with the N in the (n-1-k)-th occurrence (index = 3*(n-1-k)+2).\n\n        But note: the problem uses 1-indexed.\n\n        So for the k-th occurrence, the A is at position (3*k+1)+1?

We can remove them? But the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the variables i and j? \n\n        The current code:\n\n            i=1\n            j=3*n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                # TODO\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")   # because i=1, then the first A is at 1+1=2? \n                # then next: \n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n        For n=3: \n            d=2.\n            first: i=1, j=9 -> print 1+1=2 and 9 -> \"2 9\"\n            then i=1+3=4, j=9-3=6.\n            second: print 4+1=5 and 6 -> \"5 6\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But for n=2: \n            d=1.\n            i=1, j=6 -> print 1+1=2 and 6 -> \"2 6\", matches.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n            i += 3\n            j -= 3\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program2.py, the missing code is the block inside the for loop.\n\n   However, the TODO is inside the for loop, and we are replacing the entire block.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        program1: the two lines for the TODO in the elif branch.\n        program2: the three lines for the for loop.\n\n   But note: the program2 code has:\n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n            print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n            i += 3\n            j -= 3\n\n   But we must be cautious: the variable i and j are defined outside the loop.\n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n        i += 3\n        j -= 3\n\n   But we do this for each iteration.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But note: the program1 code has an indentation of 8 for the TODO? \n\n   In program1, the TODO is in:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with two lines of code, with the same indentation.\n\n   The current indentation for the elif branch is 8 (one level of 4 and then the if-elif block adds 4 more).\n\n   So we write:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n   with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output in a JSON string.\n\n   We must escape the newlines and quotes? \n\n   Alternatively, we can write the string with the exact code.\n\n   For program1: \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   For program2: \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But note: the program2 code is inside a for loop, and the for loop is already indented. The current code has:\n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with three lines, each indented by 8 (because the for loop is indented by 4, and the block inside the for loop is indented by 8).\n\n   So the three lines should be indented by 8.\n\n   But the code we are writing is the code that goes in the for loop, so we write:\n\n        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\n        i += 3\n        j -= 3\n\n   and each line is indented by 8.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding.\n\n   Since the TODO is at the same indentation level, we output the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use f-strings? But the problem does not specify the Python version.\n\n   But the original program2 uses print with string concatenation? \n\n   Actually, the original program2 for n=1: \n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"1 2\")\n\n   So we can use: \n        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\n\n   or \n\n        print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n\n   But to be safe, we use the same style as the rest.\n\n   The rest uses: \n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"1 2\")\n\n   So we can do: \n        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\n\n   But we can also do: \n        print(i+1, j)   # but this would print with a space in between? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"output m lines. The k-th of these lines should contain two integers i_k, j_k (1<=i_k, j_k<=3n, i_k != j_k)\"\n\n   And the example: \n        n=1: \"1 2\"\n\n   So we can do: \n        print(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n\n   But the problem says: the minimum Python version? \n\n   Since the problem uses `import math` and `for _ in [0]*int(input())`, it is likely that f-strings are allowed? But the original program2 does not use f-strings.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use string concatenation.\n\n   We choose to use: \n        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\n\n   But note: i and j are integers.\n\n   So the code for program2 is:\n\n        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\n        i += 3\n        j -= 3\n\n   But we must do this for each iteration.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program1 code has 8 spaces of indentation? \n\n   In the given program1, the elif branch is:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with two lines, each indented by 8 (relative to the outer block) or 12? \n\n   Actually, the code:\n\n        while i < j:\n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The if and elif are at the same level: 4 spaces for the while, then 4 more for the if/elif.\n\n   The existing code in the if branch is:\n\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\n   which is indented by 8.\n\n   So we should output for program1:\n\n        \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   Similarly, in program2, the for loop is:\n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at 8 spaces (4 for the else, 4 for the for). The code we put should be at 8 spaces.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But note: the quotes must be escaped in the JSON string.\n\n   We are to output a JSON string.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n        }\n\n   But the inner double quotes in program2 must be escaped.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON string? But the specification says to use double quotes.\n\n   We escape the double quotes in the string for program2: \n        \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But the entire value is a string, so we must escape the backslashes? \n\n   Actually, in JSON, we use backslash to escape.\n\n   So the program2 string has: \n        ... + \\\" \\\" + ...\n\n   We write: \n        \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\\\\\" \\\\\\\" + str(j))\\\\n        i += 3\\\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But wait, the newline is represented as \\n, and in JSON we must escape the backslash? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a raw string? \n\n   But the problem: we are to output a JSON object.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        \"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n        \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   and then when we dump to JSON, the newlines and quotes will be escaped.\n\n   But we are writing the JSON as a string? \n\n   Alternatively, we can write the exact string with the necessary escapes.\n\n   For program1: \n        We have two lines: \n            \"        j -= 1\" and \"        rsum += arr[j]\"\n        separated by a newline: so we write: \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n   For program2: \n        We have three lines:\n            \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\"\n            \"        i += 3\"\n            \"        j -= 3\"\n        We write: \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   And then we put this in a JSON string, so we escape the double quotes and the newlines.\n\n   But in JSON, a string can contain newlines? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the format of the JSON, but we can output a standard JSON.\n\n   We can use the json module to dump, but the problem says to output only the JSON.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"}\n\n   But note: the entire JSON must be on one line? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output pretty-printed? \n\n   The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then the JSON structure.\n\n   We'll output the JSON in one line.\n\n   But the newlines in the string values are represented as \\n.\n\n   And the double quotes in the program2 string are represented as \\\".\n\n   So the final output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"}\n\n   But wait, the program2 string has a double quote in the string, so we must escape it.\n\n   We replace every \" in the string with \\\".\n\n   However, the string for program2 is:\n\n        s = '        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))'\n        then two more lines.\n\n   So the entire string for program2 is:\n\n        \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   When we put this in a JSON string, we must escape the double quotes that are inside.\n\n   We do:\n\n        \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   But this is ambiguous: the JSON parser will see:\n\n        \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n   which when parsed becomes:\n\n        '        print(str(i+1) + \" \" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3'\n\n   This is what we want.\n\n   Therefore, we output the JSON as:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n        }\n\n   But without the pretty-printing, in one line.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n   We output the JSON.\n\n   Let me write the exact string:\n\n        \"{\\\"program1\\\": \\\"        j -= 1\\\\n        rsum += arr[j]\\\", \\\"program2\\\": \\\"        print(str(i+1) + \\\\\\\" \\\\\\\" + str(j))\\\\n        i += 3\\\\n        j -= 3\\\"}\"\n\n   But we are not to output as markdown, but as plain text.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"}\n\n   and hope that the newlines are properly interpreted.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   We output the JSON.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"        print(str(i+1) + \\\" \\\" + str(j))\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"}\n\n   This should be the answer."
