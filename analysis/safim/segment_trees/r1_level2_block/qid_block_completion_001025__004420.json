Similarly, the condition for person1: it requires that chair1 is free -> and it is free.",

So we can do:\n\n                    if m==n:\n                        r=0\n                    else: r = (n-1)//m + (n-m) But the code is inside a while loop that runs only if m<n. \n\n                We can do:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n                    break   # because we only need one iteration. But the problem: the while loop condition is m<n, and we are not changing m or n, so if we don't break, it would be an infinite loop.",

The entire program1.py after completion:\n\n            I=lambda:[*map(int,input().split())]\n            t,=I()\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                n, m = I()\n                a = I() if n > m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    a.sort(reverse=True)\n                    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                        total += a[i] + 1\n                        if total > m:\n                            break\n                    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        program2.py completion:\n\n            We are to fill the while loop:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n                    break\n\n        But note: the break is necessary to avoid infinite loop. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if m < n:\n                r = (n-1)//m + (n - m) But the code uses a while loop, so we break.",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first problem involves determining if all people can sit on a circle of chairs with specific empty chair requirements, while the second problem involves finding the minimal number of operations to create a copy of an array where all elements are equal.\n\n### Solution for Program1: Sitting Arrangement in a Circle\nThe solution involves checking if it's possible to seat all people in a circle of chairs such that each person has at least a specified number of empty chairs on both sides. The approach is as follows:\n1. **Check for Sufficient Chairs**: If the number of people `n` exceeds the number of chairs `m`, it's immediately impossible to seat everyone, so we output \"NO\".\n2. **Sort Requirements in Descending Order**: The requirements are sorted in descending order to prioritize placing people with the largest empty chair requirements first.\n3. **Calculate Total Space Needed**: The total space required is computed as:\n   - The first person needs `2 * a[0] + 1` chairs (including their own chair).\n   - Each subsequent person needs `a[i] + 1` additional chairs (accounting for their chair and the gap from the previous person).\n4. **Check Feasibility**: If the total space required is within the available chairs `m`, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution for Program2: Minimal Operations for Uniform Array\nThe solution involves determining the minimal number of operations (cloning arrays and swapping elements) needed to create a copy of the array where all elements are equal. The approach is:\n1. **Find Maximum Frequency**: The highest frequency `m` of any element in the array is found. If all elements are already the same (`m == n`), no operations are needed.\n2. **Calculate Operations**: The minimal operations required are computed as:\n   - **Cloning Operations**: The number of clones needed is `(n - 1) // m`, which ensures there are enough copies to gather the required elements.\n   - **Swapping Operations**: The number of swaps needed is `n - m` to replace non-target elements in the target copy.\n3. **Total Operations**: The sum of cloning and swapping operations gives the minimal operations required.\n\n### Code Implementation\n**Program1:**\n```python\nt -= 1\nn, m = I()\na = I()\nif n > m:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a.sort(reverse=True)\n    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n        total += a[i] + 1\n        if total > m:\n            break\n    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We have multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given:\n   t: number of test cases\n   for each test case: n, m and a list a of n integers.\n\n The problem: m chairs in a circle, n people. The i-th person requires at least a[i] empty chairs on both left and right.\n This means that when a person sits at chair j, then the segment [j - a[i], j + a[i]] (mod m) must be free (and note the circle).\n\n Important: The total of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n How to solve?\n Observation: The condition for a person with requirement a[i] is that they need a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1 chairs (because: a[i] left, the person, a[i] right).\n\n However, note the circle: the block might wrap around? But the problem says: \n   (j - a[i]) mod m, ... (j + a[i]) mod m -> that's 2*a[i]+1 consecutive chairs (in the circle).\n\n But note: if 2*a[i]+1 > m, then it's impossible.\n\n However, we have n people. We cannot assign the same chair to two people, and the blocks might overlap.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Since the circle is symmetric, we can break the circle and think linearly? But note: the circle might allow two segments that wrap around to be non-overlapping? However, the problem is difficult.\n\n Alternate approach (known from similar problems):\n\n Insight: \n   - Sort the requirements in descending order (because the person with the largest requirement is the most restrictive).\n   - We need to assign each person a starting position? Actually, we can think of the circle as having gaps.\n\n However, note: the condition is that each person requires a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1 chairs. And these blocks must be disjoint (because a chair cannot be used by two people and also the empty requirement).\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the blocks are disjoint? Actually, the condition for one person forbids others from sitting in that entire block. So the blocks must be disjoint.\n\n Therefore, we require that the sum of (2*a[i] + 1) for all i does not exceed m? Not exactly: because the circle might allow non-overlapping blocks that are not adjacent? But note: the circle is contiguous and the blocks are contiguous. However, the circle might have the blocks wrapping around? Actually, the problem does not require the blocks to be adjacent. They can be anywhere.\n\n But wait: the circle has fixed total chairs. The blocks must be disjoint and each of size (2*a[i]+1). Therefore, we must have:\n      sum_i (2*a[i] + 1) <= m   ??? \n   However, that is not sufficient: because the circle might break the linear arrangement. Also, note that the circle might have the last block and the first block overlapping? Actually, we are assigning disjoint contiguous segments in a circle. The necessary condition is that the sum of the lengths of the blocks is at most m? But that is not sufficient: because if we have two blocks, one of size 3 and one of size 3, then in a circle of 6, they can be placed without overlapping? But if we have two blocks of size 4 in a circle of 8, they can be placed without overlapping? Actually, they can be placed without overlapping if the circle is big enough.\n\n However, consider: the circle has the property that the entire set of blocks must not wrap around in a way that causes the last block to overlap with the first? Actually, we can break the circle arbitrarily. The necessary and sufficient condition is that the sum of the lengths of the blocks is at most m? But note: if we break the circle, we can arrange the blocks arbitrarily. However, the circle does not require the blocks to be adjacent. They can be placed arbitrarily as long as they are disjoint.\n\n But wait: the circle has no beginning and end. The condition for disjointness is that the entire set of blocks does not cover the circle in a way that the last block wraps and hits the first? Actually, we can always arrange the blocks in a circle without overlapping if the total length of the blocks is at most m? However, that is not true: because the circle is cyclic and contiguous. Actually, the problem is equivalent to covering the circle with disjoint intervals. The necessary condition is that the total length of the intervals is at most m. But is that sufficient? \n\n However, note: we are not covering the entire circle? We are leaving gaps. So we can arrange the blocks arbitrarily as long as the total length is <= m? \n\n But consider: two blocks of size 3 in a circle of 5: \n   total length = 6 > 5 -> impossible. \n   But if total length is 5, then we have no gap? Actually, we can have two blocks of size 2 and 2 in a circle of 5: \n        Block1: [0,1] -> size 2 (which is 2*a+1, so a= (2-1)/2 -> not integer) -> so we require integer a.\n\n Actually, the block size is 2*a[i]+1, which is always odd? Not necessarily: if a[i] is integer, then 2*a[i]+1 is odd? Yes.\n\n But 5 is odd, and we have two odd blocks: 3 and 3 -> total 6>5 -> impossible. \n\n However, what if we have two blocks of size 3 in a circle of 6? Then we can put them opposite: [0,1,2] and [3,4,5] -> no overlap. So total length 6 <= 6 -> works.\n\n But what if we have two blocks of size 3 in a circle of 6? Then we can put them without overlapping? Yes.\n\n However, what if we have two blocks of size 3 in a circle of 5? Then 3+3=6>5 -> impossible.\n\n Therefore, a necessary condition is: \n        sum_i (2*a[i] + 1) <= m.\n\n But is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: \n   Test case 2: n=2, m=5, a = [1,1] -> total = (2*1+1) + (2*1+1) = 3+3 = 6 > 5 -> we would output \"NO\", but the example says it is possible.\n\n Why? Because the example says: \n        the first person sits at chair 2, the second at chair 0. \n        Then the first person requires: [2-1, 2+1] mod 5 -> [1,2,3] -> but note: the circle: 2+1=3 -> so chairs 1,2,3 are forbidden? \n        The second person at 0: [0-1,0+1] mod 5 -> [4,0,1] -> so chairs 4,0,1 are forbidden.\n\n Now, the two blocks: \n        first: [1,2,3] -> size 3\n        second: [4,0,1] -> size 3, but note that chair 1 is in both? -> conflict.\n\n However, the example says: chairs 1 and 3 are free? Actually, the example says: \"chairs 1 and 3 are free\" meaning that they are not occupied? But the condition requires that the chairs in the forbidden zones are not occupied by other people. The two people are sitting at 0 and 2. The forbidden zones are:\n        for person at 0: [4,0,1] -> so chairs 4,0,1 must be free of other people? But chair 0 is occupied by the person, and chair 1 is free? and chair 4 is free? \n        for person at 2: [1,2,3] -> chair 1 is free, chair 2 is occupied, chair 3 is free.\n\n So the forbidden zones are only for other people? The person's own chair is allowed? The problem says: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\" -> so the person's own chair is allowed (because they are sitting there) and the others are forbidden.\n\n Therefore, the block for a person at j: \n        they require that the chairs (j - a[i]) mod m, ... (j + a[i]) mod m, EXCEPT the chair j itself, must be free? \n\n But note: the problem says: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs: ...\". So the entire segment of 2*a[i]+1 chairs must be exclusively for that person? That is, the entire segment must be free of any other person? And the person sits in the middle.\n\n Therefore, the two blocks must be disjoint? \n\n In the example: \n        person0: [4,0,1] -> chairs 4,0,1 (with 0 being the sitting chair)\n        person2: [1,2,3] -> chairs 1,2,3 (with 2 being the sitting chair)\n\n They share chair 1 -> conflict? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\". So for person0, chair1 is forbidden for others? meaning that person2 cannot sit in chair1? But person2 is sitting in chair2, which is not chair1. However, the block of person2 includes chair1? and that chair is forbidden for person0? \n\n Actually, the condition for person0: chair1 must be free (no one else). But person2's block does not sit in chair1? It sits in chair2. However, the condition for person2: it requires that chair1 is free? So if we have two persons, then the entire union of the two blocks must be free of any person except the one sitting in the center of their own block.\n\n Therefore, the two blocks must be disjoint? Because if they overlap, then in the overlapping chair, there is no one sitting? But that chair is forbidden by both persons? So it's okay to have an overlap as long as no one sits in that chair? \n\n However, the problem does not require that the forbidden zones are disjoint. It only requires that no two persons sit in the same chair and that no person sits in a forbidden zone of another.\n\n Therefore, the blocks can overlap? \n\n But then the total length of the blocks might be more than m? \n\n However, the example: \n        m=5, two blocks: [0,1,2] and [2,3,4] -> they overlap at 2? \n        But if we put person0 at 0 and person1 at 3? \n            person0: [0-1,0+1] mod5 = [4,0,1] -> so chairs 4,0,1 are forbidden for others? \n            person1: [3-1,3+1] mod5 = [2,3,4] -> so chairs 2,3,4 are forbidden for others? \n        Now, if we put person0 at 0 and person1 at 3, then:\n            person0 sits at 0 -> so chair0 is taken, and chairs 4 and 1 are forbidden (so no one else can sit there).\n            person1 sits at 3 -> so chair3 is taken, and chairs 2 and 4 are forbidden? \n        But chair4 is forbidden by both? and chair2 is forbidden by person1? \n        Now, can we have two persons? \n            The chairs: \n                0: taken by person0 -> allowed? \n                3: taken by person1 -> allowed? \n                The other chairs: 1,2,4 are forbidden? \n            So no one else can sit? and we have two persons -> that's all.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the second person in test case 2 sits at 0 and the first at 2? \n            Actually, the example: \n                \"the first person can sit 2nd and the second person can sit in the 0th chair\"\n\n        So let me check with that:\n            first person at 2: forbidden = [1,2,3] -> so chair2 is taken, chairs 1 and 3 are forbidden? \n            second person at 0: forbidden = [4,0,1] -> chair0 is taken, chairs 4 and 1 are forbidden? \n            Now, chair1 is forbidden by both? and chair3 and chair4 are forbidden? \n            The chairs that are taken: 0 and 2 -> that's two persons. \n            The forbidden chairs: 1,3,4 -> and they are not taken? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\" -> meaning that the forbidden chairs must not be occupied by any other person. Since we only have two persons, and they are sitting at 0 and 2, then the forbidden chairs (1,3,4) are indeed free? \n\n        However, the block for the first person (at 2) includes chair1? and the block for the second person (at 0) also includes chair1? -> so chair1 is in both blocks? \n\n        But that is allowed? because the condition is that no one sits in chair1? and that is satisfied.\n\n Therefore, the blocks can overlap? \n\n Then the condition is not the sum of the block sizes? \n\n How to solve?\n\n Known solution from similar problems (e.g., CodeForces problems):\n\n Insight: \n   - Sort the array a in descending order: a0 >= a1 >= ... >= a_{n-1}\n   - We assign the persons one by one. We need to cover the circle with n segments, each of length (2*a[i]+1) (but they can overlap arbitrarily in the forbidden zones, as long as the sitting positions are distinct and not in the forbidden zones of others).\n\n However, the sitting positions must be at least 1 apart? Actually, the sitting positions must be distinct and not lying in the forbidden zones of others.\n\n Alternate known solution:\n\n   We note that the condition for the circle is that we can break the circle arbitrarily. We can think linearly by cutting the circle at a point. But note: if we break the circle, we have a segment of length m. However, the circle might wrap.\n\n Known solution from CodeForces: \n   - We sort a in descending order.\n   - We then check: \n        condition: a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i] + i < m   for all i? \n        Actually, we see in known problems (e.g., Round #700) that the condition is:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # we are going to assign the i-th person (with requirement a[i]) a block that requires 2*a[i]+1 chairs? \n            # But note: we can share the gaps? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Accidental Victory\" is different.\n\n After checking known problems: \n   Problem name: \"Accidental Victory\" is not the same.\n\n Another known problem: CodeForces Round #700, Div2 C: \"The Sports Festival\"\n\n But that is not the same.\n\n After research, I recall a problem: \n   We require: \n        sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] + 1) <= m   ??? \n\n   But the example: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1]: \n        (1+1) + (1+1) = 4 <= 5 -> condition holds? \n\n   But then why the example with n=2, m=5, a=[2,2]? \n        (2+1)+(2+1)=6>5 -> condition fails -> which is correct because the example says it's impossible.\n\n   However, what about the example: n=3, m=10, a=[2,2,1]? \n        (2+1)+(2+1)+(1+1)=3+3+2=8<=10 -> condition holds? \n\n   But the example test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[1,1,1] -> \n        (1+1)*3 = 6<=10 -> condition holds -> and the example says YES.\n\n   But what about the example test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[1,2]? \n        (1+1)+(2+1)=2+3=5<=5 -> condition holds? \n        However, the example says: \n            \"if the second person sits down somewhere, he needs 2 empty chairs, both on his right and on his left side, so it is impossible to find a place for the first person, because there are only 5 chairs.\"\n\n        Why? \n            The second person (with a[1]=2) requires 2*2+1 = 5 chairs? -> so he requires the entire circle? Then the first person cannot sit? \n\n        Therefore, the condition for the second person alone: 2*a[1]+1 = 5 <= m? -> holds. \n        But then why is it impossible?\n\n        The problem: the second person requires 5 chairs? Then he sits in one chair and requires the entire circle to be empty? Then the first person cannot sit? \n\n        Therefore, the condition for a single person: 2*a[i]+1 <= m? \n\n        But for the first person: a[0]=1 -> 2*1+1=3<=5 -> holds.\n\n        However, if we assign the second person first: he takes 5 chairs? then the first person has no chair? \n\n        Alternatively, if we assign the first person first: \n            Suppose we put the first person at chair0: then the forbidden chairs are [4,0,1] -> so chairs 4,0,1 are forbidden? \n            Then we need to put the second person in the remaining chairs: 2 or 3? \n            If we put the second person at chair2: \n                then his forbidden zone: [2-2, 2+2] mod5 = [0,1,2,3,4] -> entire circle? \n                But chair0 and chair1 are already forbidden by the first person? and the second person requires that these chairs are free? -> conflict? \n\n        Therefore, the condition must be: \n            We must have at least one ordering such that we can assign the persons without conflict? \n\n        How about sorting the requirements in descending order? \n            First assign the person with the largest requirement? \n\n        Condition: \n            Let a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n            Then we require: \n                for i in range(n):\n                    if a_sorted[i] > m - 1: # because 2*a_sorted[i]+1 > m?

\n                        # But note: when we have already placed i persons, the circle is broken into segments? \n\n        Actually, known solution from CodeForces for problem \"Chairs\" (or similar) is:\n\n            sort(a, reverse=True)\n            if 2 * a[0] + 1 > m:\n                return \"NO\"\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                total += a[i] + 1\n                if total > m:\n                    return \"NO\"\n            return \"YES\"\n\n        But wait: the example [1,2] in m=5: \n            sorted: [2,1] (descending)\n            condition for a[0]=2: 2*2+1=5<=5 -> holds.\n            total = 0\n            i=0: total += 2+1 -> 3\n            i=1: total += 1+1 -> 5\n            total=5<=m? -> then YES? but the example says NO.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces Round #709) is:\n\n            total = a[0]  # the largest\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += a[i] + 1\n            if total <= m:\n                return \"YES\"\n            else:\n                return \"NO\"\n\n        But then for [2,1]: \n            total = 2 + (1+1) = 4 <=5 -> YES? \n\n        But the example says NO.\n\n        Alternatively, known solution: \n            total = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                total += a[i] + 1\n            # but then we must have at least one gap between the blocks? \n            # Actually, the circle: we need to leave at least one gap? \n\n        But the example [1,1] in m=5: \n            total = (1+1)+(1+1)=4 <=5 -> YES -> matches.\n\n        Why [2,1] fails? \n\n        Let me try to assign:\n            We have two persons: one requires 5 chairs? -> no, the requirement is: \n                for the person with 2: he requires 2 empty chairs on each side -> so 5 consecutive chairs? \n                for the person with 1: he requires 3 consecutive chairs? \n\n            Total consecutive chairs required: 5+3 = 8? but they can overlap? \n\n        But note: the sitting positions must be distinct and the forbidden zones must not contain the sitting positions of others.\n\n        How to assign the two persons? \n            We must assign two distinct chairs. \n            The person with 2: if he sits at j, then the chairs [j-2, j+2] (mod5) must be free of other persons? \n            The person with 1: if he sits at k, then the chairs [k-1, k+1] (mod5) must be free of other persons? \n\n            And note: j cannot be in the forbidden zone of k? and k cannot be in the forbidden zone of j? \n\n            The forbidden zone of j: [j-2, j+2] mod5 -> entire circle? \n            So k must not be in that entire circle? -> but there is no chair left? \n\n        Therefore, the condition for the largest requirement: \n            We must have: 2*a[0]+1 <= m   -> holds (5<=5) \n            But then the next person: \n                He must be placed in a chair that is not in the forbidden zone of the first? \n                But the first person's forbidden zone is the entire circle? -> so no chair left for the second? \n\n        Therefore, we must also consider that after placing the largest, the remaining available chairs must be at least the requirement of the next? \n\n        How to account for that? \n\n        Insight: \n            We sort in descending order. \n            The first person (largest requirement) will break the circle into one or more segments? \n            But note: the circle becomes a line after we fix the first person? \n\n        Actually, the known solution from a CodeForces problem (e.g., \"Parking\") is:\n\n            sort(a, reverse=True)\n            if a[0] > m - 1:  # meaning 2*a[0]+1 > m? -> no, because 2*a[0]+1>m -> then impossible? \n                return \"NO\"\n            total = a[0]   # we start with the largest block: it takes a[0] (what does this represent?) \n\n            Then for i in range(1, n):\n                # we need to leave a gap of at least 1 between the blocks? \n                total += a[i] + 1\n\n            if total <= m:\n                return \"YES\"\n            else:\n                return \"NO\"\n\n        But then for [2,1]: \n            a[0]=2 -> then total = 2\n            i=1: total += 1+1 = 4 -> 4<=5 -> YES -> but expected NO.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The gap: the +1 in the total might represent the gap between the blocks? \n\n        But in the circle, we don't need a gap at the end? \n\n        Alternatively, we might need to account for the fact that the largest requirement breaks the circle and then we have a linear arrangement? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces Round #709, problem B) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                if a[0] >= m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n                total = a[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    total += a[i] + 1\n                    if total >= m:\n                        break\n                if total <= m-1:   # wait, why m-1?\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        But that doesn't match.\n\n After reading the note: \n        Test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[1,2] -> output \"NO\"\n\n        Known solution from a known AC code for the same problem (from CodeForces submissions for problem \"Chairs and Requirements\"):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n, m;\n                    cin >> n >> m;\n                    vector<int> a(n);\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                    }\n                    sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());\n                    long long total = a[0];\n                    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                        total += a[i] + 1;\n                    }\n                    if (total <= m) {\n                        cout << \"YES\\n\";\n                    } else {\n                        cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        But this gives YES for [2,1] in m=5? \n\n        However, I found an AC solution for a problem with the same sample:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n, m;\n                    cin >> n >> m;\n                    vector<long long> a(n);\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                    }\n                    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<long long>());\n                    long long sum = 0;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        if (i == 0) {\n                            sum += 2 * a[i] + 1;\n                        } else {\n                            sum += 2 * a[i] + 1 - a[i]; // ???

\n\n        Actually, if two persons are sitting at positions x and y, then the distance between x and y (in the circle) must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? \n\n        Why? \n            Because the first person requires a[i] empty chairs to his left and right, so the next person must be outside the segment [x - a[i], x + a[i]]. \n            Similarly, the second person requires a[j] empty chairs, so the first person must be outside [y - a[j], y + a[j]]. \n            The closest they can be is when they are separated by a[i] empty chairs on one side and a[j] empty chairs on the other? \n            So the circular distance between x and y must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? \n\n        But note: the circle: the distance is min(|x-y|, m-|x-y|) -> but we require the entire arc between them to be at least a[i]+a[j]+1? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            The two sitting positions must be at least (a[i] + 1) apart in one direction and (a[j]+1) apart in the other? \n\n        Alternatively, the entire circle must have gaps that can accommodate the minimum distance between any two persons.\n\n        This is similar to the problem of placing n points in a circle of length m such that the arc between any two adjacent points is at least some value? \n\n        But note: we are not requiring adjacent gaps, but for every pair? \n\n        Actually, the minimal distance between any two sitting positions must be at least max(a[i]+a[j]+1) for any pair? -> that is too strong.\n\n        Instead, we can break the circle arbitrarily. We can sort the sitting positions and then the gaps between adjacent sitting positions (in the linearized circle) must be at least the requirement of the persons on both sides? \n\n        Specifically, if we have two adjacent persons (in the linearized circle) with requirements a_i and a_j, then the gap between them must be at least a_i + a_j + 1? \n\n        But note: the circle: the gap between the last and the first must also be at least the sum of their requirements? \n\n        Therefore, we have n gaps (if we break the circle at a point) and we require:\n            gap_i >= a_i + a_{i+1} + 1   for i=0..n-1 (with a_n = a_0)\n\n        And the sum of the gaps is m? \n\n        So we require: \n            sum_{i} (a_i + a_{i+1} + 1) <= m   ?\n\n        But note: the gaps are exactly the empty spaces? and the sitting positions are fixed? \n\n        Actually, the total length of the circle is m, and the sitting positions are n points. The gaps are the empty spaces between them. The sum of the gaps is m - n? \n\n        But wait: the circle has n gaps? and the sum of the gaps is m? because the sitting positions are not taking space? -> no, the sitting positions are distinct chairs, so the gaps are the empty chairs? \n\n        Actually, the circle has m chairs. We are using n chairs for sitting. The remaining m-n chairs are distributed in the gaps. \n\n        The condition for a gap between two adjacent persons (with requirements a_i and a_j) is that the gap must be at least a_i + a_j + 1? \n\n        But note: the gap is the number of empty chairs between them. \n\n        However, the requirement for a_i is that there are at least a_i empty chairs on his left and right? \n            But the gap to the left of person_i is shared with the person to his left, and the gap to the right is shared with the person to his right? \n\n        Specifically, the gap to the left of person_i must be at least a_i? and the gap to the right must be at least a_i? \n\n        But then the gap between person_i and person_{i+1} must be at least a_i (for the right of person_i) and a_{i+1} (for the left of person_{i+1})? \n            -> so the gap must be at least a_i + a_{i+1}? \n\n        However, the problem says \"at least a_i empty chairs on his right and left\", meaning that the gap to the left must be >= a_i and the gap to the right must be >= a_i? \n\n        But if we have a gap of size g between person_i and person_{i+1}, then this gap is used for the right of person_i and the left of person_{i+1}. \n            -> we require g >= a_i + a_{i+1}? \n\n        Why? because the a_i empty chairs on the right of person_i are the first a_i chairs in the gap, and the a_{i+1} empty chairs on the left of person_{i+1} are the last a_{i+1} chairs in the gap. \n\n        Therefore, the gap must be at least a_i + a_{i+1}. \n\n        But note: the circle has n gaps. The sum of the gaps is m - n (because there are n sitting positions). \n\n        Therefore, we require:\n            for all i: gap_i >= a_i + a_{i+1}\n            and sum_i gap_i = m - n\n\n        Then: \n            sum_i (a_i + a_{i+1}) <= m - n\n\n        -> 2 * sum_i a_i + a_0 + a_{n-1} - (a_0+a_{n-1}) ??? \n\n        Actually, if we let the persons be arranged in a circle: \n            gap0: between person0 and person1 -> >= a0+a1\n            gap1: between person1 and person2 -> >= a1+a2\n            ...\n            gap_{n-1}: between person_{n-1} and person0 -> >= a_{n-1}+a0\n\n        Then the sum of the gaps: \n            >= (a0+a1) + (a1+a2) + ... + (a_{n-1}+a0) \n            = 2*(a0+a1+...+a_{n-1])\n\n        And the sum of the gaps = m - n.\n\n        Therefore, we require:\n            2 * (a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}) <= m - n\n\n        -> 2 * S + n <= m, where S = sum(a)\n\n        But let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> \n            2*(1+1) + 2 = 2*2+2 = 6 <= 5? -> 6<=5 -> false -> NO, but expected YES.\n\n        Why? \n\n        In the example: \n            We have two persons. The gaps: \n                gap0: between person0 and person1 -> must be at least a0+a1 = 2.\n                gap1: between person1 and person0 -> must be at least a1+a0 = 2.\n            The sum of gaps = 4, and the sitting positions take 2 chairs, so total chairs = 4+2=6>5 -> impossible? \n\n        But the example assignment: \n            person0 at 0, person1 at 2.\n            Then the circle: \n                from 0 to 2: gap0 = 1 (chair1) -> but we need at least 2? \n                from 2 to 0: gap1 = 3 (chairs 3,4,0? but 0 is taken) -> wait, the circle: \n                    The chairs: 0,1,2,3,4.\n                    The gap between 0 and 2: clockwise: 0->1->2: gap=1 (empty chair1) \n                    The gap between 2 and 0: clockwise: 2->3->4->0: gap=3 (empty chairs3,4) -> but then the gap for the right of person0 (which is the gap from 0 to 2) is only 1, but a0=1 -> requires at least 1 empty chair on the right? -> satisfied? \n                    Similarly, the gap for the left of person0: from 0 to the next person counterclockwise? which is person1 at 2: counterclockwise: 0->4->3->2: gap=3 (empty chairs4,3) -> satisfies the left requirement of 1.\n\n            How do we split the gap between 0 and 2? \n                The requirement for person0: \n                    left: at least 1 empty -> the gap to the left (counterclockwise) is 3 (chairs4,3) -> satisfies.\n                    right: at least 1 empty -> the gap to the right (clockwise) is 1 (chair1) -> satisfies? \n                But note: the gap between 0 and 2 clockwise is only 1, and that is used for the right of person0 and the left of person1? \n                For person1: \n                    left: at least 1 empty -> the gap to the left (counterclockwise) from 2 to 0: which is the gap that includes chair1? -> but wait, the gap between 2 and 0 counterclockwise: 2->1->0: gap=1 (chair1) -> satisfies.\n                    right: at least 1 empty -> the gap to the right (clockwise) from 2 to 0: 2->3->4->0: gap=3 -> satisfies.\n\n            Therefore, the gap between 0 and 2 (which is chair1) is used for the right of person0 and the left of person1. \n            So we count it for both? \n\n            This means that the gap of size 1 is shared. \n\n        Therefore, the condition for a gap between two adjacent persons (in the circle) is that the gap size must be at least a_i (for the right of the first) + a_j ( for the left of the second) ? \n            -> but then the gap of size 1 must be >= 1+1 = 2 -> fails.\n\n        Hence, the known solution with sorting in descending order and then checking:\n\n            total = a[0] \n            for i in range(1, n): \n                total += a[i] + 1\n            if total <= m: \n                \"YES\"\n            else:\n                \"NO\"\n\n        might be the intended solution? and the sample [1,2] in m=5: \n            sorted: [2,1]\n            total = 2 + (1+1) = 4 <=5 -> YES.\n\n        But the sample says NO.\n\n        I see the sample explanation for test case 3: \n            \"if the second person sits down somewhere, he needs 2 empty chairs, both on his right and on his left side, so it is impossible to find a place for the first person, because there are only 5 chairs.\"\n\n        This implies that the second person (with requirement 2) requires 5 chairs, and then there is no room for the first person? \n\n        Therefore, the condition for the largest requirement must be: \n            2*a[0]+1 <= m   -> holds for m=5, a[0]=2 -> 5<=5.\n\n        But then the first person (with requirement 1) requires 3 chairs? and we have no contiguous block of 3 chairs left? \n\n        How many contiguous chairs are left after placing the person with 2? \n            If we place the person with 2 at chair0, then the forbidden zone is [0-2..0+2] = [3,4,0,1,2] -> the entire circle. \n            So there is no chair left for the first person? \n\n        Therefore, the condition is not only the sum, but also the largest requirement must leave room for the others? \n\n        Specifically, after placing the largest requirement, the circle is gone? \n\n        So the condition should be: \n            - The largest requirement must be such that 2*a[0]+1 <= m   (otherwise, even one person cannot sit)\n            - Then, the remaining persons can be placed in the remaining chairs? \n\n        But the remaining chairs are m - (2*a[0]+1) ? -> but the largest requirement might not take contiguous chairs exclusively? because the next person might be placed in a way that shares the empty space? \n\n        However, the largest requirement takes a contiguous block of 2*a[0]+1 chairs? -> then the circle is broken into two segments? \n\n        Then the next largest requirement must be placed in one of the segments, and that segment must have size at least 2*a[1]+1? \n\n        This is a greedy allocation in a circle broken into segments. \n\n        We can simulate:\n\n            segments = [m - (2*a[0]+1)]   # but wait, if we place the largest requirement, we remove a contiguous block of 2*a[0]+1, then the circle becomes a segment of length m - (2*a[0]+1)? \n            -> but actually, when you remove a contiguous block from a circle, you get one segment? \n\n            Example: m=5, remove a block of 5 -> then we get 0.\n\n            But if we remove a block of size L from a circle, we get one segment of length m - L.\n\n        Then for the next person (a[1]=1), we need a contiguous block of 3. But the segment has size 0? -> fail.\n\n        Therefore, we require: \n            after placing the largest, the segment size = m - (2*a[0]+1) must be >= the requirement of the next largest? \n\n        But the next largest might be placed in the segment, and then we break the segment into two? \n\n        This is the \"greedy in a circle\" with segments.\n\n        Algorithm for multiple persons:\n\n            sort(a) in descending order.\n            segments = a deque of segments, initially one segment: [0, m-1] of length m.\n            for each requirement a_i in sorted order:\n                if there is no segment of length >= (2*a_i+1), then fail.\n                else, choose the largest segment (or any segment that is big enough) and place the person in the middle? \n                    then the segment is split into two segments: \n                         left_segment = (start, mid - a_i - 1)   [length = (mid - a_i - 1) - start + 1? ]\n                         right_segment = (mid + a_i + 1, end)   [length = end - (mid + a_i + 1) + 1]\n\n                But note: the circle? we broke the circle with the first person, then it becomes linear.\n\n            However, the first person: \n                we have a circle of length m. We need to choose a contiguous block of 2*a0+1. \n                then the circle becomes a linear segment of length m - (2*a0+1).\n\n            Then for the next person, we have one segment. We then break it into two segments? \n\n            Example: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1]:\n                first person (a0=2): requires 5 chairs -> then the segment becomes 0. \n                then second person: requires 3 chairs -> fail.\n\n            -> NO.\n\n            Example: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1]:\n                first person (a0=1): requires 3 chairs. \n                    then the circle becomes a segment of length 5-3=2.\n                second person: requires 3 chairs -> fail? \n\n            But wait, we can place the first person anywhere. Maybe we can choose the placement to minimize the damage? \n\n            In the circle, after placing the first person (say at chair0), the circle is broken into one segment: from chair3 to chair4 (length=2) and from chair1 to chair2 (length=2)? \n                Actually, when we remove a contiguous block of 3 (say [0,1,2]), then the circle has two segments: [3,4] and then the next would be [5..?] -> but m=5, so chairs are 0..4.\n\n            Removing [0,1,2] leaves two segments: \n                one from 3 to 4 -> length=2\n                and the other from 4 to 0? -> no, contiguous removal in a circle leaves one contiguous free segment? \n\n            Actually, in a circle, removing a contiguous block leaves one contiguous free segment? -> only if the removed block is not the entire circle. \n\n            In this case, the free segment is from 3 to 4 -> length=2.\n\n            Then the second person requires a contiguous block of 3 -> fail.\n\n            But the example assignment: \n                person0 at 0: takes [0,1,2] -> then free: [3,4] -> length=2, cannot place person1 who requires 3.\n                person0 at 2: takes [0,1,2] (if we take [1,2,3] for example) -> then free: [4] and [0] -> two segments of length 1.\n\n            How about if we place the first person not covering the entire circle? \n\n            The requirement for the first person (a0=1) is: a contiguous block of 3. We can choose any contiguous block of 3. \n            For example, can we choose [4,0,1]? \n                Then the free chairs are [2,3] -> length=2.\n\n            Still not enough.\n\n            But the example says they can sit at 0 and 2. \n                person0 at 0: then the block is [4,0,1] -> free chairs: 2 and 3.\n                person1 at 2: then the block is [1,2,3] -> but chair1 is in the first block? \n\n            However, the block for person1 at 2: [1,2,3] overlaps with the first block [4,0,1] at chair1. \n\n            The condition: the block [4,0,1] for person0 means that no one else can sit in 4,0,1. \n                -> then person1 cannot sit in 2 because the block [1,2,3] includes chair1 (which is forbidden) and chair2 is where person1 sits, which is allowed? \n\n            But the condition for person0: it forbids others from sitting in [4,0,1] -> and person1 is sitting in 2, which is not in [4,0,1] -> allowed.\n            The condition for person1: it requires that [1,2,3] are free of others? \n                -> chair1 is in [1,2,3] and is forbidden by person0? -> but person0 is not sitting in chair1, it is only forbidden. \n                -> the condition: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\" -> so only sitting is not allowed. \n                -> person0 is not sitting in chair1, so it is free? -> then it is allowed for the condition of person1 to have chair1 free? \n\n            However, the condition for person0: it requires that chair1 is free of others (meaning no one sits there) -> and indeed no one sits in chair1. \n            Similarly, the condition for person1: it requires that chair1 is free -> and it is free. \n\n            Therefore, the blocks can overlap as long as the sitting positions are not in the other's block? \n\n            This means that the only constraint is that the sitting positions are distinct and not in the forbidden zones of others. \n\n            Therefore, the contiguous block for a person is only for the empty chairs, and it is not that the block is removed from the circle, but rather that the block must be free of other sitting positions. \n\n            So the circle might have overlapping forbidden zones, and that is allowed. \n\n            Then the condition is: \n                - The sitting positions must be pairwise at least (a_i + a_j + 1) apart? \n\n            Specifically, for any two persons i and j, the circular distance between their sitting positions must be > a_i + a_j? \n\n            Why? \n                If the distance between i and j is <= a_i + a_j, then one of them will be in the forbidden zone of the other? \n\n            Example: \n                person0 at x, person1 at y.\n                The distance d = min(|x-y|, m-|x-y|).\n                If d <= a_i, then the other person is in the forbidden zone of person0? \n                    because the forbidden zone of person0 is [x - a0, x + a0] mod m.\n                Similarly, if d <= a_j, then the other person is in the forbidden zone of person1.\n\n                But note: if a0=1 and a1=1, and d=1, then:\n                    person0: requires that the chairs at distance 1 are free of others -> but there is a person at distance 1 -> violation.\n\n                Therefore, we require d > a0 and d > a1? \n                    -> then d > max(a0, a1) \n\n                But that is not sufficient: \n                    if a0=2 and a1=1, and d=2, then:\n                         for person0: the forbidden zone up to distance 2 -> includes the chair at distance 2 -> so the other person at distance 2 is in the forbidden zone? -> violation.\n\n                Therefore, we require d > a0 + a1? \n\n                Because the forbidden zone of person0 extends a0 in both directions, so to avoid including the sitting position of person1, we require that the sitting position of person1 is at least a0+1 away in one direction? \n\n                Specifically, the closest they can be is a0+1 in one direction and a1+1 in the other? \n\n                But in the circle, the distance is the shortest arc. \n\n                Therefore, we require: \n                    d >= a0 + a1 + 1   (because if they are exactly a0+a1+1 apart, then the forbidden zones do not overlap at the sitting positions)\n\n            Example: a0=1, a1=1: then d>=3? \n                in a circle of 5: \n                    if we put them at 0 and 2: d = min(2,3)=2 <3 -> fail.\n\n            But the example says it is possible.\n\n            Let me check: \n                person0 at 0: requires that the chairs at distance 1: 4 and 1 are free -> they are free.\n                person1 at 2: requires that the chairs at distance 1: 1 and 3 are free -> they are free.\n                The sitting positions: 0 and 2 -> distance=2.\n                Is person1 in the forbidden zone of person0? \n                    The forbidden zone of person0: [4,0,1] -> does not include 2.\n                Is person0 in the forbidden zone of person1? \n                    The forbidden zone of person1: [1,2,3] -> does not include 0? \n                        -> 0 is not in [1,2,3] -> wait, in the circle, the chair0 might be considered as not in the segment [1,2,3] if we don't wrap? \n\n                But the circle: the segment [1,2,3] is from 1 to 3, which does not include 0.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is not the circular distance between the sitting positions, but the condition is that the sitting position of one is not in the forbidden segment of the other.\n\n            The forbidden segment of person0: [0 - a0, 0 + a0] mod m = [4,0,1] (for a0=1) -> which is three consecutive chairs: 4,0,1.\n            The sitting position of person1 is 2, which is not in [4,0,1] -> allowed.\n            The forbidden segment of person1: [2-1,2+1] = [1,2,3] -> sitting position of person0 is 0, which is not in [1,2,3] -> allowed.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: \n                for any two persons i and j, the sitting position of i is not in the forbidden segment of j, and vice versa.\n\n            This is equivalent to: \n                the sitting position of i is not in [x_j - a_j, x_j + a_j] mod m, \n                and the sitting position of j is not in [x_i - a_i, x_i + a_i] mod m.\n\n            This condition is automatically satisfied if i and j are the same person, but for distinct i and j, we require:\n                x_i not in [x_j - a_j, x_j + a_j] mod m, \n                x_j not in [x_i - a_i, x_i + a_i] mod m.\n\n            How to check this for n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^9?

We can do:\n\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                ... code for one test case ...\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                n, m = I()\n                a = I()\n                if n > m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    a.sort(reverse=True)\n                    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                        total += a[i] + 1\n                        if total > m:\n                            break\n                    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are sorting each test case. The worst-case one test case has n=10^5, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's move to program2.py.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n            We have an array a of n integers.\n            We can do:\n                Operation1: clone any array (cost 1 operation)\n                Operation2: swap two elements from any two copies (or same) on any positions (cost 1 operation)\n\n            We want to find the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n        Example: \n            Test1: [0,0,0] -> already all equal -> 0.\n            Test2: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example says 6 operations.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        Insight:\n            We want to have a copy of the array where all elements are equal to some value x.\n\n            How to achieve that?\n                We can use the following:\n                    We start with one copy.\n                    We can clone it arbitrarily.\n                    We can swap elements between copies.\n\n            The operations allow us to gather all occurrences of a particular value x in one copy? \n\n            Specifically, if we want to create a copy with all elements x, then we need to have n occurrences of x in that copy.\n\n            But initially, we have only the occurrences that are in the array.\n\n            How many operations to gather them?\n\n            We can do:\n                Let f(x) be the frequency of x in the original array.\n                We start with one copy that has f(x) occurrences of x.\n\n                To have a copy with n occurrences of x, we need to get an additional n - f(x) occurrences of x from somewhere.\n\n            Where can we get them? \n                From other copies, by swapping.\n\n            How many swaps? \n                We can swap an occurrence of x from one copy with an occurrence of a non-x from the copy we are building.\n\n            Specifically, we can use the following strategy:\n\n                We will create several clones. In the end, we want one copy (say copy0) to have all x's.\n\n                Initially, copy0 has f(x) x's.\n\n                We need n - f(x) more x's.\n\n                We can get these x's from other copies, but we have to put something in return.\n\n                We can use other copies as a reservoir.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Operation1: clone the original array. Now we have two copies.\n\n                  Then, we can swap:\n                      swap a non-x in copy0 with an x in copy1.\n\n                  This costs 1 operation (swap) and it increases the number of x's in copy0 by 1.\n\n                  We need n - f(x) swaps.\n\n                  But also, we might need to create more clones if there are not enough x's in the other copies.\n\n            However, note: we can clone multiple times. \n\n            How many x's are available in total? \n                Only f(x) initially. And we cannot create new x's, only move them.\n\n            Therefore, the entire system has exactly f(x) x's. \n\n            To have one copy with n x's, we would need f(x) >= n, which is only possible if f(x)=n (and then we are done).\n\n            But that is not the case in the example.\n\n            The example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> f(0)=2, but we want a copy with 6 zeros -> we need 6 zeros, but there are only 2.\n\n            How did the example do it in 6 operations?\n\n            The example:\n\n                Step1: create a copy -> operation1, now two copies: \n                    copy0: [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                    copy1: [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n\n                Then they did some swaps to get:\n                    copy0: [0,0,0,3,7,0]   -> has 4 zeros, but not all.\n                    copy1: [1,1,3,3,7,3]   -> has no zero in the first two, but then a zero at the end? \n\n                Then they created a copy of the first array (which is [0,0,0,3,7,0]) -> operation2: clone, now three copies.\n\n                Then they swapped in the first two copies to get:\n                    copy0: [0,0,0,0,0,0]   -> all zeros.\n                    copy1: [3,7,0,3,7,0]   -> and copy2: [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n\n                How many operations: \n                    clone1: 1\n                    swaps: they did 4 swaps in the first step? and then 2 swaps in the second step? -> total 6.\n\n            How to count minimally?\n\n            Insight from known solution:\n\n                Let m = max frequency of any element.\n\n                Then the answer is: n - m + (number of operations for cloning and swapping)\n\n            But note: \n                We start with one copy.\n                We can create a new copy with one operation. \n                In the new copy, we can then swap elements.\n\n            We want to gather at least n of the same element in one copy. \n\n            We cannot create new elements, so we can only gather the existing ones.\n\n            Therefore, the maximal number of copies of a single element we can have in one array is limited by the total number of that element in the entire system.\n\n            Initially, we have frequency m for the mode.\n\n            After k cloning operations, we have k+1 copies, and the entire system has (k+1) * n elements, and the number of occurrences of the mode is (k+1)*m.\n\n            We want to have one copy with n occurrences of the mode. \n\n            How many occurrences of the mode do we need in that copy? n.\n\n            How many are available in the entire system? (k+1)*m.\n\n            We can move occurrences from other copies to the target copy by swapping. \n                Each swap can bring one occurrence of the mode from another copy to the target copy, but it also moves a non-mode element out of the target copy.\n\n            Initially, the target copy has m0 = m occurrences of the mode.\n\n            We need n - m0 more.\n\n            For each additional occurrence we bring, we need to do one swap.\n\n            But to do a swap between the target copy and another copy, we need to have that other copy available.\n\n            We have k other copies.\n\n            How many occurrences of the mode are in the other copies? \n                Initially, the other copies have a total of k * m occurrences of the mode.\n\n            We can use at most k * m occurrences from the other copies.\n\n            Therefore, we require:\n                m0 + (number of swaps) <= n   -> we are building the target copy to have n modes.\n                and the number of swaps we can do is at most the total available in other copies: k * m.\n\n            But note: we are not limited by the available modes in other copies because we can do multiple swaps from the same copy? \n\n            However, we can only do one swap per operation, and we can use any copy arbitrarily.\n\n            The constraint is that we can only do one swap per operation, and we have to have the modes available in the other copies.\n\n            We need to do at least (n - m0) swaps.\n\n            But also, to have the other copies available, we need to do k cloning operations.\n\n            Therefore, the total operations is: \n                k (for cloning) + (n - m0) (for swaps) = k + (n - m)\n\n            But we also require that the entire system has enough modes: \n                (k+1) * m >= n   [because we need n modes in the target copy, and the entire system has (k+1)*m modes]\n\n            We want to minimize total operations = k + (n - m)\n\n            subject to: (k+1)*m >= n.\n\n            Solve for k: \n                k >= ceil((n - m) / m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\n            Actually: \n                (k+1) >= ceil(n/m)   -> k >= ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n            Then total operations = k + (n - m) >= (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)\n\n            But note: k must be an integer >= ceil(n/m)-1.\n\n            We can choose k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n            Then total operations = (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2 (for the array [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m = frequency of 0 is 2, or frequency of 3 is 2? -> actually the mode is 2 (for 0 and 3).\n\n            But the example used 0, so m=2.\n\n            Then: \n                k = ceil(6/2) - 1 = ceil(3) - 1 = 3-1=2.\n                total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 2+4=6.\n\n            Example: n=3, m=3 (all equal) -> \n                k = ceil(3/3)-1 = 1-1=0.\n                total operations = 0 + (3-3)=0.\n\n            Example: n=3, m=2 (e.g., [1,1,2]) -> \n                k = ceil(3/2)-1 = ceil(1.5)-1 = 2-1=1.\n                total operations = 1 + (3-2)=2.\n\n            How to achieve for [1,1,2] in 2 operations?\n                Option1: \n                    Operation1: clone -> now two copies: [1,1,2] and [1,1,2]\n                    Operation2: swap the 2 in copy0 with the 1 in copy1 at a particular position? \n                        We want copy0 to be [1,1,1]. \n                        Swap the last element of copy0 (2) with the last element of copy1 (2) -> then both are still [1,1,2] -> not helpful.\n                    Swap the last element of copy0 (2) with the first element of copy1 (1) -> then copy0 becomes [1,1,1] and copy1 becomes [2,1,2] -> done.\n\n            Therefore, 2 operations.\n\n            But the formula: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for a test case is: \n                Let m = max frequency of any element.\n                If m == n: \n                    answer = 0\n                Else:\n                    k = ceil(n/m) - 1   [but note: ceil(n/m) is the smallest integer >= n/m]\n                    total_ops = k + (n - m)\n\n            However, note: ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1   in integer arithmetic.\n\n            We can compute: \n                k = (n-1)//m   # because (n-1)//m = floor((n-1)/m), then ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, so k = (n-1)//m.\n\n            Then total_ops = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2: (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2, then 2 + (6-2)=6.\n\n            Example: n=3, m=2: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1, then 1+ (3-2)=2.\n\n            But wait: what if n=4, m=3: \n                k = (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1, then total_ops=1+(4-3)=2.\n                Check: \n                    We need one clone (k=1) -> operations=1.\n                    Then we need 4-3=1 swap -> total=2.\n                And the condition: (1+1)*3=6>=4 -> holds.\n\n            However, what if n=4, m=2: \n                k = (4-1)//2 = 3//2=1, then total_ops=1+(4-2)=3.\n                Check: \n                    We have mode=2. \n                    We need 4 in one copy -> we need 2 more.\n                    We do one clone: now two copies, total modes=4.\n                    We do two swaps: \n                        swap a non-mode from copy0 with a mode from copy1: then copy0 gets one more mode -> becomes 3.\n                        swap again: copy0 gets one more mode -> becomes 4.\n                    Total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n            But note: the problem says the array can have negative numbers? \n                The frequency count is the same.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py:\n\n                We are given: \n                    for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:   # the test cases: the first line is t, then for each test case: one line for n, then one line for the array.\n                    n=len(a:=a.split())   # but note: the array is in the string a, and we split. But the length of the split list is n? \n                    m = max frequency in the array.\n\n                Then we have:\n                    if m==n: \n                        r=0\n                    else:\n                        k = (n-1)//m   # integer floor division of (n-1) by m\n                        r = k + (n - m)\n\n                But wait: the example in the code: \n                    n=len(a)   # but a is the string of the array, then we split -> the number of elements is n.\n\n                However, the array might have duplicate elements, and we are counting frequency.\n\n                The code already has:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split())   # this sets a to the list of string tokens, and n to the length of that list.\n                    m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n                Then the while loop: \n                    while m<n:\n                        ...   # we are to complete the while loop body to compute r.\n\n                But we can break out of the while loop immediately? \n\n                Alternatively, we can compute r without a while loop.\n\n                The known solution: \n                    r = 0\n                    while m < n:\n                        # we do one more clone operation if needed? \n                        # but the formula is: r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)   [but note: m might change? no, we are using the initial m]\n\n                However, the formula does not change with m? \n\n                But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we are not changing m or n in the loop.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    if m==n:\n                        r=0\n                    else:\n                        r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n                But then why the while loop? \n\n                The existing code:\n\n                    r=0\n                    while m<n:\n                        # TODO\n\n                We must fill the TODO so that it breaks and sets r appropriately.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n                    break   # break the while loop immediately.\n\n                But the while loop is while m<n, and if m==n, we skip the loop and r=0.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    if m==n:\n                        r=0\n                    else:\n                        r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n                But the code is inside a while loop that runs only if m<n. \n\n                We can do:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n                    break   # because we only need one iteration.\n\n                But the problem: the while loop condition is m<n, and we are not changing m or n, so if we don't break, it would be an infinite loop.\n\n                Alternatively, we can change the while loop to an if? \n\n                But the code structure is:\n\n                    r=0\n                    while m<n:\n                        # we do something to update r and then break? \n\n                We can simply set r and break.\n\n                Code:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n                    break\n\n                But note: the problem says the minimal number of operations.\n\n                Therefore, for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n                    break\n\n            However, let me test with the examples:\n\n                Example: n=6, m=2: \n                    (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2, then 2 + (6-2)=6.\n\n                Example: n=3, m=3: skip the while loop -> r=0.\n\n                Example: n=3, m=2: \n                    (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1, then 1+ (3-2)=2.\n\n            But note: the formula uses integer floor division, which is what we want.\n\n            However, in Python, (n-1)//m is floor division.\n\n            Example: n=4, m=3: \n                (4-1)//3 = 3//3 = 1, then 1+ (4-3)=2.\n\n            Therefore, it is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the mode is not unique? \n            The formula uses the maximum frequency m. We don't care which element, we choose the one with the highest frequency.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n            break\n\n        However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are only doing one iteration per test case.\n\n        But note: the while loop is designed to run only once? because we break.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the while to if, but the code structure is while, so we break.\n\n        So the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n                    break\n                print(r)\n\n        But what if there are multiple modes? \n            m is the maximum frequency, so it is the best candidate.\n\n        However, note: the array might have negative numbers, but we are using Counter on the string tokens. That is okay.\n\n        But wait: the array elements are integers, but we are reading them as strings. \n            For example, the array might be: ['-1', '0', '1'] -> then the frequency of each is 1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the array might have duplicates even as strings: e.g., '1' and '1' are the same.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, the problem says: the array elements are integers in [-10^9, 10^9]. \n            But we are splitting the string and counting the tokens. This is okay.\n\n        But note: the array might have spaces? the input is space separated.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Let's write the completions.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        program1.py completion:\n\n            n, m = I()\n            a = I()\n            if n > m:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                    total += a[i] + 1\n                    if total > m:\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        But note: the existing code has a while t: loop, and we are to put the code for one test case.\n\n        The entire program1.py after completion:\n\n            I=lambda:[*map(int,input().split())]\n            t,=I()\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                n, m = I()\n                a = I()\n                if n > m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    a.sort(reverse=True)\n                    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                        total += a[i] + 1\n                        if total > m:\n                            break\n                    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        program2.py completion:\n\n            We are to fill the while loop:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n                    break\n\n        But note: the break is necessary to avoid infinite loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if m < n:\n                r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n\n        But the code uses a while loop, so we break.\n\n        However, the problem says: output only the missing code, and the missing code is the block for the while loop.\n\n        The existing code in program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to output the two completions in a json.\n\n        Format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        But note: the completions are code blocks. We must be careful with quotes and newlines.\n\n        For program1, the completion is a block of code (multiple lines) for the while t: loop body.\n\n        For program2, the completion is the block inside the while loop.\n\n        We write:\n\n            program1: \n                n, m = I()\n                a = I()\n                if n > m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    a.sort(reverse=True)\n                    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                        total += a[i] + 1\n                        if total > m:\n                            break\n                    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n            program2:\n                r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n                break\n\n        But note: in program2, the break is necessary to break out of the while loop.\n\n        However, the while loop runs only once because we break.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    n, m = I()\\n    a = I()\\n    if n > m:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    else:\\n        a.sort(reverse=True)\\n        total = 2 * a[0] + 1\\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\\n            total += a[i] + 1\\n            if total > m:\\n                break\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\" if total > m else \\\"YES\\\")\",\n                \"program2\": \"        r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the indentation in program1: the existing while t: is at the same level as the previous, so the body should be indented. We use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        In the given program1, the while t: is at the top level, and the body should be indented. We are providing the body.\n\n        Similarly, in program2, the while m<n: is already there, and we are providing the body, which should be indented.\n\n        We use the same indentation as the comments: \n            In program1: the comment says \"# TODO: Your code here\" -> we replace that with the block, indented one level more.\n\n        We assume the existing code uses 4-space indentation.\n\n        For program1, the existing code:\n\n            t,=I()\n            while t:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the block, and we must indent the block one level (so 4 spaces for the block, and then the statements inside the block are 4 more).\n\n        But the TODO is at the end of the while line. We need to break the line.\n\n        Actually, the completion for program1 is the entire body of the while loop, which should be:\n\n            while t:\n                [the code we provided]\n\n        But the existing code has \"while t:# TODO\", so we can do:\n\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                ... our code ...\n\n        But the existing code does not have the \"t -= 1\". We must include it.\n\n        Actually, the existing code for program1 is:\n\n            I=lambda:[*map(int,input().split())]\n            t,=I()\n            while t:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO line with the body.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                n, m = I()\n                a = I()\n                if n > m:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    a.sort(reverse=True)\n                    total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                    for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                        total += a[i] + 1\n                        if total > m:\n                            break\n                    print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        But the problem says: Output only the missing lines or blocks.\n\n        The missing block is the entire body of the while loop, including the \"t-=1\".\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1 is:\n\n            t -= 1\n            n, m = I()\n            a = I()\n            if n > m:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                total = 2 * a[0] + 1\n                for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                    total += a[i] + 1\n                    if total > m:\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if total > m else \"YES\")\n\n        And we must indent it by 4 spaces? \n\n        But the existing while t: is at the same level as the previous, and the body should be indented.\n\n        In the output, we will provide the string for the block, which is:\n\n            \"    t -= 1\\n    n, m = I()\\n    a = I()\\n    if n > m:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    else:\\n        a.sort(reverse=True)\\n        total = 2 * a[0] + 1\\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\\n            total += a[i] + 1\\n            if total > m:\\n                break\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\" if total > m else \\\"YES\\\")\"\n\n        For program2, the existing code:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n            break\n\n        And we indent by 8 spaces (because the while is already indented 4, and the body should be 4 more) -> but the existing code in the for loop is:\n\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n        The body of the while should be indented 4 more spaces relative to the while.\n\n        So we provide:\n\n            \"        r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\\n        break\"\n\n        But note: the next line after the while body is \"print(r)\", which is at the same level as the while, so we break out and then print.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    t -= 1\\n    n, m = I()\\n    a = I()\\n    if n > m:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    else:\\n        a.sort(reverse=True)\\n        total = 2 * a[0] + 1\\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\\n            total += a[i] + 1\\n            if total > m:\\n                break\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\" if total > m else \\\"YES\\\")\",\n                \"program2\": \"        r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n        Let me check the program1: \n            The first line: \"    t -= 1\" -> this is one level of indentation (4 spaces) for the while body.\n            Then the rest.\n\n        And program2: \n            The while body: two levels of indentation (8 spaces) for the body of the while that is inside the for loop.\n\n        But the existing program2 has:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            and we are replacing the comment with two lines, each indented 8 spaces.\n\n        However, the existing line \"while m<n: ...\" is already at 4 spaces. The body should be 8 spaces.\n\n        We provide two lines: \n            \"        r = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\"\n            \"        break\"\n\n        This is 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n        But note: the existing code might have the comment at the same line, so we are replacing the entire line? \n\n        The problem says: missing lines or blocks. We are providing the block for the while body.\n\n        We output the two completions as described."
