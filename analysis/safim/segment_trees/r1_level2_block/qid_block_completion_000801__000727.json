Actually, the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - p2) because Bob starts at the last candy (index n-1) and moves left until p2 (so he has eaten from index p2+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1 - p2 candies).

The condition to enter the loop is p1-1<=p2. In the update for Alice: we do p1 +=1, then the new p1 might be n? But then in the next iteration, we have p1 (which is n) and p2 (which is at least the current value). The condition: p1-1 = n-1 <= p2 -> true only if p2>=n-1.\n      But p2 is initially n-1, and then we decrement it. So if p2 is still n-1, then we enter.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\nThe current code uses two pointers (p1 from left, p2 from right) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob).\nThe idea is to have:\n  s1 = sum of candies Alice has eaten (from the left)\n  s2 = sum of candies Bob has eaten (from the right)\n\nWe want to record the total number of candies eaten (p1 from left and (n-1-p2) from right) when s1 == s2.\n\nThe current code has:\n  while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition seems off. We want to run while p1 <= p2? But note: we are updating p1 and p2 inside.\n  Actually, let's adjust: the condition should allow p1 to go from 0 to n and p2 from n-1 to -1, but we break when p1>p2? \n  However, note the condition: p1-1<=p2. Initially, p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1<=n-1 -> true.\n\nBut the problem says: the total candies eaten is p1 (from left) and (n-1-p2) from right? Actually, the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - p2) because Bob starts at the last candy (index n-1) and moves left until p2 (so he has eaten from index p2+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1 - p2 candies).\n\nThe current code does:\n  if s1 == s2: \n      l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # total candies = p1 (from left) + (n-1-p2) (from right)\n      s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nThen it has two conditions:\n  if s1 < s2: ... (we need to complete this)\n  if s2 < s1: s2 += l[p2]; p2 -= 1\n\nBut note: after the first condition (s1==s2) we update s1 and p1. Then we check the next two conditions? However, if we updated and then s1 becomes greater than s2? We should use elif? Also, the condition for the while loop: p1-1<=p2.\n\nBut the condition in the while loop: we are going to run as long as p1-1 <= p2. Why p1-1? Because we just incremented p1? Actually, after we do p1+=1, then the next time we check we have the new p1. \n\nAlternatively, we can think: we want to consider the candies that are not eaten. The uneaten candies are from p1 to p2 (inclusive). So we should run while p1 <= p2? \n\nBut the problem says: the total candies eaten is p1 (from left) and (n-1-p2) from right. And the condition for the next step is that we can still add from left or right.\n\nHowever, the current condition is (p1-1<=p2). Let me see: \n  Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1<=n-1 -> true.\n  After we take one from left: p1 becomes 1 -> condition: 0<=p2 (which is n-1) -> true until p2>=0.\n\nBut when p1 becomes 2 and p2 becomes 0, then condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\nBut we might have a case where we can still add from the right? \n\nActually, the condition should be while p1 <= p2? Because we have at least one candy in the middle? \n\nBut note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So when p1==p2, that candy is not eaten by either? Then we can only add from one side? Actually, we can only add from one side? But the problem: Alice eats from left, Bob from right. They cannot eat the same candy. So when p1==p2, that candy is in the middle and not eaten. So we can only add from left or right? \n\nBut the current condition (p1-1<=p2) is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. That is too permissive? Because when p1 = p2+2, we break. \n\nWe need to fix the condition? But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we must be O(n). \n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition to p1 <= p2? But then we break when p1>p2. \n\nBut note: the current code has an if block for s1==s2 that increases p1. Then we check s1<s2 and then s2<s1. \n\nHowever, after the first if, we have two independent ifs? That might cause both to run? We should use elif.\n\nBut the problem: we are to complete the missing part. The missing part is the line for \"if s1 < s2\". \n\nWhat should we do when s1 < s2? Then we need to add more to Alice? But Alice is on the left. So we should take the next candy from the left? \n\nBut wait: we just updated Alice in the s1==s2 block? Actually, the structure is:\n\n  while condition:\n      if s1 == s2: \n          record the total candies (p1 + n-1-p2) and then add l[p1] to s1 and move p1 to the right.\n      if s1 < s2: ...   # but after the first if, we might have s1==s2 and then we update and then s1 becomes greater? \n      if s2 < s1: ...   # then we update Bob.\n\nBut note: after the first if, we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check if s1 < s2? It might be that after adding one candy to Alice, s1 becomes less than s2? Then we would add another candy to Alice? \n\nBut that would be two candies in one iteration? \n\nAlternatively, we should do one update per iteration? \n\nActually, the intended logic is to have one update per iteration: either we update Alice (if s1<=s2) or Bob (if s2<=s1). But note the condition: when s1==s2, we update Alice? Then we break the tie by giving the next candy to Alice? \n\nBut then we have to check again: after updating Alice, we might have s1>s2? Then we update Bob? \n\nBut that would be two updates in one iteration? \n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  while p1 <= p2:\n      if s1 <= s2:\n          s1 += l[p1]\n          p1 += 1\n      else:\n          s2 += l[p2]\n          p2 -= 1\n      if s1 == s2:\n          best = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\nBut note: the problem says we can record multiple times when s1==s2 and then take the last one? Actually, the current code appends to l2 every time s1==s2 and then prints the last element. \n\nBut the problem: we want the maximum total candies? And we are moving from the outside in? So the last time we have s1==s2 might be the one with the most candies? \n\nBut actually, we are increasing the total candies as we go? Because we are adding one candy at a time. And we record every time we have equality. Then the last recorded is the one with the most candies? \n\nBut note: the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, every time we add a candy, the total candies eaten increases by one. But we record only when the sums are equal. So the last time we have equality is the one with the most candies? \n\nBut consider: we start with 0,0 -> record 0 (but we don't record because we haven't started). Then we add to Alice: now we have one candy. Then we add to Bob: now we have two candies. Then if they become equal, we record. Then we add again? \n\nBut the problem: we are moving from the outside in. The total candies eaten is increasing until we run out of candies. So the last time we have equality is the one with the most candies? \n\nBut what if we have a later equality with more candies? Yes, because we are adding one at a time. \n\nHowever, the current code does:\n\n  if s1 == s2: \n      l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # at this moment, the current p1 and p2 are the next ones to be taken? Actually, we are about to update? \n\nWait: the code does:\n  if s1 == s2: \n      l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # at this point, we have not taken the next candy? \n      then we take the next candy from the left: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\nSo the recorded total candies is the current total: p1 (which is the number of candies Alice has taken so far) and (n-1-p2) (the number of candies Bob has taken so far). But note: we are about to add one more for Alice? \n\nActually, the recorded value is the total candies eaten so far (without the next one). Then we add one for Alice. \n\nBut then the next time we have equality, we record again? \n\nBut the total candies eaten at the time of recording is the current total. \n\nSo we are recording the total at the moment of equality. \n\nBut we are going to add more candies? \n\nSo we want the maximum total? Then we should record every time we have equality? And then take the maximum? \n\nBut the problem: the example: \n  First test case: n=2, [1,1] -> Alice takes left, Bob takes right -> total 2. \n  How does the code run?\n      t=1, n=2, l=[1,1]\n      p1=0, p2=1, s1=0, s2=0 -> condition: p1-1 = -1 <= 1 -> true.\n          s1==s2 -> record: p1 + n-1-p2 = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? -> that's 0? \n          then s1 becomes 1, p1=1.\n          then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> then we do: s2 += l[1] -> s2=1, p2=0.\n      Then condition: p1-1 = 0 <=0 -> true.\n          s1==s2? 1==1 -> true -> record: p1=1, n-1-p2 = 2-1-0 = 1 -> total=1+1=2? \n          then s1 += l[1] -> but p1 is 1, so l[1] is the second candy? But wait, the list is [1,1] and index 1 is the second candy? \n          Then s1=2, p1=2 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=0? false -> break.\n      Then we print l2[-1] which is 2.\n\nBut the second test case: n=3, [1,2,1] -> but wait, the example says n=6? Actually, the example says: \n  \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nBut wait, the example input? The problem says: \n  \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\nBut the example: \n  \"For the second test case, ...\" -> n=6? and weights? The example says: Alice eats the first three from the left (total 7) and Bob eats the first three from the right (total 7). So the candies: \n      Left: [a, b, c] -> sum=7\n      Right: [d, e, f] -> sum=7\n      And the entire set: [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> and they eat all? \n\nBut the example says: the answer is 6.\n\nSo the code must work for that.\n\nBut the current code for the second test case: \n  n=6, l = [a,b,c,d,e,f] (with a+b+c=7, d+e+f=7? but note: the example says: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] for the fourth test case, so the second test case must be different? Actually, the example says: \n      \"For the second test case, ...\" -> but the problem says: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n  So the array must be: [a,b,c,d,e,f] and they eat [a,b,c] and [d,e,f]? But then the array is split? \n\n  How does the code run? \n      We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? \n      Then we add a to s1 -> s1=a, p1=1.\n      Then we check: if s1 < s2? no. if s2 < s1? yes -> then we add f to s2 -> s2=f, p2=4.\n      Then we have: condition: p1-1=0<=4 -> true.\n          s1==s2? a==f? not necessarily. \n      Then we continue? \n\n  Actually, we need to keep adding until the sums are equal? \n\n  But the example: they eat three from left and three from right. So we would record when we have taken three from left and three from right? \n\n  How? \n      Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? \n      Then we add a: s1=a -> then we add f: s2=f -> then we check: if a==f? if not, then we add b? if a<f, then we add b? \n      Then we have s1=a+b, then if a+b < f, we add e? \n      Then we have s2 = f+e, then if a+b < f+e, we add c? \n      Then s1 = a+b+c, then if a+b+c == f+e? not necessarily. Then we add d? \n\n  But we want to record when we have taken three from left and three from right? \n\n  Actually, we record when the sums are equal. So we must have a+b+c = d+e+f? \n\n  How do we get that? \n\n  We start with:\n      s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0.\n      Then we add a: s1=a -> then we check: s1>s2? -> then we add f: s2=f -> then we check: if s1==s2? if a==f, then record 2 (because Alice has 1, Bob has 1 -> total 2).\n      Then we add b: s1=a+b -> then we check: if a+b < f? then we add e? -> s2 = f+e -> then if a+b == f+e? then record 4 (Alice:2, Bob:2 -> total 4).\n      Then we add c: s1=a+b+c -> then we check: if a+b+c < f+e? then we add d? -> s2 = f+e+d -> then if a+b+c == f+e+d? then record 6.\n\n  So we record 0, then 2, then 4, then 6? Then we print 6.\n\n  But what if the sums are not equal at 6? Then we break without recording 6? \n\n  So the algorithm: we are moving the pointers until the sums are equal? \n\n  But the problem: we want the maximum total candies? So we record every time the sums are equal? And then take the maximum? \n\n  However, the current code only records when the sums are equal and then continues? And then at the end we take the last recorded value? \n\n  But the last recorded value is the one with the most candies? Because we are adding one candy at a time? \n\n  But note: we are adding from left and right? The total candies is increasing? \n\n  So the last time we have equality is the one with the most candies? \n\n  But what if we have an equality at 2 and then at 6? Then we record 2 and then 6? and then we take 6? \n\n  So the code is: \n      l2 = []\n      ... \n      print(l2[-1])\n\n  So we print the last recorded value? \n\n  But what if we never have an equality? Then l2 is empty? Then we get an error? \n\n  The problem says: if they cannot eat the same non-zero weight, then output 0. \n\n  But note: we start with 0,0 -> we record 0? So l2 is not empty? \n\n  Example 3: n=2, [1,2] -> \n      Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? \n      Then we add left: s1=1 -> then we check: s1>s2? -> then we add right: s2=2 -> then we check: s1==s2? 1==2? no -> then condition: p1-1<=p2? \n          Now p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true.\n          Then we check: s1=1, s2=2 -> s1<s2? -> then we do: ... we have to complete the missing part.\n\n  The missing part is: if s1 < s2: ... \n\n  What should we do? We should add more to Alice? So we take the next candy from the left? But there is no next candy? p1 is 1, which is the last? \n\n  Actually, we have p1=1 and p2=0. The next candy for Alice would be at index 1? But p1 is already 1? Then we cannot take more? \n\n  But the condition: we are in the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> 0<=0 -> true. \n\n  Then we do:\n      if s1==s2? no.\n      if s1 < s2: then we do ...? \n\n  We should add a candy from the left? But we are at p1=1, which is the last candy? Actually, the candies are from index0 to index1. \n      Alice has taken index0. Bob has taken index1. \n      The next candy for Alice would be at index1? But that candy is already taken by Bob? \n\n  So we cannot take it? \n\n  Therefore, we break? \n\n  But the condition: we are going to break when p1-1>p2? \n\n  How do we break? \n\n  We need to update: if s1 < s2, then we take from the left? But we have to check if there is any candy left on the left? \n\n  Actually, the condition for the while loop is p1-1<=p2. But we are about to take from the left: we would do p1+=1? Then after that, p1 becomes 2? Then the next condition: p1-1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break.\n\n  So we do: \n      if s1 < s2: \n          s1 += l[p1]   # but p1 is 1 -> l[1]=2 -> s1=1+2=3\n          p1 += 1   -> p1=2\n      Then we break? \n\n  Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? \n\n  But the expected answer for [1,2] is 0? \n\n  However, we recorded 0 at the beginning? \n\n  But the problem: they cannot eat the same non-zero weight? So they eat zero? \n\n  But note: the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\" they can eat? They can eat zero candies? \n\n  So 0 is acceptable? \n\n  But what if we have an array where we never have an equality? Then we output the last recorded value? which is 0? \n\n  So the algorithm: we start with 0,0 -> record 0. Then we update until we break? \n\n  But what if we have an equality at the beginning? Then we record 0? \n\n  But we also record when we have an equality later? \n\n  So the code is: \n      l2 = [0]   # because we start with 0? \n      then we update and record whenever we have an equality? \n\n  But the example [1,1] recorded 0 and then 2? \n\n  So we output 2? \n\n  Therefore, the missing part for program1.py: \n      if s1 < s2: \n          we should add a candy from the left? \n          s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But wait: the condition: we are at a state where s1 < s2. Then we want to increase s1? So we take the next candy from the left? \n\n  So the code for the missing part: \n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But note: we have to be careful with the indices. We are at p1, which is the next available candy on the left? \n\n  However, we have already incremented p1 in the s1==s2 block? \n\n  Actually, the structure is:\n\n      while (p1-1<=p2):\n          if s1 == s2: \n              l2.append(...)\n              s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n          if s1 < s2:   # note: this is a separate if, not elif\n              ... \n          if s2 < s1: \n              ... \n\n  But if we do the first if, then we update s1 and p1, and then we check the next two ifs? \n\n  For example: \n      Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> we do the first if: record 0, then s1 becomes l[0], p1 becomes 1.\n      Then we check: if s1 < s2? -> if l[0] < 0? probably not. \n      Then we check: if s2 < s1? -> 0 < l[0] -> true -> then we do: s2 += l[p2] (which is the last candy) and p2-=1.\n\n  Then we go to the next iteration.\n\n  But what if after the first if, we have s1 < s2? Then we do the second if? \n\n  Example: \n      Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1 becomes 1 (if l[0]=1), p1=1.\n      Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we skip the second if and do the third: s2 < s1 -> true -> then we add the last candy to s2.\n\n  So it's okay? \n\n  But what if we have s1==s2 and then after updating Alice, we have s1 < s2? Then we do the second if? \n\n  Example: \n      s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n      Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> 1<0? false -> then we check s2<1 -> true -> then we update Bob: s2=3 (if the last candy is 3), p2=n-2.\n\n  Then next iteration: \n      condition: p1-1=0<=p2? (if p2 is n-2, which is at least 0? if n>=2) -> true.\n      then check: s1=1, s2=3 -> s1==s2? no.\n      then if s1< s2: true -> then we do: s1 += l[p1] (which is the next left candy) -> p1 becomes 2.\n\n  So we are updating twice in one iteration? \n\n  But that is acceptable? \n\n  However, the problem: we are adding two candies for Alice in a row? \n\n  But the problem: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left in a row? But the algorithm is: we are adding one at a time? \n\n  But the problem: we are allowed to add as many as we want? But the algorithm is greedy: we are adding one at a time? \n\n  But note: we are trying to maximize the total candies? and we are moving from the outside in? \n\n  The algorithm: \n      We start with 0,0 -> record 0.\n      Then we add one candy for Alice? \n      Then we add one candy for Bob? \n      Then we check: if the sums are equal? record the total (which is 2).\n      Then we add one more for Alice? \n      Then we add one more for Bob? \n      Then record 4? \n      Then ... until we break.\n\n  But we are updating twice in one iteration? \n\n  Actually, the while loop runs one iteration per update? \n\n  But in the first iteration we update Alice (from the first if) and then Bob (from the third if). Then the next iteration we update Alice again (from the second if) and then Bob again? \n\n  But that would be two updates per iteration? \n\n  We want to do one update per iteration? \n\n  Alternatively, we can restructure to do one update per iteration? \n\n  But the problem: we are to complete the missing line? \n\n  The missing line is: \n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to write: \n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But then we have two updates in one iteration? \n\n  However, the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000. And we are updating at least one candy per iteration? So the total iterations is at most 200000? \n\n  But if we update two candies per iteration, then we might do 100000 iterations? \n\n  But the condition: the while loop condition: p1-1<=p2. \n\n  Actually, each iteration we update at least one pointer? Either p1 or p2? \n\n  But in the first if we update p1, and then in the third if we update p2? \n\n  So we update two pointers? \n\n  But the condition: we break when p1-1>p2. \n\n  How many iterations? \n      Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1<=n-1 -> true.\n      Then we update p1 to 1 -> condition: 0<=n-1 -> true.\n      Then we update p2 to n-2 -> condition: 0<=n-2 -> true.\n\n      Then next iteration: update p1 to 2 -> condition: 1<=n-2 -> true if n>=3.\n      Then update p2 to n-3 -> condition: 1<=n-3 -> true if n>=4.\n\n      So we do about n/2 iterations? \n\n  But each iteration we update two candies? \n\n  So the total operations are O(n)? \n\n  And the total n over test cases is 200000? So it's acceptable? \n\n  Therefore, the missing line for program1.py is: \n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious: what if p1 is already beyond the array? \n      The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> so p1 <= p2+1. \n      When we do p1 +=1, then we set p1 to p2+2? Then the condition breaks? \n\n  And we are accessing l[p1] only when p1 is in the range? \n\n  But the condition: we are in the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> so p1 <= p2+1. \n      If p1 <= p2, then l[p1] is valid? \n      If p1 == p2+1, then we are about to take a candy at p1 which is beyond the current segment? \n\n  Actually, the current segment of uneaten candies is [p1, p2]. So if p1>p2, we break. \n\n  But the condition is p1-1<=p2 -> which is p1<=p2+1. \n\n  So when p1==p2+1, we enter the loop? \n\n  Then we do the first if: s1==s2? \n      Then we do: s1 += l[p1] -> but p1 is p2+1, which is beyond the array? \n\n  We must avoid that. \n\n  How? \n\n  The condition for the first if: we are going to update p1 only if p1 is in the valid range? \n\n  But the condition: we have p1<=p2+1. \n\n  We should break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n  But the problem: the example [1,1] worked? \n\n  In [1,1]: \n      Iteration1: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1==s2 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n          then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the third if: s2<1 -> true -> s2=1, p2=0.\n      Then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n          s1==s2: 1==1 -> record 2, then s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1, so l[1] is the second candy? \n          Then p1 becomes 2.\n      Then condition: p1-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\n  But when we did s1 += l[1] at the second iteration, that was the second candy? But Bob already ate the second candy? \n\n  How? \n      Bob ate the candy at index1? Then we are adding the same candy again? \n\n  This is a problem. \n\n  Actually, the state: \n      After the first iteration: \n          Alice has eaten candy0 -> p1=1 (so the next available for Alice is candy1? but Bob has eaten candy1? \n      Then we update Bob: we do s2 += l[p2] -> p2 is 1 -> we add candy1? Then we set p2=0. \n      Then the next iteration: \n          We check: s1=1, s2=1 -> we record 2 (because Alice has eaten 1 candy, Bob has eaten 1 candy -> total 2? \n          Then we update Alice: we do s1 += l[1] -> which is the candy at index1? But that candy was already eaten by Bob? \n\n  This is a conflict. \n\n  Therefore, we must not allow the same candy to be eaten twice. \n\n  The problem: the pointers p1 and p2: \n      p1: the next candy that Alice will eat? or the number of candies Alice has eaten? \n      Actually, the code: \n          Initially: p1=0 -> Alice has eaten nothing? \n          Then we do: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1 -> then p1 becomes 1: meaning Alice has eaten candy0, and the next available is candy1? \n\n      Similarly, Bob: p2 starts at n-1 -> we do s2 += l[p2]; p2 -=1 -> then Bob has eaten candy n-1, and the next available for Bob is candy n-2? \n\n  But in the second iteration: \n      We are going to use p1=1 and p2=0? \n      Then we update Alice: we take candy1? but Bob has not taken candy1? Bob has taken candy n-1? \n\n  In the example [1,1] (n=2): \n      After the first iteration: \n          Alice: p1=1 -> she has eaten candy0? \n          Bob: p2=0 -> he has eaten candy1? \n      Then the next iteration: \n          condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n          s1=1, s2=1 -> we record 2? \n          Then we update Alice: we take l[1] -> which is the candy at index1? But Bob has already taken it? \n\n  So we are taking the same candy? \n\n  How to fix? \n\n  We should break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n  But the condition: we are using p1-1<=p2? \n\n  We should change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n  Then in the second iteration: \n      p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1<=0 -> false -> we break? \n\n  Then we don't do the second iteration? \n\n  Then we don't record the 2? \n\n  But we want to record 2? \n\n  How? \n\n  We record when the sums are equal? But we break before we can record? \n\n  Therefore, we must record the equality at the moment we have it? \n\n  But the problem: the candies are already taken? \n\n  Actually, the state: \n      Alice has taken candy0 -> s1=1, Bob has taken candy1 -> s2=1. \n      Then we have an equality? \n\n  How do we record? \n\n  The total candies eaten: Alice has taken 1, Bob has taken 1 -> total 2. \n\n  But we are not going to take any more? \n\n  So we should record 2? \n\n  But the condition: we break when p1>p2? \n\n  We can record after we break? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition to p1<=p2? and then after the loop, we check if we have an equality? \n\n  But the problem: we are to complete the code as given? \n\n  The given code has the condition: while (p1-1<=p2): \n\n  And the example [1,1] worked? It recorded 2? \n\n  How? \n      In the second iteration: \n          p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true -> we enter.\n          s1=1, s2=1 -> we record: p1 + n-1-p2 = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2.\n          Then we update Alice: s1 += l[1] -> 1+1=2, p1=2.\n          Then we break? \n\n  But then we have recorded 2? \n\n  But the problem: we are taking candy1 twice? \n\n  How can we avoid that? \n\n  We must not update if there is no candy? \n\n  Actually, the condition: we are updating Alice only if we are in the loop? \n\n  But the state: the next candy for Alice is at index1? But Bob has taken it? \n\n  How do we know that? \n\n  The pointers: \n      The uneaten candies are from p1 to p2? \n      But in the second iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> which is an invalid segment? \n\n  We should break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n  Therefore, we change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n  But the problem: the example [1,1] would not record the 2? \n\n  Alternatively, we can record the equality without updating? \n\n  The current code: \n      if s1 == s2: \n          l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # this is the current total: Alice has eaten p1 candies, Bob has eaten n-1-p2 candies? \n          then we update: s1 += l[p1]; p1+=1   -> but if p1>p2, then we are taking an invalid candy? \n\n  We should only update if there is a candy? \n\n  How? \n\n  We can do: \n      if s1 == s2: \n          l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n          if p1 <= p2:   # we can take one more? \n              s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n          else:\n              break   # or not? \n\n  But the problem: we are to complete the missing line? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition of the while loop to p1<=p2? \n\n  But the problem: the condition is given: while (p1-1<=p2): \n\n  And we are not allowed to change it? \n\n  The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> we are only to fill the TODO? \n\n  But the condition might be a bug? \n\n  However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the example [1,1] works? \n\n  But the example [1,1] does work? \n\n  But the issue: we are taking candy1 twice? \n\n  Actually, in the second iteration, when we update Alice: we are taking l[p1] at p1=1? \n      But the array l has two elements: l[0]=1, l[1]=1. \n      Bob has taken the candy at index1? But we are taking it again? \n\n  How do we represent that Bob has taken candy1? \n      We set p2=0 -> meaning the next available for Bob is at index0? \n      But the candy at index1 is already taken? \n\n  Actually, the state: \n      p1: the next available candy for Alice is at index p1? \n      p2: the next available candy for Bob is at index p2? \n\n  But after Bob takes candy1 (index1), we set p2=0? meaning the next available for Bob is candy0? \n      But candy0 is also available for Alice? \n\n  This is the problem: the candies are contiguous. The uneaten candies are from p1 to p2? \n      Initially: [0,1] -> p1=0, p2=1.\n      After Alice takes candy0: p1=1, and the uneaten candies are [1,1] -> candy1.\n      After Bob takes candy1: p2=0, and the uneaten candies are [1,0] -> which is empty? because 1>0? \n\n  We should represent the uneaten candies as p1 to p2, inclusive? \n      Then after Alice takes candy0: p1=1, p2=1 -> uneaten: [1] (index1).\n      Then after Bob takes candy1: p2=0, so uneaten: from 1 to 0 -> empty? \n\n  How? \n      Bob: we start at p2=1 (the last candy). We take it, then we set p2=0 -> meaning the next available is at index0? \n      But the next available for Bob should be the one before the last taken? \n\n  We should do: \n      Bob: takes candy at p2, then moves to p2-1.\n\n  Then the uneaten candies are from p1 to p2 (inclusive). \n\n  So after Bob takes candy1: \n      p2 becomes 0? but the candy at index0 is already taken by Alice? \n\n  Actually, we have: \n      Alice: takes candy0 -> p1 becomes 1 (so the next available is index1).\n      Bob: takes candy1 -> p2 becomes 0 (so the next available is index0, but that is already taken?).\n\n  The uneaten candies are the ones from p1 to p2? \n      But p1=1, p2=0 -> no candy? \n\n  So we should break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n  But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> in this case: 1-1=0<=0 -> true -> we enter the loop? \n\n  Then we do: \n      s1=1, s2=1 -> record 2? \n      Then we update Alice: s1 += l[1] -> but l[1] is the candy at index1? which is already taken by Bob? \n\n  This is a data race? \n\n  How to avoid? \n\n  We should not update if there is no candy? \n\n  We can check: if p1<=p2: then update, else break? \n\n  But the problem: we are to complete the missing line? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n  But the problem: the condition is given. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> we are allowed to change the condition? \n\n  But the instruction: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and we are given the code with a TODO. \n\n  We are only to fill the TODO? \n\n  The TODO is only in the line: \n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we cannot change the condition? \n\n  Then we must live with it? \n\n  But the example [1,1] works and outputs 2? \n\n  And the fourth example: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=7, and the answer is 7? \n\n  How does it work? \n      We want: Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30? \n      Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n  How do we record 7? \n      We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0.\n      Then update Alice: s1=7, p1=1.\n      Then update Bob: s2=1, p2=5.   [because the last candy is at index6? so initially p2=6, then we take l[6]=1, then p2=5]\n      Then condition: p1-1=0<=5 -> true.\n          s1=7, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=1+l[5]=1+11=12, p2=4.\n      Then condition: 0<=4 -> true.\n          s1=7, s2=12 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=7+l[1]=7+3=10, p1=2.\n      Then condition: 1<=4 -> true.\n          s1=10, s2=12 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=10+l[2]=10+20=30, p1=3.\n      Then condition: 2<=4 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=12 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=12+l[4]=12+8=20, p2=3.\n      Then condition: 2<=3 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=20 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=20+l[3]=20+10=30, p2=2.\n      Then condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=30 -> record: p1 + n-1-p2 = 3 + (7-1-2) = 3+4=7.\n          Then update Alice: s1=30+l[3] -> but p1=3, l[3]=10 -> s1=40, p1=4.\n      Then condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n      Then we print 7.\n\n  But note: when we update Alice at p1=3, that candy (index3) is the fourth candy? which is 10. But Bob has not taken it? \n      But in the next step, Bob updates: he takes l[3]? \n\n  But wait: at the state when we recorded 7, the next available for Alice is index3 and for Bob is index3? \n      Then we update Alice: she takes index3? \n      Then we update Bob: we are in the next iteration? \n          But the condition: p1=4, p2=2 -> condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n  But Bob did not get a chance to take index3? \n\n  And the candy at index3 is taken by Alice? \n\n  But in the fair partition: Bob should take the candies [10,8,11,1] -> which includes the candy at index3 (10)? \n\n  How can Bob take it if Alice took it? \n\n  This is a problem. \n\n  Therefore, the algorithm has a flaw: it allows both to take the same candy? \n\n  How to fix? \n\n  We should not allow them to take the same candy. \n\n  The issue: when we are at p1=3 and p2=2, the candy at index3 is not available for Alice? because the segment is from p1=3 to p2=2 -> which is empty? \n\n  But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> 2<=2 -> true. \n\n  And then we do: \n      if s1==s2: record 7.\n      then we update Alice: s1 += l[3] -> but p1=3, and the next available is at index3? but the segment is empty? \n\n  We should break out of the loop when p1>p2? \n\n  But the condition is p1-1<=p2? \n\n  We can change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n  Then in the state: p1=3, p2=2 -> 3<=2 -> false -> break. \n      Then we don't record the 7? \n\n  But we want to record 7? \n\n  How? \n\n  We record when s1==s2? \n\n  We can record after the loop? \n\n  But the current code records inside the loop. \n\n  Alternatively, we can record the 7 in the last iteration? \n\n  How? \n      In the state: p1=3, p2=3 -> then we have a valid segment? \n      Then we do: \n          s1=30, s2=30 -> record 7? \n          then update Alice: s1=30+l[3]=40, p1=4.\n          then condition: 3<=3 -> true? \n          then we have to continue? \n\n  But how do we get p1=3 and p2=3? \n\n  Let me re-simulate with condition p1<=p2? \n\n  We change the condition to: while p1<=p2: \n\n  Example [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]:\n      Start: p1=0, p2=6 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0.\n          then update Alice: s1=7, p1=1.\n      Then condition: 1<=6 -> true.\n          s1=7, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=1, p2=5.\n      Then condition: 1<=5 -> true.\n          s1=7, s2=1 -> update Alice: s1=10, p1=2.\n      Then condition: 2<=5 -> true.\n          s1=10, s2=1 -> update Alice: s1=30, p1=3.\n      Then condition: 3<=5 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=1 -> update Bob: s2=1+11=12, p2=4.\n      Then condition: 3<=4 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=12 -> update Bob: s2=12+8=20, p2=3.\n      Then condition: 3<=3 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=20 -> update Bob: s2=20+10=30, p2=2.\n      Then condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n      Then we print the last recorded value? which is 0? \n\n  But we never recorded 7? \n\n  We should record when s1==s2? \n\n  In the last step: when we update Bob to 30, then s1=30 and s2=30? \n      But we are in the condition: we are about to leave the loop? \n\n  How can we record it? \n\n  We can record after the loop? \n\n  But the current code only records inside the loop. \n\n  Alternatively, we can record in the loop body at the right moment? \n\n  How about: \n      if s1==s2: \n          record\n\n  But in the last update (when we did Bob: s2=30) we are not in the loop body? \n\n  We do the update for Bob in the loop body? \n      In the last iteration: \n          p1=3, p2=3 -> true.\n          s1=30, s2=20 -> we do: \n              if s1==s2? no.\n              if s1< s2? no.\n              if s2< s1: yes -> then we do: s2+=l[3]=10, p2=2.\n          Then after that, we can check: s1==s2? -> 30==30? -> but we are not checking in this iteration? \n\n  Then we break? \n\n  We can move the recording to after the updates? \n\n  But the current code: \n      if s1==s2: ... \n      if s1<s2: ... \n      if s2<s1: ... \n\n  Then in the next iteration, we check? \n\n  But we break? \n\n  Therefore, we should change the order? \n\n  How about: \n      while p1<=p2:\n          if s1 <= s2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              best = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n  Then in the example: \n      ... \n      After the last update: we set s2=30, p2=2 -> then we check: s1=30, s2=30 -> then we set best=3 + (7-1-2)=3+4=7.\n      Then we break.\n\n  Then we print best? \n\n  But the given code structure is different. \n\n  Given the constraints of the problem (we are only to fill the TODO), we must not change the structure. \n\n  Therefore, we must live with the given structure and hope that the condition p1-1<=p2 is intended and the examples work? \n\n  The example [1,1] works and outputs 2, and the fourth example outputs 7? \n\n  And the third example: n=2, [1,2] -> outputs 0? \n\n  So we will complete program1.py with: \n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  For program2.py: \n      The code: \n          n=int(input())\n          while n:\n              num=int(input())\n              if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n              elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n              elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n              else:print(\"Division 4\")\n              n-=1\n\n      The TODO: in the condition for Division 2? \n          Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n\n      The condition: \n          if num>=1900: Division 1\n          elif num>=1600: then it must be Division 2? because if it were >=1900 we would have taken the first branch. \n          so we can print \"Division 2\"\n\n      But note: the next condition is elif num>=1400: which is for Division 3. \n\n      So the missing code: \n          print(\"Division 2\")\n\n  However, the condition: \n      if num>=1900 -> Division 1\n      else if num>=1600 -> then 1600<=num<=1899 -> Division 2\n      else if num>=1400 -> then 1400<=num<=1599 -> Division 3\n      else -> Division 4\n\n  So the missing line is: \n        print(\"Division 2\")\n\n  But we must be cautious: the problem says: \n      Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n\n  And our condition: num>=1600 will include ratings>=1900? but we already handled >=1900 above. \n\n  So it's safe. \n\n  Therefore, the answer for program2.py is: \n        print(\"Division 2\")\n\n  But note: the code has an indentation: the TODO is in the elif clause. \n\n  We simply put: \n        print(\"Division 2\")\n\n  But then the next condition is elif num>=1400: which is correct. \n\n  So the final answer: \n      program1: \"        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n      program2: \"        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n\n  But wait: the program1 code has a comment on the same line? \n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO line? \n\n  The TODO is only the comment? \n\n  We should remove the comment and put the code? \n\n  So the line becomes: \n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But the style: we can put it on the next line? \n\n  The given code: \n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n  We can do: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n  But the problem: the next line is an if statement? \n\n  Alternatively, we can put it in one line? \n\n  But the style of the given code: the next condition is in one line. \n\n  We can do: \n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But to be safe and clear, we can put it in two lines? \n\n  However, the problem: we are to output only the missing code? \n\n  The missing code for program1 is the block for the condition s1 < s2. \n\n  The given code for the condition s2 < s1 is in one line. \n\n  So we do one line? \n\n  But the condition s1 < s2 might be followed by the next if? \n\n  If we do: \n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  Then the next if is still executed in the same iteration? \n\n  That is acceptable? \n\n  Yes, because we want to check all conditions? \n\n  But note: after we update s1, we might have s1>=s2? then we don't want to update s2? \n\n  But the next if: if s2 < s1: ... might be true? \n\n  Example: \n      s1=1, s2=2 -> we do the first update: s1 becomes 3, then we check: if s2< s1: 2<3 -> true -> then we update s2? \n\n  But that would be two updates in one iteration? \n\n  That is the current design. \n\n  So we do: \n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But the problem: what if p1 is out of bounds? \n      The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> so p1<=p2+1. \n      If p1==p2+1, then l[p1] is out of bounds? \n\n  But the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. \n      p1 is initially 0, and we increment it. \n      p1 should not exceed n-1? \n\n  But the condition: p1<=p2+1. \n      p2 is at least -1? \n      So p1 can be at most p2+1. \n      But p2 starts at n-1, then p1 can be up to (n-1)+1 = n? \n\n  Then when p1=n, we try to access l[n] -> index out of bounds. \n\n  How to avoid? \n\n  We should only update if p1 < n? \n\n  But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> and p2>= -1, so p1 can be up to p2+1. \n      But p2 is at least -1, so p1 can be up to n? \n\n  But the array has size n: indices 0 to n-1. \n\n  Therefore, when p1 = n, we are out of bounds. \n\n  We can check: if p1 < n: then update, else break? \n\n  But the problem: we are not allowed to change the condition? \n\n  However, the problem guarantees that the total n over test cases is 200000, and the array has n elements. \n\n  But the condition: the sum of n over test cases is 200000? \n\n  And we are only to fill the TODO? \n\n  We must assume that the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1 is in bounds? \n\n  But when p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1, and p2 might be -1? then n-1<=-1 -> false -> we break. \n\n  So we never have p1 = n in the loop? \n\n  Let me see: \n      The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> to enter the loop.\n      If p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1.\n      We require n-1<=p2.\n      But p2 is at most n-1 initially, and we are decrementing it. \n      When p1 = n, then p2 must be at least n-1? \n      But p2 starts at n-1 and we are decrementing, so p2 is at most n-1. \n      But if p2 is n-1, then we have not taken any candy from the right? \n      And p1 = n -> we have taken all from the left? \n      Then the condition: n-1<=n-1 -> true -> we enter.\n\n      Then we try to access l[p1] = l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n  Therefore, we must avoid that. \n\n  How? \n\n  We can check in the TODO: if p1 < n: then update, else: break? \n\n  But the problem: we are to output only the missing code? \n\n  We can do: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But the given code for the condition s2<s1 is in one line. \n\n  Alternatively, we can rely on the condition of the while loop to avoid this? \n\n  But the condition is p1-1<=p2, and when p1=n, then p1-1 = n-1, and we require n-1<=p2. \n      But p2 is at most n-1, so we enter only if p2>=n-1. \n      And p2 starts at n-1, and we are decrementing, so p2>=n-1 only if p2=n-1. \n      Then in the next iteration, we would have p1=n, p2=n-1 -> condition: n-1<=n-1 -> true.\n\n  So we enter and then we try to access l[n] -> out of bounds. \n\n  Therefore, we must add a bounds check. \n\n  Given the instructions, we are to complete the code so that it runs correctly. \n\n  So for program1.py, we do: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But the problem: the next if (s2<s1) might be executed? \n\n  If we break, then we break out of the while loop, so the next if is not executed. \n\n  But the break is inside the if s1<s2. \n\n  Alternatively, we can do: \n        if s1 < s2 and p1 < n: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        elif s1 < s2:\n            break\n\n  But that is two lines. \n\n  Or we can do: \n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 >= n: break\n            s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n  But then if we break, we break the while loop? \n\n  But the break will break the while loop? \n\n  We are inside the while loop. \n\n  So if we break, we exit the while loop and the for loop continues? \n\n  But we are in a test case. \n\n  We want to break out of the while loop? \n\n  Then we can do: \n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But then if we break, we break the while loop. \n\n  And then we print l2[-1]? \n\n  And if we never recorded any value? then l2 might be empty? \n\n  But we recorded 0 at the beginning? \n\n  So it's safe. \n\n  But the problem: the condition might be rare? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are only to fill the TODO, and the original condition might be intended to avoid this? \n\n  But the example [1,1] does not have p1>=n? \n\n  In the last iteration: p1=1 (which is < n=2) -> then we update to p1=2, and then the next condition: p1-1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break. \n\n  So we never have p1>=n in the loop? \n\n  When would p1>=n happen? \n      Only if we try to update Alice when there is no candy left? \n\n  But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> and p1>=n -> then p1-1>=n-1.\n      We require p1-1<=p2 -> so n-1<=p2.\n      But p2 is at most n-1, so p2 must be n-1.\n      Then we are in the state: \n          p1 = n, p2 = n-1.\n      But how did we get p1=n? \n          We must have updated Alice from p1=n-1 to p1=n in the previous iteration? \n      Then in the previous iteration, we had p1=n-1, p2=n-1 -> condition: (n-1)-1 = n-2<=n-1 -> true.\n          then we did an update for Alice: p1 becomes n.\n\n      Then in the next iteration: \n          p1=n, p2=n-1 -> condition: n-1<=n-1 -> true.\n          then we try to update: if s1<s2, then we try to access l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n  Therefore, we must avoid that. \n\n  Given the instructions, we decide to add the bounds check. \n\n  But the problem: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, and we are only to fill the TODO, and the TODO is only for the condition s1<s2. \n\n  So we output for program1: \n        if p1 < n: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n        else: break\n\n  But we need to put it in the block? \n\n  We can do: \n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But the given code for the condition s2<s1 is in one line. \n\n  We are allowed to use multiple lines? \n\n  The problem: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\n  So we can use a block. \n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the completion is:\n        if p1 < n:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But wait, the condition s1 < s2 is already there. \n\n  We are to complete the TODO line. \n\n  The TODO is at the line: \n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can replace the entire line with: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But then the next line is \"        if s2 < s1: ...\", which is after the block. \n\n  Alternatively, we can put the entire block in one line? \n\n  But that is not readable. \n\n  Given the instructions, we output the block. \n\n  But the output format: we are to output only the missing code? \n\n  For program1, the missing code is the block for the condition s1 < s2. \n\n  So we output: \n        if p1 < n:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: the indentation. In the given code, the TODO line is indented by 4 spaces, and the next line is also indented by 4 spaces. \n\n  We will output the block with the same indentation? \n\n  The current code after the TODO line has: \n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n  We want: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n  But the first if has a block now. \n\n  Alternatively, we can do without the bounds check? \n\n  Because the problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000, and the array has n elements, and the condition p1-1<=p2 might ensure that p1 is always < n? \n\n  Let me see: \n      p1 is incremented from 0 upward. \n      The condition to enter the loop is p1-1<=p2.\n      In the update for Alice: we do p1 +=1, then the new p1 might be n? \n      But then in the next iteration, we have p1 (which is n) and p2 (which is at least the current value). \n      The condition: p1-1 = n-1 <= p2 -> true only if p2>=n-1.\n      But p2 is initially n-1, and then we decrement it. \n      So if p2 is still n-1, then we enter. \n      Then we try to access l[p1] = l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n  Therefore, we must have the bounds check. \n\n  So we include it. \n\n  For program2, we have: \n        print(\"Division 2\")\n\n  But note: the code has to output exactly as required. \n\n  Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if p1 < n:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n}\n\n  But wait: in program1, the condition s1 < s2 is already there. We are only to complete the block under it. \n\n  So the completion for program1 is the block that goes under the if s1 < s2. \n\n  And for program2, the completion is the print statement.\n\n  Let's hope it works."
