    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we have a binary string of even length.\n We want to partition the string into contiguous subsegments of the same character, and we want the length of every segment to be even.\n We can change any character to '0' or '1' at a cost of one operation per change.\n\n The goal: minimum number of operations.\n\n Observation:\n We are allowed to change arbitrarily. We note that the problem requires the entire string to be partitioned into contiguous segments of even length, and each segment has the same character.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire string to be one segment? It can be multiple. But the condition is that the partition must be the minimum number of contiguous subsegments (meaning we break only when adjacent characters are different).\n\n But note: the problem says \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\" -> This is the natural partition: we break at every change.\n\n However, we are allowed to change some bits. We want to achieve that in the natural partition (which is the minimum contiguous subsegments) every segment has even length.\n\n How to solve?\n We can traverse the string and group consecutive same characters. But note: we are allowed to change some characters arbitrarily. We can also note that we can merge adjacent segments by changing the boundary? But the problem requires the minimum number of contiguous subsegments? Actually, the partition is defined by the breaks: we break when two adjacent characters are different. So if we change a character, we might merge two segments or break a segment.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length. Moreover, the segments must be contiguous and of the same character.\n\n We can use dynamic programming? But note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200,000. However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases is at most 200,000. So we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000? Actually, the input says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\".\n\n How about we traverse and try to form even segments? We can use a greedy approach:\n\n Idea:\n We traverse the string and try to form segments of even length. But note: we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily. We want to minimize the number of changes.\n\n We can consider: we are going to form segments of even length. The segments must be contiguous and of the same character. We can choose the character for each segment arbitrarily? But note: adjacent segments must be of different characters? Because if they are the same, they would be merged. So the segments must alternate.\n\n However, we are allowed to change arbitrarily, so we can choose the starting character arbitrarily and then alternate.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the segments to alternate? Actually, the natural partition breaks at every change. So if we have two consecutive segments of the same character, they would be merged. Therefore, the segments must alternate.\n\n Therefore, the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length and the segments must alternate between 0 and 1.\n\n How to minimize the operations? We can choose the starting character arbitrarily and then the entire string is fixed: we know the pattern: \n pattern: [a block of even length of 0, then a block of even length of 1, then 0, ...] OR [a block of even length of 1, then 0, ...]\n\n But note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily. So for a fixed pattern of alternating segments, we can compute the cost.\n\n However, we don't know the starting character and we don't know the lengths of the segments? But we are free to choose the breaks arbitrarily? Actually, the problem requires the partition to be the minimum number of contiguous subsegments? That means we cannot break a run of the same character arbitrarily? Actually, we can change the characters arbitrarily so that the natural partition (by breaks at adjacent different) will form the segments we want.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the partition to be the natural one? It says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" and then the condition. However, the natural partition is the one that minimizes the number of segments: we break only when adjacent characters are different.\n\n Therefore, we are forced to break at every place where two adjacent characters are different. So we cannot avoid a break at a boundary if the two sides are different. But we can change the characters arbitrarily so that the breaks occur only at the boundaries we choose.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily. We can design the entire string arbitrarily? But we want to minimize the operations.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We note that the condition of the problem (after our changes) is that the natural partition (by breaks at adjacent different) must have every segment of even length.\n\n How can we achieve that? We can traverse and fix the string. We can use a greedy algorithm that forms the current segment until we have an even length? But note: we can also change the character to force a break or avoid a break.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily. We can also note that the parity of the segment length is what matters.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let's traverse the string and keep a current segment. We start with the first character. We have two choices: we can change the first character or not? Actually, we are going to form segments of even length. We can decide the starting character arbitrarily.\n\n But note: we want to minimize the operations. We can use a state machine that tracks the current segment's character and the current length mod 2.\n\n However, note: the problem can be simplified by the following:\n\n Observation: \n In the final string, we require that every maximal contiguous segment of 0s or 1s has even length. But note: we can break a segment of odd length by changing one character in the middle? Actually, we can break it arbitrarily.\n\n But note: if we have a run of k consecutive same characters, we can break it by changing one character? For example, if we have \"000\", we can change the middle to '1' to get \"010\", then we have three segments: \"0\", \"1\", \"0\" -> but then the lengths are 1,1,1 -> all odd? that's not even.\n\n Alternatively, we can break it by changing two characters? For example, \"000\" -> \"010\" doesn't work. How about \"000\" -> \"011\"? Then we have \"0\" and \"11\": lengths 1 and 2 -> 1 is odd. \n\n Actually, we can break a run of k consecutive same characters into segments of even length by changing some characters. How?\n\n We can note: \n - If k is even, we don't need to break? we can leave it as one segment? but wait, we can also break it arbitrarily? but we don't have to. However, if we break it, we might merge with adjacent segments? \n\n Actually, the problem requires the natural partition (minimal breaks) to have even segments. So if we have a run of even length, we can leave it as one segment. If we have a run of odd length, we cannot leave it as one segment because the length is odd. So we must break it? How?\n\n We can break a run of odd length by changing one character in the middle? But note: if we change one character in the middle, we break the run into two runs: the left part and the right part. But then the left part and the right part will be adjacent to the new character? \n\n Example: \"000\" -> if we change the middle to '1', we get \"010\". Then the natural partition is three segments: \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", each of length 1 -> odd. That doesn't work.\n\n How about changing two characters? \n Example: \"000\" -> change the second and third: \"011\" -> then we have \"0\", \"11\": two segments. The first segment has length 1 (odd) -> not good.\n\n How about changing the first and second? \"100\" -> then we have \"1\", \"00\": two segments: 1 (odd) and 2 (even) -> not good.\n\n How about changing the first and third? \"101\": then we have \"1\", \"0\", \"1\": three segments of length 1 -> not good.\n\n So we cannot break a run of 3 into even segments with one or two changes? \n\n Actually, we can break a run of odd length by breaking it at an even position? But note: we can break it at multiple places? \n\n However, note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily. We can also consider merging with adjacent segments? \n\n But the problem is: we are processing the entire string. We can use a greedy algorithm that goes from left to right and whenever we have a segment that becomes even, we break? \n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Let the current segment start at index i. We are going to extend until we have an even length? But what if we have an odd length? We can break at the first even length? \n\n However, consider: \n We are at position i, and we are forming a segment of 0s. We can extend until we have an even length. But if we extend and then we see that the next character is the same? Then we can include it? But if we include it, we break the evenness? \n\n Actually, we can use a greedy algorithm that:\n\n Let i=0, and we set the current segment character to s[0] (or we can change it? but we are allowed to change, so we can choose the character arbitrarily). We want to form a segment of even length. We can choose to change the first character? \n\n Alternatively, we can use state (last character, current segment length mod 2). We traverse the string and for each character, we decide whether to change it or not, and then update the state.\n\n But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we have 2 states (last character: 0 or 1) and 2 states (mod 2) -> 4 states. We can do DP.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case n per test case can be 200000? and the total n over test cases is 200000, so there is at most one test case? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n But note: the constraints on t: up to 10000 test cases? but the total n<=200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 10000, but the average n is 200000/10000 = 20. So we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n However, worst-case: 10000 test cases each of n=20 -> 10000*20 = 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do:\n\n Let dp[i][last][parity] = minimum operations to process the prefix [0:i] such that the last segment (which is still ongoing) has last character = last (0 or 1) and the current segment has length mod 2 = parity (0 for even, 1 for odd). \n\n However, we are going to break the string into segments. We break when we change the character? Actually, we break when the current character is different from the last segment's character? But we can change the current character arbitrarily.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n We break the string at positions where we decide to end a segment. But the condition: the segment must be even. So we can only break at even positions? \n\n Actually, we can design:\n\n Let dp[i][c] = minimum operations to process the prefix [0:i] and the last segment ends at i and has character c (0 or 1) and the entire prefix is partitioned into segments of even length.\n\n How to transition?\n We know that the segment ending at i must have even length. So we can let the segment start at j (j<=i) such that the length (i-j+1) is even. Then:\n\n dp[i][c] = min_{j: j-1 is the end of a segment and j to i forms an even-length segment} { \n     dp[j-1][1-c] + (number of changes needed from s[j:i+1] to make it all c) \n }\n\n But note: we can also have the entire segment from j to i being changed to c? \n\n However, the total n is 200000? and we cannot iterate over j for each i.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy: \n\n Insight from known similar problems: \n We note that the condition of even segments implies that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length. Moreover, the segments must alternate. \n\n We can use a state machine that only remembers the last character and the current segment's length mod 2? But we don't care about the entire history? \n\n Let dp[i][c][p] = minimum operations to process the prefix [0:i] such that the current segment (which is not closed) has character c and the current length mod 2 is p (0 or 1). \n\n Then we consider the next character s[i] (or we can change it to 0 or 1). \n\n We have two choices for the next character: we can set it to 0 or 1. \n\n If we set it to the same as the current segment's character c, then:\n   new_length_mod = (p+1) % 2\n   Then we can either close the segment if new_length_mod==0? But note: we are not forced to close? Actually, we can only close when the segment is even? But we are in the middle? \n\n However, we are forming segments: we can close the segment at i if the current segment becomes even? But we are allowed to leave it open? \n\n Actually, we can only close the segment when we break (i.e., when we change the character for the next segment) or at the end. \n\n But note: the problem requires the entire string to be partitioned. So at the end we must have the last segment even.\n\n How to design the state? We don't close the segment until we break the character. So we don't need to remember the entire segment? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n We traverse the string and we are in a segment. We can only end the segment when the current length is even. Then we start a new segment.\n\n So:\n\n Let dp[i][c] = minimum operations to process the prefix [0:i] and the current segment (if any) has not been closed and the current segment's character is c and the current length mod 2 is 0? \n\n But wait, we can also have the segment not closed? Actually, we must close the segment only when we break? \n\n Actually, we can break the segment only when the current segment is even? \n\n We can have:\n\n dp[i][c] = minimum operations to have processed [0:i] and the current segment (if any) has character c and the current length mod 2 is 0 (meaning we can break at i) OR we are in the middle of a segment (with odd length) and we cannot break? \n\n Actually, we need to remember the parity. So:\n\n Let dp[i][c][p] = minimum operations to process [0:i] and the current segment has character c and the current length mod 2 is p.\n\n Then we consider the next character at i+1.\n\n We can set the next character to 0 or 1. Let the chosen character be d.\n\n Case 1: d == c -> then we extend the current segment.\n   new_p = (p+1) % 2\n   Then we update: \n        dp[i+1][c][new_p] = min( dp[i+1][c][new_p], dp[i][c][p] + (0 if s[i]==d else 1) )\n\n Case 2: d != c -> then we break the current segment and start a new segment. But we can only break the current segment if the current segment is even? i.e., p must be 0? \n   Why? Because if the current segment is not even (p=1) then we cannot break? because we would leave an odd segment.\n\n   So if p==0, then we can break and start a new segment with character d. The new segment has length 1 -> so the new parity is 1 (odd). \n        dp[i+1][d][1] = min( dp[i+1][d][1], dp[i][c][0] + (0 if s[i+1]==d else 1) )\n\n   But what if p==1? Then we cannot break? because we cannot leave an odd segment. So we must not break? Then we cannot change the character? \n\n However, note: we are forced to break? because the next character is different? But wait, we are allowed to change the next character to c? Then we don't break? \n\n Actually, we have two choices: we can set the next character to c (then we don't break) or to d (then we break, but only if the current segment is even).\n\n Therefore, we must consider both choices.\n\n But note: if we set the next character to c, then we are in case 1.\n\n So we don't need to consider breaking when we set the next character to d? We only break when we set the next character to d and the current segment is even? \n\n However, what if we are in the middle of an odd segment and we set the next character to d? Then we break? But that leaves the current segment as odd -> which is invalid. So we are not allowed to break until the segment becomes even.\n\n Therefore, we cannot break in the middle of an odd segment? \n\n So the state must remember the current segment's character and the parity.\n\n But note: we can also break the segment at an even position? So if we are at an even position (current segment even) we can break? \n\n However, we are forced to break when we change the character? But we can also change the next character to the same as the current? \n\n Therefore, the state:\n\n dp[i][c][p] = minimum operations to process the prefix [0:i] and the current segment (which is not closed) has character c and the current length mod 2 is p.\n\n Then for the next character s[i] (at index i, we are processing from 0 to n-1) we have:\n\n   Option 1: set the character to c (the same as the current segment)\n        new_p = (p+1) % 2\n        cost = 0 if s[i]==c else 1\n        then update dp[i+1][c][new_p] = min( dp[i+1][c][new_p], dp[i][c][p] + cost )\n\n   Option 2: set the character to d (different from c) -> but only if the current segment is even? (p==0) because we can only break an even segment? \n        Then we break the current segment (which is even) and start a new segment with character d and length 1 (so parity=1).\n        cost = 0 if s[i]==d else 1\n        then update dp[i+1][d][1] = min( dp[i+1][d][1], dp[i][c][0] + cost )\n\n But note: what if we are at the beginning? We start with no segment? \n\n We can initialize: \n   We start at index0. We can set the first character to 0 or 1.\n\n   dp[0][0][1] = 0 if s[0]=='0' else 1\n   dp[0][1][1] = 0 if s[0]=='1' else 1\n\n Then we iterate from i=0 to n-1.\n\n At the end, we require that the last segment is even? so we must have p=0. \n   Answer = min( dp[n][0][0], dp[n][1][0] )\n\n However, note: we are processing the entire string. The last segment must be even.\n\n But what if we break the segment at the last character? Then the last segment is of length 1? which is odd? so we cannot break at the last character? \n\n Actually, we break only when we change the character? and we break only when the current segment is even. The last segment must be even. So we require the state at the end to be even.\n\n Therefore, we take min( dp[n][0][0], dp[n][1][0] ).\n\n But note: the state at n: we have processed [0:n] so the last segment is the one that ends at n-1? \n\n However, our state dp[i] is after processing i characters. So at i=n, we have processed n characters.\n\n The state at n: the current segment has length mod 2 = p. We require p=0.\n\n But note: we never closed the last segment? Actually, we don't need to close the last segment until the end? and we don't break at the end? So the last segment must be even.\n\n Therefore, the answer is min( dp[n][0][0], dp[n][1][0] ).\n\n However, we must consider: what if we break the segment at the last character? But we break only when we change the character? and at the last character we don't have a next character? So we don't break at the last character? \n\n Therefore, the last segment is the one that started at some j and ended at n-1, and we require it to be even.\n\n But note: we are not forced to break at the last character? We break only when we change the character? So the last segment is the one that started at the last break and goes to the end. We require it to be even.\n\n Therefore, the state at the end must have the last segment even.\n\n Now, the state dimension: i from 0 to n, and two characters, and two parities -> 4 states per index. Total states: 4*n, which is 4*200000 = 800000 per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total states over all test cases is 800000? which is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, meaning the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases is 200000. So we can do 4 * 200000 = 800000 states, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: we have 10000 test cases? but the total n is 200000, so the average n is 20. So worst-case we have 10000 test cases each of length 20 -> 10000 * 4 * 20 = 800000 states? which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must be careful: we are iterating for each index and for each state we do 2 possibilities? Actually, for each state (c, p) we consider two choices for the next character: same as c or different? But if we choose different, we require p==0. So:\n\n   For each state (c, p) at index i:\n        Option 1: set to c -> update state (c, (p+1)%2) with cost = (0 if s[i]==c else 1)\n        Option 2: set to d (the other character) -> only if p==0, then update state (d, 1) with cost = (0 if s[i]==d else 1)\n\n But note: at the beginning, we have two states: (0,1) and (1,1). Then we iterate.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   dp[0][0][1] = 0 if s[0]=='0' else 1\n   dp[0][1][1] = 0 if s[0]=='1' else 1\n\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        for c in [0,1]:\n            for p in [0,1]:\n                if dp[i][c][p] is not INF:\n                    # Option 1: set to c (same as current segment)\n                    cost1 = 0 if s[i]==str(c) else 1\n                    new_p1 = (p+1) % 2\n                    # update dp[i+1][c][new_p1] = min( dp[i+1][c][new_p1], dp[i][c][p] + cost1 )\n\n                    # Option 2: set to d (the other character) -> only if p==0\n                    d = 1-c\n                    cost2 = 0 if s[i]==str(d) else 1\n                    if p == 0:\n                        # we break the current segment (which is even) and start a new segment of d with length 1 -> parity=1\n                        # update state (d, 1)\n                        # ...\n\n   Then at the end: min( dp[n][0][0], dp[n][1][0] )\n\n But note: we are using 0 and 1 for the characters. We have to convert the string s: s[i] is either '0' or '1'. We can represent c as 0 or 1, and then convert to character: str(c) -> but that gives '0' for 0 and '1' for 1? \n\n However, we can also use: \n        cost1 = 0 if (s[i]=='0' and c==0) or (s[i]=='1' and c==1) else 1\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute: \n        same = 1 if s[i]==str(c) else 0 -> then cost1 = 0 if same else 1.\n\n But note: we can also use integers: if we represent the character as 0 and 1, then we can do:\n        cost1 = 0 if (s[i] == c) ... but wait, s[i] is a character, not an integer.\n\n We can convert the string to integers? or we can represent the state c as a character? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        c_char = '0' if c==0 else '1'\n        cost1 = 0 if s[i]==c_char else 1\n\n But that is a bit heavy. We can convert the entire string to integers? \n\n Since the total n is 200000, we can do:\n\n        s_arr = [1 if ch=='1' else 0 for ch in s]\n\n Then we can use integers.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do that.\n\n But we have 10000 test cases? and the total n is 200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 10000, but the average n is 20. So converting each string to an array of integers: 20 per test case * 10000 = 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid converting the entire string? We can do:\n\n        cost1 = 0 if (c==0 and s[i]=='0') or (c==1 and s[i]=='1') else 1\n\n But that is also acceptable.\n\n However, we are going to do 4 * n per test case? and n is the length of the string. The total n over test cases is 200000, so total operations 4*200000 = 800000, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: we have two options per state? and we have 4 states per index? so 8 operations per index? 8 * 200000 = 1.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        s = input().strip()\n        # We'll use dp[0] and dp[1] for the two characters? and we'll use a 2x2 array: dp[i][c][p] for the state at index i (0-indexed, we are processing the i-th character) and then we update for i+1.\n\n        # We'll use a 2D array: dp[c][p] for the current index.

Actually, we can always form a valid partition by changing the entire string? \n\n However, the problem always has a solution? because we can change every character arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, we output ans.\n\n Let's test with the example: \n   Example 1: \"000\" -> we want to break it? \n        We can change it to \"000\" -> then we have one segment of length 3 (odd) -> invalid? \n        But we can break it? How? \n        We can change the middle to '1': then we get \"010\", which has three segments: \"0\",\"1\",\"0\" -> each length 1 (odd) -> invalid.\n        We can change the first two to '1': then we get \"110\", which has two segments: \"11\" (even) and \"0\" (odd) -> invalid.\n        We can change the last two to '1': then we get \"011\", which has two segments: \"0\" (odd) and \"11\" (even) -> invalid.\n        We can change the first and last: \"101\" -> three segments of length 1 -> invalid.\n\n        How about changing two characters: \n            Change the first and the second: \"100\" -> segments: \"1\",\"00\" -> 1 (odd) and 2 (even) -> invalid.\n            Change the first and the third: \"101\" -> invalid.\n            Change the second and the third: \"011\" -> invalid.\n\n        How about changing all three? \n            \"111\" -> one segment of length 3 -> invalid.\n\n        How about changing to \"1100\": but wait, the string is \"000\", so we have three characters.\n\n        Actually, we must have an even-length segment. The entire string is of length 3, which is odd. We cannot partition it into segments of even length? because the sum of even numbers must be even? 3 is odd -> impossible? \n\n        But wait: the problem says: \"divide s into contiguous non-empty subsegments\" and \"minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" and then the condition that each segment has even length. \n\n        However, the entire string is of length 3, which is odd. How can we partition it into segments of even length? The sum of even numbers must be even, but 3 is odd -> impossible? \n\n        But note: we are allowed to change the string arbitrarily. We can change the entire string to \"0000\"? but the string is fixed to length 3.\n\n        Actually, we must partition the entire string. The segments must be contiguous and non-empty. The condition: each segment has even length. The entire string length is 3, which is odd. It is impossible to partition an odd-length string into segments of even length? \n\n        Therefore, the problem states that n is even. So the entire string length is even. \n\n        The input specification: \"n (2<=n<=200000) \u2014 the length of s, it is guaranteed that n is even.\"\n\n        So we don't have to worry about odd-length strings.\n\n        Therefore, the example \"000\" is of length 3? but wait, the problem says n is even. So we don't have such example.\n\n        Example: n=2: \"00\" -> we can leave it as one segment: even -> cost=0? \n                 \"01\" -> we can break it? \n                    If we break: we have two segments: \"0\" and \"1\", each of length 1 -> odd -> invalid.\n                    How about not break? then we have one segment? but the segment would be \"01\", which is not of the same character? so we cannot have one segment? \n\n        Actually, the natural partition: \n            \"01\": the minimal partition is two segments: \"0\" and \"1\". \n            But each segment has length 1 -> odd -> invalid.\n\n        How to fix? \n            We can change the first character to '1': then we get \"11\" -> one segment: even -> cost=1.\n            Or change the second to '0': then \"00\" -> one segment: even -> cost=1.\n            Or change the first to '1' and the second to '0': then \"10\" -> two segments: \"1\" and \"0\", each odd -> invalid? \n            Or change both to '0': then \"00\" -> one segment: even -> cost=2? not minimal.\n\n        So minimal cost is 1.\n\n        Let's run the DP for \"01\", n=2.\n\n        Step0: i=0, s[0]='0'\n            dp0[0][1] = 0   # if we set to 0: cost0=0 -> state (0,1)\n            dp0[1][1] = 1   # if we set to 1: cost=1 -> state (1,1)\n\n        Step1: i=1, s[1]='1'\n            For state (0,1): \n                Option1: set to 0 -> cost1 = 0? no, because s[1] is '1' and we set to 0 -> cost1=1.\n                         new_p1 = (1+1)%2 = 0 -> state (0,0): update new_dp[0][0] = min(inf, 0+1)=1.\n                Option2: set to 1 (the other) -> and since p=1 (which is not 0) -> skip? \n            For state (1,1):\n                Option1: set to 1 -> cost1=0? because s[1]=='1', so cost1=0 -> new_p1=(1+1)%2=0 -> state (1,0): new_dp[1][0]=min(inf, 1+0)=1.\n                Option2: set to 0 -> and p=1 -> skip.\n\n            Then at the end: min(new_dp[0][0], new_dp[1][0]) = min(1,1)=1.\n\n        So it returns 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: \"00\", n=2:\n            Step0: i0: \n                state (0,1): cost0=0\n                state (1,1): cost0=1\n            Step1: i1: s[1]='0'\n                state (0,1): \n                    Option1: set to 0 -> cost1=0 -> new_p1= (1+1)%2=0 -> state (0,0): 0+0=0.\n                    Option2: set to 1 -> and p=1 -> skip.\n                state (1,1):\n                    Option1: set to 1 -> cost1=1 (because s[1] is '0') -> new_p1=0 -> state (1,0): 1+1=2.\n                    Option2: set to 0 -> and p=1 -> skip.\n                Then min(0,2)=0.\n\n        Example: \"10\", n=2: \n            Step0: i0: \n                state (0,1): cost0=1 (because we set to 0: s[0]=='1' -> cost=1)\n                state (1,1): cost0=0\n            Step1: i1: s[1]=='0'\n                state (0,1): \n                    Option1: set to 0 -> cost1=0 -> new_p1=0 -> state (0,0): 1+0=1.\n                    Option2: set to 1 -> skip (because p=1, not 0)\n                state (1,1):\n                    Option1: set to 1 -> cost1=1 -> new_p1=0 -> state (1,0): 0+1=1.\n                    Option2: set to 0 -> skip.\n                Then min(1,1)=1.\n\n        Example: \"1111\", n=4: \n            Step0: i0: \n                state0: (0,1): cost=1\n                state1: (1,1): cost=0\n            Step1: i1: s[1]='1'\n                state (0,1):\n                    Option1: set to 0 -> cost=1 -> new_p1= (1+1)%2=0 -> state (0,0): 1+1=2.\n                    Option2: set to 1 -> and p=1 -> skip?

Then we take min( dp[0][0], dp[1][0] ) at the end.\n\n            At step3 (which is the last character, i=3) we have updated the state for the next index? Actually, we are updating for the state after processing the third character (index3). \n\n            Then we have:\n                state (0,0) at step4? -> no, we are at step3 (which is the state after processing the third character, which is the last). \n\n            How do we get state (0,0) at step4? \n\n            Actually, we are updating for the next character: we are at index i (0-indexed) and we update for i+1. So after processing the last character (i=n-1) we have the state at index n.\n\n            Therefore, we have:\n\n                dp0 at index0 -> state at index0 (one character processed)\n                then we update for index1 -> state at index1 (two characters processed)\n                then for index2 -> state at index2 (three characters processed) -> but wait, we have n=4, so we need to process index0,1,2,3.\n\n            We do:\n\n                i=0: state for index0 -> one char\n                i=1: update for index1 (second char) -> state for two chars\n                i=2: update for index2 (third char) -> state for three chars\n                i=3: update for index3 (fourth char) -> state for four chars.\n\n            Then we take min( dp[0][0], dp[1][0] ) at the state after processing the fourth char.\n\n            So for \"0000\": \n                Step0: i0: state (0,1):0, (1,1):1.\n                Step1: i1: \n                    from (0,1): \n                         Option1: set to 0 -> cost=0 -> state (0,0):0.\n                    from (1,1): \n                         Option1: set to 1 -> cost=1 -> state (1,0):1+1=2.\n                Step2: i2: \n                    state (0,0): \n                         Option1: set to 0 -> cost=0 -> state (0,1):0.\n                         Option2: set to 1 -> allowed (p=0) -> cost=1 -> state (1,1):0+1=1.\n                    state (1,0): \n                         Option1: set to 1 -> cost=1 -> state (1,1):2+1=3.\n                         Option2: set to 0 -> allowed -> cost=0 -> state (0,1):2+0=2.\n                Step3: i3: \n                    state (0,1): \n                         Option1: set to 0 -> cost=0 -> state (0,0): min(0 from 0, 2 from 2) -> 0? \n                         Option2: set to 1 -> skip (p=1) \n                    state (1,1): \n                         Option1: set to 1 -> cost=1 -> state (1,0): min(1+1=2, 3+1=4) -> 2? \n                Then at the end: min( state (0,0)=0, state (1,0)=2 ) -> 0.\n\n            So it returns 0.\n\n        Example: \"00000000\" -> 0.\n\n        Example: \"01\", n=2: we did and got 1.\n\n        Example: \"10\", n=2: we got 1.\n\n        Example: \"1110011000\" (n=10) -> the example says it is not good initially. The example says the answer is 3? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following. Change s_3, s_6 and s_7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", it can be divided into \"11\" and \"00000000\", which lengths are 2 and 8 respectively. There are other ways to operate 3 times to make s good\"\n\n        So the example \"1110011000\" -> becomes \"1100000000\" -> cost=3.\n\n        How does our DP do?\n\n        We'll run for \"1110011000\", n=10.\n\n        We are not going to do by hand, but we trust the DP.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and n=10 is small.\n\n        But we can code it and test? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note: the example \"1110011000\" -> the answer is 3.\n\n        We'll run the DP for \"1110011000\":\n\n        We'll write a small program to test.\n\n        But we are to output the code for the function? \n\n        However, the problem says: we are to complete the function func(s) that is provided.\n\n        The provided function:\n\n            def func(s):\n                curr=s[0]\n                c=0\n                count=0\n                for i in s:\n                    if i==curr:\n                        c+=1\n                    elif c%2==0:\n                        c=1\n                        curr=i\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        This function is incomplete. \n\n        How does this function work? \n\n        It seems to be a greedy: \n            curr: the current segment's character\n            c: the current length of the segment (in terms of consecutive same characters? but note: we are allowed to change)\n\n        But the function does not use the operation? \n\n        Actually, the function is incomplete. \n\n        The problem says: we are to complete the function.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and the missing part is in the else block.\n\n        How about we use the greedy approach?\n\n        Alternate greedy solution:\n\n        We traverse the string and group consecutive same characters. But we are allowed to change. \n\n        We note: \n          We want the entire string to be partitioned into segments of even length. \n          We can break a run of consecutive same characters arbitrarily? \n\n        Insight: \n          We can break a run of consecutive same characters of length L into segments of even length. How many changes are needed? \n          Note: we can change a character to break the run? \n\n          Actually, we can break a run of consecutive same characters by changing a character to the opposite, which breaks the run into two. But then the two new runs must be of even length? \n\n          However, we can break multiple times? \n\n          How many breaks are needed for a run of length L? \n            We want to partition the run into segments of even length. \n            The entire run is of the same character. \n            We can break at positions that are even? \n\n          But note: we can change a character to break the run. Each break requires one change? \n\n          Actually, if we change a character, we break the run at that position? \n\n          Example: run of 1: \n            We need to change it? because we cannot have a segment of length 1 (odd). \n            How? We can change it to the opposite? then we break the run? but then we have two segments: one on the left and one on the right? \n            But if we change the only character, then we break the run? but then we have two segments: the left is empty and the right is empty? \n\n          Actually, we are in the middle of the string? \n\n          Alternate: \n            We can merge adjacent runs? \n\n          Known solution for a similar problem: \n            We can use a greedy: \n                Let ans = 0\n                Traverse the string and group consecutive same characters. \n                Then for each group, if the length is even, then we can leave it as one segment? \n                If the length is odd, then we can break it by changing one character at the end? and then merge with the next group? \n\n          Example: \n            \"000\": \n                Group1: '0' with length 3 -> odd.\n                We can change the last character to '1', then we break the group: \n                    becomes \"001\" -> then we have two groups: \"00\" (even) and \"1\" (odd) -> not fixed.\n                Then we change the last character of the next group? \n\n          Actually, we can break the run of 3 by changing the last character to the next run's character? then we merge the last character with the next run? \n\n          How? \n            \"000\" -> if we change the last character to the next run's character, then we break the run at the last character? and the next run gets one more character? \n\n          Example: \"000111\" -> \n            Group1: '0' length=3, Group2: '1' length=3.\n            We change the last character of the first run to '1': then we get \"00111\" -> groups: \"00\" (even) and \"111\" (odd) -> then we change the last character of the second run to ... but there is no next run? \n\n          How about we break the first run: change the last character to '1', then we have:\n                \"00111\" -> groups: \"00\" (even) and \"111\" (odd). \n            Then we break the second run: change the last character to ... but we are at the end? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the first run by changing the middle? \n            \"000\" -> change the second to '1': then we get \"010\" -> groups: \"0\", \"1\", \"0\" -> each length 1 -> odd -> not fixed.\n\n          Known solution from known problems: \n            We can do: \n                ans = 0\n                i = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    j = i\n                    while j < n and s[j]==s[i]:\n                        j += 1\n                    L = j - i\n                    # Now we have a run of length L\n                    # We can break this run into segments of even length? \n                    # How many changes? \n                    # We can break the run at every even position? \n                    # But note: we can break by changing one character to the opposite, which will break the run and also merge with the next run? \n                    # Actually, we can break the run by changing a character to the opposite, which will split the run and also the next run (if any) will be merged with the new character? \n\n                    # Instead, we can use: \n                    #   We break the run at positions that are even? \n                    #   But we are allowed to break multiple times? \n\n                    # Actually, we can break the run of length L into segments of even length by making (L - number_of_segments) changes? \n                    # But note: we can also change a character to the opposite and then it becomes a new run of length 1? \n\n                    # Alternate known solution: \n                    #   We can use a greedy that traverses and whenever we have an odd-length run, we break it by changing the next character to the opposite? and then skip the next character? \n\n                    # Example: \n                    #   \"000\": \n                    #       We are at the first run: '0', length=3 (odd). We change the next character (which is the first character of the next run) to the opposite? but there is no next run? \n                    #   But we are in the same run? \n\n                    # Known solution from a Codeforces problem (1393C) is not exactly the same.\n\n          Actually, there is a known solution for this problem (which is Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) B1): \n            We can do:\n\n                ans = 0\n                i = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    j = i\n                    while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                        j += 1\n                    L = j - i\n                    if L % 2 == 1:\n                        # we need to break\n                        # we change the last character of this run to the next run's character?

but wait, the next character is '0', we change it to '1'? \n                Then the string becomes \"1111011000\" -> then we set i=4.\n            Then at i=4: run of '0'? but now at index3 we have '1', so the run at index3 is '1'? \n                Actually, we changed index3 to '1', so the string is \"1111011000\"\n                Then the next run: \n                    i=4: '0' -> run from index4 to index5: \"01\" -> not the same? \n                Actually, we have: \n                    index0: '1'\n                    index1: '1'\n                    index2: '1'\n                    index3: '1'  (changed)\n                    index4: '0'\n                    index5: '1'\n                    index6: '1'\n                    index7: '0'\n                    index8: '0'\n                    index9: '0'\n\n                So at i=4: \n                    run of '0'? only one '0' at index4 -> L=1 (odd) -> then we change the next character (at index5) to '0'? \n                    Then the string becomes \"1111001000\", and we set i=6.\n                Then at i=6: \n                    run of '1'? at index5 we changed to '0', so at index6: '0'? \n                    Actually, index5 is '0', index6 is '1'? \n                    So at i=6: run of '1' from index6 to index7? -> no, index6='1', index7='0' -> L=1 (odd) -> change the next character (index7) to '1'? \n                    Then we set i=8.\n                Then at i=8: run of '0' from index8 to index9: L=2 (even) -> no change.\n                Total cost=3.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But why does this work? \n            We are essentially: \n              For a run of odd length, we change the first character of the next run to the current run's character, and then skip that character (so we start the next run at the character after the changed character).\n\n          How does this affect the next run? \n            The next run originally starts at j (the end of the current run). We change s[j] to the current run's character, so the current run becomes even (because we extend it by one) and then the next run starts at j+1, but the character at j+1 is the same as the next run's character? \n            But wait, we changed s[j] to the current run's character, so the next run is now from j+1 to ...? \n\n          However, the next run might be broken? because the character at j is now different from the next run's character? \n\n          But note: the next run originally was a run of a different character. We changed s[j] to the current run's character, so the next run is still starting at j+1 with the same character as before? \n\n          And we skip the next run's first character? no, we skip the entire next run? no, we only skip the character at j (which we changed) and then start the next run at j+1.\n\n          But then the next run is shorter by one? \n\n          However, we don't care about the next run's length? we will process it separately.\n\n          But note: we are not processing the next run in the same while loop? we set i = j+1, so we start the next run at j+1.\n\n          But what if the next run is only one character? then we will process it as a run of length 1 (odd) and then change the next next run? \n\n          This greedy might work.\n\n          But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and this greedy is O(n) per test case.\n\n          We can implement this greedy in the function func(s):\n\n            def func(s):\n                n = len(s)\n                i = 0\n                ans = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    j = i\n                    while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                        j += 1\n                    L = j - i\n                    if L % 2 == 0:\n                        i = j\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        if j < n:\n                            ans += 1\n                            i = j+1   # skip the next character\n                        else:\n                            ans += 1\n                            i = j   # or break\n                return ans\n\n          But wait, in the else branch when j==n, we do ans+=1 and then i=j -> break.\n\n          Test with \"0\": n=1 -> but n is even, so we don't have this.\n\n          Test with \"01\": \n            i=0: run of '0': L=1 (odd) -> then j=1 (which is <n, n=2) -> ans=1, then i=2 -> done. -> returns 1.\n          Test with \"00\": \n            i=0: run of '0': L=2 (even) -> i=2 -> done. -> returns 0.\n          Test with \"000\": # but n=3 is not allowed, skip.\n          Test with \"000111\": \n            i=0: run of '0': L=3 (odd) -> ans=1, i=4.\n            i=4: run of '1': from index4 to index5: L=2 (even) -> done. -> returns 1.\n          But the example \"000111\" we expected cost=1? but the example \"1110011000\" cost=3.\n\n          However, the example \"000111\" is not the same as the provided example.\n\n          But the provided example \"1110011000\" we did and got 3.\n\n          But wait, the example \"000111\" has length 6, and we got 1.\n\n          Is there a solution with 1 change for \"000111\"? \n            Change the last character of the first run (at index2) to '1': then we get \"001111\" -> \n                segments: \n                    \"00\" (even) and \"1111\" (even) -> valid.\n            cost=1.\n\n          So it is correct.\n\n          But the example in the problem: \n            \"1110011000\" -> change to \"1100000000\": cost=3.\n\n          How many changes in our greedy? 3.\n\n          Therefore, we can use this greedy.\n\n          However, note: the function provided in program2.py is:\n\n            def func(s):\n                curr=s[0]\n                c=0\n                count=0\n                for i in s:\n                    if i==curr:\n                        c+=1\n                    elif c%2==0:\n                        c=1\n                        curr=i\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          This function is iterating character by character. \n\n          How can we incorporate the greedy? \n\n          The greedy groups consecutive same characters. But this function is not grouping, it is iterating.\n\n          We can simulate the grouping? \n\n          The variable 'curr' is the current run's character.\n          'c' is the current count.\n\n          When we see a different character, we check if the current run's length is even? \n            if even, then we start a new run with the new character.\n          else (odd), then we do something.\n\n          In the else branch (when we see a different character and the current run is odd), we can do:\n\n            We change the current character to 'curr'? then we extend the current run? \n            But then the current run becomes even? because we are adding one to an odd run -> even.\n\n            Then we set the current run's character to the opposite of 'curr'? because the next run should be different? \n\n          But note: we are changing the current character to 'curr', so the run is extended. Then the next character should be the opposite of 'curr'? \n\n          However, the next character might be the same as 'curr'? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            In the else branch (when we see a different character and the current run is odd):\n                count += 1   # because we change this character to 'curr'\n                # then we extend the current run: c becomes c+1 -> which is even? \n                # then we break the run here? and then the next run should start with the opposite of 'curr'? \n                # but we are at the character that we changed to 'curr', so the next run should start with the opposite? \n                # so we set curr = the opposite of the original 'curr'? \n                # but wait, the next character might be the same as the original next character? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            In the else branch:\n                count += 1\n                # we change the current character to the current run's character, so the current run becomes even.\n                # then we set the current run's character to the opposite? because the next run should be the opposite? \n                # and we reset c to 0? because we are starting a new run? but we just extended the current run to even, and then we break? \n\n          But note: after changing, the current run is extended by one, so it becomes even. Then we break the run at this character? \n\n          However, the next character is the one after the current character? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            In the else branch:\n                count += 1\n                # we change the current character to the current run's character, so the current run becomes even.\n                # then we break the run at this character? \n                # and then we start a new run with the opposite character? \n                # but the current character is now the same as the current run, so we don't want to include it in the next run? \n\n          How about we set the current run as finished (even) and then the next run starts at the next character? \n\n          But the next character is the one we are currently processing? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            In the else branch:\n                count += 1\n                # we change the current character to the current run's character, so the current run becomes even (c+1 is even? because c was odd, so c+1 is even) \n                # then we break the run at the previous character? and then the current character (which we changed) is now the start of a new run? \n                # but wait, we changed it to the current run's character, so it is the same as the current run? \n\n          This is messy.\n\n          Alternatively, we can simulate the greedy with a while loop? but the function is iterating with a for loop.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            def func(s):\n                n = len(s)\n                i = 0\n                count = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    j = i\n                    while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                        j += 1\n                    L = j - i\n                    if L % 2 == 0:\n                        i = j\n                    else:\n                        if j < n:\n                            count += 1\n                            i = j+1\n                        else:\n                            count += 1\n                            i = j\n                return count\n\n          But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and this while loop is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so it is acceptable.\n\n          However, the provided function is a for loop. We are not allowed to change the for loop to a while loop? \n\n          The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          The missing block is in the else branch.\n\n          We must use the provided structure.\n\n          How to incorporate in the for loop?\n\n          We are iterating with a for loop over i in s.\n\n          We have:\n            curr: the current run's character.\n            c: the current count of the run.\n\n          When we see a character i that is not equal to curr, and the current run's count c is even, then we start a new run: set curr to i and c=1.\n\n          When we see a character i that is not equal to curr, and the current run's count c is odd, then we are in the else branch.\n\n          In the else branch, we want to change the current character to curr? then we extend the current run to even? \n          But then what? \n            After changing, the current run becomes even. Then we break the run at this character? \n            But the next character should be the opposite of curr? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            count += 1   # because we change this character to curr\n            # then the current run becomes even: c+1 is even? \n            # then we break the run at this character? \n            # and then we start a new run with the opposite character? \n            # but the current character is now curr, so the next run should start with the opposite of curr? \n\n          However, the next character might be the same as the current character we are about to set? \n\n          We can set:\n            curr = the opposite of the original curr?   # because the next run should be the opposite of the current run (which is the original curr) \n            c = 0   # reset the count for the new run? \n            # but we haven't processed the current character? \n\n          But note: we changed the current character to the original curr, and then we break the run. Then the next run starts at the next character? \n\n          However, the current character is now the same as the previous run, so we don't want to include it in the next run? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            In the else branch:\n                count += 1\n                # change the current character to the current run's character (curr), so the current run becomes even: c+1 (which is even) \n                # then we break the run at the previous character? and then the current character is now the last character of the current run? \n                # and then we start a new run at the next character? \n                # but the current character is now curr, and the next character is the next in the string? \n                # we set c = 0 and then we set curr to the opposite of the current run's character? \n                # and then we continue to the next character? \n\n          But then we haven't processed the current character in the new run? \n\n          Alternatively, we can skip the current character for the new run? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            In the else branch:\n                count += 1\n                # change the current character to curr, then the current run becomes even.\n                # then we start a new run with the opposite of curr, and we set c=0, and then we do not add the current character to the new run? \n                # because we changed it to curr, so it is not the new run's character? \n                curr = '1' if curr=='0' else '0'\n                c = 0\n                # and then we do not add the current character to the new run? \n                # then the next character will be processed as the first character of the new run? \n\n          But the current character is not processed in the new run? \n\n          Example: \"01\", and we are at the '1' (i='1') and the current run is '0' with c=1 (odd). \n            We change the '1' to '0', so the string becomes \"00\", and then we set curr='1' and c=0.\n            Then we move to the next character? but there is no next character.\n\n          Then the current run of '0' has length 2 (even) and then we have a new run of '1' of length 0? \n          But the entire string is \"00\", which is one run of '0' (even) -> valid.\n\n          But the new run of '1' is of length 0, which we ignore.\n\n          Example: \"000111\": \n            We'll simulate:\n\n            s = \"000111\"\n            curr = '0'\n            c = 0\n            count = 0\n\n            i='0': same as curr -> c=1.\n            i='0': same as curr -> c=2.\n            i='0': same as curr -> c=3.\n            i='1': different. \n                c=3 (odd) -> else branch.\n                count=1.\n                change this '1' to '0' -> so we have \"0000\" so far? \n                then set curr = '1' (opposite of '0')\n                c = 0   # reset\n            i='1': now curr='1', and c=0 -> then we set c=1? \n                But wait, we are at the fourth character (index3) and we changed it to '0', so the fourth character is '0', but we are now at the fifth character (index4) which is '1'. \n                So we see '1' and curr='1' -> c=1.\n            i='1': same -> c=2.\n\n            Then we are done.\n\n            The string becomes \"000011\" -> \n                segments: \"0000\" (even) and \"11\" (even) -> valid.\n\n            cost=1.\n\n          But wait, we changed only one character? the example \"000111\" becomes \"000011\", which is valid.\n\n          However, the example in the problem \"1110011000\" becomes:\n\n            s = \"1110011000\"\n            We'll do:\n\n            curr = '1'\n            c=0, count=0\n\n            i0: '1' -> c=1.\n            i1: '1' -> c=2.\n            i2: '1' -> c=3.\n            i3: '0' -> different, and c=3 (odd) -> else branch.\n                count=1\n                change this '0' to '1' -> so we have \"1111\"\n                set curr='0', c=0.\n            i4: '0' -> now curr='0', so same -> c=1.\n            i5: '1' -> different, and c=1 (odd) -> else branch.\n                count=2\n                change this '1' to '0' -> \n                set curr='1', c=0.\n            i6: '1' -> same as curr='1' -> c=1.\n            i7: '0' -> different, and c=1 (odd) -> else branch.\n                count=3\n                change this '0' to '1'\n                set curr='0', c=0.\n            i8: '0' -> same -> c=1.\n            i9: '0' -> same -> c=2.\n\n            Then the string becomes: \"1111001000\" with the changes? \n                We changed index3 to '1', index5 to '0', index7 to '1'\n                So: \n                    index0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:0,6:1,7:1,8:0,9:0 -> \n                    \"1111001100\" -> wait, index5 is changed to '0', so at index5 we have '0', and index6 is '1', index7 changed to '1', so index7 is '1', then index8='0', index9='0'\n                    -> \"1111001100\" -> \n                    segments: \n                        \"1111\" (even), \"00\" (even), \"11\" (even), \"00\" (even) -> valid.\n\n            cost=3.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, in the else branch, we do:\n\n            count += 1\n            # change the current character to the current run's character (curr) -> but we don't actually change the string, we only care about the count.\n            # then we set the current run's character to the opposite of what it was, and reset the count to 0? \n            # but note: we are not actually changing the string for the future? we are only using the current run's state.\n\n          However, after changing, the current character becomes the same as the current run, so we extend the current run to even? and then we start a new run with the opposite character? \n\n          But we are not including the current character in the new run? \n\n          Why reset count to 0? \n\n          Because we are starting a new run, and the new run has not seen any character yet? \n\n          But the current character we just changed is not of the new run? it is the last character of the current run? \n\n          So for the new run, we start at the next character.\n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            else:\n                count += 1\n                curr = '1' if curr=='0' else '0'\n                c = 0\n\n          But note: after this, we are at the current character, and we have reset the count to 0, and changed the current run's character to the opposite. \n          Then the next character will be processed with the new curr and c=0.\n\n          However, we are in the for loop: we are at a specific character. We have processed this character by changing it to the old curr, and then we reset the state for the next character.\n\n          But we are not including this character in the new run? \n\n          That is correct: this character is changed to the old curr, so it is part of the old run (which is now closed) and the new run starts at the next character.\n\n          Therefore, we do not add to c for this character? \n\n          But the for loop will move to the next character.\n\n          So the code for the else branch is:\n\n            count += 1\n            curr = '1' if curr=='0' else '0'\n            c = 0\n\n          But note: after resetting c to 0, when we see the next character, we will do:\n\n            if i (the next character) == curr: then c=1.\n            else: then we check c%2? which is 0 -> then we start a new run with the new character.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, what if we are at the last character and we do the else branch? \n            Example: \"01\", n=2: \n                i0: '0' -> c=1.\n                i1: '1' -> different and c=1 (odd) -> else branch.\n                    count=1\n                    curr = '1' -> becomes '0'? because we flip? \n                    c=0\n                Then we are done.\n\n            The string becomes \"00\" (because we changed the last character to '0')? \n                segments: \"00\" (even) -> valid.\n\n          But what if we have \"03\" with n=3? not allowed.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the function as:\n\n            def func(s):\n                curr=s[0]\n                c=0\n                count=0\n                for i in s:\n                    if i==curr:\n                        c+=1\n                    elif c%2==0:\n                        c=1\n                        curr=i\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        count += 1\n                        curr = '1' if curr=='0' else '0'\n                        c = 0   # reset for the new run, which will start at the next character\n                # But what if the last run is odd? \n                # After the for loop, we have a run of length c. \n                # If c is odd, then we need to change one more character? \n                if c % 2 == 1:\n                    count += 1\n                return count\n\n          But wait, in the example \"000\", n=3 (which is not allowed) we would do:\n            i0: '0' -> c=1.\n            i1: '0' -> c=2.\n            i2: '0' -> c=3.\n            Then after the loop: c=3 (odd) -> count +=1 -> total=1.\n\n          But the problem says n is even, so we don't have to worry? \n\n          However, what if the last run is odd? \n            Example: \"01\", n=2: \n                After the loop: \n                    The last run: after the else branch, we set c=0, and then we are done. \n                    Then we check: c"
