We can swap the b in the first array with an a in the second array -> [a,a,c] and [b,b,c] -> 3 ops\n        Then swap the c in the first array with an a in the third array -> [a,a,a] -> 4 ops. So 4 operations. Therefore, the formula holds. But note: we can do better? Step1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n    Step2: swap the b in the first array with the a in the second array -> [a,a,c] and [b,b,c] -> 2 ops\n    Step3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [a,a,c], [a,a,c], [b,b,c] -> 3 ops\n    Step4: swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? -> [a,a,a] and [b,b,c] and [c,a,c] -> 4 ops. But we have [a,a,a] at the first array. However, we did 4 operations. So the minimal number is 4. Therefore, the answer for a test case is: \n      Let m = max frequency of any element in the array. If m == n: 0\n      Else: \n          k = ceil(n/m) - 1   [the minimal k such that (k+1)*m >= n]\n          ans = k + (n - m)\n\n  But note: k = ceil(n/m) - 1 = (n + m - 1) // m - 1? Actually, ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, so k = (n-1)//m. Alternatively, we can compute k as the smallest integer such that (k+1)*m >= n -> k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n  How to compute ceil(n/m)? k = (n + m - 1) // m - 1   -> but note: \n          (n + m - 1) // m is ceil(n/m) for integers? Example: n=6, m=2 -> (6+2-1)//2 = 7//2=3 -> k=3-1=2 -> then ans=2+4=6 -> correct.\n          n=3, m=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> k=2-1=1 -> ans=1 +1=2 -> correct. n=3, m=1 -> (3+1-1)//1=3//1=3 -> k=3-1=2 -> ans=2+2=4 -> correct. Therefore, we can write:\n\n      if m == n:\n          ans = 0\n      else: k = (n + m - 1) // m - 1\n          ans = k + (n - m)\n\n  But note: the problem says the array elements can be negative?

Let k = ceil((n - m0) / m0) Then (n - m0) / m0 = n/m0 - 1, so ceil(n/m0 - 1) = ceil(n/m0) - 1? \n          But ceil(n/m0 - 1) is not necessarily ceil(n/m0)-1: \n              n=6, m0=2: (6-2)/2 = 2 -> ceil(2)=2, then clones=2 -> then total operations = 2 + (6-2)=6 -> correct.\n              n=3, m0=1: (3-1)/1=2 -> ceil(2)=2, then clones=2, then ans=2+2=4 -> correct.\n              n=3, m0=2: (3-2)/2 = 0.5 -> ceil(0.5)=1, then clones=1, then ans=1+1=2 -> correct. Therefore, clones = ceil((n - m0) / m0) = (n - m0 + m0 - 1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0   ??? ceil((n-m0)/m0) = (n - m0 + m0 - 1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0? Example: n=6, m0=2: (6-1)//2 = 5//2=2 -> correct. n=3, m0=1: (3-1)//1 = 2//1=2 -> correct.\n          n=3, m0=2: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct. So we can do:\n\n          clones = (n - m0 - 1) // m0 + 1   # because ceil(a) = (a-1)//1 + 1? But wait: ceil(a) for a = (n-m0)/m0 = (n-m0+m0-1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0? Actually, ceil(a) = (a + denominator - 1) // denominator, but here a = (n-m0)/m0, so denominator is 1? Alternatively, we know: \n          clones = (n - 1) // m0   # but wait: (n-1)//m0 for n=6, m0=2: 5//2=2 -> correct. But note: (n-1)//m0 = floor((n-1)/m0) = k such that k < = ( n-1)/m0 < k+1. But we want ceil(n/m0) - 1 = floor((n-1)/m0) ? ceil(n/m0) = floor((n+m0-1)/m0)\n          then ceil(n/m0)-1 = floor((n+m0-1)/m0) - 1.\n\n      Is floor((n-1)/m0) = floor((n+m0-1)/m0) - 1?\n          Let me test: n=6, m0=2: \n              floor((6-1)/2)=floor(5/2)=2. floor((6+2-1)/2)=floor(7/2)=3, then 3-1=2 -> equal.\n          n=3, m0=2: floor((3-1)/2)=floor(2/2)=1. floor((3+2-1)/2)=floor(4/2)=2, then 2-1=1 -> equal. Therefore, clones = (n-1) // m0. But wait: for n=3, m0=3: \n          clones = (3-1)//3 = 2//3 = 0 -> then ans = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct. And for n=4, m0=3: \n          clones = (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1, then ans = 1 + (4-3)=2. How: \n              Start: [x,x,x,y] (m0=3)\n              Operation1: clone -> arrays: [x,x,x,y] and [x,x,x,y] -> 1 op. Then swap: swap the y in the first array with an x in the second array -> [x,x,x,x] and [x,x,x,y] -> 2 ops. So 2 operations. Therefore, we can do:\n\n          clones = (n-1) //",

But note: if m>=n, we don't enter the loop. So it's safe. Therefore, we can use this. However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, and this is a constant time operation.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array and then m queries. After each query (which updates an element), we must output the sum of awesomeness values over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of a contiguous subarray is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,2,2,3] has awesomeness 3 (blocks: [1], [2,2], [3]).\n\nThe initial code sets up the array with 1-indexing (by inserting a 0 at the beginning and appending a 0 at the end). Then there is a loop for i from 1 to n (the original array) that we must complete.\n\nThe idea is to note that the total awesomeness over all subarrays can be computed by considering the contribution of each adjacent pair.\n\nNote: The awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus the number of indices j in [l+1, r] such that a[j] != a[j-1]. Therefore, the total sum is:\n\n  Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices j in [l+1, r] with a[j] != a[j-1])]\n\n= (number of subarrays) * 1 + Sum_{j=2}^{n} [ (number of subarrays that include the adjacent pair (j-1, j) and for which j is in the subarray and j-1 is the left boundary or to the left) ] * I(a[j] != a[j-1])\n\nBut note: the adjacent pair (j-1, j) is included in a subarray [l, r] if and only if l <= j-1 and r >= j.\n\nThe number of such subarrays is (j-1) * (n - j + 1). \n\nTherefore, the total sum can be written as:\n\n  total = (n*(n+1))//2   [because there are n*(n+1)//2 subarrays, each contributing 1] \n          + Sum_{j=2}^{n} [ (j-1) * (n - j + 1) * I(a[j] != a[j-1]) ]\n\nHowever, note that the problem also has an update mechanism. The provided code already does:\n\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i-1)\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i\n\nand then updates a[i] and then adds similar terms.\n\nBut note: the adjacent pairs that involve the updated element are (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). So we subtract the contributions of these two pairs (if they were contributing) and then add the new contributions.\n\nHowever, the initial loop for i in range(1, n+1) is intended to initialize the total contribution from adjacent pairs. But note that the adjacent pairs we consider are for indices (1,2), (2,3), ... (n-1, n). So we should initialize `ans` (which will represent the total contribution from adjacent pairs) by:\n\n  for j in range(2, n+1):   # j from 2 to n: adjacent pair (j-1, j)\n      ans += (a[j] != a[j-1]) * (j-1) * (n - j + 1)\n\nBut note: the array a has been extended to have a[0] and a[n+1] as 0. We are only concerned with adjacent pairs from 1 to n (so pairs (1,2), (2,3), ... (n-1, n)). However, the initial array a[1..n] is given.\n\nBut the initial code for the loop is:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe cannot use j in that loop? Actually, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We are at index i. But note: the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is only defined for i>=2.\n      # Similarly, we can do nothing for i=1? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the adjacent pairs are from index 2 to n. So we can do:\n\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(2, n+1):\n      if a[i] != a[i-1]:\n          ans += (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n\nBut the problem says: the initial array is given and then we have queries. The provided code already has a while loop for the queries.\n\nHowever, the initial code has:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nand then uses `ans` in the queries.\n\nSo we must initialize `ans` in that loop. But note: the loop runs for i from 1 to n. We can consider the adjacent pairs that start at i? Actually, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We are going to consider the adjacent pair (i, i+1) for i from 1 to n-1? \n      # But the problem has two adjacent pairs for each element: left and right? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the adjacent pairs into two parts: the one to the left (i-1, i) and the one to the right (i, i+1). However, the update part subtracts both.\n\nBut note: the initial `ans` variable is set to 0. Then we are going to add the contributions of all adjacent pairs. We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We are going to add the contribution of the adjacent pair (i, i+1) for i from 1 to n? \n      # But note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is only defined for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nActually, the update part subtracts:\n  (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)   [for the pair (i-1, i)]\n  (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i              [for the pair (i, i+1)]   [because (n - (i+1) + 1) = n - i]\n\nSo we should initialize `ans` by the sum of contributions for every adjacent pair (i, i+1) for i from 1 to n-1? But note: the update part subtracts the contributions of the two adjacent pairs that involve the updated element. So the initial `ans` must be the total contribution of all adjacent pairs.\n\nTherefore, we can initialize `ans` by:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):   # i from 1 to n-1: adjacent pair (i, i+1)\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)   # because for the pair (i, i+1): the number of subarrays that include this pair is i * (n - i) [because l can be any from 1 to i, and r can be any from i+1 to n]\n\nBut note: the update part uses the same formula: for the left adjacent pair (i-1, i) the contribution is (i-1) * (n - i + 1) and for the right adjacent pair (i, i+1) the contribution is i * (n - i).\n\nSo we should initialize `ans` by:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):   # i from 1 to n-1: adjacent pair (i, i+1)\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut the loop in the code is from 1 to n (inclusive). We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We can consider the adjacent pair (i, i+1) only for i from 1 to n-1.\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the array a has been extended: a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. So a[1] to a[n] are the original. We are only concerned with pairs (i, i+1) for i in [1, n-1].\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the for loop for program1.py is:\n\n  if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n      ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the update part subtracts the left adjacent pair (i-1, i) and the right adjacent pair (i, i+1). The left adjacent pair (i-1, i) is stored at index i? Actually, the left adjacent pair for the updated element at index i is (i-1, i) and the right is (i, i+1). The update part subtracts the contributions of these two pairs (if they were active) and then after updating the element, it adds the new contributions.\n\nSo the initialization must account for every adjacent pair in the initial array.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i? Actually, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is between the element at i and i+1. The contribution of that pair is i * (n - i) because the left part can be chosen in i ways (any starting index from 1 to i) and the right part in (n-i) ways (any ending index from i+1 to n).\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut wait: the update part for the left adjacent pair (i-1, i) uses (i-1) * (n - i + 1). Why? \n  The adjacent pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1 and i. The number of subarrays that include this pair: \n      l must be in [1, i-1] and r must be in [i, n] -> so (i-1) choices for l (from 1 to i-1) and (n - i + 1) choices for r (from i to n).\n\nSimilarly, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is at index i and i+1: \n      l must be in [1, i] and r must be in [i+1, n] -> so i choices for l and (n - i) choices for r.\n\nTherefore, the initialization for the adjacent pairs should be:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):   # for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) for i in [1, n-1]\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut the loop in the code is from 1 to n (inclusive). So we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut the problem says: the loop is for i in range(1, n+1). We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nAlternatively, we can break the loop to run only to n-1? But the problem says: \"Complete the code\" and the loop is already written as for i in range(1, n+1). So we must use that loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py in the for loop is:\n\n    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n        ans += i * (n - i)\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given an array. We can do two operations:\n  1. Clone an existing array (so we get one more copy).\n  2. Swap two elements from any two copies (any positions).\n\nWe want the minimal number of operations to obtain at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\nNote: We start with one copy.\n\nThe operations: \n  Operation 1: clone (cost 1 op) -> we get one more copy, but initially we have one copy. After k cloning operations, we have k+1 copies.\n  Operation 2: swap (cost 1 op) -> we can swap any two elements from any two arrays (or same array) at any positions.\n\nWe need to get one copy that has all elements equal.\n\nIdea: \n  We can use the following strategy:\n    - We are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can gather all occurrences of a particular value in one array? \n    - But note: we can only swap two elements at a time, and we can use multiple arrays to help.\n\nHowever, note the note in the problem: \n  Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> \n      Step1: clone -> two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n      Then swap: for example, swap the element at position 2 (which is 1) in the first array with the element at position 5 (which is 0) in the second array? \n        But the example does: \n          After clone: two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n          Then swap: \n            First array: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> swapped the element at position 2 (originally 1) with the element at position 2 of the second array? Actually, the example underlines: \n            [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> so they swapped the 1 at index1 (0-indexed) in the first array with a 0 from somewhere? \n\nBut note: the example then creates a copy of the first array (so now three arrays) and then swaps again.\n\nThe minimal operations: \n  We note that if the array is already constant, then 0 operations.\n\nOtherwise, we can consider: \n  We want to have one array with all elements equal to, say, x. How many x's do we need? We need n x's.\n\nBut initially, we have one copy of the array. We can clone and then swap to bring more x's into one array.\n\nLet f(x) be the frequency of x in the original array. Then we start with f(x) copies of x. We need n - f(x) more copies of x.\n\nHow to get more copies? \n  We can clone the array to get more copies, and then swap. But note: when we swap, we can take an x from another array and put it in the target array, but then we lose an x in the other array? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n  We are going to use a process of \"concentrating\" a particular value x. \n\n  Operation plan:\n    Operation 1: clone the array. Now we have two copies. Then we can swap an element that is x in the second array with a non-x in the first array? Then the first array gains one x (if we put an x in it) and the second array loses one x.\n\n  But note: we can also swap non-x elements arbitrarily without affecting the count of x? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n    Let k be the number of x's we have in the entire multiset of arrays? Initially, we have f(x) x's. Each cloning operation gives us an additional f(x) x's? But wait, when we clone, we clone the entire array. So after k clones, we have (k+1) * f(x) x's in total.\n\n    We need at least n x's in one array. So we require (k+1) * f(x) >= n? \n\n    But note: we can also swap arbitrarily. The problem is that we can only swap two elements at a time, and we can use the other arrays as reservoirs. \n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n      Step 1: Clone the array until we have enough x's. How many clones? We need at least ceil(n / f(x)) - 1 clones? Because after k clones we have k+1 arrays, and total x's = (k+1)*f(x). We require (k+1)*f(x) >= n -> k >= ceil(n/f(x)) - 1.\n\n      Then, we need to swap to bring n x's into one array. How many swaps? We need to bring n - f(x) x's from the other arrays into the target array. But note: each swap can bring at most one x? \n\n      However, we can also swap within the arrays to free up x's? \n\n    Actually, the minimal operations might be:\n\n      Let m = max frequency of any element.\n\n      If m == n, then 0.\n\n      Otherwise, we can do:\n\n        Operation 1: clone the array. Now we have two arrays. Then we can swap to bring one more of the desired element into the first array? But note: we can do multiple swaps.\n\n      The example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (for 0 and 3). The answer was 6 operations? \n\n      How 6? \n        Operation 1: clone -> 1 op -> 2 arrays.\n        Then they did 2 swaps? (but the example says: \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array\" -> then they have [0,0,0,3,7,0] (which has 4 zeros) and [1,1,3,3,7,3] (which has 2 ones and 2 threes and 1 seven? and one zero missing?).\n\n        Actually, the example then does:\n          Operation 3: clone the first array -> now 3 arrays -> 2 clone operations so far.\n          Then they do two swaps: swapping the 3 and 7 in the first two copies of the first array? \n\n        Total operations: 1 (first clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (second clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n      But note: the problem says minimal number of operations.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n    We note that we can do:\n\n      Operation 1: clone -> 1 op, now we have two arrays.\n      Then we can swap two elements: for example, swap a non-x in the first array with an x in the second array. Then the first array gains one x and the second array loses one x. \n\n      So after one clone and one swap, we have increased the count of x in the first array by 1.\n\n      Then we can do again: clone the first array? and then swap? \n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let k = number of clones. Then we have k+1 arrays.\n\n      We can use the other k arrays as reservoirs. We can take x's from the other arrays to put into the first array. How many x's can we take? Initially, we have (k+1)*f(x) x's in total. We want the first array to have n x's. The other arrays can have at least one x? Actually, we don't care about the other arrays as long as we can take as many x's as we want.\n\n      The maximum we can put in the first array is the total number of x's: (k+1)*f(x). So we require (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n      How many swaps? We start with the first array having f(x) x's. We need n - f(x) more. Each swap can bring one x from another array? But note: we might have to free up x's that are stuck in the first array? Actually, we can swap a non-x in the first array with an x in another array. This increases the count of x in the first array by 1 and decreases the count in the other array by 1. So we need n - f(x) swaps.\n\n      But wait: we might not have to do one swap per x? Because we can also swap within the other arrays to free up x's? Actually, we don't need to: we can directly swap a non-x in the first array with an x in any other array.\n\n      Therefore, the total operations would be: \n          clones: k (so that (k+1)*f(x) >= n) \n          swaps: n - f(x)\n\n      Total operations: k + (n - f(x))\n\n      But note: we can choose x to be the element with the maximum frequency m. Then we minimize k: we choose the smallest k such that (k+1)*m >= n.\n\n      Then total operations = k + (n - m)\n\n      And k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n      Example: n=6, m=2 -> k = ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1 = 2? Then total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 6 -> matches.\n\n      Another example: n=3, m=2 -> k = ceil(3/2)-1 = ceil(1.5)-1 = 2-1 = 1, then operations = 1 + (3-2)=2.\n\n      How? \n        Start: [x, x, y] (m=2 for x)\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [x,x,y] and [x,x,y]\n        Operation2: swap the y in the first array with an x in the second array -> [x,x,x] and [x,y,y] -> done? So 2 operations.\n\n      But wait: the problem says we need to output the minimal number of operations. \n\n      However, is there a better way? \n        We could do:\n          Operation1: clone -> 1 op -> two arrays.\n          Operation2: swap the y in the first array with the x at the same position in the second array? Then we get [x,x,x] and [y,x,y] -> 2 operations.\n\n      So 2 operations.\n\n      Now, what if we try with m=1? \n        n=3, m=1 -> k = ceil(3/1)-1 = 3-1=2, then operations = 2 + (3-1)=4.\n\n      How?\n        Start: [a,b,c] (all distinct)\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a from the second array with b in the first array? -> [a,a,c] and [b,b,c] -> 2 ops\n        Now we don't have an array of all same. \n        Operation3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [a,a,c], [a,a,c], [b,b,c] -> 3 ops\n        Operation4: swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? -> but the third array is [b,b,c] -> we can swap the c in the first array with a b in the third array? Then first array becomes [a,a,b] -> not constant.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a in the first array with b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops: now we have two arrays: one with two b's and one with two a's? \n        Then Operation3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [b,b,c], [b,b,c], [a,a,c] -> 3 ops\n        Operation4: swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? -> [b,b,a] -> not constant.\n\n      Actually, we need to get one array with three same. \n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a in the first array with b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops\n        Operation3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [b,b,c], [b,b,c], [a,a,c] -> 3 ops\n        Operation4: swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? -> first array becomes [b,b,a] -> not constant.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a in the first array with c in the second array -> [c,b,c] and [a,b,a] -> 2 ops\n        Then we don't have an array of all same.\n\n      How about:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a in the first array with b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops\n        Operation3: swap the c in the first array with the a in the second array? -> [b,b,a] and [a,a,c] -> 3 ops: still not.\n\n      Actually, we need to do:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap a in the first array with b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops\n        Operation3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [b,b,c], [b,b,c], [a,a,c] -> 3 ops\n        Operation4: swap the c in the first array with the b in the third array? -> but the third array is [a,a,c] -> we can swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? Then first array becomes [b,b,a] -> not.\n\n      How about swapping the c in the first array with the a in the third array? Then first array becomes [b,b,a] and the third array becomes [a,a,c] -> [a,a,c] becomes [c,a,c]? \n\n      Actually, we can swap any two elements from any two arrays. So we can swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? Then:\n        First array: [b,b,a] \n        Third array: [c,a,c] -> not helpful.\n\n      We need to get one array to be [b,b,b]. How? \n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap the a in the first array with the b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops\n        Operation3: swap the c in the first array with the a in the second array? -> [b,b,a] and [a,c,c] -> 3 ops: not.\n\n      Alternate plan:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap the a in the first array with the c in the first array? -> but that doesn't help.\n\n      We note: we can swap within the same array? The problem says: \"Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions\". So we can swap within the same array.\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: in the first array, swap a and c -> [c,b,a] -> 2 ops: not helpful.\n\n      How about:\n\n        Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n        Operation2: swap the a in the first array with the b in the second array -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> 2 ops\n        Operation3: swap the c in the first array with the a in the second array? -> [b,b,a] and [a,c,c] -> 3 ops\n        Operation4: clone the second array -> 4 arrays: [b,b,a], [a,c,c], [a,c,c], [a,c,c] -> 4 ops\n        Operation5: swap the a in the first array with the c in the second array? -> [b,b,c] and [a,a,c] -> but we already had that.\n\n      This is getting messy.\n\n  Let me reexamine the formula: total operations = k + (n - m), where k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n  For n=3, m=1: k = ceil(3/1)-1 = 3-1=2, then total operations = 2 + (3-1)=4.\n\n  How to do in 4? \n    We want to form an array of three a's? But we only have one a initially.\n\n    Step1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op -> total a's: 2\n    Step2: clone again -> 3 arrays: [a,b,c], [a,b,c], [a,b,c] -> 2 ops -> total a's: 3\n    Step3: swap: we need to bring two more a's into one array. \n        We can swap the b in the first array with an a in the second array -> [a,a,c] and [b,b,c] -> 3 ops\n        Then swap the c in the first array with an a in the third array -> [a,a,a] -> 4 ops.\n\n    So 4 operations.\n\n  Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n  But note: we can do better? \n    Step1: clone -> 2 arrays: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c] -> 1 op\n    Step2: swap the b in the first array with the a in the second array -> [a,a,c] and [b,b,c] -> 2 ops\n    Step3: clone the first array -> 3 arrays: [a,a,c], [a,a,c], [b,b,c] -> 3 ops\n    Step4: swap the c in the first array with the a in the third array? -> [a,a,a] and [b,b,c] and [c,a,c] -> 4 ops.\n\n    But we have [a,a,a] at the first array.\n\n    However, we did 4 operations.\n\n  So the minimal number is 4.\n\n  Therefore, the answer for a test case is: \n      Let m = max frequency of any element in the array.\n      If m == n: 0\n      Else: \n          k = ceil(n/m) - 1   [the minimal k such that (k+1)*m >= n]\n          ans = k + (n - m)\n\n  But note: k = ceil(n/m) - 1 = (n + m - 1) // m - 1? \n      Actually, ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, so k = (n-1)//m.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute k as the smallest integer such that (k+1)*m >= n -> k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n  How to compute ceil(n/m)? \n      k = (n + m - 1) // m - 1   -> but note: \n          (n + m - 1) // m is ceil(n/m) for integers? \n          Example: n=6, m=2 -> (6+2-1)//2 = 7//2=3 -> k=3-1=2 -> then ans=2+4=6 -> correct.\n          n=3, m=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> k=2-1=1 -> ans=1+1=2 -> correct.\n          n=3, m=1 -> (3+1-1)//1=3//1=3 -> k=3-1=2 -> ans=2+2=4 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      if m == n:\n          ans = 0\n      else:\n          k = (n + m - 1) // m - 1\n          ans = k + (n - m)\n\n  But note: the problem says the array elements can be negative? But frequency is absolute.\n\n  However, the provided code in program2.py:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          print(ans)\n\n  We see that they initialize ans = n - m, and then they have a while loop: while (m < n): ... \n\n  This while loop is intended to account for the cloning operations? \n\n  How many times do we need to clone? k times. And each clone operation is one op. So we need to add k to ans.\n\n  But note: initially, ans = n - m (which is the number of swaps). Then we need to add k (the number of clones). \n\n  How to compute k? We can do:\n\n      k = 0\n      current = m   # total number of x's we have (initially m in one array, but after cloning we get more)\n      while current < n:\n          # we do a clone: then we get an additional m x's? \n          current += m   # because each clone gives m more x's? \n          k += 1\n          # and then we don't need to do anything else? \n\n      Then total operations = k + (n-m)\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is m < n. And we are going to break when current >= n.\n\n  However, the provided code has:\n\n      ans = n - m\n      while (m < n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n\n      k = 0\n      current = m\n      while current < n:\n          current += m\n          k += 1\n      ans += k\n\n  But note: we can do without an extra variable? \n\n  Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n      ans = n - m   # the swaps\n      clones = 0\n      total = m   # total x's we have (if we consider we are going to use the same element x, and we have m in the first array and then we get more by cloning)\n      while total < n:\n          clones += 1\n          total += m   # because we clone and get m more\n      ans += clones\n\n  But the provided code does not have extra variables. We can use:\n\n      ans = n - m\n      total = m\n      while total < n:\n          total *= 2   # wait, no: each clone adds m, not doubles.\n\n      Actually, we are adding m each time.\n\n  However, we can avoid an extra variable by reusing m? But note: we need m (the max frequency) for the entire test case.\n\n  The provided code has:\n\n      n=len(li:=li.split());   # note: this n is the length of the array? but wait: li.split() gives the array, so n = len(array) = the given n.\n\n      m = max(Counter(li).values())\n\n      ans = n - m\n\n      while (m < n):\n          # we do one clone: then we get m more x's? \n          m = m * 2   # but wait: that would be doubling the frequency? but actually we are adding m (the original frequency) each time? \n\n          But note: if we clone, we get one more array. Then the total number of x's becomes (number of arrays) * (original frequency). But the original frequency is fixed? \n\n      Actually, the variable m is the max frequency in the original array. We should not change it? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      clones = 0\n      current = m\n      while current < n:\n          clones += 1\n          current += m   # because we clone and get m more x's\n\n      ans += clones\n\n  But the provided code does not have the variable 'clones'. We can update ans in the loop:\n\n      while m < n:   # but note: m is fixed? we cannot change m? \n\n  We must not change m because we use it to compute the increments.\n\n  How about we use a temporary variable? But the code structure is:\n\n      n=len(li:=li.split());\n      m = max(Counter(li).values())\n      ans =n-m\n      while(m<n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n\n      temp = m\n      clones = 0\n      while temp < n:\n          clones += 1\n          temp += m\n      ans += clones\n\n  But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do a loop? \n\n  However, note: m might be 1, then we do about n/m = n iterations -> worst-case n=10^5 -> 10^5 iterations per test case? and the sum of n is 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 10000? but the sum of n is <= 10^5, so the total number of test cases is at most 10 (because 10 * 10000 = 100000) -> worst-case 10 test cases. And for each test case, the while loop runs at most n/m, which in the worst-case m=1 -> 10^5 per test case -> 10 * 10^5 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But we can do without an extra variable? \n\n  Alternatively, we can update ans and also update a variable that represents the current total x's? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      current = m   # current total x's we have (if we consider we have cloned enough to have this many x's in total)\n      while current < n:\n          # we do one clone: which costs one operation, so we add one to ans\n          ans += 1\n          current += m   # because we get m more x's\n\n  But note: the variable m is the original max frequency. We are not changing m.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in the while loop for program2.py is:\n\n      ans += 1\n      m += m0   # but wait, we cannot change m? because the condition is while (m < n) and we are updating m? \n\n  But the condition uses m, and we are updating m? \n\n  Actually, the condition is while (m < n). We are updating m? \n\n  We have two options:\n\n      Option 1: use a temporary variable (current) and update it, but we don't have that variable.\n\n      Option 2: update m? But note: the condition uses m and we are updating m. \n\n      We can do:\n\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2   # but wait: this is doubling, but we are adding the original m? \n\n      But that is not the same: we are adding the original m each time, not doubling.\n\n  Example: n=6, m0=2 (original m)\n      We want: \n          Step0: m=2 -> 2<6 -> ans=4 (from n-m=4) then we add one op (ans=5) and then m becomes 2+2=4? \n          Then 4<6 -> add one op (ans=6) and m becomes 4+2=6 -> break.\n\n      Then ans=6 -> correct.\n\n      How about n=3, m0=1:\n          Step0: m=1 -> 1<3 -> ans = (n-m=2) then add one op -> ans=3, then m=1+1=2.\n          Then 2<3 -> add one op -> ans=4, then m=2+1=3 -> break.\n\n      So we need to remember the original m? \n\n  But note: we are updating m, and the next time we add the original m? How do we remember the original m? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      base = m   # the original max frequency\n      current = m\n      while current < n:\n          current += base\n          ans += 1\n\n  But we don't have base? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      base = m\n      while m < n:\n          ans += 1\n          m += base   # but then we are updating m, and the condition uses the updated m.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But the problem: the variable m is defined as the max frequency. We are going to change it? \n\n  We can change it because after we compute the initial m, we don't need the original m for anything else.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in the while loop for program2.py is:\n\n      ans += 1\n      m += m   # but wait: we want to add the original base? but we just updated m.\n\n  Actually, we want to add the original base. But we have overwritten m.\n\n  How about:\n\n      base = m   # but we cannot do that because the code is only one line? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      ans += 1\n      m += base   # but we don't have base.\n\n  Alternatively, we can store the original m in a different variable? But the code structure is:\n\n      n=len(li:=li.split());\n      m = max(Counter(li).values())\n      ans =n-m\n      while(m<n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n\n      base = m   # before the loop? but the problem says: complete the code in the while loop.\n\n  But we are allowed to add code above the while loop? The problem says: \"Complete the code\" and the TODO is inside the while loop.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  We are missing the code inside the while loop. So we cannot change the code above.\n\n  Therefore, we must update m by adding the original base, but we don't have the base? \n\n  But note: the original base is stored in the variable m initially. Then we update m to m + base. But base is the original m. So we can do:\n\n      ans += 1\n      m = m + m0   # but we don't have m0.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      ans += 1\n      m += m   # this would double m? but we want to add the original base, which is the initial m at the start of the test case? \n\n  But the initial m is fixed. However, we are updating m. \n\n  Example: \n      Initially: m0 = 2 (for n=6)\n      First iteration: m = 2 -> then we do m = 2 + 2 = 4 -> then condition: 4<6 -> true, so we do again.\n      Second iteration: m = 4 + 2? but we don't have 2 anymore.\n\n  We see: we need to add the original base each time, not the current m.\n\n  How to remember the original base? We cannot. \n\n  Therefore, we must not update m in the way that we add the current m? \n\n  We note: the total after k clones is: m0 * (k+1). \n\n  We can break the loop when m0*(k+1) >= n. \n\n  But we don't have k? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      k = 0\n      while m0*(k+1) < n:\n          k += 1\n      ans += k\n\n  But we cannot do that in the while loop without an extra variable? \n\n  Actually, we can compute k without a loop? \n\n      k = ceil(n / m0) - 1\n\n  Then we can do:\n\n      ans += ceil(n/m0) - 1\n\n  But the problem says: the while loop condition is (m < n). We can break out of the loop by updating m? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      # We break the loop when m >= n, so we don't need to update m? \n\n      But the condition is while (m < n). We can break by not updating m? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      k = (n + m0 - 1) // m0 - 1\n      ans += k\n\n  But again, we don't have m0? \n\n  Therefore, we must store the original m? \n\n  Since the problem says we can only fill the missing block in the while loop, we have to do:\n\n      We change the condition to use a different variable? \n\n  But we are not allowed to change the condition? \n\n  The problem says: \"Complete the code\" and the code has:\n\n      while(m<n):\n\n  So we must use that condition and update m appropriately.\n\n  How about we do:\n\n      ans += 1\n      # We want to add the original base to m. But we don't have the base.\n\n  Another idea: we don't update m at all? Then the loop would run infinitely.\n\n  We must update m to eventually break the loop.\n\n  How about we update m to be the total number of x's we have after the next clone? \n\n      total_x = m + base   # but we don't have base.\n\n  But note: the base is the original max frequency. We can store it in a variable? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      base = m   # but we cannot do that inside the loop? because then every time we set base to the current m? \n\n  We can do before the while loop? \n\n  But the problem says: only the missing code in the while loop.\n\n  Therefore, we must restructure the code? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the original base is the value of m at the beginning of the test case. We can save it at the beginning? \n\n  But the code above the while loop is:\n\n      n=len(li:=li.split());\n      m = max(Counter(li).values())\n      ans =n-m\n      while(m<n):\n\n  We can change that to:\n\n      n=len(li:=li.split());\n      m0 = max(Counter(li).values())\n      m = m0\n      ans = n - m0\n      while m < n:\n          ans += 1\n          m += m0\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the TODO is inside the while loop. \n\n  However, the problem also says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are missing the entire block for the test case? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Complete the code in the while loop\".\n\n  Given the constraints, we decide to change the code above the while loop and also the while loop? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the missing code is only the TODO part? \n\n  We are in a dilemma.\n\n  Let me read the problem again: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program2.py, and then we are given the code with a TODO inside the while loop.\n\n  Therefore, we are only allowed to fill the TODO part.\n\n  How to do it without an extra variable? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      ans += 1\n      # We want to add the original base to m. But we don't have base.\n\n  But note: the original base is the value of m at the beginning of the test case. However, we have updated m in the loop? \n\n  Actually, we haven't updated m yet in the loop. The condition uses the current m, which initially is the base. Then in the first iteration, we can do:\n\n      base = m   # at the beginning of the loop body? \n\n  Then update m = m + base.\n\n  But then in the next iteration, we would set base to the new m? \n\n  We want base to be the original base.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot.\n\n  Another idea: we can break the problem into a different formula. \n\n      We know that the number of clones needed is k = ceil(n/m0) - 1.\n\n      And we can compute that without a loop? \n\n      But we are in a while loop that runs while (m < n). We can simulate the number of clones by:\n\n          clones = 0\n          current = m0\n          while current < n:\n              clones += 1\n              current += m0\n\n      Then we can do: ans += clones, and then break out of the loop? \n\n  But the while loop condition is (m < n). We can break out by setting m to a value >= n? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      clones = 0\n      current = m   # which is m0 at the first iteration\n      while current < n:\n          clones += 1\n          current += m   # but this m is the base, and it's fixed? \n      ans += clones\n      m = n   # to break the loop\n\n  But then we only do the while loop once.\n\n  Example: n=6, m0=2 -> \n      clones = 0, current=2 -> 2<6 -> clones=1, current=4 -> 4<6 -> clones=2, current=6 -> break inner loop.\n      Then ans = (6-2) + 2 = 6, and then set m=6 -> break the outer while loop.\n\n  But the problem is that we are not allowed to add an inner loop? The worst-case might be 10^5 iterations per test case, and the sum of n is 10^5, but the number of test cases is at most 10, so total operations 10 * 10^5 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem might have more test cases? But the input says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 10^5. And the number of test cases t <= 10000, but the sum of n <= 10^5, so the number of test cases is at most 10.\n\n  But the inner loop for one test case might run up to n/m0 which is at most 10^5 (if m0=1). And we have at most 10 test cases, so total inner loop iterations 10 * 10^5 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      # Inside the while loop:\n      clones = 0\n      current = m   # current total x's\n      while current < n:\n          clones += 1\n          current += m   # because each clone gives m (the base) more x's\n      ans += clones\n      m = n   # to break the outer loop\n\n  But note: the outer loop condition is (m < n). After we set m = n, we break.\n\n  However, we only want to do this once? Because the while loop will then break.\n\n  But the outer while loop is:\n\n      while (m < n):\n          # we do this block once\n\n  And then we set m = n, and then the next time the condition fails.\n\n  But what if the array has more than one test case? The while loop is inside a test case. The test case is processed in the for loop.\n\n  This will work.\n\n  But is there a better way? \n\n  We can do without the inner loop by direct computation:\n\n      clones = (n - m + m - 1) // m   # ceil((n-m)/m) ? \n      But note: we need to cover the deficit of n - m x's, and each clone gives m x's, so the number of clones needed is ceil((n - m) / m)? \n\n      But wait: after k clones, we have (k+1)*m0 >= n -> k >= ceil(n/m0) - 1.\n      The deficit in the target array is n - m0, but we are not only covering the deficit of the target array, we are increasing the total supply.\n\n      Actually, the number of clones is ceil((n - m0) / m0) ? \n          Let k = ceil((n - m0) / m0) \n          Then (n - m0) / m0 = n/m0 - 1, so ceil(n/m0 - 1) = ceil(n/m0) - 1? \n          But ceil(n/m0 - 1) is not necessarily ceil(n/m0)-1: \n              n=6, m0=2: (6-2)/2 = 2 -> ceil(2)=2, then clones=2 -> then total operations = 2 + (6-2)=6 -> correct.\n              n=3, m0=1: (3-1)/1=2 -> ceil(2)=2, then clones=2, then ans=2+2=4 -> correct.\n              n=3, m0=2: (3-2)/2 = 0.5 -> ceil(0.5)=1, then clones=1, then ans=1+1=2 -> correct.\n\n      Therefore, clones = ceil((n - m0) / m0) = (n - m0 + m0 - 1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0   ??? \n\n          ceil((n-m0)/m0) = (n - m0 + m0 - 1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0? \n          Example: n=6, m0=2: (6-1)//2 = 5//2=2 -> correct.\n          n=3, m0=1: (3-1)//1 = 2//1=2 -> correct.\n          n=3, m0=2: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          clones = (n - m0 - 1) // m0 + 1   # because ceil(a) = (a-1)//1 + 1? \n          But wait: ceil(a) for a = (n-m0)/m0 = (n-m0+m0-1) // m0 = (n-1) // m0? \n          Actually, ceil(a) = (a + denominator - 1) // denominator, but here a = (n-m0)/m0, so denominator is 1? \n\n      Alternatively, we know: \n          clones = (n - 1) // m0   # but wait: (n-1)//m0 for n=6, m0=2: 5//2=2 -> correct.\n          But note: (n-1)//m0 = floor((n-1)/m0) = k such that k <= (n-1)/m0 < k+1.\n\n      But we want ceil(n/m0) - 1 = floor((n-1)/m0) ? \n          ceil(n/m0) = floor((n+m0-1)/m0)\n          then ceil(n/m0)-1 = floor((n+m0-1)/m0) - 1.\n\n      Is floor((n-1)/m0) = floor((n+m0-1)/m0) - 1?\n          Let me test: n=6, m0=2: \n              floor((6-1)/2)=floor(5/2)=2.\n              floor((6+2-1)/2)=floor(7/2)=3, then 3-1=2 -> equal.\n          n=3, m0=2:\n              floor((3-1)/2)=floor(2/2)=1.\n              floor((3+2-1)/2)=floor(4/2)=2, then 2-1=1 -> equal.\n\n      Therefore, clones = (n-1) // m0.\n\n      But wait: for n=3, m0=3: \n          clones = (3-1)//3 = 2//3 = 0 -> then ans = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct.\n\n      And for n=4, m0=3: \n          clones = (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1, then ans = 1 + (4-3)=2.\n          How: \n              Start: [x,x,x,y] (m0=3)\n              Operation1: clone -> arrays: [x,x,x,y] and [x,x,x,y] -> 1 op.\n              Then swap: swap the y in the first array with an x in the second array -> [x,x,x,x] and [x,x,x,y] -> 2 ops.\n\n          So 2 operations.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          clones = (n-1) // m0   # where m0 is the original frequency.\n\n      Then ans = (n-m0) + clones.\n\n      But note: we are in the while loop and we have the current m (which is m0) and n.\n\n      However, we cannot do this without knowing m0? \n\n  Given the constraints, and that we are only allowed to fill the while loop, and that the while loop will run only once per test case (because we will break it), we can do:\n\n      # Since the while loop condition is m < n, and we haven't changed m, we do:\n      clones = (n-1) // m   # because m is the original base at this point\n      ans += clones\n      m = n   # to break the loop\n\n  But wait: what if the while loop condition is not satisfied? Then we wouldn't enter. But we are in the loop.\n\n  This will work.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the while loop is:\n\n      clones = (n-1) // m\n      ans += clones\n      m = n   # to break the loop\n      # break   # but setting m to n will break in the condition\n\n  But note: we only want to do this once. The while loop will then break.\n\n  However, we can also break explicitly:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But the problem says: the while loop condition is (m < n). If we break, then we break the loop. And we don't need to worry about the condition.\n\n  But what if we do not break? The next iteration would see m unchanged and (m<n) still true? \n\n  So we must break.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But is (n-1)//m always the number of clones? \n\n  We have established that it is.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  However, let me test with n=6, m=2: \n      (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> ans = (6-2) + 2 = 6 -> correct.\n\n  n=3, m=1: (3-1)//1 = 2//1=2 -> ans = (3-1)+2 = 4 -> correct.\n\n  n=3, m=2: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> ans = (3-2)+1=2 -> correct.\n\n  n=4, m=3: (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1 -> ans = (4-3)+1=2 -> correct.\n\n  But note: if m>=n, we don't enter the loop. So it's safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can use this.\n\n  However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, and this is a constant time operation.\n\n  So we output for program2.py:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But wait: what if there is a case where we might not want to break? \n\n  The break will exit the while loop. And we only need to do this calculation once.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, note that the while loop is designed to run multiple times? But our solution is to compute the entire number of clones in one shot.\n\n  Therefore, we break to avoid multiple iterations.\n\n  But the problem says: minimal number of operations. We are not simulating the process, we are using a formula.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But note: the problem says the array elements can be negative, but that doesn't affect the frequency count.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Summary:\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code in the for loop is:\n\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program2.py, the TODO is inside the while loop. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n  However, the problem says \"blocks\", so two lines are acceptable.\n\n  Now, we output in the specified JSON format.\n\n  Note: We must output the code exactly as it would appear in the program.\n\n  For program1.py, the code is:\n\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\n  For program2.py, the code is:\n\n      ans += (n-1) // m\n      break\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the variable 'n' is the length of the array, and 'm' is the max frequency.\n\n  We output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\", \"program2\": \"ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"}\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  And the format is a JSON string.\n\n  But note: the code for program1.py is in the for loop that runs from 1 to n+1. We must indent properly? The existing code has 4 spaces for the for loop body.\n\n  In the given program1.py, the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n  We'll output the code with 8 spaces of indentation? \n\n  But the problem doesn't specify the exact indentation level. However, the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n      for i in range(1, n + 1):\n          # TODO: Your code here \n\n  We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n          if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n              ans += i * (n - i)\n\n  But the first line is an if statement and the second is a statement. We need to indent the if by 8 spaces and the inner statement by 12? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n  Since the TODO is at the same level as the following lines in the while loop, which are indented by 4 spaces (relative to the for loop), we do:\n\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n              ans += i * (n - i)\n\n  But wait, the for loop body is one level of indentation (4 spaces). The if should be at 4 spaces and the inner statement at 8? \n\n  In the provided program1.py, the while loop body is:\n\n      ans -= (a[i] != a[i - 1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)\n      ans -= (a[i] != a[i + 1]) * (n - (i + 1) + 1) * i \n      a[i] = x \n      ans += (a[i] != a[i - 1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i + 1]) * (n - (i + 1) + 1) * i \n      print(ans + n * (n + 1) // 2)\n      m -= 1\n\n  which is at 4 spaces.\n\n  So for the for loop body, we should have 4 spaces for the if and 8 for the inner statement.\n\n  But the problem does not require us to output the entire program, only the missing code. So we output the two lines with the proper indentation as they would appear.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting a string.\n\n  We'll output:\n\n      program1: \"    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\"\n\n  But the initial for loop has 4 spaces for the body, so the if should be at 4 spaces (so we add 4 spaces) and the inner statement at 8 (so we add 8 spaces).\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem says \"exactly as it would appear\".\n\n  Given the ambiguity, and since the existing code in program1.py has 4 spaces per indent, we assume:\n\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          [4 spaces] if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          [8 spaces] ans += i * (n - i)\n\n  Similarly, for program2.py, the while loop body should be:\n\n      [4 spaces] ans += (n-1) // m\n      [4 spaces] break\n\n  But the existing while loop in program2.py has:\n\n      while(m<n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 4 spaces. We replace it with two lines at 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\"\n      program2: \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n\n  But wait, in program2.py, the while loop is:\n\n      while(m<n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with two lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  However, the problem says: the code for program2.py is:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          print(ans)\n\n  So the while loop body is at the same indentation level as the for loop body: 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the two lines we add should be at 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces, and the while loop is inside the for loop, so the while loop is at 4 spaces, and its body should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  But the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n  The problem says: the TODO is inside the while loop. In the given code, the while loop body is:\n\n      while(m<n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 8 spaces (because the while loop body is indented by 4, and the comment is indented by 4 more).\n\n  Therefore, we should output for program2.py:\n\n      \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n  But note: the next line after the break is at the same level as the while loop: 4 spaces? \n\n  We break and then the while loop ends, and then we do 'print(ans)' at 4 spaces.\n\n  So the break is the last thing in the while loop body.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\"\n      program2: \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n  But wait, in program1.py, the for loop body is at 4 spaces, and the if and the inner statement are at 4 and 8 respectively.\n\n  We'll output the string with the exact indentation.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but the existing code uses 4 per indent.\n\n  Final output:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\", \n        \"program2\": \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the while loop body is already at 4 spaces, so the body of the while loop should be indented by 8 spaces. The TODO is at 8 spaces. We replace it with two lines at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n  However, to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the context.\n\n  We write the JSON string.\n\n  Note: We must escape newlines as \\n.\n\n  Let me write the exact strings:\n\n      program1: \"    if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n        ans += i * (n - i)\"\n      program2: \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n  But wait, in program1.py, the for loop body is one level (4 spaces) and the if is at the same level, and the inner statement is one more level (4 more spaces). So 4 and 8.\n\n  In program2.py, the while loop body is one level (4 spaces) and the two statements should be at one more level (4 more spaces) -> 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n  We output the JSON."
