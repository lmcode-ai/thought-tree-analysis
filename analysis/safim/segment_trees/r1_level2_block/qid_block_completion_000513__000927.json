Alternatively, \n          Step1: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: \"WRB\"\n          Step2: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\" Then step3: we want the first cell to be B (ok) and the second to be R (ok) and the third to be R? We can stamp positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then the second becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\" It seems we cannot get \"BRR\". But wait: the problem says the stamp can be applied arbitrarily many times. How about:\n      Start: WWW\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 1 and 2: BR again -> \"BRW\" (same)\n      Step3: positions 1 and 2: RB -> \"RBW\"\n      Step4: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then we have: R, B, R -> \"RBR\"\n\n      Still not. Actually, we can do:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\"\n      Step3: positions 1 and 2: RB -> then we have: R, B, R -> \"RBR\"\n\n      Then step4: positions 2 and 3: RB -> then we have: R, R, B -> \"RRB\"\n\n      Then step5: positions 1 and 2: BR -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\" We are cycling.",

But we saw that \"BRR\" is not achievable? However, the editorial solution is:\n\n      t = int(input())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s = s.split('W')\n          bad = False\n          for part in s: if part == '':\n                  continue\n              if part.count('R')==0 or part.count('B')==0:\n                  bad = True\n                  break\n          print(\"NO\" if bad else \"YES\") And they say that the sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> valid, and the fifth: \"BRB\" -> valid, and the seventh: \"\" -> valid? The test cases from the problem:\n      Example test cases:\n        1: \"BRB\" -> valid? \n        2: \"BB\" -> invalid? 3: \"BBB\" -> invalid? 4: \"RR\" -> invalid? 5: \"BRB\" -> valid? 6: \"RBB\" -> valid? 7: \"W\" -> valid. But the problem states:\n      For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible -> so second: \"BB\", third: \"BBB\", fourth: \"RR\" -> all invalid. And the fifth: \"BRB\" -> valid, sixth: \"RBB\" -> valid, seventh: \"W\" (or empty) -> valid. Now, what about \"BRR\"? According to the solution: \n          part = \"BRR\": \n             count of 'R' = 2, count of 'B' = 1 -> both are present -> valid. But we couldn't find a way to form \"BRR\". However, we can form \"BRR\" by:\n      Step1: stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: \"WRB\" (if we start with three white: positions 1,2,3)\n      Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\", not \"BRR\". How about:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then we have: R, B, W -> \"RBW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: R, R, B -> \"RRB\"\n\n      Then we have \"RRB\", which is not \"BRR\". Alternatively, \n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> \"BRB\"\n      Step3: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> \"RRB\" -> then we have \"RRB\", which is not \"BRR\". But note: we can do:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> \"RBW\"\n      Step3: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> \"RBR\"\n      Step4: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> \"RBB\" -> not. How about a different approach for \"BRR\":\n      We want the first cell to be B, the second and third to be R.\n\n      Step1: cover positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, W -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: cover positions 2 and 3: set to RR? -> but we cannot.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the prices in descending order and build a prefix sum array `a` such that a[0]=0, a[1]=p0, a[2]=p0+p1, ... (for the sorted descending list).\n\nThe problem: For each query (x, y), we note that the customer must purchase at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase), the customer would choose to buy exactly x items (because buying more might not help since we only get the y cheapest free, and we can choose which items to buy). However, note that the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. Therefore, to maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest to be as expensive as possible. But note: we are allowed to choose any set of x items. So we can choose the x items that have the largest prices? But wait: the free items are the cheapest ones. So if we choose the x largest prices, then the cheapest ones in that set are the smallest of the large ones. However, we can also choose to leave out some very cheap items? Actually, we want the y cheapest in the set to be as expensive as possible.\n\nStrategy: \n- We sort the prices in descending order. Then, we consider: if we choose the top x items (the x most expensive), then the free items are the last y items in that set (which are the smallest in the set). The sum of these y items is the sum of the items from position (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending list? Actually, if we have the descending list: [v0, v1, ..., v_{x-1}], then the smallest y items are the last y: v_{x-y}, v_{x-y+1}, ..., v_{x-1}. But note: in the prefix sum array `a` we built, a[i] is the sum of the first i items (i.e., the top i items). Therefore:\n  total of the top x items = a[x] (since a[0]=0, a[1]=v0, a[2]=v0+v1, ...)\n  total of the top (x-y) items = a[x-y]\n  so the free value = a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut wait: is that correct? \nExample: n=5, prices = [1,2,3,5,5] (sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1])\nQuery: x=3, y=2 -> we choose 3 items: the best is [5,5,3] -> free: 5+3? But note: the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, the two cheapest in [5,5,3] are 3 and 5? But then the free value is 3+5=8? However, the example says 8.\n\nBut in our method: \na[0]=0\na[1]=5\na[2]=5+5=10\na[3]=10+3=13\na[4]=13+2=15\na[5]=15+1=16\n\nFor x=3, y=2: free value = a[3] - a[3-2] = a[3]-a[1] = 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\nAnother query: x=2, y=1 -> we choose two items: the best is two 5's -> free value=5.\nOur method: a[2]-a[2-1]=10-5=5 -> correct.\n\nAnother: x=5, y=3 -> free value = 1+2+3=6.\nOur method: a[5]-a[5-3]=16 - a[2]=16-10=6 -> correct.\n\nTherefore, for each query (x, y) we can compute: a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: our prefix array `a` is built for the entire sorted descending list. However, we have n items. The query x might be at most n, and we built `a` for indices 0..n.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py for the loop over queries is:\n  for each query (x, y):\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array `a` we built has length n+1 (from index 0 to n). And we have sorted the prices in descending order and built the prefix sums.\n\nHowever, note the code: \n  a = [0]\n  for x in sorted(map(int, input().split()))[::-1]: \n      a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nSo `a` is built for the descending list.\n\nBut note: the problem says the customer can choose any set of x items. We are assuming that the best set is the top x items. Why is that? \nBecause if we choose a set that does not include the top x items, then we are replacing one of the top x items with a cheaper one. Then the y cheapest in the set would be at most the same as before (if we replace a non-free item) or we might be including a cheaper item that then becomes one of the free ones, which would reduce the free value. Therefore, the optimal is to take the top x items.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n  for _ in range(q):\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the problem says \"print a single integer for each query\". However, the program is being run as \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\", meaning the output of program1 is piped to program2. But wait, program2 is a separate program that we also have to complete. However, the problem says that we are to output the missing code for both programs.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and in the format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the for-loop that processes the queries.\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must replace the TODO part. We can write:\n\n  for _ in [0]*q:\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nHowever, note: the array `a` is built for the entire list of n items. But what if the query has x that is greater than n? The problem states: 1<=x<=n, so x is at most n. And we built `a` for indices 0..n, so we are safe.\n\nBut note: the array `a` has n+1 elements (indices 0..n). So we can use x and x-y as indices. Also, x-y is at least 0 because y<=x.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n  x, y = map(int, input().split())\n  print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut we must do this for each query. So we write:\n\n  for _ in [0]*q:\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the existing code uses `[0]*q` to iterate q times.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a string s of length n.\n\nWe have to determine if we can form the string s (which consists of 'W', 'R', 'B') using the stamp operations. The stamp is 2 cells wide and can be applied as \"BR\", \"RB\", and can be applied multiple times to the same cell. The stamp must always cover two adjacent cells.\n\nImportant: the stamp operation always colors two adjacent cells at a time. Also, note that the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell, so the color of a cell can change over time.\n\nObservations:\n1. The stamp always covers two adjacent cells. Therefore, if there is an isolated non-white cell (i.e., a non-white cell that is adjacent only to white cells or at the boundary) then we must cover it with a stamp that also covers an adjacent cell. But note: we can cover the same cell multiple times.\n\n2. Note that the entire picture is initially white. The stamp always sets two adjacent cells to either (B,R) or (R,B). Therefore, the following are invariant?\n   - The entire picture must be partitioned into segments of non-white cells that are separated by white cells. And each contiguous non-white segment must have an even number of non-white cells? Actually, no: because we can stamp overlapping. However, note that the stamp is two cells. So the operations are reversible? \n\nAnother approach: \nWe note that the problem constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we need an efficient solution.\n\nKey idea: \n- White cells are like separators. We can split the string by 'W' and then check each contiguous non-white segment independently.\n\nFor a contiguous segment (without any white) of length L, what are the necessary conditions?\n- The segment must be of even length? Actually, no: because we can stamp overlapping. For example, we can form a segment of length 3: \n  Example: \"BRB\" -> \n      Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: \"WWBR\" (if we start with 4 white? but we have 3) -> actually the example in the note: \n        \"WWW\" -> stamp on last two: \"W RB\" -> then stamp on first two: \"BR RB\" -> then we have \"BRB\" (if we consider the last two as the last two, then the middle is overwritten?).\n\nBut note: the example in the problem: \n  \"WWW\" -> stamp on positions 2 and 3: becomes \"WRB\" (if we use RB) -> then stamp on positions 1 and 2: becomes \"BRB\" (if we use BR on the first two: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R, but then we have \"BRB\"). \n\nSo we can form a segment of length 3? \n\nBut wait: the example also says that a single non-white cell is impossible. So what is the difference?\n\nActually, the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. Therefore, we cannot change a single cell in isolation. So if we have a segment of length 1, it is impossible.\n\nMoreover, note that the stamp operation always sets two adjacent cells to two different colors (one red and one blue). Therefore, in any contiguous non-white segment, we must have at least one red and one blue? \n\nBut consider: \n  \"RR\" -> can we form? \n      We can do: \n        Start: WW -> we can stamp: either BR or RB. So we get either \"BR\" or \"RB\". \n        Then we stamp again on the same two: \n          If we have \"BR\", stamping again with BR would give: \n            First cell: originally B -> if we stamp with BR: the first cell becomes R? \n            But note: the stamp operation recolors both cells. So if we apply the same stamp again to the same two, we get:\n              For the first cell: originally B, then we stamp with BR: the stamp sets the first cell to B? Actually, no: the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we apply the stamp again, it will set the two cells to the two colors again. So if we have \"BR\" and we apply the BR stamp (which is the same as the first stamp) we get \"BR\" again? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells\". So if we apply the stamp to the same two cells twice, we get:\n  First stamp: sets to BR.\n  Second stamp: sets to BR again? Then we are back to BR? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a different rotation? \n  First stamp: BR -> then we apply the same two cells with RB: \n      Then the first cell: originally B -> becomes R? \n      The second cell: originally R -> becomes B? \n  So we get \"RB\". \n\nBut then we can change the two cells arbitrarily? \n\nActually, note that the stamp has two forms: BR and RB. And each application sets the two cells to one of these two patterns. Therefore, the two cells can be set to any of the two patterns arbitrarily many times. \n\nBut what if we have a segment of two? \n  We can have either \"BR\" or \"RB\". So we cannot have \"BB\" or \"RR\". \n\nTherefore, for a segment of two, we must have one blue and one red.\n\nWhat about a segment of three? \n  We can have \"BRB\", \"RBR\", \"BRR\", ...? \n  But note: the example: \n      \"BRB\": \n        Step1: stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> so we have W, R, B -> then stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have B, R, B -> which is \"BRB\" (if we consider the first two as B and R, then the last is B) -> so \"BRB\" is possible.\n\n  What about \"BBB\"? \n      We start with \"WWW\". \n      We can stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> now \"BRW\"\n      Then stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then the second cell becomes R (from R) to B? and the third becomes B? -> so we get: B, B, B? \n          But wait: the stamp on positions 2 and 3: \n            The second cell was R, and we apply RB: so the second cell becomes R? (because the stamp sets the two cells to R and B: the first of the two becomes R and the second becomes B? but then we have: \n                first cell: B, second cell: R (from the first stamp) -> then we stamp the second and third: \n                    The stamp RB: so the second cell becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then we have: B, R, B -> not BBB.\n\n      Alternatively: \n          First stamp: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Then stamp: positions 1 and 2 again: set to RB -> then the first cell becomes R, the second becomes B -> \"RBW\"\n          Then stamp: positions 1 and 2 again: set to BR -> then first becomes B, second becomes R -> \"BRW\" -> cycle.\n\n      How about stamping the same set twice? \n          First: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Then: positions 1 and 2: BR again -> then the first cell: B becomes B? (if we apply BR: the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R) -> same as before? \n\n      Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we apply the same stamp again, we get the same pattern. \n\n      How about using a different rotation on the same two? \n          First: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Then: RB on positions 1 and 2: then the first cell becomes R and the second becomes B -> \"RBW\"\n          Then: BR again: then first becomes B, second becomes R -> \"BRW\" -> cycle.\n\n      So we cannot get \"BBB\".\n\n  Therefore, for a segment of three, we cannot have all the same color.\n\nWhat is the invariant? \n  In any contiguous non-white segment, the pattern must be such that it is possible to assign the entire segment by overlapping stamps. \n\n  Note: the stamp operation is linear? Actually, we can model the problem as a system of linear equations over GF(2). \n\n  Alternatively, we can note:\n    - The entire segment must not be of a single color (unless the segment is of length 0).\n    - The segment must have at least one blue and one red.\n\n  But what about a segment of length 4? \n      Example: \"BBRR\": \n        We can do:\n          Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRWW\"\n          Step2: stamp on positions 3 and 4: set to BR -> \"BRBR\"\n          Then we have \"BRBR\", which is not \"BBRR\".\n\n        How about:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRWW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then the second cell (R) becomes R? (if we use RB: the first of the two becomes R and the second becomes B) -> so we have: B, R, B, W -> \"BRBW\"\n          Step3: positions 3 and 4: set to RB -> then we have: B, R, R, B -> \"BRRB\" -> not \"BBRR\".\n\n      How to get \"BBRR\"? \n        Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then we have: R, B, W, W -> \"RBWW\"\n        Step2: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, W, W -> \"BRWW\"\n        Step3: positions 3 and 4: set to RB -> then we have: B, R, R, B -> \"BRRB\" -> not \"BBRR\".\n\n      Alternatively, we can try to cover the entire segment at once? \n        We can do:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRWW\"\n          Step2: positions 1 and 2: BR again -> same? \n          Step3: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> then we have: B (from first cell), then the second cell: originally R -> becomes B, and the third becomes R -> \"BBRW\"\n          Step4: positions 3 and 4: set to BR -> then we have: \"BBR\" becomes \"BB\", and the last two: BR -> so \"BBBR\"? \n\n      It seems difficult.\n\n  Actually, note the following: \n      The problem states that the total length of all test cases is at most 10^5. So we can process each contiguous segment in linear time? \n\n  Known solution for a similar problem (from Codeforces Round #727 (Div. 2) problem B) is to split by white and then for each contiguous segment:\n      - If the segment is empty, skip.\n      - Otherwise, the segment must have at least one blue and one red. Also, the length of the segment must be at least 2? But we saw that a segment of length 1 is impossible. \n\n  However, the example \"BRB\" (length 3) is possible and has both colors. \n\n  Actually, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a contiguous segment (without white) are:\n      - The length must be at least 1? But we know length 1 is impossible -> so if we have a segment of length 1, we return impossible.\n      - The segment must not be all the same color? \n\n  But what about a segment of length 2: \"BB\" -> impossible? because we must have one blue and one red? -> so if we have \"BB\", that's impossible. Similarly, \"RR\" is impossible? \n\n  However, wait: we can form \"BR\" and \"RB\", but not \"BB\" or \"RR\". \n\n  For a segment of length 3: \n      We cannot form \"BBB\" or \"RRR\", but we can form \"BRB\", \"RBR\", etc.\n\n  For a segment of length 4: \n      We cannot form \"BBBB\", but we can form \"BBRR\"? \n\n  Actually, we can form \"BBRR\" by:\n      Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRWW\"\n      Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2 again but with RB: then we get \"RBW\" -> no, that doesn't work.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use overlapping:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRWW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: RB -> then the second cell (R) becomes R? (if we use RB: the first of the two is R and the second is B) -> so we have: B, R, B, W -> \"BRBW\"\n      Step3: positions 3 and 4: BR -> then we have: B, R, B, R -> \"BRBR\", which is not \"BBRR\".\n\n  How about:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRWW\"\n      Step2: positions 1 and 2: BR again -> same? \n      Step3: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then the second cell (R) becomes B? and the third becomes R -> so we have: B, B, R, W -> \"BBRW\"\n      Step4: positions 3 and 4: BR -> then we have: B, B, B, R -> \"BBBR\", which is not \"BBRR\".\n\n  It seems we cannot form \"BBRR\". \n\n  But note: the problem says the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. So we can change a cell multiple times. \n\n  How about modeling the color changes? \n      Let each cell be represented by a variable that can be toggled. \n      We assign: \n          R = 0, B = 1? (or vice versa) and then the stamp operation: \n          When we apply the stamp to positions i and i+1, we set:\n              cell_i = a, cell_{i+1} = 1-a   (if we use the pattern BR: then first is B=1, second is R=0 -> so we set: (1,0))\n              or \n              cell_i = 1-a, cell_{i+1} = a   (if we use the pattern RB: then first is R=0, second is B=1 -> so we set: (0,1))\n\n          But note: we can also think of the stamp as: \n              BR: (1,0)\n              RB: (0,1)\n\n          And when we apply the stamp again, we are doing an XOR? \n\n  Actually, we can consider the entire process as a system of equations. \n\n  Alternatively, note that the operations are reversible and the entire system is linear. \n\n  However, a simpler invariant: \n      The parity of the number of blues (or reds) in the entire segment? \n\n  But note: the entire segment is initially white (which we can consider as not counted). Then each stamp operation adds one blue and one red. Therefore, the total number of blues must equal the total number of reds? \n\n  But wait: we can stamp the same cell multiple times. \n      Example: two cells: \n          First stamp: BR -> one blue, one red.\n          Then stamp again on the same two: if we use BR again, we get BR again -> still one blue and one red.\n          If we use RB: then we get RB -> which is one red and one blue -> same counts.\n\n      But what if we stamp a cell an odd number of times? \n          Consider a cell that is covered by k stamps. Then its color is determined by the last stamp? \n\n      Actually, the stamp operation sets the two cells to specific colors. It does not toggle. \n\n  Therefore, the color of a cell is the color set by the last stamp that covers it. \n\n  But note: we can cover a cell multiple times, and the last stamp that covers it determines its color. \n\n  Therefore, we can achieve any coloring? \n\n  However, we have constraints: \n      - The stamp must cover two adjacent cells. \n      - The entire segment must be covered by contiguous stamps (with overlaps allowed).\n\n  Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems) is to split by white and then for each contiguous non-white segment:\n      - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return NO.\n      - Else, if the segment has only one color (only 'B' or only 'R'), then it's impossible -> return NO.\n\n  Why? \n      Because each stamp operation adds one blue and one red. Therefore, in the entire segment, we must have at least one blue and one red. \n\n  But note: we can cover a cell multiple times. However, even if we cover a cell multiple times, the entire segment must have at least one blue and one red? \n\n  Example: a segment of two: \n      We can only get \"BR\" or \"RB\", so we must have one blue and one red.\n\n  Example: a segment of three: \n      We can get \"BRB\", which has two blues and one red -> so we have both colors. \n      But we cannot get \"BBB\", which has only blue -> so that's impossible.\n\n  Therefore, the condition for a contiguous segment is:\n      - The segment must have at least two cells (so no isolated non-white).\n      - The segment must contain at least one 'B' and at least one 'R'.\n\n  But note: what if the segment is \"BRR\"? \n      It has one blue and two reds -> that's acceptable? \n      And we can form it? \n          Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: stamp on positions 2 and 3: RB -> then the second cell (R) becomes R? (if we use RB: the first of the two is R and the second is B) -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\", not \"BRR\".\n\n      How to get \"BRR\":\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then the second cell (R) becomes B? and the third becomes R -> so we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\", not \"BRR\".\n\n      Alternatively:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 1 and 2: RB -> then we get \"RBW\"\n          Step3: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then we have: R, B, R -> \"RBR\", not \"BRR\".\n\n      How about:\n          Step1: positions 2 and 3: BR -> then we have \"WBR\"\n          Step2: positions 1 and 2: RB -> then the first cell: W becomes R? and the second cell: W becomes B? -> but wait, the second cell was originally W and then we set it to B? and the first cell becomes R? -> then we have \"RB?\" -> \"RBR\" for the first two and the third is R? -> \"RBR\", not \"BRR\".\n\n      It seems we cannot get \"BRR\". \n\n  But wait: the example in the problem: \n      \"WWW\" -> stamp on last two: \"WRB\" -> then stamp on the first two: \"BRB\" -> then how to get \"BRR\"? \n      We can then stamp on the last two again? \n          The last two are \"RB\": if we stamp with BR: then the third cell becomes R? and the second becomes B? -> then we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\".\n\n      Or if we stamp the last two with RB: then we get: the second cell becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\".\n\n  So how to get \"BRR\"? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n      Start: WWW\n      Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2: BR again -> same? \n      Step3: stamp on positions 2 and 3: BR -> then the second cell (R) becomes B? and the third becomes R -> \"BBR\"\n\n      How about:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: RB -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\"\n          Step3: stamp on positions 2 and 3: BR -> then we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\"\n\n      Still not \"BRR\".\n\n  After checking known solutions for the problem (from Codeforces Round #727 (Div. 2), problem B: https://codeforces.com/contest/1539/problem/B), we see that the solution is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          s = input().strip()\n          parts = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for part in parts:\n              if len(part) == 0:\n                  continue\n              if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n  But wait, the example \"BRR\" would be split into the part \"BRR\", which has 'B' and 'R', so it would be valid? \n\n  However, we just saw that we cannot form \"BRR\". \n\n  But the problem note has:\n      For the fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> valid.\n      For the sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> valid? \n\n  The sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> \n      The example says: \"WWW\" -> stamp on last two: \"WRB\" -> then stamp on the last two again: ...? \n      Actually, the example says: \n          \"WWW\" -> stamp on last two: \"WRB\" -> then they say: becomes \"RBB\"? \n          How: \n            Step1: stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: W, R, B -> \"WRB\"\n            Step2: stamp on positions 2 and 3 again: set to BR -> then the second cell (R) becomes B? and the third (B) becomes R? -> then we have: W, B, R -> \"WBR\", not \"RBB\".\n\n      Alternatively, step2: set to RB again: then we have: W, R, B -> same.\n\n      How about:\n          Step1: stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> \"WRB\"\n          Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then the first cell (W) becomes R? and the second cell (R) becomes B? -> then we have: R, B, B -> \"RBB\". \n\n      So that works.\n\n  Therefore, the segment \"RBB\" is achievable. \n\n  Now, what about \"BRR\"? \n      We can do:\n          Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then we have: R, B, W -> \"RBW\"\n          Step3: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, W -> \"BRW\" -> cycle.\n\n      How about:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\"\n          Step3: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> then we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\"\n\n      How to get \"BRR\": \n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> then we have: B, B, R -> \"BBR\"\n\n      Then step3: we want the third cell to be R? but it is already R. Then we want the second cell to be R? but it is B. \n          We can stamp positions 2 and 3 again: set to RB -> then the second cell becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\"\n\n      How about:\n          Step1: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> then we have: \"WBR\"\n          Step2: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then we have: R, B, R -> \"RBR\"\n\n      Then step3: we want the third cell to be R? it is R.

Also, if there is a contiguous segment that has only red or only blue, then it is impossible. But note: a segment that has both colors is always possible, regardless of the arrangement.\"\n\n  Why is that? \n      Because we can always form any pattern that has at least one red and one blue in a contiguous segment? \n\n  But we saw that \"BRR\" is not achievable? \n\n  However, the editorial solution is:\n\n      t = int(input())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n          s = s.split('W')\n          bad = False\n          for part in s:\n              if part == '':\n                  continue\n              if part.count('R')==0 or part.count('B')==0:\n                  bad = True\n                  break\n          print(\"NO\" if bad else \"YES\")\n\n  And they say that the sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> valid, and the fifth: \"BRB\" -> valid, and the seventh: \"\" -> valid? \n\n  The test cases from the problem:\n      Example test cases:\n        1: \"BRB\" -> valid? \n        2: \"BB\" -> invalid? \n        3: \"BBB\" -> invalid? \n        4: \"RR\" -> invalid? \n        5: \"BRB\" -> valid? \n        6: \"RBB\" -> valid? \n        7: \"W\" -> valid.\n\n  But the problem states:\n      For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible -> so second: \"BB\", third: \"BBB\", fourth: \"RR\" -> all invalid.\n\n  And the fifth: \"BRB\" -> valid, sixth: \"RBB\" -> valid, seventh: \"W\" (or empty) -> valid.\n\n  Now, what about \"BRR\"? \n      According to the solution: \n          part = \"BRR\": \n             count of 'R' = 2, count of 'B' = 1 -> both are present -> valid.\n\n  But we couldn't find a way to form \"BRR\". \n\n  However, we can form \"BRR\" by:\n      Step1: stamp on positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: \"WRB\" (if we start with three white: positions 1,2,3)\n      Step2: stamp on positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\", not \"BRR\".\n\n  How about:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> then we have: R, B, W -> \"RBW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> then we have: R, R, B -> \"RRB\"\n\n      Then we have \"RRB\", which is not \"BRR\".\n\n  Alternatively, \n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> \"BRB\"\n      Step3: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> \"RRB\" -> then we have \"RRB\", which is not \"BRR\".\n\n  But note: we can do:\n      Step1: positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: positions 1 and 2: set to RB -> \"RBW\"\n      Step3: positions 2 and 3: set to BR -> \"RBR\"\n      Step4: positions 2 and 3: set to RB -> \"RBB\" -> not.\n\n  How about a different approach for \"BRR\":\n      We want the first cell to be B, the second and third to be R.\n\n      Step1: cover positions 1 and 2: set to BR -> then we have: B, R, W -> \"BRW\"\n      Step2: cover positions 2 and 3: set to RR? -> but we cannot. The stamp only gives BR or RB.\n\n      But note: we can cover positions 2 and 3 with RB: then we get: B, R, B -> \"BRB\"\n\n      Then if we cover positions 2 and 3 again with RB: then we get: B, R, B -> same.\n\n      How about covering positions 2 and 3 with BR: then we get: B, B, R -> \"BBR\"\n\n      Then if we cover positions 1 and 2 with BR: then we get: R, B, R -> \"RBR\"\n\n      Then if we cover positions 1 and 2 with RB: then we get: B, R, R -> \"BRR\" -> that's it!\n\n      So:\n          Step1: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"BRW\"\n          Step2: positions 2 and 3: BR -> \"BBR\"\n          Step3: positions 1 and 2: BR -> \"RBR\"   [because BR on \"BB\": the first B becomes B? -> no: the stamp sets the two cells to BR. So if we apply BR to \"BB\": \n                first cell: B -> set to B? (if we use BR: the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R) -> then we have: B, R, R -> \"BRR\" -> wait, that's what we want? \n\n          Actually, step3: we apply BR to positions 1 and 2 which are currently B and B. \n              The stamp sets them to BR: so the first cell becomes B? and the second becomes R? -> then we have: B, R, R -> \"BRR\".\n\n      So we did:\n          Step1: BR on (1,2): \"BRW\"\n          Step2: BR on (2,3): \"BBR\" -> because the second cell was R, then we set it to B? and the third to R -> so we have: B, B, R.\n          Step3: BR on (1,2): then we set the first cell to B? and the second cell to R? -> then we have: B, R, R -> \"BRR\".\n\n      But wait: step3: the second cell was B, and we set it to R -> so we have: first cell becomes B (from the stamp) and second becomes R -> then the third cell is still R -> \"BRR\".\n\n      Therefore, it is possible.\n\n  So the condition is: \n      For each contiguous non-white segment, we require:\n          - The segment must have at least one blue and at least one red.\n\n  Therefore, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n      We split the string by 'W' to get the contiguous non-white segments.\n      For each segment:\n          if the segment is empty, skip.\n          else, if the segment has only 'B's or only 'R's, then it's invalid -> set a flag and break.\n      Then output \"YES\" if all segments are valid, else \"NO\".\n\n  The existing code in program2.py:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  We note: \n      The input is read from stdin. The first two lines are the total test cases and then the first test case's n and then the string. The code [*open(0)] reads all lines. Then [2::2] takes every second line starting from index 2 (0-indexed), which are the strings of the test cases.\n\n      For each test case string s (which has a newline, so we do s[:-1] to remove it), we split by 'W' to get the segments.\n\n      Then we iterate over the segments (each segment is a string of non-white characters, or empty).\n\n      The variable `b` is initially 0. We want to set `b` to 1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n      Then the print: \n          'YNEOS'[b::2] \n          If b=0: then we take the substring starting at 0 with step 2: \"YES\" (because: \n              index0: 'Y', index2: 'S' -> but step2: [0::2] of \"YNEOS\" is \"Y\" then skip 'N' then 'E' then skip, then 'O' then skip, then 'S'? -> actually, it's \"YES\": \n                  indices: 0, 2, 4 -> 'Y', 'E', 'S' -> but that's \"YES\" only if we take 0 and 2? \n          Actually, the string is \"YNEOS\": \n              [0::2] -> take index0: 'Y', index2: 'E', index4: 'S' -> \"YES\"\n              [1::2] -> index1: 'N', index3: 'O' -> \"NO\"\n\n      So if b=0, we print \"YES\", if b=1, we print \"NO\".\n\n      Therefore, we set b=1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n  The missing code for the inner loop:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if i == '':   # skip empty\n              continue\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b = 1\n              break   # but note: we are in a for-loop, so we break out of the inner for-loop.\n\n  However, the problem says: the total length of all test cases <= 10^5, and we are breaking at the first invalid segment.\n\n  But note: the for-loop is over the segments of one test case. We want to check all segments of one test case? \n      Actually, we can break as soon as we find one invalid segment in the test case.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if i == '':\n              continue\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  But note: what if there are multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n  However, we can also break the inner loop and then the outer loop will move to the next test case? \n      The structure:\n          for s in ...:   # for each test case string\n              b = 0\n              for i in ...:   # for each segment in this test case\n                  if segment is invalid: \n                      b=1; break\n              print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the split by 'W' might create many segments, but the total length is the length of the string, which is n, and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if not i:   # empty string\n              continue\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      if i.strip() == '': continue   # but i won't have newline because we split the string without the newline.\n\n  But note: the split by 'W' on a string without newline: so i is a string of non-white characters or empty.\n\n  We can also write:\n\n      if len(i) > 0 and (i.count('R')==0 or i.count('B')==0):\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  But the condition: if the segment has no 'R' OR has no 'B'. \n\n  However, the condition: \n      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i \n      is equivalent to: if the segment has no 'R' OR no 'B'\n\n  But note: if the segment has no 'R' and no 'B', that is also caught. But that would be an empty segment? but we skip empty. \n\n  Actually, if the segment is non-empty, then it must have at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n  Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n  But note: what if the segment has both? then we don't set b=1.\n\n  So the code for program2.py is:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i == '': \n                  continue\n              if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b=1\n                  break\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  However, note: the split might include empty strings at the beginning or end? and we skip them.\n\n  This matches the known solution.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"        if i == '': \\n            continue\\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\\n            break\"}\n\n  But note: the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n      for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must replace the TODO part.

The existing code in program1.py has the for-loop without a body. We are to complete the body.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the for-loop over the segments has a TODO, and we complete the body.\n\n  But note: the program2.py code has:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to complete the body of this for-loop.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n  and for program2.py:\n\n      if i == '': \n          continue\n      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  But note: the program2.py code already has the for-loop and the variable `b` defined. We are to complete the body.\n\n  We output the code as a string in the JSON.\n\n  However, note: the program1.py code must be indented. Since the for-loop is at the same level as the previous lines, we indent by 4 spaces.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is two lines (with proper indentation) and a for-loop body.\n\n  We write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n      \"program2\": \"        if i == '':\\n            continue\\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n  But note: the existing for-loop in program2.py has the comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", and we are replacing that with the body. The body should be at the same indentation level as the for-loop? \n\n  The for-loop is:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to write the body of the for-loop. The body should be indented one level more than the for-loop. Since the for-loop is already at an indentation level (inside the outer for-loop), we add 4 more spaces for the body.\n\n  However, the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  We are to replace the TODO line with the body. But note: the TODO is on the same line as the for-loop. We can break it as:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          ...   # body\n\n  So the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for-loop, which we write as:\n\n      if i == '': \n          continue\n      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  And we indent each line by 8 spaces? because the for-loop is already indented by 4. But in the string we output, we will represent the indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n  In program2.py, the TODO is at the same line as the for-loop. We must write the body of the for-loop. The body should be indented relative to the for-loop.\n\n  In Python, the body of a for-loop is indented by 4 spaces relative to the for.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # existing line\n          if i == '':                # new line, indented 4 more\n              continue               # indented 8 more? \n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b=1\n              break\n\n  But note: the existing line in the given code for program2.py is:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the entire line? Actually, no. The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the block for the for-loop body.\n\n  Therefore, we output the block that goes inside the for-loop, which is:\n\n        if i == '':\n            continue\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n            b=1\n            break\n\n  And we indent each line by 8 spaces? because the for-loop is already at 4 spaces, and the body should be 4 more, so 8 in total? \n\n  But note: the existing code has:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  We are to replace the TODO line with:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # we keep this line\n              ... body ...              # and then the body\n\n  But the problem says: the TODO is in the for-loop line. We are to complete the body. So we do not change the for-loop line.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for-loop (which is the block that comes after the for-loop line).\n\n  We write the body as:\n\n        if i == '':\n            continue\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n            b=1\n            break\n\n  And we represent it as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we know that the for-loop body should be indented one level more than the for-loop.\n\n  Since the for-loop is at an indentation level of 4 (because it is inside the outer for-loop that is already indented), the body should be at 8.\n\n  But to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the code without extra indentation and let the existing for-loop line remain. We are only to output the body.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      for program2.py: \n          \"        if i == '':\\n            continue\\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n  But note: the first line of the body should be at the same level as the next line? \n\n  Actually, the body of the for-loop is a block. We write:\n\n          for i in ...:   # this line is already there\n              ... body ...\n\n  So the body should be indented by 4 more spaces. Since the for-loop line is at 8 spaces (because the outer for-loop is at 4, and then the inner for-loop is at 8), then the body should be at 12? \n\n  Let me count:\n\n      for s in ...:   # 0\n          b=0         # 4\n          for i in ...:   # 4 (but then the body of this for-loop must be 8)\n\n  So the body of the inner for-loop should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\n  But the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with the body. The body should be written at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      \"        if i == '':\\n        continue\\n        ...\"\n\n  But that would be 8 spaces for the if, and then 8 for the continue? \n\n  Actually, in Python, we do:\n\n          for i in ...:\n              if ...:   # 8 spaces\n                  ...   # 12 spaces\n\n  So:\n\n      for program2.py, the body:\n\n          if i == '': \n              continue\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  We write:\n\n      Line1: 8 spaces: \"if i == '':\"\n      Line2: 12 spaces: \"continue\"\n      Line3: 8 spaces: \"if ...:\"\n      Line4: 12 spaces: \"b=1\"\n      Line5: 12 spaces: \"break\"\n\n  But note: the second if is at the same level as the first if.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without the extra indentation for the condition, but that would be incorrect.\n\n  Actually, we can write:\n\n      if i == '': continue\n      else:\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: \n              b=1\n              break\n\n  But that is more lines.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      if not i: continue\n      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n          b = 1\n          break\n\n  And the indentation:\n\n      for i in ...:\n          if not i: continue\n          if ...:\n              b=1\n              break\n\n  So:\n\n      Line1: 8 spaces: \"if not i: continue\"\n      Line2: 8 spaces: \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\"\n      Line3: 12 spaces: \"b=1\"\n      Line4: 12 spaces: \"break\"\n\n  But note: the condition can be written as:\n\n      if i == '':\n          continue\n      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n          b = 1\n          break\n\n  And the indentation:\n\n      for i in ...:\n          if i == '':\n              continue\n          if ...:\n              b=1\n              break\n\n  So the first if: 8 spaces, the continue: 12 spaces, then the next if: 8 spaces, and the break: 12 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we output for program2.py:\n\n      \"        if i == '':\\n            continue\\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n  This has:\n        Line1: 8 spaces + \"if i == '':\"\n        Line2: 12 spaces + \"continue\"\n        Line3: 8 spaces + \"if ...:\"\n        Line4: 12 spaces + \"b=1\"\n        Line5: 12 spaces + \"break\"\n\n  But note: the break is at 12 spaces and is part of the second if.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without the second if having a block? \n\n      if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  But then we skip empty in the condition.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      if i != '' and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  But then we don't skip empty? we skip by not entering.\n\n  But we can also do:\n\n      if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  This means: if the segment is non-empty and it does not have both colors, then invalid.\n\n  Then the body becomes:\n\n      if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n          b=1\n          break\n\n  But note: if i is empty, we skip.\n\n  This is one line? but we have to break it.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n          b = 1\n          break\n\n  And the indentation:\n\n      for i in ...:\n          if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n              b=1\n              break\n\n  So:\n\n      Line1: 8 spaces: \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\"\n      Line2: 12 spaces: \"b=1\"\n      Line3: 12 spaces: \"break\"\n\n  This is three lines.\n\n  But the condition is a bit complex.\n\n  We'll stick to the two-step.\n\n  Given the constraints, we do:\n\n      for i in ...:\n          if i == '':\n              continue\n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b=1\n              break\n\n  And output the string with the exact indentation.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\", \n        \"program2\": \"        if i == '':\\n            continue\\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in program1.py, the for-loop body has two lines, and we indent each by 4 more than the for-loop.\n\n  The for-loop in program1.py is:\n\n      for _ in[0]*q:\n\n  and we are to write the body at 4 spaces.\n\n  So:\n\n      for _ in[0]*q:\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n  We output the two lines with 4 spaces each.\n\n  Therefore, the string for program1.py is:\n\n      \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\n  This has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n  We are done."
