But what about the substring that is the entire string? We just did: \"abca\": a:2, b:1, c:1 -> okay. How about the substring \"abc\": \n                    a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay. How about the substring \"bca\": \n                    b:1, c:1, a:1 -> okay. How about the substring \"a\" (first) and the entire string has 'b' and 'c': \n                    |1-0|=1 -> okay. So \"abca\" should be YES. But our algorithm: \n                    distinct: 3 -> no consecutive duplicates -> then we check for pattern in contiguous substrings of length 3: \n                        \"abc\": a!=c -> skip. \"bca\": b!=a -> skip. -> then we print \"YES\". (correct)\n\n          However, what about \"abcab\": \n                distinct: 3 -> no consecutive duplicates? Check patterns of length3: i0: \"abc\" -> skip. i1: \"bca\" -> skip.\n                    i2: \"cab\" -> skip.\n                -> YES. But let's check: \n                    The entire string: \"abcab\": \n                    distinct: a,b,c.\n                    Check substring \"aba\" (positions 0,1,3? but that's not contiguous) -> we don't have contiguous substring \"aba\". The contiguous substrings of length3: \n                        \"abc\": a:1,b:1,c:1 -> okay.\n                        \"bca\": b:1,c:1,a:1 -> okay. \"cab\": c:1,a:1,b:1 -> okay. Also, the entire string: a:2, b:2, c:1 -> \n                        |2-2|=0, |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1 -> okay. So it's YES. But what about \"abac\" (which we had) was caught by the pattern at i0: \"aba\". However, what about \"axa\" where x is any character different from 'a'? \n                distinct: at least 2 (if x is one character) -> but if there is a third character? Actually, the entire string is \"axa\", distinct: {'a','x'} -> two distinct. Then we don't check the pattern? But in the substring \"axa\", we have a:2, x:1 -> for the entire string, we have only 'a' and 'x'. Then the condition: \n                    for the substring \"axa\": \n                        |f(a)-f(x)| = |2-1|=1 -> okay. So YES. But what if the entire string has a third character, say the string is \"axay\", and the distinct set is {'a','x','y'}? Then we have to check: \n                    consecutive duplicates:",

So we would print \"YES\". Therefore, we don't need the condition \"a == b\" separately? But the provided code had:\n\n                if b == 1 or a == b:\n                    print('YES') We are replacing that with:\n\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    ... And then in the else, we handle the rest, including the case when a==b (all distinct) -> which will be handled by the consecutive duplicates (which will be false) and then if distinct>=3 we check pattern (which will be false) -> then we print YES. So we are covering the same. Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = len(set(s)) n_len = len(s)\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    found_dup = False\n                    for i in range(n_len-1):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                            found_dup = True\n                            break\n                    if found_dup:\n                        print('NO')\n                    else:\n                        if distinct == 2:\n                            print('YES')\n                        else:\n                            found_pattern = False\n                            for i in range(n_len-2):\n                                if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                    found_pattern = True\n                                    break\n                            print('NO' if found_pattern else 'YES')\n\n          But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000, so we are safe.",

But what if a2 is very large? then ceil((a1+1)/a2) might be 1? but if a2>a1+1, then 1*a2 = a2>a1+1 -> so we can set x2=1. Then total moves = |0|+|1|+|1| = 2. But the example output is 4? \n\n          Example: a = [1,2,3,4,5] -> \n            x0=0 -> b0=0\n            x1=1 -> b1=2\n            x2= ceil((2+1)/3)=ceil(3/3)=1 -> b2=3\n            x3= ceil((3 +1)/4)=ceil(4/4)=1 -> b3=4\n            x4= ceil((4+1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1 -> b4=5\n            total moves = 0+1+1+1+1 = 4. This matches. But what if we set x0 to a negative value? For example, set x0=-1 -> b0=-1 -> then we require b1>-1 -> the smallest nonnegative multiple? We can set x1=0? -> b1=0 -> then condition: -1<0 -> holds. Then for b2: must be >0 -> x2=1 -> b2=3. Then b3: x3=1 -> 4, b4=1->5. total moves = 1+0+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n          Same. How about set x0=-2? b0=-2, then b1 must be >-2 -> we can set x1=0 -> b1=0 -> then same as above -> total moves=2+0+1+1+1=5 -> worse. So we want to set x0 as close to 0 as possible. But what if a0 is large? Example: a0=100, a1=1.\n            Option1: x0=0 -> then b0=0, then b1 must be at least 1 -> x1=1 -> moves=1.\n            Option2: x0=-1 -> b0=-100, then b1 must be >-100 -> we can set x1=-99 -> b1=-99 -> then moves=1+99=100 -> worse. So we want to set x0=0. But what if we set x0=1? b0=100, then b1 must be >100 -> x1=101 -> moves=1+101=102 -> worse. Therefore, for the first element, we set x0=0.

How about: \n                    x_i = ceil(b_{i+1}/a_i) - 1? For b_{i+1}=-3, a_i=2: \n                    ceil(-3/2)=ceil(-1.5) = -1, then -1-1 = -2 -> but we saw -2 is not valid. So we stick with: \n                    x_i = (b_{i+1}-1) // a_i [using integer division?] But note: we want the floor of (b_{i+1}-1)/a_i, and integer division in Python for negative is floor? Example: (b_{i+1}-1) = -4, a_i=2 -> -4//2 = -2 -> correct. But if b_{i+1}=3, a_i=2: \n                    we require x_i * 2 < 3 -> x_i can be 0,1? the smallest |x_i| is 0? But 0*2=0<3 -> valid. How to compute for positive b_{i+1}? We can set x_i=0? But our formula: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> then x_i=1 -> |x_i|=1, but we have a better option: 0. So we must distinguish: We want the integer x_i that minimizes |x_i| and satisfies x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}.",

We require: x_i * a_i < b_{i+1] \n                    => x_i < b_{i+1] / a_i   (since a_i>0)\n\n                    The largest negative integer (closest to 0) that is < b_{i+1]/a_i is: \n                         x_i = floor( (b_{i+1] - 1) / a_i ) [because we want strictly less]\n\n                  But if b_{i+1] is positive, we use 0. Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    if b_{i+1] > 0:\n                        x_i = 0\n                    else:\n                        x_i = (b_{i+1] - 1) // a_i   # but note: if (b_{i+1]-1) is negative, then // is floor which is what we want. However, what if b_{i+1] is negative and a_i does not divide (b_{i+1]-1)? Example: b_{i+1] = -3, a_i=2: \n                         (-3-1) = -4, -4//2 = -2 -> then b_i = -2*2 = -4 < -3 -> valid. But what if b_{i+1] = -4, a_i=2: \n                         (-4-1)//2 = -5//2 = -3 -> then b_i = -6 < -4 -> valid. But we want the smallest absolute value. Is there a candidate with absolute value 2? \n                         x_i=-2 -> b_i=-4, which is not < -4 -> invalid. So -3 is the best.",

But we can also set x_i=-2 -> -4, which is also valid, but |x_i|=2 -> worse. So we want the negative integer x_i with the smallest absolute value that satisfies x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}. How to compute that? If b_{i+1} > 0, then we can set x_i=0? Then b_i=0, and 0 < b_{i+1} -> valid, and |x_i|=0. But wait: if b_{i+1}=1, then 0<1 -> valid. If b_{i+1}=0, then we require b_i<0 -> so x_i must be negative.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 200,000.\n The problem states: for any substring t and any two characters u, v in the entire string s, the condition must hold.\n However, note the examples: \n   \"aba\" -> YES, \"abb\" -> NO, \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n Observation from the examples and the problem:\n - If the string has only one distinct character, then every substring has only one character. The condition holds because the difference between the same character is 0 and with any other (which doesn't appear) the frequency is 0 -> difference is 1 (if we compare a character that appears and one that doesn't, then |freq(u)-freq(v)| = |some positive - 0| = positive, but note: the condition requires that the difference is not more than 1 for any two characters *present in s*. However, note the problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\". So if a character does not appear in the substring, then its frequency is 0. But note: the condition must hold for every triplet (t, u, v) where u and v are present in the entire string s (not necessarily in t). \n\n However, let's read the problem again: \"u and v are characters present in s\". So even if u or v does not appear in t, we still have to consider the difference? For example, in substring \"bb\" of \"abb\", we have u='a' and v='b': \n   freq('a') in \"bb\" is 0, freq('b') is 2 -> |0-2| = 2 > 1 -> invalid.\n\n Therefore, the condition must hold for every substring t and every pair of characters (u, v) that appear anywhere in the entire string s.\n\n But note: the problem says \"characters present in s\", meaning the entire string.\n\n However, the total length of all strings is only 200,000, but the number of distinct characters per string can be up to 26 (since lowercase letters). But the number of substrings is O(n^2) which is too many.\n\n We need a smarter approach.\n\n Insight: \n The problem constraints on the total length of strings (200,000) is the sum of |s| over test cases. But note: the example condition fails for a substring of length 2 in \"abb\". \n\n Actually, note the note in the problem: \n   For the second testcase: substring \"bb\" fails because |f('a') - f('b')| = |0-2| = 2.\n\n How about we check for every contiguous substring? That would be O(n^2) per test case, which is too slow for |s| up to 200,000.\n\n But note: the total sum of |s| over test cases is 200,000. However, worst-case there could be one test case with |s| = 200,000. Then O(n^2) would be 20e10, which is too slow.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n After reading known solutions for similar problems (like CodeForces problems), we can note:\n\n Claim: The condition fails if and only if there exists a contiguous substring of length 2 or 3 that violates the condition.\n\n Why?\n   Consider: the condition requires that for every substring and every pair of characters (u,v) in the entire string, |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n   In particular, if we have a substring of length 2 that has two same consecutive characters, say \"aa\", then for u='a' and v any other character that appears in the entire string (say 'b'), we have |f_t('a') - f_t('b')| = |2-0| = 2, which fails.\n\n   Similarly, if we have a substring of length 3 that has two same characters and one different, but then we might have a problem? Actually, consider \"aab\": \n        For u='a', v='b': |2-1| = 1 -> okay.\n        But what about a substring of length 3 that is \"aaa\"? Then for u='a' and v='b': |3-0|=3 -> fails.\n\n   However, note that if the entire string has only one distinct character, we skip because we already handled that (b==1 -> YES). So we are in the case with at least two distinct characters.\n\n   Therefore, we can check:\n      - If the string has two consecutive same characters (like \"aa\", \"bb\", etc.), then we have a substring of length 2 that fails (because for the other distinct character that exists in the entire string, the frequency difference is 2 and 0 -> 2>1).\n      - Also, if there is a substring of length 3 that has the same character at the ends and a different one in the middle? Actually, consider \"aba\": that's okay. But what about \"aaba\"? \n          The substring \"aaa\" (if we have three consecutive same) is bad. But also, what about two same characters separated by one? For example, \"aca\" in a string that has 'a' and 'c'? \n          Then in the substring \"aca\", we have: \n             f('a') = 2, f('c') = 1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n   However, what about a substring of length 3 that is \"aaa\"? Then for any other character v in the entire string, we have |3-0|=3 -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, we must check for any contiguous occurrence of the same character at least twice? Actually, two consecutive same characters (like \"aa\") is enough to break the condition because the substring \"aa\" has two of one letter and zero of another (if the entire string has at least two distinct characters). \n\n   But what if the entire string has two distinct characters, and we have \"aa\" as a substring? Then for the other character (say 'b') that appears somewhere in the entire string, we have in the substring \"aa\": \n        freq('a')=2, freq('b')=0 -> |2-0|=2>1 -> invalid.\n\n   Similarly, if we have three consecutive same characters? Then the substring of three same characters would have 3 of one and 0 of the others -> |3-0|=3>1.\n\n   However, note: the condition must hold for every pair of characters that appear in the entire string. So if we have a substring that has two consecutive same characters, then we have a violation.\n\n   But wait: what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then we don't have any other character. Then we return YES. So we don't check for consecutive same in that case.\n\n   However, what if the entire string has two distinct characters, but the two distinct characters are not adjacent? For example, \"abab\" is okay? \n        But note: we must check every substring. The substring \"aa\" does not appear? \n        However, what about the substring \"a\" (which is okay) and \"aa\" doesn't exist. But what about the substring \"aba\": \n            For u='a', v='b': |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n        But what about the substring \"ab\": |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n        And \"ba\": same.\n\n        However, what about the substring \"abab\": \n            a:2, b:2 -> |2-2|=0 -> okay.\n\n        But what if we have \"aab\"? \n            substring \"aa\": |2-0|=2 (if the entire string has 'a' and 'b') -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, the condition fails if and only if there exists two consecutive same characters OR three consecutive same characters? Actually, two consecutive same is enough.\n\n   However, what about a substring of two same characters that are not consecutive? For example, in \"aba\": \n        We have two 'a's but they are separated by a 'b'. The substring of the two a's? But they are not contiguous. The contiguous substrings are: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\". \n        The substring \"a\" (first) and \"a\" (last) is not contiguous? We are only considering contiguous substrings.\n\n   Therefore, we only need to check for contiguous duplicates? \n\n   But note: the problem says \"substring\" meaning contiguous substring.\n\n   So the violation occurs if there is any contiguous substring of two same characters? \n\n   However, consider the example \"abc\": \n        distinct characters: a, b, c. \n        Check every contiguous substring of length 2: \"ab\", \"bc\" -> both have one of two distinct characters? \n            For \"ab\": \n                a:1, b:1 -> |1-1|=0 -> okay for (a,b)\n                a:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay? \n                b:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n            For \"bc\": similarly.\n\n        But what about a substring of length 3? \"abc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1 -> any pair: |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n\n        Now, what about a substring of length 1? \n            For a single character, say 'a': \n                a:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay? \n                a:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n        So \"abc\" is okay.\n\n   Now, what about \"aab\": \n        contiguous substrings of length 2: \n            \"aa\": \n                a:2, b:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n        If the entire string has only one distinct character -> YES.\n        Else, check if there is any contiguous duplicate (i.e., two consecutive same characters). If yes, then NO.\n\n   But wait: what about the example \"aaba\"? \n        The entire string has two distinct characters? \n        We have \"aa\" -> fails.\n\n   However, what about \"aabac\"? \n        We have \"aa\" at the beginning -> fails.\n\n   But what about \"abac\"? \n        Does it have \"aa\"? -> yes, at positions 0 and 2? But they are not consecutive. \n        However, the contiguous substring \"aa\" does not occur. The contiguous substrings that are of length 2: \n            \"ab\", \"ba\", \"ac\" -> none are \"aa\". \n        But what about the substring \"aba\"? \n            For u='a', v='b': |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            For u='a', v='c': |2-0|=2 -> fails? because the entire string has 'c'? \n        So in \"abac\", the substring \"aba\" has two a's and one b, and zero c's. Then for the pair (a,c): |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, we must also consider non-adjacent duplicates? \n\n   How can we check for such a violation without O(n^2)? \n\n   Note: the violation in \"abac\" is in the substring \"aba\" (which is contiguous) and then we have to consider the character 'c' that is not in the substring? \n        But the condition says: for every substring t and every pair of characters (u,v) that are present in the entire string s.\n\n        In the substring \"aba\", we have to check for every pair of distinct characters that appear in the entire string s. The entire string s has 'a','b','c'. \n        So we must check:\n            a and b: |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            a and c: |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, we have a violation.\n\n   How to catch this? \n\n   We note that the violation occurs because the substring \"aba\" has two a's and zero c's, and the entire string has c. \n\n   How about we check for every contiguous substring of length at most 3? \n\n   Why 3? \n        The minimal violating substring must be of length 2 or 3? \n        - Length 2: two same characters -> then we have two of one and zero of another (if the entire string has at least two distinct characters) -> fails.\n        - Length 3: we can have a substring that has two of one character and zero of another? \n            Example: \"aba\" -> two a's and zero c's? But wait, the entire string must have at least three distinct characters? Not necessarily: in \"aaba\", we have two distinct, and the substring \"aa\" (length2) already fails.\n\n        Actually, the example \"abac\" has three distinct characters. \n\n        In a substring of length 3, we can have:\n            - Three same: then we have 3 of one and 0 of the others -> fails (if there is at least one other character in the entire string).\n            - Two same and one different: then we have two of one and one of another, and zero of the rest? \n                For a character that is not in the substring, we have 0. Then the difference between the two same and that character is 2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must check:\n            - If there is any contiguous duplicate (length2) -> fails.\n            - Or if there is any contiguous substring of length 3 that has two same characters and the entire string has a third character? \n\n        But note: if the entire string has only two distinct characters, then a substring of length 3 that has two same and one different: \n            Example: \"aab\": \n                substring \"aab\": \n                    a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay for (a,b). \n                But wait, we already have a contiguous duplicate \"aa\" at the beginning -> so we would have failed at the duplicate.\n\n        So the only new case is when the entire string has at least three distinct characters and we have a substring of length 3 that has two same characters and the two same characters are not consecutive? \n\n        Actually, in \"abac\": \n            The substring \"aba\" has two a's that are not consecutive? But the substring is contiguous: positions 0,1,2: 'a','b','a'. \n            We don't have consecutive duplicates? \n\n        How can we check for a substring of length 3 that has two same characters? \n            We can check for every triplet: \n                for i in range(n-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        then we have a pattern \"aba\" (with the same letter at the ends and a different in the middle).\n\n            But note: in \"abac\", we have s[0]=='a', s[1]=='b', s[2]=='a'. So we have s[0]==s[2] and s[0]!=s[1]. \n\n            Why is this a problem? \n                Because the entire string has at least three distinct characters? Actually, in \"abac\", we have three: 'a','b','c'. \n                Then in the substring s[0:3] = \"aba\", we have:\n                    a:2, b:1, c:0.\n                Then for the pair (a,c): |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must also check for the pattern \"aba\" (with the same at the ends and different in the middle) when the entire string has at least three distinct characters? \n\n        But wait: what if the entire string has exactly two distinct characters? \n            Example: \"ababa\" -> distinct characters: 'a','b'. \n            Check substring \"aba\": \n                a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay for (a,b). \n                There is no third character. \n            So it's okay? \n\n        However, what about the substring \"aa\"? \n            We don't have consecutive duplicates? \n            But in \"ababa\", we don't have consecutive duplicates. \n            But we have the pattern \"aba\" at every step? \n\n        How about we check the entire string? \n            The condition: for every substring and every pair of characters in the entire string (which are 'a' and 'b').\n\n            For any substring, the frequencies of 'a' and 'b' must differ by at most 1.\n\n            Consider a substring of length 1: \n                'a': |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                'b': |0-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n            For a substring of length 2: \n                \"ab\": |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n                \"ba\": same.\n\n            For a substring of length 3: \n                \"aba\": |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n                \"bab\": |1-2|=1 -> okay.\n\n            For a substring of length 4: \n                \"abab\": |2-2|=0 -> okay.\n\n            So \"ababa\" is okay.\n\n        Therefore, the pattern \"aba\" (with two distinct characters) is okay.\n\n        So the problem only arises when the entire string has at least three distinct characters and we have the pattern \"aba\" (same at the ends and different in the middle) OR consecutive duplicates? \n\n        But note: if we have three distinct characters and the pattern \"aba\", then we have a problem because of the third character? \n\n        Actually, the problem is that the substring \"aba\" does not contain the third character. Then for the third character, we get frequency 0, and for the character 'a' we get 2 -> difference 2.\n\n        Therefore, we must check:\n            - If the entire string has at least three distinct characters, then we must check for the pattern \"aba\" (i.e., s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1])? \n\n        But wait: what if we have the pattern \"abc\"? \n            s[0]=='a', s[1]=='b', s[2]=='c'. \n            Then we don't have s[0]==s[2]. \n\n        What if we have \"aab\", but we already catch the consecutive duplicates.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          For each test case:\n            s = input string\n            distinct = set(s)\n\n            if len(distinct) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                # Check for consecutive duplicates: \n                found = False\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n\n                if found:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now, if there are at least three distinct characters, check for the pattern \"aba\" (same at the ends and different in the middle) in contiguous substrings of length 3?\n                if len(distinct) >= 3:\n                    found2 = False\n                    for i in range(len(s)-2):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                            found2 = True\n                            break\n                    if found2:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # only two distinct characters and no consecutive duplicates -> YES\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n        Let's test:\n          Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct: {'a','b'} -> 2 -> then we check consecutive duplicates: \n                'a' and 'b' -> no duplicate? then we go to the else branch (two distinct) -> YES.  (correct)\n\n          Example 2: \"abb\" -> consecutive duplicates: 'b' and 'b' -> found -> NO. (correct)\n\n          Example 3: \"abc\" -> distinct: 3 -> then check consecutive duplicates: none -> then check pattern: \n                i=0: \"abc\": a==c? no -> skip.\n                i=1: \"bc\" -> not length 3? we break at i=0 and i=1? Actually, we check i from 0 to n-3: \n                    n=3: i in [0] -> \"abc\": a!=c -> no pattern -> then YES? \n                But the example says \"abc\" is YES.

(correct)\n\n          Example 5: \"aabac\" -> consecutive duplicates at the beginning: \"aa\" -> found -> NO.

(correct)\n\n          Example 9: \"aabc\" -> consecutive duplicates: \"aa\" -> NO. (correct)\n\n          Example 10: \"abca\" -> distinct:3 -> consecutive duplicates: none? \n                check pattern: \n                    i=0: \"abc\" -> a!=c -> skip.\n                    i=1: \"bca\": b!=a -> skip.\n                    i=2: \"ca\" -> not long enough? (we break at i from 0 to n-3: n=4 -> i in [0,1])\n                So we don't find the pattern? \n                But what about the substring \"abca\"? \n                    We are only checking contiguous substrings of length 3? \n                However, note: the condition must hold for every substring. The substring \"a\" at the beginning and the substring \"a\" at the end? \n                    For the entire string, we have distinct {'a','b','c'}. \n                    Consider the substring \"aa\" (the first and the last)? But that is not contiguous. \n                    The contiguous substrings that might be problematic? \n                        We have the substring \"abca\": \n                            a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n                                |2-1|=1 for (a,b) -> okay\n                                |2-1|=1 for (a,c) -> okay\n                                |1-1|=0 for (b,c) -> okay.\n                        What about the substring \"aa\"? not contiguous -> so we don't have that.\n\n                But wait: what about the substring \"a\" (the first) and the substring \"a\" (the last) are not contiguous. The contiguous substring of two a's? We don't have that.\n\n                However, what about the substring \"ca\" (last two)? \n                    a:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n                But what about the substring that is the entire string? \n                    We just did: \"abca\": a:2, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n                How about the substring \"abc\": \n                    a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n                How about the substring \"bca\": \n                    b:1, c:1, a:1 -> okay.\n\n                How about the substring \"a\" (first) and the entire string has 'b' and 'c': \n                    |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n                So \"abca\" should be YES.\n\n                But our algorithm: \n                    distinct: 3 -> no consecutive duplicates -> then we check for pattern in contiguous substrings of length 3: \n                        \"abc\": a!=c -> skip.\n                        \"bca\": b!=a -> skip.\n                    -> then we print \"YES\". (correct)\n\n          However, what about \"abcab\": \n                distinct: 3 -> no consecutive duplicates? \n                Check patterns of length3:\n                    i0: \"abc\" -> skip.\n                    i1: \"bca\" -> skip.\n                    i2: \"cab\" -> skip.\n                -> YES.\n\n                But let's check: \n                    The entire string: \"abcab\": \n                    distinct: a,b,c.\n                    Check substring \"aba\" (positions 0,1,3? but that's not contiguous) -> we don't have contiguous substring \"aba\". \n                    The contiguous substrings of length3: \n                        \"abc\": a:1,b:1,c:1 -> okay.\n                        \"bca\": b:1,c:1,a:1 -> okay.\n                        \"cab\": c:1,a:1,b:1 -> okay.\n                    Also, the entire string: a:2, b:2, c:1 -> \n                        |2-2|=0, |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n                So it's YES.\n\n          But what about \"abac\" (which we had) was caught by the pattern at i0: \"aba\".\n\n          However, what about \"axa\" where x is any character different from 'a'? \n                distinct: at least 2 (if x is one character) -> but if there is a third character? \n                Actually, the entire string is \"axa\", distinct: {'a','x'} -> two distinct. \n                Then we don't check the pattern? \n                But in the substring \"axa\", we have a:2, x:1 -> for the entire string, we have only 'a' and 'x'. \n                Then the condition: \n                    for the substring \"axa\": \n                        |f(a)-f(x)| = |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n                So YES.\n\n          But what if the entire string has a third character, say the string is \"axay\", and the distinct set is {'a','x','y'}? \n                Then we have to check: \n                    consecutive duplicates: none? \n                    pattern: \n                        i0: \"axa\" -> a==a and a!=x -> found -> NO.\n\n                Now, why is \"axay\" bad? \n                    Consider the substring \"axa\": \n                        a:2, x:1, y:0 -> then |2-0|=2 for (a,y) -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm above should work.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 200,000. \n          We are doing:\n            For each test case: \n                building set: O(n)\n                checking consecutive duplicates: O(n)\n                if distinct>=3, then checking for pattern in O(n) (scanning for triplets).\n\n          Since the total length of all strings is 200,000, this is acceptable.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total of |s| over test cases <= 200,000.\n\n          Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n          However, the original code provided has:\n\n            if b == 1 or a == b:\n                print('YES')\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We must replace the else part.\n\n          The original code seems to be trying to check for a periodic string? \n\n          But we have a different approach.\n\n          We'll replace the else part with our algorithm.\n\n          However, note: the condition \"a == b\" means the string has all distinct characters? \n            Then we must check: \n                Example: \"abc\" -> distinct and no consecutive duplicates -> YES. \n                But what about \"abcd\": \n                    consecutive duplicates? none -> and distinct=4 -> then we check for pattern? \n                    We don't have any pattern of the form \"aba\" (because all adjacent are distinct and the next next is not equal to the current because distinct? actually, in \"abcd\": \n                         i0: \"abc\" -> a != c -> skip.\n                         i1: \"bcd\" -> b != d -> skip.\n                    -> YES.\n\n          But note: the condition \"a == b\" (where a=len(s), b=len(set(s))) is equivalent to all distinct. \n          Then we can skip the consecutive duplicate check? \n          However, if the string is \"abac\", then a=4, distinct=3 -> a != b -> we go to the else.\n\n          But our algorithm: \n            if distinct==1 -> YES.\n            else:\n                check consecutive duplicates -> if found -> NO.\n                else if distinct>=3 -> check pattern -> if found -> NO, else YES.\n                else (distinct==2) -> YES.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            if len(set(s)) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                dup = False\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        dup = True\n                        break\n                if dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                if len(set(s)) >= 3:\n                    pat = False\n                    for i in range(len(s)-2):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                            pat = True\n                            break\n                    if pat:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the pattern check: we only need to check if s[i]==s[i+2] (we don't need to check s[i]!=s[i+1] because if we have consecutive duplicates we already broke out, so adjacent are distinct. And if adjacent are distinct, then s[i]!=s[i+1] is always true? \n          But wait: if we have \"aba\", then s[0]==s[2] and we break. \n          But if we have \"abc\", then s[0]!=s[2]. \n\n          However, what if we have \"aaa\"? \n            We already broke at the consecutive duplicate at the first two.\n\n          So we can simplify: \n            if we are in the branch for distinct>=3, then we know there are no consecutive duplicates. Therefore, adjacent characters are distinct. So we only need to check s[i]==s[i+2]? \n\n          But note: the pattern \"aba\" requires that the two a's are separated by one different. And we know that s[i] != s[i+1] and s[i+1]!=s[i+2] (because no consecutive duplicates) but we don't know about s[i] and s[i+2]. \n\n          So we can just check s[i]==s[i+2] without checking the middle? \n\n          Example: \"abc\": \n            i=0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not equal -> skip.\n\n          Example: \"aba\": \n            i=0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='a' -> equal -> we break.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if len(set(s)) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                n = len(s)\n                # Check consecutive duplicates\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else:   # no break in the for loop\n                    if len(set(s)) < 3:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        for i in range(n-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                break\n                        else:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: we must not print twice. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use flags.\n\n          However, the problem says: the total length of all strings is 200,000, so we can do:\n\n          We'll restructure:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                distinct = len(set(s))\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                    found_dup = False\n                    for i in range(n-1):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                            found_dup = True\n                            break\n\n                    if found_dup:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        if distinct == 2:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:   # distinct>=3\n                            found_pattern = False\n                            for i in range(n-2):\n                                if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                    found_pattern = True\n                                    break\n                            if found_pattern:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                            else:\n                                print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the example \"abac\" has distinct=3 and found_pattern becomes True -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n          However, we can optimize: if we break in the consecutive duplicates loop, we skip the rest. \n\n          But the total length of all strings is 200,000, so worst-case we do two passes per string (one for consecutive duplicates and one for pattern) which is O(n) per test case.\n\n          Since the total n over test cases is 200,000, it's acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we replace the else part in the provided code with the above.\n\n          The provided code:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input()[:-1]   # note: [:-1] to remove newline, but we can use .strip()\n                a = len(s)\n                b = len(set(s))\n                if b == 1 or a == b:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    for i in range(1, a):\n                        if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                            w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                            if s == w:\n                                print(\"YES\")\n                            else:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                    break   # This break is inside the for-loop? Actually, the break is at the same level as the for-loop? \n\n          Actually, the break is inside the for-loop? \n\n          The code:\n\n            for i in range(1, a):\n                ... \n            break\n\n          This break will break the outer for-loop (the test case loop) after the first test case? \n\n          But we have multiple test cases. \n\n          Actually, the provided code structure:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input()[:-1]\n                a = len(s)\n                b = len(set(s))\n                if b == 1 or a == b:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    for i in range(1, a):\n                        ... \n                    break   # This break will break the outer loop (the test case loop) after the first test case that goes into the else.\n\n          That is not what we want.\n\n          We must remove that break.\n\n          Also, the inner for-loop: \n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                    w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                    if s == w:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # TODO\n\n          We are going to replace the entire else block.\n\n          So we do:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input().strip()   # using strip to remove newline and any extra spaces\n                distinct = len(set(s))\n                n_len = len(s)\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                    found_dup = False\n                    for i in range(n_len-1):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                            found_dup = True\n                            break\n\n                    if found_dup:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        if distinct == 2:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:   # distinct>=3\n                            found_pattern = False\n                            for i in range(n_len-2):\n                                if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                    found_pattern = True\n                                    break\n                            if found_pattern:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                            else:\n                                print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the condition \"a == b\" (which is n_len == distinct) is the same as the string having all distinct characters. \n          In that case, we go to the else branch? \n          But our algorithm: \n            distinct>=2 -> then we check consecutive duplicates -> if none, then if distinct==2 -> YES, else distinct>=3 -> then check pattern.\n\n          However, if the string has all distinct characters, then distinct = n_len, which is at least 2 (since we are in the else of distinct==1). \n          And consecutive duplicates: if the string has all distinct, then consecutive duplicates cannot occur? \n          So we would go to the branch: \n                if distinct == 2: ... \n                else: distinct>=3 -> then check pattern.\n\n          But if the string has distinct characters and no consecutive duplicates, then the pattern: \n                for i in range(n_len-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2] -> but the string has distinct characters, so s[i] != s[i+2] (because all are distinct). \n          So we would print \"YES\".\n\n          Therefore, we don't need the condition \"a == b\" separately? \n\n          But the provided code had:\n\n                if b == 1 or a == b:\n                    print('YES')\n\n          We are replacing that with:\n\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    ... \n\n          And then in the else, we handle the rest, including the case when a==b (all distinct) -> which will be handled by the consecutive duplicates (which will be false) and then if distinct>=3 we check pattern (which will be false) -> then we print YES.\n\n          So we are covering the same.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = len(set(s))\n                n_len = len(s)\n                if distinct == 1:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    found_dup = False\n                    for i in range(n_len-1):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                            found_dup = True\n                            break\n                    if found_dup:\n                        print('NO')\n                    else:\n                        if distinct == 2:\n                            print('YES')\n                        else:\n                            found_pattern = False\n                            for i in range(n_len-2):\n                                if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                    found_pattern = True\n                                    break\n                            print('NO' if found_pattern else 'YES')\n\n          But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          However, the provided code had an extra break in the else branch? We are removing that.\n\n          Let's run the provided examples:\n\n            Example: \"aba\" -> distinct=2 -> no consecutive duplicates -> then distinct==2 -> YES.\n            Example: \"abc\" -> distinct=3 -> no consecutive duplicates -> then check pattern: \n                for i in range(1): \n                    \"abc\": s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not equal -> then print YES.\n\n          So we are good.\n\n          But note: the example \"a\" -> distinct=1 -> YES.\n\n          Example \"aa\": distinct=1 -> YES? But wait, the string \"aa\" has distinct=1 -> YES. \n          However, the problem: \n            The condition: for every substring and every pair of characters present in s. \n            The entire string has only 'a'. \n            Then for any substring, we only have 'a'. \n            For two characters: we only have one character, so the pair (a,a) -> |f(a)-f(a)|=0 -> okay. \n            And there is no other pair? \n            So YES.\n\n          But what about the example \"abb\": \n            distinct=2 -> then we check consecutive duplicates: \n                i0: 'a' and 'b' -> no\n                i1: 'b' and 'b' -> yes -> print NO.\n\n          Correct.\n\n          Therefore, we output the entire code for the test case loop? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and the missing code is in the else block of the provided code.\n\n          The provided code has:\n\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the entire else block (from the else: to the end of the inner for-loop) with our code.\n\n          But note: the provided else block has a for-loop and then a break. We are removing that.\n\n          So we replace:\n\n            else:\n                ... (the entire block we are going to replace)\n\n          with:\n\n            else:\n                found_dup = False\n                for i in range(a-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        found_dup = True\n                        break\n                if found_dup:\n                    print('NO')\n                else:\n                    if b == 2:   # because b is the distinct count, which we already computed as len(set(s))\n                        print('YES')\n                    else:\n                        found_pattern = False\n                        for i in range(a-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                found_pattern = True\n                                break\n                        print('NO' if found_pattern else 'YES')\n\n          But note: the variable 'b' is the distinct count. We can use it.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the variable 'a' is the length of the string.\n\n          Also, note: the condition for distinct==2: we use 'b' (which is the distinct count) and check if b==2.\n\n          But what if the distinct count is more than 3? We use the else branch.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            else:\n                found_dup = False\n                for i in range(a-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        found_dup = True\n                        break\n                if found_dup:\n                    print('NO')\n                else:\n                    if b == 2:\n                        print('YES')\n                    else:\n                        found_pattern = False\n                        for i in range(a-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                found_pattern = True\n                                break\n                        if found_pattern:\n                            print('NO')\n                        else:\n                            print('YES')\n\n          We can also write:\n\n            else:\n                # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                dup = False\n                for i in range(a-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        dup = True\n                        break\n                if dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    if b < 3:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        pat = False\n                        for i in range(a-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                pat = True\n                                break\n                        print(\"NO\" if pat else \"YES\")\n\n          But note: if b==1, we already handled above. So in the else branch, b>=2. \n          Then if b==2, we print YES. If b>=3, we check the pattern.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            if b == 2: \n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:   # b>=3\n                ...\n\n          But what if b>3? The condition still holds: we need to check the pattern.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            else:\n                dup = False\n                for i in range(a-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        dup = True\n                        break\n                if dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    if b < 3:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        pat = False\n                        for i in range(a-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                pat = True\n                                break\n                        print(\"NO\" if pat else \"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the variable 'a' is the length, and we are using a-1 and a-2.\n\n          We assume a>=1.\n\n          But the problem says |s|>=1.\n\n          We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n          But note: if the string length is 1, then we would have gone to the first branch (distinct==1) -> YES. \n          If the string length is 2: \n              distinct: if distinct==1 -> YES, else distinct==2 -> then we go to the else branch: \n                  check consecutive duplicates: \n                      for i in range(1): \n                         s[0] and s[1] -> if they are the same, then we print NO, else we go to the inner else: \n                         then check b (distinct) -> if distinct==2 -> YES.\n\n          So for \"ab\": distinct=2 -> YES.\n\n          For \"aa\": distinct=1 -> YES.\n\n          For \"aaa\": distinct=1 -> YES.\n\n          For \"aab\": distinct=2 -> consecutive duplicates at the first two -> NO.\n\n          So it's consistent.\n\n          Therefore, we output the above block for the else part.\n\n          But note: the provided code had an inner for-loop and a break. We are replacing that entire else block.\n\n          So the final code for the test case loop becomes:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input()[:-1]   # note: the original code uses [:-1] to remove newline\n                a = len(s)\n                b = len(set(s))\n                if b == 1 or a == b:\n                    print('YES')\n                else:\n                    dup = False\n                    for i in range(a-1):\n                        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                            dup = True\n                            break\n                    if dup:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        if b < 3:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            pat = False\n                            for i in range(a-2):\n                                if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                    pat = True\n                                    break\n                            print(\"NO\" if pat else \"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the original code uses s = input()[:-1] to remove the newline. We can keep that.\n\n          But what if the string has trailing space? The problem says the string consists of lowercase English letters. So no space. \n\n          We'll run with the provided example.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000, and we are doing two loops per string (worst-case two passes) which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we output the else block as above.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the else block? \n\n          But the provided code has:\n\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the entire else block (from the else: to the end of the inner for-loop) with our code.\n\n          But note: the provided else block has a break after the for-loop? \n\n          The code:\n\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    ... \n                break   # This break is at the same indentation as the for-loop? \n\n          Actually, the break is after the for-loop, so it breaks the outer test case loop? \n\n          We must remove that break.\n\n          Therefore, we replace the entire else block (including the for-loop and the break) with our code.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            else:\n                dup = False\n                for i in range(a-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        dup = True\n                        break\n                if dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    if b < 3:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        pat = False\n                        for i in range(a-2):\n                            if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                                pat = True\n                                break\n                        print(\"NO\" if pat else \"YES\")\n\n          But note: the variable names: we use a, b, s as given.\n\n          We are done.\n\n          However, let me test with the provided examples in the problem.\n\n          Example 1: \"aba\" -> \n            a=3, b=2 -> else branch: \n                dup: \n                    i0: 'a' and 'b' -> no\n                    i1: 'b' and 'a' -> no -> dup=False\n                then b=2 -> b<3 -> True -> print \"YES\"\n\n          Example 2: \"abb\" -> \n            a=3, b=2 -> else branch:\n                dup: \n                    i0: 'a' and 'b' -> no\n                    i1: 'b' and 'b' -> yes -> dup=True -> print \"NO\"\n\n          Example 3: \"abc\" -> \n            a=3, b=3 -> else branch:\n                dup: no -> then b>=3 -> \n                    check pattern: \n                        i0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not equal -> pat=False -> print \"YES\"\n\n          Example 4: \"abac\" -> \n            a=4, b=3 -> else branch:\n                dup: \n                    i0: 'a' and 'b' -> no\n                    i1: 'b' and 'a' -> no\n                    i2: 'a' and 'c' -> no -> dup=False\n                then b=3 -> check pattern:\n                    i0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='a' -> equal -> pat=True -> print \"NO\"\n\n          Example 5: \"aa\" -> \n            a=2, b=1 -> first condition: b==1 -> YES.\n\n          Example 6: \"a\" -> YES.\n\n          Example 7: \"ab\" -> \n            a=2, b=2 -> else branch:\n                dup: i0: 'a' and 'b' -> no -> then b=2 -> print \"YES\"\n\n          Example 8: \"aab\" -> \n            a=3, b=2 -> else branch:\n                dup: i0: 'a' and 'a' -> yes -> print \"NO\"\n\n          Example 9: \"abca\" -> \n            a=4, b=3 -> else branch:\n                dup: no -> then b=3 -> check pattern:\n                    i0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> no\n                    i1: s[1]=='b', s[3]=='a' -> no -> pat=False -> print \"YES\"\n\n          Example 10: \"abac\" (already done) -> NO.\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          Therefore, we output the else block as above.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the else block? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n          But this is for program2.py? \n\n          The problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n          We are currently working on program2.py.\n\n          But note: the problem says:\n\n            You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\n\n          We are given two programs. We must complete both.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" for both programs.\n\n          We have only done program2.py so far.\n\n          Now, what about program1.py?\n\n          We must go back to program1.py.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly.\"\n\n          We have two programs.\n\n          We are given:\n\n            # program1.py\n            ... with missing lines or blocks\n\n            # program2.py\n            ... with missing lines or blocks\n\n          We must complete both.\n\n          We have completed program2.py.\n\n          Now, program1.py:\n\n          The code for program1.py:\n\n            m=int(input())\n            a=[int(i)for i in input().split()]\n            t1,min=0,10**20\n            while(t1<m):\n                t2=t1\n                k,t=0,0\n                while(t2<m-1):\n                    t+=(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                    k=a[t2+1]*(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                    t2+=1\n                t2=t1\n                k=0\n                while(t2>0):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if(min>t):\n                    min=t\n                t1+=1\n            print(min)\n\n          We must complete the TODO in program1.py.\n\n          Description for program1.py:\n\n            You are given an array a of n positive integers, and an array b (initially zeros) of length n.\n            In one move: choose an index i, and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\n            Find the minimum number of moves to make b strictly increasing.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: \n                n=5, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n            Output: 4\n\n          How?\n\n            We can set b[0] = -1, b[1]=0, b[2]=3, b[3]=4, b[4]=5.\n            How many moves?\n                b0: from 0 to -1: subtract 1 -> 1 move.\n                b1: 0 -> 0: 0 moves? but we need strictly increasing: -1 < 0 -> so we don't need to change b1? \n                However, the problem says: we can only add or subtract multiples of a_i. \n                So for b1: we can only add or subtract multiples of 2. We cannot leave it at 0? \n                Actually, we start at 0. We can do 0 moves? \n\n            But note: the problem says \"add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So we can do multiple moves on the same index? \n\n            We are allowed to do any number of moves arbitrarily. \n\n            The moves on an index i: we can do k moves: then b_i = k * a_i or -k * a_i? \n\n            Actually, we can do a sequence of moves: \n                We can do: \n                    On index0: subtract once -> b0 = -1.\n                    On index1: do nothing -> b1=0.\n                    On index2: add once -> b2=3.\n                    On index3: add once -> b3=4.\n                    On index4: add once -> b4=5.\n\n            Total moves: 1+0+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n            But wait: we can also do:\n                b0: subtract once -> -1\n                b1: we need b1 > b0 = -1. We can set b1=0 by doing nothing? But 0 is not a multiple of 2? \n                Actually, we start at 0. We are allowed to do nothing? \n\n            The problem says: \"In one move you can choose an integer i and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\" \n            So we can do zero moves on an index? \n\n            Therefore, the moves per index are nonnegative integers (number of operations on that index).\n\n            We want to minimize the total moves.\n\n            Constraints: n up to 5000.\n\n          How to solve?\n\n          We note that we can choose the operations arbitrarily. We require:\n                b0 < b1 < b2 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n          And we start with b_i = 0 for all i.\n\n          We can represent the final b_i as: \n                b_i = k_i * a_i,   where k_i is an integer (positive, negative, or zero? but note: we can do multiple moves: if we do k moves of adding, then k_i = k; if we do k moves of subtracting, then k_i = -k. But we can also mix? \n\n          Actually, the moves are independent: we can do some adds and some subtracts? \n\n          But note: if we do 3 adds and 2 subtracts on index i, then the net effect is 1 add -> b_i = a_i.\n\n          So the net effect: b_i = x_i * a_i, where x_i is an integer (can be positive, negative, or zero).\n\n          We require:\n                x_0 * a_0 < x_1 * a_1 < ... < x_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\n\n          And the total moves is the sum of absolute values of x_i? \n\n          Why? Because if we do 3 adds and 2 subtracts, that's 5 moves. But the net x_i = 1 -> |x_i| = 1? That doesn't match.\n\n          Actually, the total moves for index i is the total number of operations on i, which is the absolute value of the net effect? \n\n          But note: we can do operations in any order. The net effect is x_i = (number of adds - number of subtracts). The total moves is (number of adds + number of subtracts). \n\n          How to express total moves in terms of x_i? \n            Let adds = A, subtracts = B, then x_i = A - B, and moves_i = A+B.\n            Then moves_i = A+B = (A-B) + 2B = x_i + 2B.\n            But we don't know B.\n\n            Alternatively: \n                moves_i = A+B = (A+B) = (A-B) + 2B = x_i + 2B.\n                Also, moves_i = (A+B) = (A-B) + 2B = x_i + 2B, and since B>=0, moves_i >= |x_i|? \n                Actually, we can also write: \n                    moves_i = |x_i| + 2 * min(A,B) \n                but that doesn't help.\n\n          Actually, we can note: \n            moves_i = |x_i| + 2 * min(A,B) \n            but we don't know min(A,B). \n\n          However, we are free to choose any integers x_i. \n\n          The problem: minimize sum_i moves_i = sum_i (A_i+B_i) = sum_i (|x_i| + 2 * min(A_i,B_i)) \n          But note: we can always choose the operations so that we don't do both add and subtract? \n            Why? Because if we do both, we can cancel them: \n                Instead of doing A adds and B subtracts (with A>0 and B>0), we can do (A-B) adds (if A>B) and that would be the same net effect and uses A-B moves (which is less than A+B).\n\n          Therefore, we can assume that for each index i, we only do one type of operation: either only adds or only subtracts. \n\n          Then: \n            If we do only adds: then x_i = A (a nonnegative integer) and moves_i = A = x_i.\n            If we do only subtracts: then x_i = -B (a nonpositive integer) and moves_i = B = -x_i.\n\n          So moves_i = |x_i|.\n\n          Therefore, the total moves = sum_i |x_i|.\n\n          Now the problem becomes: \n            We want to choose integers x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1} such that:\n                x_0 * a_0 < x_1 * a_1 < ... < x_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\n            and minimize sum_i |x_i|.\n\n          How to choose x_i?\n\n          We note that we can let x_i be any integer. \n\n          We want to minimize the absolute values. \n\n          We can try to build the sequence from left to right.\n\n          We require: \n                x_i * a_i < x_{i+1} * a_{i+1}\n\n          We can set x_0 arbitrarily. But we want to minimize the absolute values, so we might set x_0 as close to 0 as possible? \n\n          However, note: we can set x_0=0? \n            Then b0=0.\n            Then we require b1>0 -> x_1>=1 (if a_1>0) -> then b1>=a_1.\n            Then we require b2> b1>=a_1 -> x_2>= ceil((a_1+1)/a_2) ? \n\n          But we want to minimize the absolute values.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming.\n\n          But note: the constraints: n up to 5000, and a_i up to 10^9.\n\n          We cannot iterate over all possible x_i.\n\n          Alternate Insight:\n\n          We note that the condition is:\n                x_i * a_i < x_{i+1} * a_{i+1}\n\n          We can rewrite:\n                x_{i+1} > (a_i * x_i) / a_{i+1}\n\n          Since x_{i+1} is an integer, we have:\n                x_{i+1} = floor((a_i * x_i) / a_{i+1}) + 1   ??? \n\n          But note: we can also have negative values. \n\n          However, we want to minimize the absolute values. \n\n          We can try to set x_i as small as possible in absolute value.\n\n          We can traverse from left to right and greedily set x_i to the smallest integer (in absolute value) that satisfies the condition.\n\n          But note: we might have to adjust later.\n\n          Alternatively, we can traverse from right to left? \n\n          Actually, we can set:\n\n            Let b0 = x0 * a0. We want b0 as close to 0 as possible? \n            But then b1 must be at least b0+1.\n\n          However, we are free to choose any integers. \n\n          We can set x0 to 0? Then b0=0.\n          Then for i=1: we require b1>0 -> the smallest positive multiple of a1 is a1 (if we use positive moves) -> so x1=1, b1=a1.\n          Then for i=2: we require b2>a1 -> the smallest multiple of a2 that is >a1: \n                x2 = ceil((a1+1)/a2)   [if we use positive moves] \n                but if we use negative moves, we might get a negative multiple? but then it would be less than a1? so we must use positive.\n\n          But what if a2 is very large? then ceil((a1+1)/a2) might be 1? but if a2>a1+1, then 1*a2 = a2>a1+1 -> so we can set x2=1.\n\n          Then total moves = |0|+|1|+|1| = 2.\n\n          But the example output is 4? \n\n          Example: a = [1,2,3,4,5] -> \n            x0=0 -> b0=0\n            x1=1 -> b1=2\n            x2= ceil((2+1)/3)=ceil(3/3)=1 -> b2=3\n            x3= ceil((3+1)/4)=ceil(4/4)=1 -> b3=4\n            x4= ceil((4+1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1 -> b4=5\n            total moves = 0+1+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But what if we set x0 to a negative value? \n            For example, set x0=-1 -> b0=-1 -> then we require b1>-1 -> the smallest nonnegative multiple? \n                We can set x1=0? -> b1=0 -> then condition: -1<0 -> holds.\n                Then for b2: must be >0 -> x2=1 -> b2=3.\n                Then b3: x3=1 -> 4, b4=1->5.\n                total moves = 1+0+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n          Same.\n\n          How about set x0=-2? \n            b0=-2, then b1 must be >-2 -> we can set x1=0 -> b1=0 -> then same as above -> total moves=2+0+1+1+1=5 -> worse.\n\n          So we want to set x0 as close to 0 as possible.\n\n          But what if a0 is large? \n            Example: a0=100, a1=1.\n            Option1: x0=0 -> then b0=0, then b1 must be at least 1 -> x1=1 -> moves=1.\n            Option2: x0=-1 -> b0=-100, then b1 must be >-100 -> we can set x1=-99 -> b1=-99 -> then moves=1+99=100 -> worse.\n\n          So we want to set x0=0.\n\n          But what if we set x0=1? \n            b0=100, then b1 must be >100 -> x1=101 -> moves=1+101=102 -> worse.\n\n          Therefore, for the first element, we set x0=0.\n\n          Then for i from 1 to n-1:\n                We require: x_i * a_i > b_{i-1} = x_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n                We want the smallest |x_i| that satisfies this.\n\n          How to choose x_i? \n            We can choose x_i to be positive or negative? \n            But if we choose negative, then b_i = negative multiple of a_i, which might be less than b_{i-1} (which is nonnegative if we start with 0) only if b_{i-1} is negative? \n\n          However, we started with x0=0 -> b0=0. Then for i=1, we require b1>0 -> so x1 must be positive? \n\n          Then for i=2, we require b2> b1>0 -> so x2 must be positive.\n\n          Therefore, we can assume that we only use nonnegative x_i for i>=1? \n\n          But what if we set x1 negative? \n            Then b1 = negative -> but we require b1>0 -> so we cannot.\n\n          So for i>=1, we must have x_i>=1? \n\n          Actually, we can set x_i=0? \n            Then b_i=0, but then we require 0> b_{i-1} -> which is not possible if b_{i-1}>=0.\n\n          Therefore, for i>=1, we must have x_i>= ceil((b_{i-1}+1)/a_i) and positive.\n\n          But note: we might have negative b_{i-1}? \n\n          How can b_{i-1} be negative? \n            Only if we set x0 negative? \n\n          But we set x0=0? \n\n          Then b0=0, then b1>0 -> x1>= ceil(1/a1) -> since a1>=1, ceil(1/a1)=1.\n\n          Then b1 = a1 * x1 >= a1.\n\n          Then b2> b1>=a1 -> x2>= ceil((b1+1)/a2) \n\n          So we can do:\n\n            b0 = 0\n            moves = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                # We require b_i > b_{i-1}\n                # b_i = x_i * a_i, and we want the smallest positive integer x_i such that x_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n                # That is: x_i = floor(b_{i-1} / a_i) + 1   ??? \n\n                But note: \n                    We require x_i * a_i > b_{i-1}\n                    => x_i > b_{i-1} / a_i\n                The smallest integer x_i is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) + 1.\n\n                Then moves_i = x_i = floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) + 1.\n\n                Then b_i = a_i * (floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) + 1)\n\n                And we add moves_i to the total moves.\n\n            Total moves = 0 (for x0) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (floor(b_{i-1}/a_i)+1)\n\n          Example: a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n            i=1: b0=0 -> x1 = floor(0/2)+1 = 0+1 = 1 -> moves_i=1, b1=2.\n            i=2: b1=2 -> x2 = floor(2/3)+1 = 0+1 = 1 -> moves_i=1, b2=3.\n            i=3: b2=3 -> x3 = floor(3/4)+1 = 0+1 = 1 -> moves_i=1, b3=4.\n            i=4: b3=4 -> x4 = floor(4/5)+1 = 0+1 = 1 -> moves_i=1, b4=5.\n            total moves = 0+1+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n          But what if we set x0 to -1? \n            Then b0 = -1, moves0=1.\n            Then for i=1: we require b1 > -1 -> the smallest nonnegative integer multiple? \n                We can set x1=0? -> b1=0 -> moves1=0.\n                Then i=2: b1=0 -> x2 = floor(0/3)+1 = 1 -> moves2=1, b2=3.\n                Then i=3: b2=3 -> x3= floor(3/4)+1=1 -> moves3=1, b3=4.\n                i=4: x4= floor(4/5)+1=1 -> moves4=1.\n                total moves=1+0+1+1+1=4.\n\n          So we have two options: set x0=0 and then moves=4, or set x0=-1 and then moves=4.\n\n          But what if we set x0=-2? \n            b0=-2, moves0=2.\n            i=1: require b1>-2 -> we can set x1=0 -> b1=0, moves1=0.\n            then same as above -> total=2+0+1+1+1=5.\n\n          So the minimal moves is 4.\n\n          How to find the minimal moves? \n\n          We must choose x0 arbitrarily? \n\n          We can try all possible x0?

\n\n          In the forward part, we started with k=0 and then for the next index (t1+1) we did:\n\n                moves for index t1+1 = (k // a[t1+1] + 1) \n                and then set k = a[t1+1] * (k // a[t1+1] + 1)\n\n          This k is the value at index t1+1? \n\n          Then we used that k for the next.\n\n          But what about the value at index t1? \n\n          In the forward part, we did not set the value at t1. \n\n          Then we have a backward part: \n\n                t2 = t1\n                k = 0\n                while(t2>0):\n                    # TODO\n\n          This backward part is for indices from t1-1 down to 0?

\n\n          But the total moves is the sum of absolute values of the x_i.\n\n          The provided code does:\n\n            for each t1 in [0, m-1]:\n                # set the value at t1 to 0? \n                # then compute the right part (from t1+1 to end) with starting value 0? \n                # then compute the left part (from t1-1 down to 0) with starting value 0? \n\n          But then we require: \n                b_{t1-1} < 0   (if we set b_{t1}=0) and then b_{t1+1} > 0.\n\n          How to compute the left part? \n\n          For the left part, we traverse from t1-1 down to 0:\n\n            We require: \n                b_{i} < b_{i+1}\n\n          Since we are going backwards, we require:\n                b_i < b_{i+1}   => for the backward pass: we are at index i, and we know b_{i+1}, we need to choose x_i such that x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}.\n\n          And we want to minimize |x_i|.\n\n          How? \n            We can set x_i to be the integer that is as close to 0 as possible and satisfies x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}.\n\n          The candidates: \n            If we use positive x_i: then x_i * a_i is positive, but we require it to be less than b_{i+1}. \n            If we use negative x_i: then we can get negative values, which are always less than b_{i+1} (if b_{i+1} is nonnegative) but we want to minimize |x_i|.\n\n          Actually, we want the largest multiple of a_i that is less than b_{i+1}. \n\n          But note: we can also use negative multiples? \n\n          Example: \n            a_i=2, b_{i+1}=0: \n                We require x_i * 2 < 0 -> so x_i must be negative.\n                The largest multiple less than 0? \n                    We want the one closest to 0? \n                    x_i = -1 -> -2, which is <0 -> valid, and |x_i|=1.\n                But we can also set x_i=-2 -> -4, which is also valid, but |x_i|=2 -> worse.\n\n          So we want the negative integer x_i with the smallest absolute value that satisfies x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}. \n\n          How to compute that? \n\n            If b_{i+1} > 0, then we can set x_i=0? \n                Then b_i=0, and 0 < b_{i+1} -> valid, and |x_i|=0.\n\n            But wait: if b_{i+1}=1, then 0<1 -> valid.\n\n            If b_{i+1}=0, then we require b_i<0 -> so x_i must be negative. \n                The largest value for b_i (which is the closest to 0) is -a_i? \n                But we want the smallest |x_i|: \n                    x_i = -1 -> b_i = -a_i, which is <0 -> valid, moves=1.\n\n            If b_{i+1} is negative? \n                We require b_i < b_{i+1} (which is negative). \n                Then we can set x_i to be a negative integer such that x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}. \n                The largest possible b_i (closest to 0) is the largest multiple of a_i that is less than b_{i+1}? \n                But we want the smallest |x_i|? \n\n                Example: a_i=2, b_{i+1} = -3.\n                    We require b_i < -3.\n                    The multiples: \n                        x_i = -2 -> b_i = -4 < -3 -> valid, |x_i|=2.\n                        x_i = -1 -> b_i = -2 -> but -2 is not < -3 -> invalid.\n\n                How to compute?

\n                    But we want the one with the smallest absolute value? \n\n                Note: the absolute value of a negative number is -x_i.\n\n                We want to minimize |x_i| = -x_i, so we want x_i to be as close to 0 as possible (from the negative side) but still < b_{i+1}/a_i.\n\n                The candidate: \n                    x_i = floor((b_{i+1}-1)/a_i)   ??? \n\n                Actually, we want the largest integer that is < b_{i+1}/a_i. That is: floor(b_{i+1}/a_i - 1e-9) = floor((b_{i+1}-1)/a_i) might not be exact.\n\n                We can do: \n                    x_i = floor((b_{i+1}-1) / a_i) \n\n                But then we have: \n                    x_i * a_i <= b_{i+1}-1 < b_{i+1} -> valid.\n\n                But is this the one with the smallest absolute value? \n\n                Example: a_i=2, b_{i+1}=-3:\n                    (b_{i+1}-1)/a_i = (-4)/2 = -2 -> floor(-2) = -2 -> x_i=-2 -> |x_i|=2.\n\n                But what if we try x_i=-1: \n                    -1*2 = -2, which is not < -3 -> invalid.\n\n                So it is the smallest absolute value? \n\n                However, we might have a candidate with a larger absolute value that is also valid? but we want the smallest absolute value.\n\n                So we have to choose the negative integer x_i that is the largest (closest to 0) that is still < b_{i+1}/a_i? \n                    That is: the ceiling of (b_{i+1}/a_i) in the negative direction? \n\n                Actually, we want: \n                    x_i = floor((b_{i+1}-1) / a_i) \n\n                But note: if b_{i+1} is negative, then (b_{i+1}-1)/a_i is more negative.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    We want the largest integer x_i such that x_i * a_i < b_{i+1} -> \n                    x_i = floor( (b_{i+1} - 1) / a_i )   ??? \n\n                Actually, the largest integer strictly less than c is floor(c) - 1 if c is integer? \n\n                But we can use: \n                    x_i = (b_{i+1} - 1) // a_i   if b_{i+1} is not divisible by a_i, then floor((b_{i+1}-1)/a_i) = floor(b_{i+1}/a_i) \n                    but if it is divisible, then we need to subtract 1? \n\n                Actually, we can use: \n                    x_i = (b_{i+1} - 1) // a_i   # integer floor division? \n\n                But note: in Python, floor division for negative is floor? \n\n                Example: (-4)//2 = -2, (-5)//2 = -3.\n\n                We want: \n                    for b_{i+1} = -3, a_i=2: \n                        (-3-1)//2 = (-4)//2 = -2 -> which is what we want.\n\n                But if b_{i+1} = -4, a_i=2: \n                    (-4-1)//2 = -5//2 = -3 -> then b_i = -3*2 = -6 < -4 -> valid, and |x_i|=3.\n                    But we could do x_i=-2: -4, which is not < -4 -> invalid.\n                    x_i=-1: -2, which is not < -4 -> invalid.\n                    so -3 is the only possibility.\n\n                However, is there a possibility with a smaller absolute value? \n                    |x_i|=3 is the smallest? \n\n                But wait: we want the smallest absolute value. The valid x_i are -2, -3, -4, ... but -2 and -1 are not valid. So -3 is the one with the smallest absolute value? \n\n                Actually, the absolute value of -3 is 3, and -4 has absolute value 4, so 3 is the smallest.\n\n                How about: \n                    x_i = ceil(b_{i+1}/a_i) - 1? \n\n                For b_{i+1}=-3, a_i=2: \n                    ceil(-3/2)=ceil(-1.5) = -1, then -1-1 = -2 -> but we saw -2 is not valid.\n\n                So we stick with: \n                    x_i = (b_{i+1}-1) // a_i   [using integer division?]\n\n                But note: we want the floor of (b_{i+1}-1)/a_i, and integer division in Python for negative is floor? \n\n                Example: (b_{i+1}-1) = -4, a_i=2 -> -4//2 = -2 -> correct.\n\n                But if b_{i+1}=3, a_i=2: \n                    we require x_i * 2 < 3 -> x_i can be 0,1? \n                    the smallest |x_i| is 0? \n                    But 0*2=0<3 -> valid.\n\n                How to compute for positive b_{i+1}? \n                    We can set x_i=0? \n                    But our formula: (3-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> then x_i=1 -> |x_i|=1, but we have a better option: 0.\n\n                So we must distinguish: \n\n                  We want the integer x_i that minimizes |x_i| and satisfies x_i * a_i < b_{i+1}.\n\n                  The candidates: \n                    x_i = 0: then 0 < b_{i+1] -> valid if b_{i+1}>0.\n                    x_i = -1: then -a_i < b_{i+1] -> always valid? but if b_{i+1} is very negative, then we might have to use a more negative x_i.\n\n                  Actually, we want the x_i that minimizes |x_i|. \n\n                  The minimal |x_i| is 0 if we can set x_i=0 and 0 < b_{i+1] -> which is true if b_{i+1}>0.\n\n                  If b_{i+1}<=0, then we cannot use 0. Then we consider negative x_i. \n                    We want the negative x_i with the smallest absolute value (i.e., the largest negative number) such that x_i * a_i < b_{i+1] (which is <=0).\n\n                  How to compute that? \n                    We require: x_i * a_i < b_{i+1] \n                    => x_i < b_{i+1] / a_i   (since a_i>0)\n\n                    The largest negative integer (closest to 0) that is < b_{i+1]/a_i is: \n                         x_i = floor( (b_{i+1] - 1) / a_i )   [because we want strictly less]\n\n                  But if b_{i+1] is positive, we use 0.\n\n                  Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    if b_{i+1] > 0:\n                        x_i = 0\n                    else:\n                        x_i = (b_{i+1] - 1) // a_i   # but note: if (b_{i+1]-1) is negative, then // is floor which is what we want.\n\n                  However, what if b_{i+1] is negative and a_i does not divide (b_{i+1]-1)? \n                    Example: b_{i+1] = -3, a_i=2: \n                         (-3-1) = -4, -4//2 = -2 -> then b_i = -2*2 = -4 < -3 -> valid.\n\n                  But what if b_{i+1] = -4, a_i=2: \n                         (-4-1)//2 = -5//2 = -3 -> then b_i = -6 < -4 -> valid.\n\n                  But we want the smallest absolute value.
