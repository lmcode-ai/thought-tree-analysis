(the code does a[i] = a[i] - (a.size()-i) -> 2 - (3-0)= -1 -> then we set to 0? not in the code, but then the next step: Then we do:\n                    add=0\n                    i=0: a[0]=0 -> skip. i=1: a[1]= 2 - (3-1)=2-2=0 -> skip.\n                    i=2: a[2]=1 - (3-2)=1-1=0 -> skip. Then answer = a.size() + add = 3+0=3. But the minimal time is 4.\n\n            Why the discrepancy?",

      "answer": "To solve the first problem, we need to efficiently compute the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each update. The awesomeness of a subsegment is defined as the number of blocks of consecutive identical elements. \n\n### Approach for Program1\n1. **Initial Setup**: The base value for the total awesomeness is the number of all possible subsegments, which is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). This accounts for each subsegment having at least one block.\n2. **Adjacent Pairs Contribution**: For each adjacent pair in the array, if the elements are different, they contribute to the total awesomeness. The contribution of each adjacent pair at index \\( i \\) (0-based) is \\( (i+1) \\times (n - i - 1) \\), representing the number of subsegments that include this pair.\n3. **Handling Queries**: For each query that updates an element at index \\( i \\), we check the adjacent pairs involving this index (left and right). If an update changes the equality of these pairs (from equal to different or vice versa), we adjust the total contribution accordingly by adding or removing the respective pair's contribution.\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```python\n{\"program1\": \"c -= w[ix]\"}\n```\n\n### Approach for Program2\nThe problem involves finding the minimal time to infect an entire tree starting from the root. The infection spreads in two operations per second: spreading (infecting one child per infected parent) and injection (infecting any healthy node).\n\n1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using the parent array, and count the number of children for each node.\n2. **Processing Nodes**: For nodes with children, sort the counts. Adjust these counts by subtracting their position in the sorted list plus two, then set negative values to zero.\n3. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to determine the minimal additional time required beyond the base time (number of nodes with children plus one). The binary search checks if a given time \\( k \\) suffices to cover the remaining infections by reducing each count by \\( k \\) and verifying if the sum of remaining counts is within \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\n```python\n{\"program2\": \"L = mid\"}\n```",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is to support queries that change an element and then output the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\n The awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\n We note that the total awesomeness over all subarrays can be computed by:\n   total = (n*(n+1))//2   [if there were no adjacent differences] \n           plus the contributions from the boundaries between adjacent elements.\n\n Actually, note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus the number of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i] != a[i-1].\n\n Therefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays is:\n   total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1), the number of subarrays that include this adjacent pair and for which a[i] != a[i+1])\n\n The number of subarrays that include the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is: \n   left_count = i   (because the subarray must start at any index from 1 to i)\n   right_count = n - (i+1)  (because the subarray must end at any index from i+1 to n)\n   so total = (i) * (n - i - 1)   [if we consider 0-indexed: the adjacent pair at indices i and i+1 (0-indexed) is included in subarrays that start at [0, i] and end at [i+1, n-1] -> (i+1) * (n - i - 1) ???]\n\n But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n Actually, in 0-indexed:\n   The adjacent pair (i, i+1) is included in a subarray [l, r] if and only if l <= i and r >= i+1.\n   The number of choices for l: from 0 to i -> (i+1) choices.\n   The number of choices for r: from i+1 to n-1 -> (n - i - 1) choices.\n   So the total for the adjacent pair is (i+1) * (n - i - 1).\n\n However, note the initial code has:\n   w = [(i+1)*(n-i-1) for i in range(n-1)]\n\n But wait: the array has n-1 adjacent pairs (from index0 to index1, index1 to index2, ... index(n-2) to index(n-1)).\n For the j-th adjacent pair (0-indexed j from 0 to n-2), the number of subarrays that include it is (j+1) * (n - j - 1) ?\n\n Actually, if j is the index of the first element of the pair (so the pair is at positions j and j+1), then:\n   l can be from 0 to j -> (j+1) choices? Actually, no: the subarray must start at any index from 0 to j and end at any index from j+1 to n-1 -> (j+1) * (n - j - 1).\n\n But note: the code uses:\n   w = [(i+1)*(n-i-1) for i in range(n-1)]\n\n Here, i is the index of the adjacent pair? Actually, the adjacent pairs are at indices 0,1,...,n-2. So for the i-th adjacent pair (i from 0 to n-2), the contribution is (i+1)*(n-i-1).\n\n However, note: the example in the problem: \n   n=5, and the array after first query is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n   The adjacent pairs: \n        (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different -> contributes 1 * (5-0-1) = 1*4 = 4\n        (1,2): 2 and 2 -> same -> contributes 0\n        (2,3): 2 and 4 -> different -> contributes (2+1)*(5-2-1) = 3*2 = 6\n        (3,4): 4 and 5 -> different -> contributes (3+1)*(5-3-1) = 4*1 = 4\n   Then the base total without any adjacent differences is the number of subarrays: n*(n+1)//2 = 15.\n   Then we add the contributions: 4+0+6+4 = 14 -> total = 15+14 = 29, which matches.\n\n Therefore, the current total is stored as:\n   base = (n*(n+1))//2   [which is the base awesomeness if every subarray had no adjacent differences? Actually, no: the base awesomeness for a subarray of length L is 1 (if no adjacent differences) but we are adding the differences. The formula: total_awesomeness = base + (sum of contributions from adjacent pairs that are different).\n\n But note: the base is actually the awesomeness if every adjacent pair was the same? Actually, no: the base is the number of subarrays (because each subarray has at least one block). Then for each adjacent pair that is different, we add 1 for every subarray that includes that adjacent pair? \n\n Actually, the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] = 1 + (# of indices i from l to r-1 such that a[i] != a[i+1]).\n So total_awesomeness = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, the number of subarrays that include that pair).\n\n Therefore, the initial total is:\n   base = n*(n+1)//2   [which is the number of subarrays] \n   plus the contributions from adjacent pairs that are different: for each adjacent pair i (0-indexed) that is different, we add w[i] = (i+1)*(n-i-1).\n\n The code initializes:\n   w = [(i+1)*(n-i-1) for i in range(n-1)]\n   c = sum([w[i] if a[i+1] != a[i] else 0 for i in range(n-1)])\n\n Then the answer for each query is base + c.\n\n However, when we update an element at index `ix` (0-indexed), we might change the adjacent pairs: \n   the left adjacent pair: between index ix-1 and ix (if ix>0)\n   the right adjacent pair: between index ix and ix+1 (if ix < n-1)\n\n So we need to update c accordingly.\n\n Steps for update at index `ix` (0-indexed) to value `x`:\n\n   Let the old value at ix be a[ix] and the new value is x.\n\n   We consider the left adjacent pair (if exists: ix-1 and ix):\n        old: if a[ix-1] != a[ix] then we were adding w[ix-1] to c. Now we set a[ix] to x, so we need to check:\n            if a[ix-1] != x -> then we still want to add w[ix-1] (so no change? but if they were equal before and now different, we add; if they were different and now equal, we remove; etc.)\n        So:\n          if ix != 0:\n            if the old pair (ix-1, ix) was different (a[ix-1] != old_value) and now becomes same (a[ix-1] == x) -> then we remove w[ix-1] from c.\n            if the old pair was same (a[ix-1] == old_value) and now becomes different (a[ix-1] != x) -> then we add w[ix-1] to c.\n\n   Similarly for the right adjacent pair (ix and ix+1):\n        if ix != n-1:\n            if the old pair (ix, ix+1) was different (old_value != a[ix+1]) and now becomes same (x == a[ix+1]) -> remove w[ix] from c.\n            if the old pair was same (old_value == a[ix+1]) and now becomes different (x != a[ix+1]) -> add w[ix] to c.\n\n However, note: the code already has:\n\n   if ix != 0:\n        if a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x: \n            This condition: \n                a[ix] (old) is equal to a[ix-1] (which is the same as the old value) and we are changing to x which is different from a[ix-1]? \n            Actually, the condition is written as: \n                if a[ix] == a[ix-1] and x != a[ix-1] -> then we are breaking the equality -> so we add w[ix-1] (because now they become different, so we add the contribution that we were not adding before).\n\n            But note: the condition says: \"a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x\" -> that is equivalent to (a[ix] == a[ix-1] and a[ix-1] != x) -> which implies a[ix] != x? and also a[ix-1] != x.\n\n            Actually, we are setting a[ix] to x. So if the old state was equal and the new state is not equal (because x != a[ix-1]), then we need to add the contribution for this adjacent pair.\n\n        Similarly, \n        elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] and x == a[ix-1]: \n            Then we are making them equal, so we remove the contribution.\n\n        But the code has:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x: \n                c += w[ix-1]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x: \n                c -= w[ix-1]\n\n        However, note: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x\" is equivalent to (a[ix] != a[ix-1] and a[ix-1] == x). But note: we are setting a[ix] to x. So after the update, the adjacent pair becomes (a[ix-1], x) = (x, x) -> same. So we remove.\n\n        But wait: what if the old state was different and the new state becomes same? Then we remove.\n\n        However, the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x\" is not the only way to become same? What if a[ix-1] was not equal to the old a[ix] but becomes equal to the new x? That is exactly the condition: \n            old: a[ix] != a[ix-1]\n            new: we set a[ix] to x, and if x == a[ix-1] then they become equal.\n\n        So the condition is correct.\n\n   Similarly for the right adjacent pair:\n\n        if ix != n-1:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n                Then we break the equality -> so we add w[ix] (because now they become different: x != a[ix+1]).\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                Then we make them equal -> so we remove w[ix].\n\n        But note: the condition for the right adjacent pair: \n            The adjacent pair is (a[ix], a[ix+1]). \n            Old: if they were equal and now we set a[ix] to x which is not equal to a[ix+1] -> then we break the equality -> add.\n            Old: if they were not equal and now we set a[ix] to x which is equal to a[ix+1] -> then we make them equal -> remove.\n\n        However, the condition in the code for the right adjacent pair is:\n\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                c -= w[ix]\n\n        But note: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is equivalent to (a[ix] != a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] == x). This is the condition for removal.\n\n        However, there is a problem: what if the old value a[ix] was not equal to a[ix+1] and we set it to x, and x is equal to a[ix+1]? Then we remove.\n\n        But what if the old value a[ix] was equal to a[ix+1] and we set it to x which is not equal to a[ix+1]? Then we add.\n\n        So the conditions are correct.\n\n   However, note: the code has a TODO for the right adjacent pair: we are missing the code for the removal in the right adjacent pair.\n\n   The code currently for the right adjacent pair:\n\n        if ix != n-1:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We need to complete the TODO: we should subtract w[ix] in that case.\n\n   So we write: c -= w[ix]\n\n   But note: the condition is \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\", which means we are going to set a[ix] to x and then the adjacent pair becomes (x, a[ix+1]) = (x, x) -> same, so we remove the contribution that was previously there (because the old state was different so we were adding w[ix]). Therefore, we subtract w[ix].\n\n   However, note: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is true only when the old value a[ix] is not equal to a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] is equal to x. Then we set a[ix] to x, so the adjacent pair becomes (x, a[ix+1]) = (x, x) -> same. So we remove the contribution w[ix] that we were adding for that adjacent pair.\n\n   Therefore, we complete the TODO with: c -= w[ix]\n\n   But note: what if the adjacent pair was not being counted because it was same? Actually, no: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1]\" in the elif branch means that currently (before update) we are counting this adjacent pair (so we are adding w[ix] in the total c). Then we are going to set a[ix] to x which equals a[ix+1], so we remove.\n\n   So the code for the right adjacent pair should be:\n\n        if ix != n-1:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] == x:   # but note: the condition is written as \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\", which is the same as (a[ix] != a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] == x)\n                c -= w[ix]\n\n   However, the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is equivalent to (a[ix] != a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] == x). So we can write:\n\n        elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n            c -= w[ix]\n\n   But note: what if the adjacent pair becomes same in a different way? For example, if the old state was same and we break it? That is handled by the first condition.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line is: c -= w[ix]\n\n   However, note: the code already has the left adjacent pair handled similarly.\n\n   After updating the adjacent pairs, we update the array: a[ix] = x.\n\n   Then we output: base + c = (n*(n+1))//2 + c.\n\n   But note: the base is constant? Actually, the base is the number of subarrays, which is fixed.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n        In the right adjacent pair removal: c -= w[ix]\n\n   However, note: the condition might be written in a way that is not safe? For example, if the adjacent pair was same and we break it, we add. If it was different and we make it same, we subtract. But what if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is still same? Then we do nothing. Similarly for different.\n\n   The conditions are written with if and elif, so we cover the two cases that change.\n\n   But note: what if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is still same? Then we do nothing. Similarly, if it was different and we set it to a value that is still different? Then we do nothing.\n\n   So the update is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the right adjacent pair: \n        if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n            then we break the same -> so we add w[ix] (because now they become different? but wait: we set a[ix] to x, and x != a[ix+1] -> so they become different -> we add the contribution that we were not adding before).\n\n        But note: if the adjacent pair was same, then we were not adding w[ix] (because we only add when they are different). After the update, they become different, so we start adding w[ix]. Therefore, we add w[ix] to c.\n\n        Similarly, the other condition: \n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                then we set a[ix] to x, and x == a[ix+1] -> so they become same. Therefore, we remove the w[ix] that we were adding.\n\n   But note: what if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is different? Then we break the same -> we add. \n        Condition: a[ix] == a[ix+1] and x != a[ix+1] -> then we break. This is the first condition.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is same? Then we make it same -> we remove. \n        Condition: a[ix] != a[ix+1] and x == a[ix+1] -> then we make same. This is the second condition.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is same? Then we do nothing.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is different? Then we do nothing.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is same? Then we do nothing.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is same? Then we remove.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was same and we set it to a value that is different? Then we add.\n\n        What if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is different? Then we do nothing.\n\n        But note: the condition for the right adjacent pair: \n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n                -> then we break the same -> add.\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                -> then we make same -> remove.\n\n        However, what if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is different, but the new value is not equal to a[ix+1]? Then we do nothing. But what if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is different, but the new value is equal to a[ix+1]? Then we make it same -> that is the second condition.\n\n        Actually, the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is only one way to make it same: when the new value x equals a[ix+1]. But what if the adjacent pair was different and we set it to a value that is different from a[ix+1]? Then we do nothing.\n\n        So the conditions are correct.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing line is: c -= w[ix]\n\n   But note: the code for the left adjacent pair is already complete. The TODO is only for the right adjacent pair.\n\n   So we write: \n        program1: \"c -= w[ix]\"\n\n   However, note: the code for the left adjacent pair has an elif condition and then the code for the right adjacent pair has an elif condition. We must be cautious: the condition for the right adjacent pair might be written in a way that is not symmetric? Actually, the condition for the left adjacent pair was:\n\n        if a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x: \n            c += w[ix-1]\n        elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x: \n            c -= w[ix-1]\n\n   And for the right adjacent pair we have:\n\n        if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n            c += w[ix]\n        elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n            c -= w[ix]\n\n   This is symmetric.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \"c -= w[ix]\"\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: minimal seconds to infect a rooted tree (with root 1). The process: \n   Each second:\n        Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, you can choose at most one additional child to infect (so you can infect one more child of v if there is at least one already infected child).\n        Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\n   We start with no infected, and we want the entire tree infected.\n\n   We note that we can do injections arbitrarily (any healthy vertex). The spreading operation: we can only spread to one additional child per vertex per second, and only if at least one child is already infected.\n\n   We can think greedily: \n        We start by injecting the root? But note: we can start by injecting any vertex. However, the root is special because the spreading operation from the root can then start.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n        We note that the problem has been solved in known contests (Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2), problem D). \n\n   Known solution idea:\n        We can consider that the infection starts at the root (by an injection at time 0? but note: the problem says initially all are healthy, so we must inject the root at some second). \n\n        However, we can also start by infecting a non-root. But note: the root is the only vertex without a parent. The spreading operation: a vertex v can only be infected by spreading if at least one child is infected? Actually, no: the spreading operation: for a vertex v, if at least one child is infected, then we can choose to infect one more child. But note: the parent of a vertex is the one that can spread to it? Actually, the problem says: the parent of a vertex v (different from root) is the previous vertex on the path from the root to v. The children are the ones for which v is the parent.\n\n        Therefore, the spreading operation: \n            For a vertex v, if at least one of its children is infected, then we can choose to infect one more child (if there is a healthy child) in the next spreading operation.\n\n        How does the infection spread? \n            The infection can be started by injections. Then, once a vertex is infected, it can help its parent to spread to its siblings.\n\n        We can model the infection as:\n            We start by injecting the root at time 0? Actually, we can start by injecting any vertex. However, the root is the one that can spread to all its children. \n\n        Known solution: \n            We can do a DFS and compute the following:\n\n            Let f(u) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree rooted at u, assuming that we start by having u infected at time 0? Actually, we have to consider the process.\n\n        Alternatively, we note that the total time is determined by the maximum time at which a leaf gets infected.\n\n        However, the constraints: total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            counter = defaultdict(int)\n\n            def solve(a):\n                for ai in a:\n                    counter[ai] += 1\n                count = list(counter.values())\n                num_level = len(count)\n                count.sort()\n\n                for i in range(num_level):\n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n                ...\n\n        What is `a`? The input for a test case: \n            The first integer n, then a list of n-1 integers: the parent of vertex 2, vertex 3, ... vertex n.\n\n        The code uses:\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                counter.clear()\n                res = solve(a.split())\n\n        So `a.split()` is the list of n-1 parent indices (as strings). \n\n        The code then:\n            counts the frequency of each parent? Actually, it counts the frequency of each value in the list of parents.\n\n        What does that represent? \n            The list of parents: for vertex i (from 2 to n) we have the parent p_i. \n            The frequency of a value v in this list is the number of children of vertex v (if v=1, then it's the root's children; if v is not in the list, then it has 0 children).\n\n        But note: the root (vertex 1) is not in the list? The list starts from vertex 2. So we must account for the root.\n\n        Actually, the root (vertex 1) will appear in the list as the parent of some vertices. So the frequency of 1 is the number of children of the root.\n\n        However, the root itself is not included in the list? The list has the parents of vertices 2 to n. The root (vertex 1) is the parent of some of these, so it will appear.\n\n        Therefore, the `counter` counts the out-degree (number of children) for each vertex that is a parent. But note: a leaf vertex (with no children) will not appear in the list? So we are missing the leaves.\n\n        Actually, we are only counting the vertices that are parents of at least one vertex. The root is included.\n\n        But the problem: we need to consider the entire tree. The provided code then:\n\n            count = list(counter.values())\n            num_level = len(count)   # this is the number of vertices that have at least one child? \n\n        Then it sorts the list.\n\n        Then for i in range(num_level):\n            count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n        Then it does a binary search on a variable R (which is the maximum value in the list after the subtraction) to find the minimal k such that ...?\n\n        Then the answer is: num_level + 1 + R\n\n        Why?\n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) D) is:\n\n            We start by infecting the root (so we do an injection at time 0 to the root). Then we have the root infected at time 0.\n\n            Then, we consider the children of the root. For each child, we can either inject it or spread to it. But note: the spreading operation: at each second, after the spreading operation, we can also do an injection.\n\n            The process:\n\n                Time 0: inject root -> root infected.\n\n                Then for each second t (starting at 1):\n\n                    Spreading: for each vertex that has at least one infected child, we can choose to spread to one more child. \n                    Injection: we can inject one healthy vertex.\n\n                How to minimize the time?\n\n            Alternate known solution:\n\n                Step 1: We note that we start with the root infected. Then we have a list of the children of the root. Let the root have k children. Then we can represent the time at which each child gets infected.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    We can inject some of the children and then use spreading for the others.\n\n                However, the spreading from the root: at time t (for t>=1), if at time t-1 at least one child of the root is infected, then at the spreading phase of time t we can infect one more child of the root.\n\n                Therefore, the infection of the children of the root:\n\n                    We can inject one child at time 1 (injection at time 1) -> then at time 1 (after injection) that child is infected.\n                    Then at time 2: \n                         spreading: we can spread to one more child (because the root has one infected child) -> so we infect a second child at time 2 (by spreading).\n                         then we can inject a third child at time 2 (injection phase) -> so the third child is infected at time 2.\n\n                    Then at time 3:\n                         spreading: we can spread to a fourth child (because the root has two infected children) -> infect the fourth child at time 3.\n                         injection: we can inject a fifth child at time 3.\n\n                So the pattern: \n                    The first child: injected at time 1.\n                    The second child: spread at time 2 (so we don't use an injection for it) -> but note we also inject a third child at time 2.\n\n                Actually, we can interleave injections and spreading.\n\n                Known solution from known contest:\n\n                    We consider the children of the root. Let the root have k children. Then we can assign an infection time for each child.\n\n                    We start by infecting the root at time 0.\n\n                    Then, we have k children. We can assign:\n\n                         Some children are infected by injection, and some by spreading.\n\n                    But note: the spreading from the root can only happen after at least one child is infected (by injection). Then at each second, we can spread to one more child (if we have at least one infected child) and we can also inject one more.\n\n                    Therefore, the infection of the children of the root:\n\n                         We must inject at least one child to start the spreading.\n\n                         Then, for the remaining k-1 children, we can either inject them or spread to them.\n\n                         However, the spreading from the root can only happen once per second, and we can also inject one per second.\n\n                    Therefore, the time to infect all children of the root:\n\n                         We start at time 0: root infected.\n\n                         Time 1: inject one child -> infected children: root and child1.\n\n                         Then at time 2: we can spread to one child (child2) and inject one child (child3) -> then we have 3 children infected.\n\n                         Then at time 3: we can spread to one child (child4) and inject one child (child5) -> then we have 5 children.\n\n                    But note: we have k children. The time to infect the i-th child (if we count the injections and spreads appropriately) is:\n\n                         The first child: time 1.\n                         The next two children: time 2.\n                         The next two children: time 3.\n                         ...\n\n                    Actually, after the first child, we can infect two children per second: one by spreading and one by injection.\n\n                    However, the spreading operation: we can only spread to one child per second per vertex? And we have the root that can spread to one child per second.\n\n                    Therefore, the time to infect the entire set of children of the root is:\n\n                         Let t be the time when the last child is infected.\n\n                         The number of children infected by injection: we can do one per second (except the first second we do one, and then we can do one per second along with a spread).\n\n                         The number of children infected by spreading: we can do one per second (starting at time 2).\n\n                    So the total children infected by time t:\n\n                         injections: t   (because we can inject one per second from time 1 to time t)\n                         spreads: t-1   (because we start spreading at time 2, and we can do one per second until time t: so from time 2 to t -> t-1 spreads)\n\n                    Therefore, total children = t + (t-1) = 2t-1.\n\n                    We need 2t-1 >= k  => t >= (k+1)//2.\n\n                    But note: we might not use all the injections? Actually, we can choose to use injections arbitrarily.\n\n                    However, we must have at least one injection to start the spreading.\n\n                    But the above formula: if k=1, then 2t-1>=1 -> t>=1 -> so time 1.\n\n                    How? \n                         Time 1: inject the only child -> done.\n\n                    If k=2: \n                         We need 2t-1>=2 -> t>=1.5 -> so t=2.\n                         How? \n                             Time 1: inject child1 -> then at time 2: we can spread to child2? But note: at time 2, the spreading operation: the root has one infected child (child1) so we can spread to child2. Then we don't need an injection at time 2? \n                         But we can also do: \n                             Time 1: inject child1 -> then at time 2: we do spreading: spread to child2 -> then we are done.\n\n                         So the last child is infected at time 2.\n\n                    If k=3:\n                         2t-1>=3 -> t>=2 -> so t=2: 2*2-1=3 -> so time 2.\n                         How?\n                             Time 1: inject child1 -> then at time 2: we can spread to child2 and then inject child3? \n                         But note: the spreading operation: we can only spread one per vertex per second. So at time 2: \n                             Spreading: we spread to child2 (because the root has one infected child, so we can spread to one more) -> then we have child1 and child2.\n                             Injection: we inject child3.\n                         So at time 2, we have three children infected.\n\n                    Therefore, the time for the root's children is ceil((k+1)/2)? Actually, for k=1: (1+1)/2=1 -> ceil(1)=1; k=2: (2+1)/2=1.5 -> ceil=2; k=3: (3+1)/2=2 -> ceil=2; k=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 -> ceil=3.\n\n                    But note: the formula 2t-1>=k -> t = ceil((k+1)/2).\n\n            However, the problem is not only about the root. We have a tree. The infection spreads from the root to the children, and then the children become new sources of spreading.\n\n            We can use a DFS to compute the time for each subtree.\n\n            Known solution (from known contest) for this problem:\n\n                We do:\n\n                  Let deg[i] = number of children of i.\n\n                  Then we create an array: \n                      arr = [ deg[1], deg[2], ... , deg[k] ] for all nodes that have at least one child? Actually, we consider all nodes? But note: the root is included.\n\n                  Then we sort the array in descending order? Actually, the provided code sorts in ascending order? \n\n                The provided code:\n\n                  count = list(counter.values())\n                  num_level = len(count)\n                  count.sort()   # sorts in increasing order\n\n                  for i in range(num_level):\n                      count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                Then we do a binary search on the maximum value in count (which is count[-1]) to find the minimal k such that ...?\n\n                Then the answer is num_level + 1 + R, where R is the result of the binary search.\n\n            Explanation from known contest solution:\n\n                We start by infecting the root at time 0. Then we have a list of the degrees (number of children) for each node. We sort the degrees in descending order? But the code sorts in increasing order? \n\n                Actually, the known solution (from Codeforces) for problem \"Infection of a Tree\" (or similar) is:\n\n                  vector<int> a;\n                  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    if (deg[i] > 0) {\n                      a.push_back(deg[i]);\n                    }\n                  }\n                  sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());\n                  for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {\n                    a[i] += i + 1;   // then we take the maximum over a, and then the answer is max(a, ...) \n                  }\n                  ans = max((int)a.size() + 1, *max_element(a.begin(), a.end()));\n\n                But that is different.\n\n            Alternatively, we have:\n\n                We consider the entire process. The infection starts at the root (time 0). Then we have:\n\n                  Time 1: we inject one of the children of the root? Or we can inject anywhere? Actually, we can inject any healthy vertex. But the root is already infected.\n\n                The known solution:\n\n                  We note that the spreading operation: for a node u, if at time t we have at least one child of u infected, then at time t+1 we can spread to one more child.\n\n                  Therefore, the infection of the children of a node u: \n\n                      Let u be infected at time t0.\n\n                      Then we have k children. We can assign:\n\n                          The first child must be infected by injection (or by spreading from below? but note: the children are below, so we cannot spread from below until they are infected) -> actually, we can also use spreading from the child's own children? \n\n                  This becomes complex.\n\n            After reading known solutions for Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) D, we have:\n\n                #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                using namespace std;\n\n                void solve() {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    vector<int> p(n);\n                    vector<int> deg(n);\n                    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> p[i];\n                        p[i]--;\n                        deg[p[i]]++;\n                    }\n                    vector<int> a;\n                    a.push_back(1); // the root has one \"infection start\" (itself) at time 0?

\n\n            The binary search is for the minimal k (which is the variable R in the binary search) such that check(k) is True.\n\n            The check function: \n                We have a list `count` (which is the list of the degrees (number of children) for each node that has at least one child, and then we subtracted (i+2) for the i-th in sorted order? and then we set negative to 0).\n\n                Then in check(k): \n                    We set b[i] = max(count[i] - k, 0)\n                    Then we check if the sum of b is <= k.\n\n            What does this represent?\n\n            Let me try with a small example: the root has 3 children.\n\n                Then the list `a` (the input) has the parent of 2,3,4: if they are all 1, then counter[1] = 3.\n\n                Then count = [3]\n                num_level = 1.\n\n                Then for i=0: count[0] = max(3 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(1,0)=1.\n\n                Then R = max(count)=1.\n\n                Then we do binary search: L=0, R=1 -> while R-L>1? no, so skip.\n\n                Then return num_level+1+R = 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n                But what is the minimal time for a tree with root and 3 children? \n                    Time 0: infect root.\n                    Time 1: inject one child -> infected: root, child1.\n                    Time 2: spread to child2 (from root) and inject child3 -> infected: all.\n\n                So total time = 2 seconds? \n\n                But the answer is 3? \n\n            Alternatively, the known solution from the known contest (the C++ code) for a root with 3 children:\n\n                deg[0] = 3 (if root is index0) -> then a = [1, 3] (because the root has deg>0, so we push 3; and we also push 1? why 1? the C++ code pushes 1 initially: a.push_back(1). Then sort in descending order: [3,1]. Then for i=0: a[0]=3 - (2-0) = 3-2=1; for i=1: a[1]=1 - (2-1)=1-1=0. Then t = a.size()=2. Then we do:\n\n                    add=0, mx=0.\n                    i=0: a[0]=1 > add(0) -> then diff=1, add=1.\n                    i=1: a[1]=0 <= add(1) -> skip.\n                    then answer = t+add = 2+1=3.\n\n            So the known solution also returns 3.\n\n            Why 3? \n\n                The process:\n\n                  Time 0: we inject the root? Actually, the problem says we start with no infected. We must infect the root by injection at time 0? But the problem says: each second we do spreading then injection. \n\n                  Time 0: not defined? \n\n                Actually, we start at time 0 with no infected. Then:\n\n                  Time 1: \n                      Injection: we inject the root -> root infected.\n                  Time 2:\n                      Spreading: the root has no infected child (because we haven't infected any child) -> so we cannot spread.\n                      Injection: we inject one child (say child1) -> now root and child1 infected.\n                  Time 3:\n                      Spreading: the root has one infected child -> we can spread to child2.\n                      Injection: we inject child3.\n                  Then at the end of time 3, all are infected.\n\n                So 3 seconds.\n\n            Therefore, the answer 3 is correct.\n\n            Now, what does the provided code do?\n\n                It returns 3 for the example.\n\n            How does the provided code work?\n\n                We have count = [3] -> then after subtraction: [1] (because 3-0-2=1).\n                Then we do:\n\n                    if R==0: skip.\n                    Then we do binary search: \n                         L=0, R=1 -> the while loop condition (R-L>1) is false -> so we break and return 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n            Now, what if we have a more complex tree?\n\n                Example: n=5, tree: \n                    root (1) has two children: 2 and 3.\n                    child 2 has one child: 4.\n\n                Then the input: \n                    n=5\n                    parents: for vertex2:1, vertex3:1, vertex4:2, vertex5:? -> wait, the input has n-1 numbers: p2, p3, p4, p5.\n\n                Let the tree: \n                    vertex1: root\n                    vertex2: parent=1\n                    vertex3: parent=1\n                    vertex4: parent=2\n                    vertex5: parent=2\n\n                Then the list of parents: [1,1,2,2] (for vertices 2,3,4,5).\n\n                Then counter: \n                    counter[1] = 2 (because 1 appears twice: as parent of 2 and 3)\n                    counter[2] = 2 (as parent of 4 and 5)\n\n                Then count = [2,2] -> sorted: [2,2]\n                num_level = 2.\n\n                Then for i=0: count[0] = max(2-0-2,0)=0.\n                         i=1: count[1] = max(2-1-2,0)=max(-1,0)=0.\n\n                Then R = max(count)=0 -> then the code returns num_level+1+R = 2+1+0 = 3.\n\n                But what is the minimal time?\n\n                  Time1: inject root -> root infected.\n                  Time2: \n                         spreading: root has no infected child -> skip.\n                         injection: inject child2 -> infected: root, child2.\n                  Time3:\n                         spreading: \n                             root: has one infected child (child2) -> we can spread to child3? (we choose to spread to child3) -> infect child3.\n                             child2: has no infected child? -> skip.\n                         injection: inject child4? \n                  Then at time3: infected: root, child2, child3, child4 -> but we have child5 not infected.\n\n                  Time4:\n                         spreading:\n                             root: has two infected children -> we can spread to one more? but there are no more children of the root? \n                             child2: has one infected child (child4) -> we can spread to child5.\n                         injection: inject ... but we don't need? \n                  So at time4, child5 is infected.\n\n                Total time: 4 seconds.\n\n                But the code returns 3.\n\n            What is the known solution (C++ code) for this example?\n\n                deg[0] (root) = 2 (children:2,3)\n                deg[1] (vertex2) = 2 (children:4,5) -> note: vertex index: root=0, vertex2=1, vertex3=2, vertex4=3, vertex5=4.\n\n                Then a = [1] initially? Then push deg[i] for i with deg[i]>0: \n                    push 2 (for root) and push 2 (for vertex2) -> a = [1,2,2] \n                Then sort in descending order: [2,2,1]\n                Then for i=0: a[0]=2 - (3-0) = 2-3 = -1 -> 0? (the code does a[i] = a[i] - (a.size()-i) -> 2 - (3-0)= -1 -> then we set to 0? not in the code, but then the next step: \n                Then we do:\n                    add=0\n                    i=0: a[0]=0 -> skip.\n                    i=1: a[1]= 2 - (3-1)=2-2=0 -> skip.\n                    i=2: a[2]=1 - (3-2)=1-1=0 -> skip.\n                Then answer = a.size() + add = 3+0=3.\n\n            But the minimal time is 4.\n\n            Why the discrepancy?\n\n            Let me recount the known solution from the known contest: \n\n                The known solution (from the editorial) for the problem \"Infection of a Tree\" in Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) is:\n\n                  We start by infecting the root at time 0? Actually, the editorial might be different.\n\n            After checking, the problem in the contest was: \"Tree Infection\", and the solution:\n\n                  Step 1: We count the number of children for each node. We also note that the root must be infected (so we start by infecting the root at time 0?).\n\n                  Step 2: We consider the nodes that have at least one child. We sort the list of the number of children (for these nodes) in descending order.\n\n                  Step 3: We create an array b: \n                         b_i = (the number of children of node i) - (the number of nodes with at least as many children as node i) \n                         and then we take the maximum of (b_i) and then ... \n\n            The known solution in the editorial is:\n\n                  Let f(v) be the number of children of v.\n\n                  We create an array a = [ f(v) for each node v that has at least one child ]\n\n                  Then we do:\n\n                      a.sort(reverse=True)\n                      a.insert(0, 1)   # for the root? \n\n                  Then we let t = 0.\n                  Then for i, x in enumerate(a):\n                      t = max(t, x + i + 1)\n\n                  Then we do an additional step: we consider that we can use spreading to reduce the time? \n\n            Actually, the known solution in the editorial for \"Tree Infection\" is:\n\n                  #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                  using namespace std;\n\n                  int main() {\n                    int t;\n                    cin >> t;\n                    while (t--) {\n                      int n;\n                      cin >> n;\n                      vector<int> a(n);\n                      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n                        int p;\n                        cin >> p;\n                        p--;\n                        a[p]++;\n                      }\n                      a.erase(remove(a.begin(), a.end(), 0), a.end());\n                      a.push_back(1); // for the root\n                      sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());\n                      int ans = 0;\n                      for (int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {\n                        a[i] = a[i] + i + 1;\n                        ans = max(ans, a[i]);\n                      }\n                      // then we do a greedy: we have a list of \"events\" that happen at time a[i] - something?\n                      // actually, the editorial does:\n                      //   we then consider that we can do additional injections to non-root nodes? \n                      //   but the above ans is the initial time.\n\n                      // Then we do:\n                      int cnt = 0;\n                      for (int x : a) {\n                        if (x > ans) {\n                          cnt += (x - ans);\n                        }\n                      }\n                      ans += (cnt + 1) / 2; // because we can do at most one extra per second? \n                      cout << ans << endl;\n                    }\n                  }\n\n            But this is not matching.\n\n            Given the complexity, and the provided code in the problem, we trust the provided code and complete the TODO.\n\n            The TODO in program2.py is in the binary search:\n\n                while R - L > 1:\n                    mid = (R + L) // 2\n                    if check(mid):\n                        R = mid\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The binary search is for the minimal R such that check(R) is True.\n\n            If check(mid) is True, then we set R=mid (so we try to find a smaller R).\n\n            If check(mid) is False, then we need to search in the larger half, so we set L = mid.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO is: L = mid\n\n            So we write: L = mid\n\n            Why? \n\n                We are doing:\n\n                  L = 0, R = max_count (which is the maximum value in the list `count` after the subtraction)\n\n                  We want the minimal R such that check(R) is True.\n\n                  The condition: \n                      if check(mid) is True -> then we can try a smaller R: so we set R=mid.\n                      else -> then we need a larger R: so we set L=mid.\n\n            Therefore, the missing line is: L = mid\n\n            But note: the binary search condition: while R - L > 1, and then we return R.\n\n            Then the answer is num_level + 1 + R.\n\n            Let me test with the first example: root with 3 children.\n\n                count = [3] -> after subtraction: [1] -> R = 1.\n                Then we skip the binary search (since R-L=1-0=1, which is not >1) and return 1+1+1=3.\n\n            The second example: the tree with 5 nodes (root with 2 children, and one of them has 2 children) -> \n                count = [2,2] -> after subtraction: [0,0] -> R=0 -> then the code returns 2+1+0=3, but the minimal time is 4.\n\n            This indicates the provided code might be flawed for that example.\n\n            However, the problem states: \"the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200000\", and the example with n=5 is small.\n\n            But the known solution from the known contest (the C++ code that passed) for the example n=5 (tree: root with two children, and one child has two children) gives 3, but the minimal time is 4.\n\n            This suggests that the provided code in the problem might be for a different approach.\n\n            Given the instructions, we must complete the TODO as per the code structure.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing line is: L = mid\n\n            But note: the example with n=5 might be handled differently in the provided code? \n\n            How does the provided code handle the example n=5?\n\n                The list of parents: [1,1,2,2] -> then counter: \n                    counter[1]=2, counter[2]=2.\n                Then count = [2,2] -> sorted: [2,2]\n                Then for i in range(2): \n                    i=0: count[0] = max(2-0-2,0)=0\n                    i=1: count[1] = max(2-1-2,0)=0\n                Then R = 0 -> then the code returns 2+1+0 = 3.\n\n            And the minimal time is 4, so the code is giving 3 for a tree that requires 4 seconds.\n\n            This indicates the provided code might be incorrect for that example.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200000\", and the example is included in the constraints.\n\n            But note: the problem also says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 200000\". In our example, n=5, so it is small.\n\n            Given the instructions, we are only to complete the TODO, not to change the algorithm.\n\n            Therefore, we complete the TODO with \"L = mid\".\n\n            So for program2.py, the missing code is: L = mid\n\n            But note: the code after the binary search returns R, and then the answer is num_level+1+R.\n\n            We trust the overall structure.\n\nSummary:\n\n   program1: \"c -= w[ix]\"\n   program2: \"L = mid\"\n\n   We output in JSON format.\n\n   Note: the example for program1: the provided example after the first query is [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29. The code with the completed line should work.\n\n   For program2: the provided example might be flawed, but we complete the TODO as per the code.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\"program1\": \"c -= w[ix]\", \"program2\": \"L = mid\"}"
