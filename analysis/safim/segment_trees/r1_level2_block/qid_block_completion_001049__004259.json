    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is (length) if the sum is positive, 0 if zero, and -(length) if negative.\n\nThe provided code uses a dynamic programming approach with coordinate compression and two Fenwick trees (one for positive and one for negative) and also a dictionary to store the best dp for a given prefix sum.\n\nThe note in the code says: \n    \"if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\"\n\nWe should update the dictionary for the current prefix sum.\n\nSo we add:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the dictionary `dmx` is used to store the best dp value for a given prefix sum. So we update it.\n\nHowever, note that the condition is: if the current dp[i] is greater than the current value for pref[i] in dmx, then update.\n\nBut we can also note that we are updating the Fenwick trees and the dictionary. The dictionary is for the same prefix sum.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so we can do this.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are solving a puzzle rearrangement problem. The current code uses a greedy method with two accumulators s1 and s2 for the two rows.\n\nThe idea is to traverse the columns and adjust the differences by accumulating in s1 and s2. The code already handles one case: when we can reduce the absolute sum by moving from one row to the other? Specifically, when the condition `abs(s1 + s2) < abs(s1) + abs(s2)` holds, we try to adjust.\n\nIn the if-block, if abs(s1) <= abs(s2), we do:\n    out += abs(s1)\n    s2 += s1\n    s1 = 0\n\nSimilarly, we should handle the else case: when abs(s1) > abs(s2). Then we do the symmetric operation:\n\n    out += abs(s2)\n    s1 += s2\n    s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the condition `abs(s1 + s2) < abs(s1) + abs(s2)` is true when s1 and s2 have opposite signs? Actually, it's always true that |a+b| <= |a|+|b|, and equality holds when they have the same sign or one is zero. So the condition is equivalent to when they have opposite signs? Actually, the condition is checking if the absolute value of the sum is strictly less than the sum of absolute values. This happens exactly when both s1 and s2 are non-zero and have opposite signs.\n\nBut note: the code has an if-block for when the condition holds. Then we try to reduce the absolute values by transferring as much as possible from the row with the smaller absolute difference to the other? Actually, the code does:\n\n    if abs(s1) <= abs(s2):\n        out += abs(s1)   # because we are going to move |s1| units from row0 to row1? \n        s2 += s1         # so we add s1 to s2 (which might reduce the absolute value of s2 if they are opposite)\n        s1 = 0\n\nSimilarly, in the else branch we should do:\n\n    out += abs(s2)\n    s1 += s2\n    s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the example in the note does not show this exact logic, but the idea is to cancel out as much as possible.\n\nHowever, the problem says: we can swap neighboring cells. The current approach is to use a greedy that at each column we adjust the two rows by moving the imbalances. The key is that we can swap vertically (between the two rows in the same column) and horizontally (between adjacent columns). The algorithm is known from known problems (like CodeForces problem \"Puzzle From the Future\" or similar) and the solution is to use a state (s1, s2) and at each column update the state and then try to cancel.\n\nSo the missing block for the else branch is:\n\n    else:\n        out += abs(s2)\n        s1 += s2\n        s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the example in the problem has 5 moves. We must be cautious.\n\nHowever, the provided code already has the following structure:\n\n    for x in range(n):\n        out += abs(s1) + abs(s2)   # This line is before updating the current column? Actually, it's at the beginning of the loop for column x.\n\n        Then we update s1 and s2 by the current column's current and desired.\n\n        Then if the condition holds, we do the transfer.\n\nBut the condition is: `if abs(s1 + s2) < abs(s1) + abs(s2)`\n\nThis condition is equivalent to: s1 and s2 have opposite signs and both are non-zero? Actually, |a+b| < |a|+|b| if and only if a and b have opposite signs. So we are in the case where we can cancel some of the imbalance.\n\nIn the else branch, we do the symmetric.\n\nBut note: after the transfer, we set one of the accumulators to zero? Actually, we set the one we transferred from to zero and the other becomes the sum.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        else:\n            out += abs(s2)\n            s1 += s2\n            s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the problem says that if it's impossible, we output -1. The code already checks at the end if s1 and s2 are zero.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nHowever, note that in program1.py, the missing code is just one line, and in program2.py, the missing code is three lines (with proper indentation).\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified JSON.\n\nSo:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nBut note: the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and we are replacing that with the line. Also, note the indentation: it is inside the if block and the for loop.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is:\n\n        else:\n            out += abs(s2)\n            s1 += s2\n            s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and we are replacing that with the three lines. The indentation level is 12 (because the if block is already indented by 8, and the else should be at the same level as the if). However, in the provided code, the if block is indented by 8 (from the for loop that is 4, and then the if is 8). So the else should be at the same level.\n\nBut the provided code in program2.py for the if branch is:\n\n            if abs(s1) <= abs(s2):\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n\nSo the else branch should be:\n\n            else:\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the code after the if-else is not present? Actually, the for loop continues. So we just need to complete the else.\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            else:\\n                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string.\n\nHowever, the program2 part is three lines. We can represent it as a string with newlines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning for each program, we output the exact code that is missing (as a string) and then put in the JSON.\n\nBut note: in program1, the missing code is one line. In program2, the missing code is three lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the program2 part as a single string with embedded newlines.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact formatting of the string, so we use newline characters.\n\nHowever, the example output format is a JSON string.\n\nSo we write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            else:\\n                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program2: the existing code has 12 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the if block is:\n\n            if abs(s1) <= abs(s2):\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n\nSo the else must be at the same level as the if (which is 12 spaces from the beginning of the line). Then the inner block of the else should be 16 spaces.\n\nBut the provided code in the problem for the if branch uses 16 spaces for the inner block. So we write:\n\n            else:\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut the exact string for program2 is:\n\n\"            else:\\n                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2.py for the if branch has:\n\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n\nEach of these lines is indented by 16 spaces. So the else branch should be the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But we must match the existing indentation.\n\nThe existing code:\n\n        if abs(s1 + s2) < abs(s1) + abs(s2):\n            if abs(s1) <= abs(s2):\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the else is at the same level as the inner if, and the three lines are at the same level as the inner if's block.\n\nSo the three lines should be indented by 16 spaces each.\n\nTherefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n\"            else:\\n                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n\nBut note: the existing code has 12 spaces for the outer if and 16 for the inner. So we are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire block for the else, but note that the else is already present? Actually, the else and the comment are already there. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". In program2, the missing part is the three lines of the else block. The else and the comment are already there? Actually, the provided code has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we are replacing the entire else block? Or just the TODO line? The problem says \"fill in\" the missing lines. We are to replace the TODO line with the three lines? But note: the else block currently has two lines: the else: and the comment. We are replacing the comment with three lines? Actually, we should remove the comment and put the three lines. But the problem says \"missing lines\", so we are to write the three lines at the same indentation as the inner if block.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the three lines (without the else: because the else: is already there?).\n\nWait, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program2, the block under the else is missing. The existing code has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the two lines (the else: and the comment) with:\n\n            else:\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the problem says \"fill in\", meaning we are to complete the block. So the missing block is the three lines of code (the three statements) and we must include the else:? Actually, the else: is already present. So we only need to replace the comment with the three lines? But the problem says \"missing lines\", so we output the three lines of code (without the else:).\n\nBut the example output format does not specify. However, looking at the problem statement: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo for program2, the missing part is the three lines that go inside the else block (with the same indentation as the if block above). Therefore, we output:\n\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the existing code has the else: and the comment. We are replacing the comment with these three lines. So the missing code is these three lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the three lines as a string with newlines.\n\nSo the string for program2 is:\n\n\"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n\nBut wait, the existing code has 16 spaces of indentation for the inner if block. So the three lines must be indented by 16 spaces. Therefore, each line starts with 16 spaces? Actually, no: the existing code for the if branch has:\n\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n\nEach of these lines is at 16 spaces. So we do the same for the else.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire block for the else should be:\n\n            else:\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut the problem says: we are only to output the missing code. The missing code is the three lines of the else block (without the else: because that is already present). So we output the three lines with 16 spaces each.\n\nBut the problem does not specify whether we include the else: or not. Since the else: is already in the provided code, we only output the three lines that are the body.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the block is the body of the else.\n\nSo the JSON becomes:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the program1 part: the existing code has:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the indentation: the if block is already indented by 8 (from the for loop). So the line should be indented by 12? Actually, the existing code for the if block is at 8, and the body should be at 12. But the TODO comment is at 12. So we write:\n\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the for loop and 12 for the if body. So the missing line is 12 spaces? Actually, the provided code in program1.py for the for loop is:\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        ... (some code)\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing line should be at 12 spaces. But the line we are writing is:\n\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the existing code uses 4-space indentation. The for loop is 4, then the body is 8, and the if body is 12. So the missing line should be 12 spaces.\n\nBut in the provided code, the previous lines in the for loop are at 8. The line we are adding is at 12.\n\nSo the string for program1 is:\n\n\"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n(which is 8 spaces? Actually, the entire program uses 4-space indentation. The for loop is at 4, so the body is 8. The if is at 8, so the body of the if is 12. But the string we output is the code that goes at 12, so it should be 12 spaces? Actually, no: the problem says to output the code exactly as it would appear. The existing code uses 4-space indentation. The if block is at 8 (which is two levels: 4 for the for, 4 for the if). Then the body of the if should be 12 (three levels). So 12 spaces? But the provided code in the problem for the if branch has a comment at 12? Actually, the problem does not show the exact indentation, but we assume 4 per level.\n\nBut the provided code in the problem for program1.py has:\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i] = ... (some expression)\n        ... (updating Fenwick trees)\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO is at 12 spaces (three levels). Therefore, the missing line should be 12 spaces.\n\nBut the string we output is the code that replaces the TODO. So we write:\n\n\"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nBut that is 8 spaces? Actually, we must write 12 spaces? \n\nWait, the problem does not require us to output the spaces? We output the exact line as it would appear. The line is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nwith 12 spaces at the beginning? But in the JSON string, we must represent that.\n\nAlternatively, we can count: the for loop body is 8 (two tabs of 4) and the if body is 12 (three tabs). So the line should be 12 spaces. But the problem does not specify the exact string, so we output the line with the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\nSince the TODO comment is at 12 spaces, we output the same.\n\nBut the problem does not show the exact code, so we assume that the existing code uses 4-space indentation and the if body is 12.\n\nSo the string for program1 is:\n\n\"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nBut wait, the existing code in the problem for the if branch has:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO line is indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the problem does not show the exact spaces. But in the provided code, the for loop body (which is the entire block for i) is indented by 4. The if statement is at 8, and the body of the if is at 12.\n\nSo we write 12 spaces? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing. The missing code is one line: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" with the correct indentation.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the indentation level. However, we know that the TODO comment is at the same level. So we output the same as the TODO comment, but replace the comment with the code.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the if condition and 12 for the body. So the line is 12 spaces.\n\nBut in the string, we represent it as 12 spaces? Actually, we can write the string with the exact same whitespace.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we assume that the existing code uses 4-space indentation and the if body is 12 (i.e., 12 spaces). So the string is:\n\n\"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n(which is 12 spaces at the beginning) but note: 12 spaces is 3 tabs of 4? Actually, we can write 12 spaces.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not care about the exact number of spaces? But the program must run. However, the problem says \"so that ... runs correctly\".\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the provided code uses:\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        ... (lines starting with 8 spaces)\n\nSo the if body should be 12. We'll output 12 spaces.\n\nBut to be safe, we count:\n\nThe for loop: 4 spaces for the for, then 8 for the body. The if condition: 8 (so 8 spaces) and the body: 12.\n\nSo the missing line for program1 is 12 spaces: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" (if we use 4 spaces per level, then 12 spaces is 3 levels: 4*3=12).\n\nBut the string \"            \" has 12 spaces? Actually, in the string we write, we can use 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n}\n\nBut wait, for program2: the existing code has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with three lines, each indented by 16 spaces? Actually, the if branch in the inner if has:\n\n                out += abs(s1)\n                s2 += s1\n                s1 = 0\n\nwhich are at 16 spaces (because the inner if is at 12, and the body is 16). So the else branch body should be at 16.\n\nSo the three lines for program2 are:\n\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\neach starting with 16 spaces. But the string we output for program2 is:\n\n\"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n\nwhich is 16 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nBut note: the existing code for the if branch has 16 spaces for the three lines. So we match.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the spaces? But we must match the existing indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the JSON with the two strings.\n\nLet me write the exact strings:\n\nprogram1: the missing line is one line: 12 spaces and then the code: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nprogram2: the missing block is three lines, each 16 spaces: \n    \"                out += abs(s2)\"\n    \"                s1 += s2\"\n    \"                s2 = 0\"\n\nWe combine with newlines.\n\nSo the program2 string is: \"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"\n\nNow, we output the JSON string.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the JSON and nothing else.\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"                out += abs(s2)\\n                s1 += s2\\n                s2 = 0\"}\n\nBut wait, in program1, the line is exactly as above? But note: the variable name is `pref` (not `pref` with a typo). And in the code, we have `pref[i]`.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me double-check the program2: the three lines are:\n\n                out += abs(s2)\n                s1 += s2\n                s2 = 0\n\nThis is correct.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON."
