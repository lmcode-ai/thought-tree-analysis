Let best = n * m   (the maximum price, which we output if we cannot get more trailing zeros)\n\n          We consider the possibility of having at least z trailing zeros. We can try to maximize z. However, the known solution is:\n\n            t = 1\n            for i in range(0, 100):   # because the exponent difference is at most about 60 (since 2^60 > 10^18) but we are limited by m\n                # but note: we are going to try to multiply by 2s and 5s and then 10s. But the given code is efficient: it factors n and then builds t.\n\n      Why is the candidate k0 = m - (m % t) the best? We have built t to be the maximum multiplier that we can use to balance and then add as many 10s as possible without exceeding m. Then k0 is the largest multiple of t that is <= m. \n\n          Now, note: if we use k0, then n*k0 has at least as many trailing zeros as any other candidate. Why?\n\n          - The trailing zeros we get from n*k0 is: \n                zeros = min(a + (number of 2s in k0), b + (number of 5s in k0)) But k0 is a multiple of t, and t has been built to balance the 2s and 5s and then add as many 10s as possible.",

So we output 12 spaces and then the code. But 12 spaces is 3 tabs? or 12 spaces? The problem uses spaces. Therefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\"   (12 spaces)\n\nBut 12 spaces: we can write 12 spaces. Alternatively, we can count: the for loop body is 4 spaces, then the if i>0: 4 more -> 8, then the inner if body: 4 more -> 12. So we output 12 spaces. But the problem does not specify, so we assume 4 spaces per level. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: program2 has two lines, each with 16 spaces. But wait: the program2 code we are given has the while loop condition at 12 spaces? and the body at 16. So we output 16 spaces for each line. But 16 spaces: 4 levels * 4 spaces = 16. So we output:\n\n  program1: 12 spaces + \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n  program2: 16 spaces + \"t *= 2\" and then a newline and then 16 spaces + \"a += 1\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON string for program1 is \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\" (without quotes in the string, but the string has the spaces) and for program2 is \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\". But note: the program1 code has a TODO at 12 spaces, and we are replacing it with a line at 12 spaces.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array and then a series of queries. Each query updates an element and we must output the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2.\n\nThe total we are to compute is the sum of awesomeness for every contiguous subarray.\n\nNote: The initial code already sets up:\n  n, m = ... \n  li = list of n integers\n  ans = int((n*(n+1))/2)   # This is the base: each contiguous subarray has at least 1 block.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to n-1, if li[i] != li[i-1], we add i*(n-i). Why?\nExplanation: The base ans is the total number of subarrays (each subarray has at least one block). Then, for each adjacent pair (i-1, i) that is different, we are adding the number of subarrays that cross this boundary? Actually, note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices j (from l to r-1) such that a[j] != a[j+1]. Therefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays is:\n   total = (number of subarrays) + (for each index i from 0 to n-2, the number of subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1] and for which a[i] != a[i+1]?).\n\nBut note: the base ans is the total number of subarrays (which is n*(n+1)//2). Then, for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) (with i from 0 to n-2) that is different, we add the number of subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1]. How many subarrays include [i, i+1]? \n  The subarray must start at any index from 0 to i, and end at any index from i+1 to n-1. So that's (i+1) * (n-i-1) ? \n\nBut in the code, for i in range(1, n): \n   if li[i] != li[i-1]:\n        ans += i*(n-i)\n\nHere, i is the index (from 1 to n-1). The adjacent pair is (i-1, i). The number of subarrays that include the segment [i-1, i] is: \n   starting index from 0 to i-1 -> i choices (because 0-indexed: indices 0 to i-1, which is i numbers) and ending index from i to n-1 -> (n-i) choices.\n\nSo the initial total is: base (n*(n+1)//2) plus for each adjacent pair (i-1, i) that is different, we add i*(n-i).\n\nNow, when we update an element at index i, we must update the adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\nThe code already does:\n\n  i, x = ... and then we do i -= 1 (so i is 0-indexed).\n\n  Then:\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i] != li[i-1]: \n            # This means currently (before update) the pair (i-1, i) is contributing. We are going to remove this contribution because we are updating a[i].\n            # But the code doesn't have the removal? We see that the code then checks for the new value.\n\n        if x != li[i-1]:\n            ans += i*(n-i)   # then we add the new contribution if the new value is different from the left neighbor.\n\n    Similarly, for the right neighbor (i+1):\n        if i+1 < n:\n            if li[i] != li[i+1]:\n                ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)   # remove the current contribution for the pair (i, i+1) because we are updating a[i] and it might become same as a[i+1]?\n            if x != li[i+1]:\n                ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)   # if after update the pair (i, i+1) becomes different, then add the contribution.\n\nBut note: the current state of the array is stored in `li`. We are about to update `li[i]` to `x`. So we must remove the contributions of the old value at position i for the two adjacent pairs (if they were different) and then add the contributions for the new value (if they become different).\n\nHowever, the code above does:\n\n  For the left neighbor (i>0):\n      First, if the current (old) value at i is different from the left neighbor, then we should remove the contribution for the pair (i-1, i). But the code doesn't do that? \n\nLooking at the code:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]: \n          # There is no code here? It's a TODO.\n\nSo we must complete the TODO: we need to remove the contribution for the pair (i-1, i) if they are currently different.\n\nSimilarly, for the right neighbor, the code does remove the contribution for the pair (i, i+1) if they are currently different.\n\nTherefore, the missing part for the left neighbor is to subtract i*(n-i) when the old value at i is different from the left neighbor.\n\nSo we should write:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          ans -= i*(n-i)   # because we are going to change the element at i, so the old difference at (i-1, i) will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, note that the right neighbor part already has:\n\n  if i+1<n:\n      if li[i]!=li[i+1]:\n          ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nSo the complete update for the left neighbor is:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          ans -= i*(n-i)   # remove the old contribution for the pair (i-1, i)\n      if x!=li[i-1]:\n          ans += i*(n-i)   # if the new value is different from the left neighbor, then add the contribution for the pair (i-1, i)\n\nAnd for the right neighbor:\n\n  if i+1<n:\n      if li[i]!=li[i+1]:\n          ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)   # remove the old contribution for the pair (i, i+1)\n      if x!=li[i+1]:\n          ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)   # add the new contribution if the new value is different from the right neighbor.\n\nTherefore, the missing line in the TODO is: \n    ans -= i*(n-i)\n\nBut note: the code already has the if condition and then a TODO. We just need to put the subtraction.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n\nBut wait: the code already has:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          # TODO: Your code here   -> we need to remove the contribution for the left pair (i-1, i) which is i*(n-i)\n      if x!=li[i-1]:\n          ans+=i*(n-i)\n\nSo we put: ans -= i*(n-i)\n\nSimilarly, the right neighbor part is already complete.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n\nBut note: the code also updates the array: li[i] = x, and then appends the current ans to the list al, and then prints al at the end.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given n and m (both can be up to 10^9). We are to choose an integer k in [1, m] such that n*k has as many trailing zeros as possible. If there are multiple, choose the maximum n*k. If we cannot get more trailing zeros than the original n (or if we cannot get any trailing zeros at all) then output n*m.\n\nThe code already factors n as: n = 2^a * 5^b * c, where c is coprime with 2 and 5.\n\nThen, it initializes t=1.\n\nIt then does:\n\n  if a > b:\n      while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n          t *= 5\n          b += 1\n  elif b > a:\n      while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe idea: we want to balance the exponents of 2 and 5 to get more trailing zeros. Each trailing zero requires one 2 and one 5.\n\nIf we have more 2s (a > b), then we can multiply by 5s to balance. Similarly, if we have more 5s (b > a), we multiply by 2s.\n\nSo in the TODO for the case b>a, we should do:\n\n      while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n          t *= 2\n          a += 1\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop: we multiply by 2 as long as we don't exceed m and we are still having more 5s than 2s.\n\nAfter balancing, we then try to multiply by 10 (which is 2*5) as long as we can. But note: we can also multiply by 10 multiple times? Actually, we can multiply by 10 as long as 10*t <= m. However, note that we are already at a balanced state (a==b). Then multiplying by 10 will add one 2 and one 5, so we remain balanced. But we can also multiply by 100, 1000, etc. as long as the total multiplier (t) multiplied by 10 is <= m.\n\nBut note: the code does:\n\n   while 10 * t <= m:\n        t *= 10\n\nThis is correct: we are multiplying by 10 as many times as possible (without exceeding m).\n\nThen, the code does:\n\n   output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\nWhy? We want the maximum multiple of t that is <= n*m and is of the form n*k (with k<=m). Note that k must be chosen so that n*k is a multiple of t. But note: t is built from factors 2 and 5 and 10s. However, note that n already has factors 2^a * 5^b * c, and we have built t to be 5^(a-b) [if a>b] or 2^(b-a) [if b>a] and then multiplied by 10^k. Then n*t is n * (some factors) that balances the 2s and 5s and then adds k more 10s. But note: we are not forced to use the entire t? Actually, we are going to use a multiple of t? \n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to choose any k in [1, m]. We want to form n*k. We have built t such that we can multiply by t and then by any integer as long as the total multiplier does not exceed m. However, note that we are going to set k to be the largest multiple of t that is <= m? \n\nBut the code does: k0 = m - (m % t)   [if t>0, then this is the largest multiple of t that is <= m]. Then we output n * k0.\n\nBut why is that the best? \n\nWe have two goals:\n  1. Maximize the number of trailing zeros.\n  2. If there are several with the same number of trailing zeros, choose the maximum n*k.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in n*k is determined by the minimum exponent of 2 and 5 in the factorization of n*k. We have:\n\n  n = 2^a * 5^b * c   (c coprime with 2 and 5)\n  k = 2^x * 5^y * d   (d coprime with 2 and 5)\n\nThen n*k = 2^(a+x) * 5^(b+y) * (c*d). The trailing zeros = min(a+x, b+y).\n\nWe want to maximize min(a+x, b+y). \n\nThe algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Factor out 2s and 5s from n -> we get a, b, and c (coprime with 2,5).\n\n  Step 2: We can multiply by 2s and 5s arbitrarily (as long as k<=m). We want to balance a and b. \n\n      If a < b, we can multiply by 2^(b-a) to get a+x = a + (b-a) = b, and then we have min(b, b) = b. Then we can also multiply by 10^? to add both 2 and 5? Actually, we can multiply by 10^p = (2*5)^p to get a+x = b + p, and b+y = b + p? Actually, no: if we multiply by 10^p, then we are adding p to both exponents. So then we get min(b+p, b+p) = b+p. \n\n      But note: we can also multiply by more than the balancing? Actually, we can also multiply by 2s beyond balancing? But that doesn't help because we are limited by the 5s. Similarly, we can multiply by 5s beyond balancing? Then we are limited by the 2s.\n\n  However, the algorithm in the code:\n\n      First, we balance the exponents: \n          if a > b: we multiply by 5s until a==b (or until we cannot because we exceed m). Similarly, if b>a, we multiply by 2s until a==b.\n\n      Then, we multiply by 10 as long as we can (which adds one 2 and one 5 each time) to get more trailing zeros.\n\n  But note: we are building a multiplier t. The t we build is the base multiplier that we must use to balance and then to add as many 10s as possible. Then we set k to be the largest multiple of t that is <= m. Why is that optimal?\n\n  Explanation: \n      After building t, we have that the number of trailing zeros we get is:\n          zeros = min(a + (if we added 2s? but note: in the balancing we only added the missing factor) and then we added 10s which add equally to both) -> actually, after balancing we have a = b (if we could balance completely) and then we add p times 10, so then we have a+p and b+p -> so zeros = a+p (which is the same as b+p).\n\n      Now, if we use a multiplier k that is a multiple of t, then we are effectively multiplying by t and then by some integer. But note: we don't require that the entire k is used for balancing and 10s? Actually, we can break the 10s? \n\n      However, note: we want to maximize the trailing zeros. The trailing zeros we get from the base t is a fixed amount (say z0). Then if we multiply by an extra factor, say q, then the total multiplier is t*q. The factorization of q might add more 2s and 5s? But we are free to choose q as long as t*q<=m. However, if we choose q that has factors other than 10, we might break the balance? \n\n      Actually, the key is: we have already balanced the 2s and 5s and then added as many 10s as possible (so that t is as large as possible without exceeding m). Then we set k0 = the largest multiple of t that is <= m. This k0 is t * floor(m/t). \n\n      Why is that the best? \n\n      - The trailing zeros we get from n*k0 is the same as from n*t: because k0 is a multiple of t, so the factors of 2 and 5 in k0 are at least those in t. But note: we might get more trailing zeros? \n\n      However, observe: we have already used the entire m to get as many 10s as possible. The multiplier t is the maximum we can use for the base (balancing and then 10s) without exceeding m. Then we set k0 to the maximum multiple of t that is <= m. This k0 is the maximum multiplier that includes the entire t and then an integer factor. But note: we cannot get more trailing zeros by using a multiplier that is not a multiple of t? \n\n      Actually, the trailing zeros are determined by the total 2s and 5s. We have:\n\n          total_2 = a + (exponents from k)\n          total_5 = b + (exponents from k)\n\n      We want to maximize min(total_2, total_5). \n\n      The algorithm:\n\n          We first balance: we can add 5s to the 2s if a>b, or 2s to the 5s if b>a. Then we add as many 10s as possible. This gives a candidate multiplier t. Then we set k0 = the largest multiple of t that is <= m.\n\n      But note: we might have an alternative: instead of using the entire t, we could use a multiple of a larger base? \n\n      Actually, the standard solution for this problem is:\n\n          Let t = 1.\n          Let best = n * m   (the maximum price, which we output if we cannot get more trailing zeros)\n\n          We consider the possibility of having at least z trailing zeros. We can try to maximize z.\n\n          However, the known solution is:\n\n            t = 1\n            for i in range(0, 100):   # because the exponent difference is at most about 60 (since 2^60 > 10^18) but we are limited by m\n                # but note: we are going to try to multiply by 2s and 5s and then 10s.\n\n          But the given code is efficient: it factors n and then builds t.\n\n      Why is the candidate k0 = m - (m % t) the best?\n\n          We have built t to be the maximum multiplier that we can use to balance and then add as many 10s as possible without exceeding m. Then k0 is the largest multiple of t that is <= m. \n\n          Now, note: if we use k0, then n*k0 has at least as many trailing zeros as any other candidate. Why?\n\n          - The trailing zeros we get from n*k0 is: \n                zeros = min(a + (number of 2s in k0), b + (number of 5s in k0))\n\n          But k0 is a multiple of t, and t has been built to balance the 2s and 5s and then add as many 10s as possible. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is the maximum possible.\n\n          And if there are multiple k that yield the same number of trailing zeros, we want the maximum n*k. Since n is fixed, we want the maximum k. And k0 is the maximum multiple of t that is <= m, so n*k0 is the maximum n*k that is a multiple of t and has the maximum trailing zeros.\n\n      However, what if we can get the same number of trailing zeros with a k that is not a multiple of t? \n\n          Suppose we have two candidates: k1 and k2, both giving the same number of trailing zeros (say z). Then we want the maximum n*k. But note: if k1 > k2, then n*k1 > n*k2. So we want the maximum k that gives at least z trailing zeros? Actually, we want the maximum k that gives exactly the maximum trailing zeros (which is z_max). \n\n          How do we know that k0 gives the maximum k? \n\n          The candidate k0 is the maximum multiple of t that is <= m. But note: any candidate k that gives the same trailing zeros must be such that the multiplier t0 (which is the part that provides the 2s and 5s) must be at least as large as t? Actually, no: we might have a different way to achieve the same number of trailing zeros? \n\n          However, the construction of t: we first balance and then add as many 10s as possible. This t is the maximum multiplier that we can use to get the maximum trailing zeros. Then the maximum k that we can use that has the same trailing zeros is the maximum multiple of t that is <= m. \n\n          Why? Because if we use a multiplier that is not a multiple of t, then we might break the balance? Actually, we have fixed the base t to be the one that gives the maximum trailing zeros. And then we want the maximum k that is a multiple of t (so that we preserve the trailing zeros) and <=m. \n\n          But note: we might have a candidate k that is not a multiple of t but still has the same trailing zeros? \n\n          Example: n=2, m=10. \n            n=2: a=1, b=0, c=1.\n            We are in the case b<a: so we try to multiply by 5: t=5 (if 5<=m -> yes). Then we have t=5. Then we try to multiply by 10: 5*10=50>10 -> so we stop. Then k0 = 10 - (10%5)=10. Then n*k0=20 -> trailing zeros=1.\n\n          But what if we choose k=10? then n*k=20 -> trailing zeros=1. \n          What if we choose k=5? then n*k=10 -> trailing zeros=1. \n          The maximum n*k is 20.\n\n          However, what if we choose k=8? then n*k=16 -> trailing zeros=0 -> not the same.\n\n          What if we choose k=10? that is the same as k0.\n\n          But note: k0 = 10, which is the maximum k that is a multiple of 5 and <=10.\n\n          Now, is there a candidate k that is not a multiple of 5 that gives trailing zeros 1? \n            We require that 2*k has at least one trailing zero -> so k must be a multiple of 5. \n\n          Therefore, the candidate must be a multiple of 5. So k0=10 is the best.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n      The TODO in the elif branch: we need to multiply by 2 until we balance the exponents (or until we exceed m). So we do:\n\n          t *= 2\n          a += 1   # but note: we are not changing the original n? we are just accounting for the multiplier.\n\n      However, in the code, we have:\n\n          while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We should do:\n\n          t *= 2\n          a += 1\n\n      But note: the condition is b>a, and we are increasing a by one each time. So we are reducing the gap.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          t *= 2\n          a += 1\n\n      However, note: the code already has the while loop condition and the condition on m. We just need to put the two lines.\n\nBut wait: the variable a is the exponent of 2 in n. When we multiply by 2, we are effectively increasing the exponent a by one. But note: we are building a multiplier t. The variable a in the loop is the exponent in n? Actually, we are modifying a? \n\nYes, we are updating a and b. This is acceptable because we are only using them to decide how many more 2s or 5s we need.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is two lines: \n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the code is in a while loop and we are updating t and a. We must do both.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut the code already has the while loop and the condition. We just need to fill the body.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the code has the while loop and the TODO is inside the body. We must write two lines.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", so we replace that with two lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n    {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe must be cautious: the completion for program1 is one line, and for program2 is two lines.\n\nBut note: the program2 code block has:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with two lines.\n\nSo the completion for program2 is:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the indentation. We must output the two lines with the same indentation as the while loop (which is 8 spaces? but the problem does not specify). Actually, the code we are given has 4 space indentation. The while loop is at the same level as the if and elif. The body of the while loop should be indented one more level (4 more spaces). \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO was (which is 8 spaces from the outer for loop?).\n\nBut the problem does not require the entire program, so we just output the two lines as they would appear in the program.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\nFor program1: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"   (without quotes)\n\nFor program2: two lines: \n    \"    t *= 2\"\n    \"    a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the program2 code already has the while loop condition and the TODO is in the body. We are replacing the TODO with two lines that are indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 spaces total from the outer for loop). However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is at the same indentation as the body of the while loop. So we output:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nwith each line having the same indentation as the TODO comment (which is 8 spaces relative to the outer for loop). But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the original code uses 4 spaces per level. The while loop is inside an if-elif, which is inside a for loop. The for loop is at 4 spaces, the if-elif is at 8 spaces, and the while loop body is at 12 spaces? \n\nActually, the code we are given for program2:\n\n    for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n        # ... \n        if a > b:\n            while ...:\n                ...   # at 8 spaces for the while body? \n        elif b > a:\n            while ...:\n                # TODO: Your code here   -> this line is at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the code we are given:\n\n    for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n        a = b = 0\n        c = n\n        while c % 2 == 0:\n            a += 1\n            c //= 2\n        while c % 5 == 0:\n            b += 1\n            c //= 5\n        t = 1\n        if a > b:\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe while loop body in the if branch is indented by 8 more spaces (relative to the for loop) -> total 12? Actually, the for loop is at 4, then the if is at 8, then the while is at 12, and the body of the while is at 16? \n\nBut the code we are given for the if branch has:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nSo the body of the while is at 16 spaces? \n\nTherefore, for the elif branch, the while body should be at 16 spaces. So the two lines we add should be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We output:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nwith each line having 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not require the entire program, so we output the two lines without the leading spaces? Actually, no: we must output the code as it would appear in the program. However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted in the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is at a certain indentation. We must preserve that.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we can assume that the existing code has the same indentation. \n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines with the same indentation as the existing line in the if branch. The if branch has:\n\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nSo we output:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output two lines: \"                t *= 2\" and \"                a += 1\" (with 16 spaces each) but that is not portable. Alternatively, we can output the two lines with the same relative indentation as the existing code in the if branch. But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO. But the TODO is a comment. We are replacing the TODO with two lines that are at the same indentation level.\n\nBut the problem does not require the entire program, so we output the two lines without any extra spaces? Actually, that would break the indentation.\n\nWe must output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the body of the while loop in the if branch. So we output:\n\n\"                t *= 2\"\n\"                a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"NOT as markdown code\", so we output the string as is.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines with the exact same indentation as the existing line in the if branch. Since the if branch has two lines with 16 spaces (if the original uses 4 per level: 4 for for, 4 for if, 4 for while, 4 for body -> 16), then we output 16 spaces per line.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the example code we are given for the if branch has:\n\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nSo we output:\n\n                t *= 2\n                a += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the two lines as they are.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\nWe must put the string for program1 and program2. The program1 completion is one line. The program2 completion is two lines. We can represent the two lines as a single string with a newline in between.\n\nSo:\n\n  program1: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n\n  program2: \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the example in the if branch has 16 spaces? Actually, let me count:\n\nThe code we are given for the if branch:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nThe first line of the while body is indented by 4 more spaces than the while condition? The while condition is at 12 spaces (if the for loop is 4, then if: 8, then while: 12). Then the body is 16. \n\nBut the problem does not require the exact spaces? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and the example code we are given has that indentation. So we use the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem says the code uses spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we assume the same indentation as the existing body in the if branch.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n  program2: \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the program2 code we are given has the TODO at 16 spaces? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the body of the while in the if branch. So we output 16 spaces for each line.\n\nBut 16 spaces is the same as 4*4. \n\nAlternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? But we must be consistent.\n\nBut the problem says: the code is given. We are to complete it. So we use the same indentation as the existing code.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n  For program2: the two lines with 16 spaces each.\n\nBut to be safe, we count the spaces in the example in the if branch: \n\nThe if branch has:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nThe while condition is at 12 spaces? Actually, the code we are given in the problem statement for program2 is:\n\n    for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n        # n = 2 ** a * 5 ** b * c\n        a = b = 0\n        c = n\n        while c % 2 == 0:\n            a += 1\n            c //= 2\n        while c % 5 == 0:\n            b += 1\n            c //= 5\n        t = 1  # our result should be a multiple of t\n        if a > b:\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n        elif b > a:\n            while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        while 10 * t <= m:\n            t *= 10\n        #print(n, m, t, file=stderr)\n        output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\nThe if and elif are at the same level. The while loops inside are at the same level. The body of the while in the if branch is indented by 4 more spaces. So the body is at 4 (for) + 4 (if) + 4 (while) + 4 (body) = 16 spaces? \n\nTherefore, we output the two lines for program2 with 16 spaces at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" so we output the string as is.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has two lines. We use the newline character to separate.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as a single string with embedded newline.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact format of the string, but we are returning a JSON string.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  \"program1\": \"ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nBut note: in JSON, we must escape the backslash? Actually, no: the newline is represented as \\n, and in a JSON string, that is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as:\n\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the two lines as a single string with a newline.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", meaning for program2 we are replacing the TODO with two lines. So we output two lines of code.\n\nIn JSON, we represent that as a string with a newline.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"ans -= i*(n-i)\", \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"}\n\nBut note: the exact number of spaces: 16. How did we get 16? \n\nThe for loop: 4 spaces\nif/elif: 4 more -> 8\nwhile: 4 more -> 12\nbody: 4 more -> 16.\n\nBut the code we are given for the if branch has:\n\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nwhich is 16 spaces? Actually, we can count the spaces in the string representation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without the spaces? But that would break the code.\n\nWe must output the same indentation as the existing body in the if branch.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation, so we assume the same as the if branch.\n\nTherefore, we output the two lines with 16 spaces each.\n\nBut to be precise, we count the spaces in the example: \n\nThe if branch body has two lines. The first line: \"                t *= 5\" -> that is 16 spaces? \n\nActually, the example code we are given for the if branch is:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\nThe while condition is at 12 spaces? and the body is at 16? \n\nBut the problem does not show the exact spaces. However, the code we are given for the if branch has the body at 4 more spaces than the while condition. The while condition is at 12 spaces (if the for loop is 4, then the if is 4 more -> 8, then the while is 4 more -> 12). Then the body is 4 more -> 16.\n\nSo we output 16 spaces for each line of the body.\n\nBut 16 spaces is a lot. Alternatively, we can output 8? \n\nBut the problem says: the code is given. We are to complete it. So we use the same indentation as the existing body.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program2: \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\nwith 16 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the two lines as they would appear in the program.\n\nTherefore, we write the JSON as above.\n\nBut note: the program1 code has a TODO in the middle of an if block. We are replacing the TODO with one line: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\".\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has two lines. We use the newline character.\n\nHowever, to avoid any ambiguity, we output the exact string.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code without any extra formatting.\n\nTherefore, we return the JSON with the two completions.\n\nBut note: the program1 code has a TODO at:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      if x!=li[i-1]:\n          ans+=i*(n-i)\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with one line: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\".\n\nSo that line is at the same indentation as the TODO? The TODO is at 12 spaces? (for the function? Actually, the program1 code we are given has:\n\nn, m = ... \nli = ...\nans = ...\n\nfor i in range(1, n): ... \n\nthen for the queries:\n\nfor tc in range(m):\n    i, x = ... \n    i -= 1\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ...\n\nSo the for loop: 0 spaces? Actually, the code we are given for program1:\n\nn, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\nli = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = int((n*(n+1))/2)\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n        ans += i*(n-i) \n\nal = []\nfor tc in range(m):\n    i, x = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    i -= 1\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ans+=i*(n-i)\n    if i+1<n:\n        ...\n\nSo the for tc loop: 0 indentation? Then the body: 4 spaces. Then if i>0: 8 spaces. Then if li[i]!=li[i-1]: 12 spaces. Then the TODO is at 12 spaces? Then we replace with a line at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the next line is at 8 spaces: \"if x!=li[i-1]:\" -> so the TODO line is at 12.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\" at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact spaces. However, we output the same as the existing code. The existing code has:\n\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace with:\n\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            ans -= i*(n-i)\n\nTherefore, the line we output for program1 is: \"ans -= i*(n-i)\" with the same indentation as the TODO. But the TODO is at 12 spaces? Actually, the problem does not require the spaces in the output for program1? We are only to output the code without the leading spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted. So we output the line without the leading spaces? That would break the indentation.\n\nWe must output the line with the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at 12 spaces (if the for loop is 0, then for body: 4, then if: 8, then inner if: 12). So we output 12 spaces and then the line? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so we output the line as it would appear: with 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, to be consistent, we output the same as the existing code. The existing code in the same block (like the addition below) has:\n\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ans+=i*(n-i)\n\nwhich is at 12 spaces? \n\nActually, the code:\n\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            ...   # we are putting: ans -= i*(n-i) at 12 spaces\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ans+=i*(n-i)   # this line is at 12 spaces? \n\nThe body of the outer if (if i>0) is indented by 4. Then the inner if and the next if are at 8? and their bodies are at 12? \n\nBut the code we are given:\n\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ans+=i*(n-i)\n\nThe first inner if: the condition is at 8, and the body (the TODO) is at 12. Then the next if is at 8, and its body is at 12.\n\nSo we output for program1: the line \"ans -= i*(n-i)\" at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the line with 12 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we output without the spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so we output the line as it would be in the program: with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\"   (with 12 spaces at the beginning)\n\nBut wait, 12 spaces? How many spaces? The for loop body is 4, then the if i>0 body is 8, then the inner if body is 12. \n\nBut the example code we are given for program1 has:\n\n    if i>0:\n        if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if x!=li[i-1]:\n            ans+=i*(n-i)\n\nThis is 4 spaces for the for body, 8 for the if i>0 body, and 12 for the inner if body.\n\nSo we output 12 spaces and then the code.\n\nBut 12 spaces is 3 tabs? or 12 spaces? The problem uses spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\"   (12 spaces)\n\nBut 12 spaces: we can write 12 spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can count: the for loop body is 4 spaces, then the if i>0: 4 more -> 8, then the inner if body: 4 more -> 12.\n\nSo we output 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we assume 4 spaces per level.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: program2 has two lines, each with 16 spaces.\n\nBut wait: the program2 code we are given has the while loop condition at 12 spaces? and the body at 16. So we output 16 spaces for each line.\n\nBut 16 spaces: 4 levels * 4 spaces = 16.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  program1: 12 spaces + \"ans -= i*(n-i)\"\n  program2: 16 spaces + \"t *= 2\" and then a newline and then 16 spaces + \"a += 1\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON string for program1 is \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\" (without quotes in the string, but the string has the spaces) and for program2 is \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\".\n\nBut note: the program1 code has a TODO at 12 spaces, and we are replacing it with a line at 12 spaces. The program2 has a TODO at 16 spaces? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the body of the while in the if branch, which is 16 spaces. So we output 16 spaces for each line of program2.\n\nTherefore, we write the JSON.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code as it would appear.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            ans -= i*(n-i)\",\n  \"program2\": \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut to be safe, we can write without the spaces? But that would break the code.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code without the leading spaces and let the user put it in the right indentation? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code.\n\nTherefore, we output with the spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but the example code we are given has consistent indentation of 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo we do as above."
