So we did 2 clones (2 operations) and 4 swaps -> total 6 operations. But the formula: ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(4/2)=2, then total operations = 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6. But wait: the formula I thought was: ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m) = 2+4=6. But what if we take more than one swap per clone?",

Step1: clone -> A and B (1 op)\nStep2: clone again -> A, B, C (2 ops) Now we have three copies of the original. Step3: swap A[1] and B[0] -> A=[1,1,3], B=[2,2,3] (3 op)\nStep4: swap A[2] and C[0] -> A=[1,1,1], C=[3,2,3] (4 op) Total 4 operations. So the formula holds: ceil(2/1)=2 clones, and 2 swaps -> 2+2=4. But the problem says the total operations is 4? But the example in the note was 6 for n=6, m=2 -> 2 clones and 4 swaps -> 6.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n\nWe note that the code is missing the part for when b < a. Also, note that the variable `f` is being set when a==b, but we must remember that we are trying to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is the entire segment that has been eaten, i.e., the candies from the left that Alice ate and the candies from the right that Bob ate). The variable `f` is being updated to `len(n) - r + l - 1` which is the total number of candies eaten so far? Let's break it down:\n\n- Initially, the entire array has `len(n)` candies.\n- `l` is the next index for Alice to eat (so the number of candies Alice has eaten is `l` because she started at index0 and has eaten from 0 to l-1 -> total l candies).\n- Similarly, `r` is the next index for Bob to eat, but Bob eats from the right. The number of candies Bob has eaten is `len(n) - 1 - r` (because he started at the last index and has eaten from r+1 to the end -> total `len(n)-1 - r` candies).\n\nTherefore, the total candies eaten is `l + (len(n)-1 - r)`. But note the expression in the code: `len(n) - r + l - 1` = `l + (len(n) - r - 1)` -> which is exactly `l + (n-1 - r)`.\n\nHowever, the current code has a flaw: the variable `f` is only updated when `a==b` and we are in the loop. But what if we break the loop without updating? Also, note that the problem says that if they cannot eat non-zero weight then the answer is 0. The current code initializes `f=0` (from [0]*4, so f=0). So if no equal sum is found, it will print 0 which is correct.\n\nBut the missing part is when `b < a`. In that case, we should add a candy from the right to Bob's side. So we do:\n\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop is `l<=r`. We must be cautious to not go out of bounds.\n\nAlso, note that the condition `if a<=b` and `elif b<a` covers all cases. So we can write:\n\n    elif b < a:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nHowever, after adding this, we must also check if `a==b` after this operation? The current code has an `if a==b` check after the if-elif, so that check will run after every operation (either Alice eats or Bob eats). So that is correct.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the total number of test cases t is given, and the next lines are the test cases. The code reads every second line starting from index 2 (so the first test case's n and then the array, then the next test case's n and array, etc.). This is correct.\n\nBut note: the variable `f` is updated only when `a==b` and we are in the loop. We are trying to maximize the total candies eaten. However, the problem asks for the maximum total candies. The code updates `f` every time the sums are equal. Since we are traversing from both ends, and we are moving the pointers inward, the last time we update `f` would be the maximum? Actually, we are trying to get the maximum total candies, and we are updating `f` whenever we have an equal sum. But note that we are moving the pointers and the total candies eaten at that moment is `l + (n-1 - r)`. We want the maximum such value. However, the code does not take the maximum over all such equal sums? It just updates `f` to the current total. But note that as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten increases until we meet in the middle? Actually, no: the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, we are eating one candy at a time. The total candies eaten is the number of candies eaten by Alice (l) plus the number eaten by Bob (n-1-r). As we move the pointers, l increases and r decreases, so the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-r)) is increasing? Actually, no: because we are adding to the counts. But note: the total candies eaten is the sum of the left part (l) and the right part (n-1-r). As we move, l increases and r decreases, so the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, it is: because we are eating one candy per step. However, we are updating `f` every time we have an equal sum. But we want the maximum total candies. Since we are going from the ends to the middle, the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, no: the total candies eaten is the number of candies we have taken so far. When we take a candy, the total increases. But when we update `f` we are at a state where the sums are equal, and we have taken a certain number of candies. The next time we get an equal sum, we have taken more candies? Not necessarily: because we might have taken more candies but the sums might have become unequal again and then we get an equal sum later? Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing as we proceed. But note: we are not backtracking. We are moving the pointers inward. The total candies eaten is `l + (n-1-r)`. Initially, l=0, r = n-1, so total=0. Then we take one candy: either l becomes 1 and r remains n-1 -> total=1, or r becomes n-2 and l remains 0 -> total=1. Then we continue. The total candies eaten is increasing by one each step. Therefore, the last time we have an equal sum (i.e., the one with the largest total candies) is the maximum. However, the code updates `f` every time, so the last update will be the maximum. But what if we have an equal sum at the beginning and then never again? Then we have the initial f=0 and then we update to a positive number and then we never update again? But the problem is: we are updating `f` to the current total, which is the total at that moment. And we are going to print `f` at the end. Since we are updating whenever we have an equal sum, and the total candies eaten is increasing, the last update will be the maximum. However, note that after we update `f` we continue. It is possible that we get a larger total later? Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing as we proceed. So the last time we get an equal sum will be the one with the largest total. Therefore, we are correct.\n\nBut note: what if we break the loop without having updated `f`? Then we print 0, which is correct because we never had an equal non-zero sum? Actually, the problem says that if they cannot eat non-zero weight then the answer is 0. But note: if they eat zero candies, that is a solution (with zero weight) but the problem says \"non-zero weight\" in the note for the third test case. However, the problem statement says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and the note says \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". But note: the problem does not explicitly say that zero weight is allowed? However, the example: if they eat zero candies, then both have zero. But the problem says \"the most number of candies\", and zero candies is 0. But the example: the first test case has answer 2. The third test case has answer 0. So we are printing 0 for the third test case.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and if they can eat zero candies (which they always can) then why is the third test case 0? Because the problem requires that they eat the same total weight. They can choose to eat zero candies? But note: the problem does not say they must eat at least one candy. However, the note says \"they cannot eat the same non-zero weight\", meaning that the only solution is zero candies? But the problem does not require non-zero? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the example output for the third test case is 0. And the note says \"the answer is 0\". So we are correct.\n\nBut the problem: the fourth test case has answer 7. How does that work? The array is [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]. The note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). The total candies eaten is 3+4=7. So the code must output 7.\n\nNow, let's simulate the fourth test case with the code:\n\nn = [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n\nInitialize: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=7, f=0.\n\nStep 1: a<=b (0<=0) -> a=7, l=1 -> then check a==b? 7==0? no.\nStep 2: now a=7, b=0 -> so b<a -> Bob eats: b += n[7]=1, r=6 -> then check: 7==1? no.\nStep 3: a=7, b=1 -> a<=b? no, so Bob: b += n[6]=11 -> b=12, r=5 -> 7==12? no.\nStep 4: a=7, b=12 -> a<=b? yes -> Alice: a+=n[1]=3 -> a=10, l=2 -> 10==12? no.\nStep 5: a=10, b=12 -> a<=b -> Alice: a+=n[2]=20 -> a=30, l=3 -> 30==12? no.\nStep 6: a=30, b=12 -> a> b -> Bob: b+=n[5]=8 -> b=20, r=4 -> 30==20? no.\nStep 7: a=30, b=20 -> Bob: b+=n[4]=10 -> b=30, r=3 -> now a==b -> update f: \n   total candies = l (which is 3) + (n-1 - r) = 3 + (8-1-3) = 3+4=7 -> so f=7.\n\nThen we break the loop? Not yet: l=3, r=3 -> condition l<=r -> true.\nStep 8: now a=30, b=30 -> a<=b -> so Alice: a+=n[3]=5 -> a=35, l=4 -> then check: 35==30? no.\nThen we break because l=4, r=3 -> l>r -> break.\n\nSo we print 7. Correct.\n\nBut note: what if we have multiple equal sums? For example, if we have an array [1,1,1,1,1,1]. Then:\n\nStep1: Alice eats first: a=1, l=1 -> then check: a==b? 1==0 -> no.\nStep2: Bob eats last: b=1, r=5-1=4? (if n=6) -> then check: 1==1 -> update f: total = 1 (from Alice) + (6-1-4)=1+1=2.\nStep3: then we are at l=1, r=4 -> then we do: a<=b -> Alice: a=1+1=2, l=2 -> then check: 2==1 -> no.\nStep4: now a=2, b=1 -> Bob: b=1+1=2, r=3 -> then check: 2==2 -> update f: total = 2 (Alice) + (6-1-3)=2+2=4.\nStep5: then l=2, r=3 -> a<=b: 2<=2 -> Alice: a=2+1=3, l=3 -> then check: 3==2 -> no.\nStep6: now a=3, b=2 -> Bob: b=2+1=3, r=2 -> then check: 3==3 -> update f: total = 3 (Alice) + (6-1-2)=3+3=6.\nThen l=3, r=2 -> break.\n\nSo we print 6. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing part for program1.py is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\nThe provided code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nWe note that the problem says: we can do two types of operations: \n1. Clone an array (so we get one more copy).\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\nWe want the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy that has all elements equal.\n\nThe note says: \nFirst test case: already all equal -> 0 operations.\nSecond test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> 6 operations.\n\nHow to solve?\n\nLet the frequency of the most common element be `m`. Then we start with one array. We can do:\n\n- We can create clones and then swap elements to concentrate one value in one array.\n\nThe idea:\n\n1. We start with one array. If the array is already all equal, we are done (0 operations).\n\n2. Otherwise, we can do:\n   - Operation 1: clone the array (so we have two copies).\n   - Then we can swap two elements between the two copies to put two of the same value in one array? Actually, we can swap arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to swap any two elements from any two arrays at any positions.\n\nWe want to make one copy have all elements equal to, say, x. We can use the other copies as a pool of elements to swap.\n\nThe minimal operations:\n\nWe note that we can do:\n\n- Step 0: We have one array: A0.\n- We can clone to get A1, A2, ... etc.\n\nBut the operations:\n\n- Each clone operation counts as one.\n- Each swap operation counts as one.\n\nWe want to minimize the total operations.\n\nInsight:\n\nWe can think greedily: we want to create one array that is all x. We can use the other arrays to supply the x's that we need and to take the non-x's.\n\nBut note: we can also swap within the same array? But that doesn't help because we are moving elements around in the same array: we cannot create an x if there isn't one in that array? Actually, we can swap with another array.\n\nThe key:\n\n- We start with one array. We want to create an array that is all x. The best x is the one that appears the most (m times) in the original array? Because then we have the most of that element to work with.\n\nHow many x's do we need? We need n x's for the target array.\n\nCurrently, we have m x's in the original array. So we need n - m more x's. Where do we get them? From other arrays. But we can only get them by swapping. And we can create clones to hold the non-x elements.\n\nThe process:\n\n1. We start with one array. We can clone it to get a second array. Then we can swap an x from the second array to the first array (and take a non-x from the first array to the second). This gives us one more x in the first array. But note: we used two operations: one clone and one swap.\n\nBut we can do better: we can clone multiple times and then do multiple swaps? Actually, we can do:\n\n- Operation 1: clone -> now we have two arrays.\n- Operation 2: swap an x from array2 to array1 and a non-x from array1 to array2 -> now array1 has one more x.\n\nBut then we can clone again? Or we can do multiple swaps? Actually, we can do multiple swaps in one array? But each swap is one operation.\n\nBut note: we can swap between any two arrays. So if we have k clones (so total k+1 arrays), then we can do multiple swaps: we can swap one x from each of the k clones to the target array? But we have to get those x's from the clones. How did the clones get the x's? They started with the same array. So each clone has m x's? Actually, no: we are swapping, so the distribution changes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy iterative method:\n\nLet k be the number of clones we have. Initially k=0 (only the original). We are going to build the target array.\n\nWe need n - m x's. How do we get them?\n\nEach time we clone, we get a new array that has the same elements. Then we can swap an x from the clone to the target and a non-x from the target to the clone. This gives one x to the target. But note: we can do this for each x we need. However, we can also use the same clone for multiple swaps? But if we swap one x from the clone, then that clone loses one x. Then we can use the clone again? But we might have other x's in the clone? Actually, the clone initially has m x's. We can take up to m x's from one clone? But we need n-m x's. And we can create multiple clones.\n\nBut the operations:\n\n- To get one x from a clone, we need to have created that clone (1 operation) and then one swap (1 operation) -> total 2 operations per x? But we can use one clone to supply multiple x's? Then we don't need to create a new clone for each x.\n\nSo:\n\n- We create one clone: 1 operation. Then we can swap up to m times (because the clone has m x's) to give m x's to the target? But wait: the target already has m x's. We need n-m more. So we can take up to min(m, n-m) from one clone? Actually, the clone has m x's, but we can take as many as we want? But note: we can only take the x's that are in the clone. And we can take one per swap.\n\nSo for one clone, we can get up to m x's? But we only need n-m. So we can get min(m, n-m) x's from one clone? Then we use min(m, n-m) swaps.\n\nBut then we have:\n\nTotal operations for this clone: 1 (to create) + min(m, n-m) (swaps).\n\nBut what if n-m > m? Then we need more x's. Then we create another clone: another operation, and then we can take min(m, n-m - min(m, n-m)) = min(m, n-m-m) from the next clone? And so on.\n\nBut note: we can also use the target array? Actually, the target array is the one we are building. We start with the original as the target. Then we use clones to supply the missing x's.\n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n\nWe need to get n-m x's from somewhere. Each clone we create can supply at most m x's (because that's how many it started with). But wait: when we swap, we are taking an x from the clone and putting a non-x in the clone. Then the next time we take an x from the same clone, we are taking one that was originally in the clone? But note: we might have swapped an x from the target to the clone? No, because we are taking x's from the clone to the target. The target is the one that needs the x's.\n\nBut the clone: after we take one x, the clone has m-1 x's. Then we can take another? So we can take up to m x's from one clone? Then we need to get n-m x's. So we need to create ceil((n-m) / m) clones? And then we do (n-m) swaps.\n\nTotal operations = ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)\n\nBut let's test with the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, and the most frequent element? The note says the answer is 6 operations.\n\nWhat is m? The array: [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The frequency: 0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1 -> m=2 (for 0 or 3). Let's take x=0? Then we need 6-2=4 zeros.\n\nWe need to get 4 zeros. We create clones:\n\n- Create clone1: operations=1. Then we can take up to min(2,4)=2 zeros from clone1? Then we do 2 swaps: operations=1+2=3. Now we have 2+2=4 zeros in the target? But we need 6? Actually, we started with 2 zeros in the target. Then we took 2 more from clone1 -> total 4. We need 6? Then we need 2 more.\n\n- Create clone2: operations=1 (total 4). Then take 2 zeros from clone2: 2 swaps (total 6). Then we have 6 zeros? But wait: each clone started with 2 zeros. We took 2 from clone1 and 2 from clone2? But clone2 only had 2 zeros? Then we have taken all zeros from clone2. Then the target has 2 (original) + 2 (from clone1) + 2 (from clone2) = 6? But that is 6 zeros. So we did 2 clones (2 operations) and 4 swaps -> total 6 operations.\n\nBut the formula: ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(4/2)=2, then total operations = 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\nBut wait: the formula I thought was: ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m) = 2+4=6.\n\nBut what if we take more than one swap per clone? Actually, we are taking min(m, needed) per clone? But we are taking exactly m per clone? Actually, we can take up to m from each clone. So the number of clones we need is ceil((n-m)/m). Then the total operations:\n\n   clones = ceil((n-m)/m)   [each clone is one operation]\n   swaps = n-m              [each swap gives one x]\n\nSo total = ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)\n\nBut note: we don't need to create a clone to get the first m? Actually, we start with one array (the target). Then we create a clone and we can take up to m x's from that clone? But the target already has m x's? We are taking the x's from the clone to the target. So we can take up to m x's from one clone. Then we need to create as many clones as needed to get the remaining n-m x's: which is ceil((n-m)/m) clones? Actually, no: because each clone can supply up to m x's, so the number of clones needed is ceil((n-m)/m). Then the total operations is:\n\n   clone_ops = ceil((n-m)/m)\n   swap_ops = n-m\n   total_ops = clone_ops + swap_ops\n\nBut let's test with the first test case: already all equal -> n-m=0, then ceil(0/m)=0, and n-m=0 -> total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: n=3, m=1 -> we need 2 more. Then clones = ceil(2/1)=2, swaps=2 -> total=4.\n\nBut is that minimal? \nArray: [1,2,3] -> we want all 1's? \nStep1: clone -> [1,2,3] and [1,2,3] (1 op)\nStep2: swap: take the 1 from clone1 to target: swap the 2 in target with the 1 in clone1 -> target becomes [1,1,3] and clone1 becomes [2,2,3] (2nd op: swap)\nStep3: clone again? (3rd op) -> now we have three arrays: target [1,1,3], clone1 [2,2,3], clone2 [1,2,3] (but wait, we cloned the original? Actually, we can clone any array. But we started with the original. Then we swapped and created a clone. Then we clone again: we can clone the target? or the clone? But the problem says we can clone any array. So we can clone the original? But we have already swapped? The arrays are changing.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\nStep1: clone the original -> two arrays: A=[1,2,3], B=[1,2,3] (1 op)\nStep2: swap A[1] (which is 2) and B[0] (which is 1) -> A becomes [1,1,3], B becomes [2,2,3] (2nd op)\nStep3: now we need one more 1 for A. We can clone the original? But the original is gone? We only have A and B. Then we clone A? or B? \nBut we can clone A: then we get C=[1,1,3] (3rd op). Then we swap: we need a 1 for A. We can take a 1 from C? \nStep4: swap A[2] (which is 3) with C[0] (which is 1) -> A becomes [1,1,1], C becomes [3,1,3] (4th op). \nTotal 4 operations.\n\nBut note: we could have done:\n\nStep1: clone -> A and B (1 op)\nStep2: swap A[1] and B[0] -> A=[1,1,3], B=[2,2,3] (2 op)\nStep3: clone B -> C=[2,2,3] (3 op)\nStep4: swap A[2] and C[0] -> A=[1,1,2] -> not all ones.\n\nAlternatively, we can swap from B to A again? But B has no ones.\n\nSo we need to get the last one from a new clone? But we don't have a clone that has a one? \n\nBut we can clone the original again? But we don't have the original? The problem: initially we have one array. Then we clone it to get two. Then we swap and change both. Then we can clone one of the arrays? But we don't have the original anymore. So we have to use the arrays we have.\n\nBut note: we can clone at any time. We can clone the original at the beginning multiple times? \n\nStep1: clone -> A and B (1 op)\nStep2: clone again -> A, B, C (2 ops)\nNow we have three copies of the original.\n\nStep3: swap A[1] and B[0] -> A=[1,1,3], B=[2,2,3] (3 op)\nStep4: swap A[2] and C[0] -> A=[1,1,1], C=[3,2,3] (4 op)\n\nTotal 4 operations.\n\nSo the formula holds: ceil(2/1)=2 clones, and 2 swaps -> 2+2=4.\n\nBut the problem says the total operations is 4? But the example in the note was 6 for n=6, m=2 -> 2 clones and 4 swaps -> 6.\n\nNow, what about the provided code?\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nCurrently, it sets ans = n-m. Then it does a while loop: while m<n. Then it prints ans.\n\nBut we know that the answer is not just n-m. We have to account for the clone operations.\n\nThe while loop is probably to simulate the clone operations? \n\nWe can do:\n\n    ans = 0\n    needed = n - m\n    clones = 0\n    while needed > 0:\n        # We create a clone: one operation\n        clones += 1\n        # Then we can take up to m from this clone? But we can take at most m, but we only need 'needed'\n        # Actually, we take min(m, needed) from this clone, which gives us min(m, needed) x's, and we do min(m, needed) swaps (each swap one operation)\n        swaps_this_clone = min(m, needed)\n        ans += 1 + swaps_this_clone   # 1 for the clone, swaps_this_clone for the swaps\n        needed -= swaps_this_clone\n\nBut note: the initial ans is set to n-m? Then we are adding in the loop. But the current code sets ans = n-m. Then we are going to add more? That would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the current code sets ans = n-m (which is the total swaps we need). Then we need to add the number of clones? But the number of clones is ceil((n-m)/m). So we can do:\n\n    ans = n - m   # this is the total swaps\n    # then we add the number of clones: which is ceil((n-m)/m) -> but note: if n-m==0, then clones=0.\n    # But we have a while loop: while m<n. So we are going to add the clones.\n\nBut how? We can do:\n\n    clones = 0\n    needed = n - m\n    # But we have to compute the number of clones: which is (needed + m - 1) // m   [ceiling division of needed by m]\n    # Then ans = clones + (n-m) = (needed + m - 1) // m + (n-m)\n\nBut the problem: the note says the second test case: n=6, m=2 -> clones = ceil(4/2)=2, swaps=4 -> total=6.\n\nBut the code currently sets ans = 4. Then we need to add 2. How?\n\nThe while loop: condition m<n -> true. Then we do:\n\n    # We are going to simulate the process of creating clones until we have enough.\n\nBut note: the provided code has:\n\n    while(m<n):\n\nBut m and n are fixed? They don't change. So we must change the condition? Or we break when we have done enough? Actually, the condition is fixed: m is the max frequency, n is the length. They don't change. So the while loop condition is always true until we break? But we don't want an infinite loop.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition to a variable that we update.\n\nBut the provided code does not change m or n. So we must break out of the loop? Or we use a different variable.\n\nLooking at the note: the example in the problem: the second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2. Then the while loop condition is true (2<6). Then we do:\n\n    # We need to add the clone operations.\n\nBut the current code sets ans = 4. Then we want to add 2 (for the two clones) -> total 6. But we can do:\n\n    ans = n - m   # 4\n    clones = 0\n    temp = n - m   # 4\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m   # we are using one clone to supply m x's? But we can only supply min(m, temp) but we are subtracting m? \n        # Actually, we are subtracting m because we get m x's from one clone.\n        # Then we break when temp<=0?\n    ans += clones   # then ans = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nBut let's simulate:\n\n    temp = 4\n    clones=0\n    while temp>0: \n        clones += 1   -> clones=1\n        temp -= m   -> temp = 4-2=2\n    then temp>0 -> true again: \n        clones=2\n        temp=2-2=0 -> break.\n    then ans = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nBut what if n=3, m=1: \n    ans = 3-1 = 2\n    temp=2\n    clones=0\n    first iteration: clones=1, temp=2-1=1\n    second iteration: clones=2, temp=1-1=0 -> break.\n    ans = 2+2=4.\n\nBut what if n=5, m=2: \n    ans = 5-2=3\n    temp=3\n    clones=0\n    iteration1: clones=1, temp=3-2=1\n    iteration2: clones=2, temp=1-2 = -1 -> break.\n    ans=3+2=5.\n\nBut the formula: ceil(3/2)=2, then total=2+3=5. Correct.\n\nBut note: we are subtracting m from temp each time. This is equivalent to: clones = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m + m -1) // m = (n-1)//m? Actually, no: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b.\n\nBut we are doing: \n    clones = 0\n    temp = n-m\n    while temp>0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n\nThis is equivalent to clones = ceil((n-m)/m) if we break when temp<=0? Actually, it is: because we are counting the number of chunks of size m we need to cover n-m.\n\nBut note: if n-m is divisible by m, then we do (n-m)/m iterations. Otherwise, we do floor((n-m)/m)+1.\n\nBut that is ceil((n-m)/m).\n\nSo the code for the while loop:\n\n    temp = n - m\n    clones = 0\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n    ans += clones\n\nBut the current code sets ans = n-m initially. Then we add clones. So we can do:\n\n    temp = n - m\n    clones = 0\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n    ans += clones\n\nBut note: the while loop condition is while(m<n): which is equivalent to while (n-m>0) -> same as temp>0? But we are using a variable temp that we update. However, the condition in the while loop is the same as the condition we are checking? But we are updating temp. So we can do:\n\n    # We have: \n    #   ans = n - m   (the total swaps)\n    #   temp = n - m   (the remaining needed x's)\n    #   clones = 0\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n    ans += clones\n\nBut we don't have the variable clones defined? And we are updating temp. We can do:\n\n    temp = n - m   # but we already set ans = n-m, so we can use a variable for the remaining needed\n    # Actually, we can use the same variable for the remaining needed and then update.\n\nBut the code:\n\n    ans = n - m\n    temp = n - m\n    clones = 0\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n    ans += clones\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so the while loop might be inefficient? Because if m=1, then we do n-m iterations? But n-m can be up to 10^5? And the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total iterations would be the sum over test cases of (n_i - m_i) / m_i? But worst-case m_i=1, then we do (n_i-1) iterations per test case. And the total n_i is 10^5, but the worst-case one test case n_i=10^5, then we do 10^5 iterations -> acceptable? Because 10^5 is acceptable in Python? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, meaning the number of test cases can be up to 10^4? But the sum of n is 10^5. So the worst-case one test case with n=10^5, then we do 10^5 iterations -> acceptable.\n\nBut we can avoid the loop by computing clones = (n-m + m - 1) // m? But note: if n-m==0, then (0 + m-1)//m = (m-1)//m = 0. If n-m>0, then (n-m-1)//m + 1? Actually, the formula for ceiling division: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    clones = (n - m + m - 1) // m   # = (n-1)//m\n    ans = n - m + clones\n\nBut wait: (n-1)//m is not the same as ceil((n-m)/m). \n\nExample: n=6, m=2: \n   ceil((6-2)/2)=ceil(4/2)=2.\n   (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> same.\n\nExample: n=5, m=2: \n   ceil(3/2)=2, (5-1)//2=4//2=2.\n\nExample: n=3, m=1: \n   ceil(2/1)=2, (3-1)//1=2.\n\nBut what if n=4, m=3: \n   ceil(1/3)=1, (4-1)//3=3//3=1.\n\nSo it works: clones = (n-1)//m.\n\nBut note: if n-m==0, then (n-1)//m: if n=1, m=1 -> (0)//1=0. Correct.\n\nSo we can avoid the loop:\n\n    ans = n - m + ( (n-1) // m )   # but wait: (n-1)//m is the number of clones? \n\nBut the example: n=6, m=2: 6-2 + (5//2)=4+2=6.\n\nBut the problem: the example in the note: the second test case: 6 operations.\n\nBut the provided code has a while loop. We are allowed to change the code arbitrarily as long as we fill the missing block? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can replace the while loop? Or we must use the while loop?\n\nThe problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is inside the while loop. So we must fill the while loop? But the while loop condition is fixed: while(m<n). And we cannot change the condition? But if we don't change the condition, the loop will run forever because m and n are fixed.\n\nTherefore, we must break out of the loop? Or update m or n? But that would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the while loop to compute the clones? But we must update a variable to break the loop.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    temp = n - m   # the remaining needed\n    clones = 0\n    while temp > 0:   # but the condition is while(m<n) -> which is the same as while(n-m>0) -> but we are updating temp, not m or n.\n        # We do one clone: clones += 1\n        clones += 1\n        # Then we can take up to m from this clone? So we reduce temp by m\n        temp -= m\n        # But we must break when temp<=0? Then we break out of the loop? But the condition is while(m<n) -> which is always true? So we break when temp<=0?\n        # But we can break when temp<=0? Then we set ans += clones and break?\n        # But we are not allowed to change the condition? We can break explicitly.\n\n    Then we set ans += clones\n\nBut the problem: the while loop condition is fixed. So we must break inside the loop.\n\nSo the code for the while loop:\n\n    # We are in the while loop: while(m<n):\n    # We do:\n    clones = 0   # but we cannot reset clones each time? We must accumulate over iterations.\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n    # We have ans = n-m (the swaps)\n    # We want to compute the clones = ceil((n-m)/m) and then add to ans.\n\nBut we are in a loop that runs while m<n. We can do:\n\n    # We break out after one computation? But the loop condition is fixed. So we must break after the first iteration? But we need to run ceil((n-m)/m) times? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    # We do:\n    ans += (n-1) // m   # but we are in a loop that runs while m<n -> which is true. Then we break? But we must break.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n    # Inside the while loop, we compute the entire clones and then break.\n\nSo:\n\n    clones = (n-1) // m\n    ans += clones\n    break\n\nBut then we break the loop. But the condition is still true? But we break. Then we break after the first iteration.\n\nBut what if we don't break? Then it would run again? And we would add clones again? That would be wrong.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut then we break the loop. But the condition is still true? But we break.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are only doing one iteration per test case? Then it's acceptable.\n\nBut the while loop condition is while(m<n). We break after the first iteration. Then we break.\n\nBut what if we don't break? Then the next iteration: m<n is still true? Then we do it again? So we must break.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the while loop to simulate the subtraction? But we are allowed to change the condition? The problem says we must fill the missing block. We can do:\n\n    # We do:\n    clones = 0\n    temp = n - m\n    while temp > 0:\n        clones += 1\n        temp -= m\n        # But we are in a while loop that has condition (m<n) -> which is always true? So we break when temp<=0?\n        # But we can break when temp<=0?\n        # Then we set ans += clones and break the outer loop? But we are in the outer while loop? We cannot break the inner? \n\nWait, we are in the outer while loop: while(m<n). We are not in an inner loop. So we can do:\n\n    # We do:\n    #   clones = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-1)//m   [as above]\n    #   ans += clones\n    #   break   # to break the while loop\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n    # We do:\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of operations\", and we are computing it in one step.\n\nBut the provided code has a while loop that we must fill. We can break immediately.\n\nSo the code for the while loop block:\n\n    ans += (n - 1) // m\n    break\n\nBut wait: what if we don't break? Then the next iteration we would do the same? And we would add (n-1)//m again? So we break.\n\nBut what if we do not break? Then the condition m<n is still true and we enter again? Then we add again? That would be wrong.\n\nSo we break.\n\nBut what if we don't use break? We can set m to be >= n? But that would be:\n\n    m = n   # then the condition becomes false? But we are not allowed to change m? Because m is the max frequency.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    # We do:\n    clones = (n-1) // m\n    ans += clones\n    m = n   # to break the loop? But then we break the condition for the next test cases? Because m is used per test case.\n\nBut the next test case: we reset m. So it's safe? But the problem: the variables are per test case. The for loop is:\n\n    for li in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n        n = len(li:=li.split())\n        m = max(Counter(li).values())\n        ...\n\nSo m is computed per test case. Then we set m=n? Then the condition m<n becomes false? Then we break the loop. Then we print ans.\n\nBut that would work. But it's more operations. And we are changing m, which is not used again? So it's safe.\n\nBut the problem: we are not allowed to change the provided code arbitrarily? We can only fill the block.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\". So we can write multiple lines.\n\nBut the note: the example in the problem: the second test case: n=6, m=2 -> (n-1)//m = 5//2=2, then ans = 4+2=6.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    # Inside the while loop:\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    m = n   # to break the loop after one iteration\n    # or we break\n\nBut breaking is cleaner.\n\nSo:\n\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut what if the condition m<n is false? Then we skip the loop. But we set ans = n-m initially. Then we don't enter the loop. Then we print n-m. Correct for the case m==n? Then n-m=0, and we don't add anything.\n\nBut what if m>n? That cannot happen because m is at most n.\n\nSo the code for the while loop block is:\n\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut wait: what if n-m is not divisible by m? Then (n-1)//m is the same as ceil((n-m)/m)? We have already seen that it is.\n\nBut note: (n-1)//m is the same as floor((n-1)/m). And we want ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil((n/m) - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\nBut (n-1)//m = floor((n-1)/m) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\nExample: n=5, m=2: ceil(5/2)=3, then ceil(n/m)-1=2. And (5-1)//2=4//2=2. Correct.\n\nExample: n=4, m=3: ceil(4/3)=2, then ceil(n/m)-1=1. And (4-1)//3=3//3=1. Correct.\n\nSo it is the same.\n\nTherefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". And we are to output in JSON: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nFor program1, the missing code is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nFor program2, the missing code is:\n\n    ans += (n-1) // m\n    break\n\nBut note: in program2, the while loop condition is while(m<n). We break after the first iteration. So we break.\n\nBut what if we don't break? Then the loop would run again? And we would add (n-1)//m again? So we break.\n\nBut the problem: the while loop condition is fixed. So we must break.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the break by using a condition? But we are only going to run the loop once? So we break.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has an indentation of 8 spaces? The original code has 8 spaces for the elif block. And the program2 code has 4 spaces for the while loop block? But the provided code in program2 has 4 spaces for the while loop.\n\nBut the TODO in program2 is at the same indentation as the while loop body? So we write with 4 spaces.\n\nBut the program1: the missing part is two lines, each with 8 spaces (because it is inside the elif block).\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2, the variable n is the length of the array? But we have:\n\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n\nBut the array elements are in li.split(), and the length is n. And m = max(Counter(li).values()). So n and m are integers.\n\nBut what if the array has duplicate elements? The Counter counts the frequency of each string. But the array elements are given as strings? Because we split the input string. But the problem: the array elements can be negative? But the frequency is by string representation. That is correct.\n\nBut note: the array elements are given as integers in the input? But we are reading as strings. Then we split and then we count the frequency of the string. That is correct because the same integer will have the same string representation.\n\nBut what if the array has negative numbers? The string representation of -1 is different from 1? Correct.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
