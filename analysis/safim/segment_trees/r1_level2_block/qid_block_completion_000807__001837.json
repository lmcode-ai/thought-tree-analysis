Why 1 and 2? \n          Original: \"BAN\" -> swap(1,2): \n            index1: 'B' becomes 'A'\n            index2: 'A' becomes 'B'\n            -> \"ABN\"\n\n          Our solution: swap(1,3): \n            index1: 'B' becomes 'N'\n            index3: 'N' becomes 'B'\n            -> \"NAB\"\n\n        Both break the subsequence \"BAN\". So we can use the known pattern. But note: the provided code in the problem for even n was: if n % 2 == 0:\n                print(n // 2)\n                for k in range((n // 2)):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This is different: For n=2: \n                k=0: ans=1, then (3*2) - 1 + 1 = 6 -> so it prints \"1 6\", which is the same as our known solution? But wait: our known solution for n=2: \n                i=0: 1 and 6 -> same. However, for n=3 (odd) the provided code does:\n\n            else:",

The even case in the provided code uses: \n            for k in range(n//2):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n        For the odd case, we are going to do n//2+1 swaps. We can do the same pattern: \n            for k in range(n//2+1):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - 3*k   # because 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n        But note: the even case in the provided code uses j = 3*n - ans + 1, which is 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k. So we can write:\n\n            for k in range((n//2)+1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This will be consistent with the even case. Let me test for n=3 (odd):\n            k=0: ans=1 -> j = 3*3 - 1 + 1 = 9 -> so \"1 9\"\n            k=1: ans=4 -> j = 9 - 4 + 1 = 6 -> \"4 6\"\n            k=2: ans=7 -> j = 9 - 7 + 1 = 3 -> \"7 3\"\n\n        But wait, k goes from 0 to n//2 (which is 1) -> so k=0 and k=1? n//2 for n=3 is 1, so range(1+1)=range(2) -> k=0 and k=1. So we get:\n            swap 1 and 9\n            swap 4 and 6\n\n        This is the same as the known solution. However, note the known solution for n=3: \n            swap 1 and 9, and 4 and 6. But the known solution we discussed earlier for n=3: \n            i=0: 1 and 9\n            i=1: 4 and 6   -> same. So we can complete the TODO with:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1) But note: the provided code for even n uses the same formula. Therefore, we can write:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This will work for the odd case. However, let me check the indices for k in the odd case: \n            n=3: k from 0 to 1 (inclusive) -> two swaps. But what about n=1? The provided code already handled n=1 separately: \n                if n==1: \n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"1 2\") So for n>=3 we use the else. But wait, what if n=3? We are printing two swaps: \n                k=0: 1 and 9\n                k=1: 4 and 6\n\n        This is acceptable. However, the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 200000, but note that the number of test cases t<=10000, but the sum of n<=200000, so we are safe. But note: the provided code for even n and the odd n use the same formula for the indices? Actually, the even n code uses the same formula: \n            for k in range(n//2):\n                ans = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - ans + 1\n\n        And the odd n code we are writing the same. So we can write the entire else block as:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the example for n=1 and n=2 are handled separately and are different. Why did they handle n=1 and n=2 separately? For n=1: they printed \"1 2\", but the formula for k=0: \n                ans = 3*0+1 = 1\n                j = 3*1 - 1 + 1 = 3 -> \"1 3\", but they printed \"1 2\". For n=2: they printed \"2 6\", but the formula for k=0: \n                ans=1, j=6 -> \"1 6\", but they printed \"2 6\". So the provided code for n=1 and n=2 is different from the formula.",

Then the while condition: h+g is the total candies eaten. And the assignment: index = e + (m - r)\n\n          What is e? Alice has eaten from index0 to index e -> count = e+1? But the count for Alice is g, so g = e+1? Initially: \n            Alice: e=0, g=1 -> g = 1 = 0+1 -> matches. Bob: r = m-1, and he has eaten one candy (at index m-1), so count = 1 = m - (m-1) = 1 -> matches. When Alice eats again:\n            e becomes 1, and g becomes 2 -> count=2 = 1+1 -> matches. So the assignment in the equal condition: \n                index = e + (m - r) \n            is the total candies eaten: (e+1) [for Alice] + (m - r) [for Bob] = (g) + (h) because:\n                g = e+1, and h = m - r? But wait, initially: h = 1, and m - r = m - (m-1) = 1 -> matches. After Alice eats one more: \n                e=1, g=2 -> Alice count=2. r is still m-1, so Bob count = 1 = h.\n                then index = 1 + (m - (m-1)) = 1+1 = 2, but the total eaten is 3 (Alice:2, Bob:1) -> not matching. In the equal condition, after Alice eats, we set:\n                index = e + (m - r) \n                e is now 1 (after increment) -> so e=1. r is unchanged -> m - r = 1.\n                index = 1+1 = 2. But the total eaten is Alice:2, Bob:1 -> 3. So it should be (e+1) + (m - r) = 2+1 = 3. Therefore, the assignment should be: index = (e+1) + (m - r) But the code does: index = e + (m - r)",

Then we print index=0? But the answer for m=1 should be 0? because Alice and Bob cannot eat the same weight: \n                Alice eats the only candy: weight w, Bob has nothing -> not equal. So 0 is correct. But the code for m=1: \n            We don't enter the while loop, and we print index=0. So it's safe.

So the code is using the total candies eaten at the moment of the last equal (even if we then added more and made it unequal) and that total is the sum of the counts at the moment of the equal (before the extra eat) plus the extra eat? This is very confusing. Given the time, we will complete the TODO as:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n          and hope that the rest of the code works. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        But note: we must be cautious for index out of bounds?",

So count = e+1. Therefore, index = (e+1) + (m - r) \n\n          But the code says: index = e + (m - r) This is off by one for Alice. Similarly, for Bob: \n                when we do r -= 1, then the count for Bob is m - r? \n                initially: r = m-1, count = 1 = m - (m-1) = 1. after Bob eats one more: r becomes m-2, count = 2 = m - (m-2) = 2. So count for Bob = m - r.\n\n          Therefore, total = (e+1) + (m - r) But the code sets: index = e + (m - r) So we should change the assignment in the equal condition to:\n                index = (e+1) + (m - r)",

Actually, initially e=0. Then: lowest = lst[0] (from initialization) Then in the if block: \n                lowest += lst[e+1]  -> lst[1]\n                then e becomes e+1 -> e=1. So after this, Alice has eaten two candies: index0 and index1. But then g (Bob's count) is increased by 1? This is not logical. In the condition for equal: \n                lowest == highest:\n                then Alice eats the next candy: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1   -> again, Bob's count increases?

But then in the if block for Alice: \n                we do: \n                    e += 1   -> so e is the next index for Alice? lowest += lst[e]   -> but the code says: lowest += lst[e+1] and then e+=1 -> that would be using e+1 as the index, then e becomes e+1. This is equivalent to: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e = e+1\n\n            which means Alice is eating the candy at index e+1? and then e becomes e+1. But initially e=0, so she eats index1? and then e becomes 1. But she had already eaten index0 (from initialization: lowest = lst[0]), so now she has eaten two candies: index0 and index1. Then g (Bob's count) is increased by 1? This is not making sense. In the equal condition, we do the same: Alice eats one more candy, and then we set index = e + (m - r) [which is the total candies eaten: Alice: e+1 (because e is the last index she ate, so count=e+1) and Bob: m - r (because Bob has eaten from r to m-1, count = m-1 - r + 1 = m - r)]. But then we also increase g by 1?",

Let me change the variable names for clarity:\n\n            Let alice_count = h\n            bob_count = g\n\n          Then in the Alice block, we should do:\n                alice_count += 1   (so h should increase) In the Bob block, we should do:\n                bob_count += 1   (so g should increase)",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given multiple test cases. For each test case, an integer n.\n We are to output the minimum number of operations m and then m lines of two indices (i, j) for each swap.\n\n After reading the note and examples:\n   For n=1: we do 1 operation: swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"ABN\"\n   For n=2: we do 1 operation: swap indices 2 and 6 -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n For n>=3, we note:\n   The example for even n: \n        n=2: we did one swap (at indices 2 and 6) -> that is, for k=0: (3*0+1 = 1) but wait, the example swapped index 2 and 6.\n        Actually, in the example for n=2, they swapped the second character (index 2) and the last character (index 6).\n\n   The provided code for even n does:\n        print(n//2)\n        for k in range(n//2):\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n   But for k=0: ans = 1, then the other index is 3*n - 1 + 1 = 3*n -> so it would print \"1 6\" for n=2? \n   However, the example swap was \"2 6\", not \"1 6\".\n\n   Let me check: \n        s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> indices: \n          1: 'B'\n          2: 'A'\n          3: 'N'\n          4: 'B'\n          5: 'A'\n          6: 'N'\n\n        The example swapped index 2 and 6: \n          becomes: \n            index1: 'B'\n            index2: 'N' (from last)\n            index6: 'A' (from index2)\n          so we get: \"B\" then \"N\", then \"N\", then \"B\", then \"A\", then \"A\" -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        But if we swap index1 and 6: \n          becomes: \n            index1: 'N' (from last)\n            index6: 'B' (from first)\n          so we get: \"N\", then \"A\", then \"N\", then \"B\", then \"A\", then \"B\" -> \"NANBAB\", which has a subsequence \"BAN\"? \n          Actually, we can pick: \n            the last 'B' (at index6) then the first 'A' (at index2) then the last 'N' (at index3) -> that's \"BAN\" at indices 6,2,3? \n          But note: the subsequence must be in order. The indices must be increasing. So we cannot take index6 then index2 because 6>2 and then 3>2? \n          Actually, the subsequence must be in increasing index order. So we cannot use index6 then a lower index. \n\n        However, let's check: \n          \"NANBAB\": \n            We can form \"BAN\" by taking:\n              the first 'B' is at index4? (the fourth character is 'B') -> then an 'A' at index5? then the last character is 'B'? \n            Actually, we have:\n              index1: 'N'\n              index2: 'A'\n              index3: 'N'\n              index4: 'B'\n              index5: 'A'\n              index6: 'B'\n\n          How do we form \"BAN\"? \n            We need a 'B' then an 'A' then an 'N'. \n            We have a 'B' at index4, then an 'A' at index5, but then we need an 'N' after index5? The only 'N's are at index1,3 which are before index4. \n          So it doesn't have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\n        But the problem says for n=2 the example swap was 2 and 6. And the provided example solution for even n in the code for n=2 would output \"1 6\", which we just saw also works? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n        But note: the example output for n=2 was \"2 6\", not \"1 6\". \n\n        Why did they choose 2 and 6? \n\n        Let me check the note: \n          \"In the second testcase, s(2) = \"BANBAN\", we can swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6, converting s(2) to \"BNNBAA\"\"\n\n        So they swapped the second character (index2) and the last character (index6). \n\n        The provided code for even n does:\n            for k in range(n//2): \n                ans = 3*k+1   -> for k=0: 1, then the other index is 3*n - 1 + 1 = 3*n -> for n=2: 6.\n                so it prints \"1 6\", which is different.\n\n        But wait, the example in the note swapped index2 and 6, not 1 and 6.\n\n        Why the discrepancy?\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations under the constraints of the problem.\"\n\n        And the note says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n        So both are acceptable? \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"What's the smallest number of operations\" and then we output one such sequence.\n\n        The minimal number of operations for n=2 is 1, and both (1,6) and (2,6) are 1 operation.\n\n        But let me check the minimal number of operations for n=1: 1 operation.\n\n        For n>=1, what is the minimal number of operations? \n\n        Observation: \n          The string s(n) is composed of n blocks of \"BAN\". \n          We want to break every occurrence of the subsequence \"BAN\". \n\n        How can we break one occurrence? \n          In one block \"BAN\", if we swap two characters so that the subsequence \"BAN\" (which is the entire block) is broken, then we break that block.\n\n        However, note that a subsequence might be formed by multiple blocks? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: we want to avoid the entire string having \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        How about we break every block? But we don't need to break every block? \n\n        Alternate approach: \n          We can break the entire string by ensuring that there is no increasing sequence of indices i<j<k such that s[i]='B', s[j]='A', s[k]='N'.\n\n        We can try to collect all the B's and swap them to the end? But note we are allowed only a limited number of swaps.\n\n        Insight from known solutions: \n          We can do ceil(n/2) operations? \n\n        The provided code for even n does n//2 operations, and for odd n it does n//2+1.\n\n        How does it work?\n          For even n: \n            We do n//2 swaps. \n            For k in [0, n//2 - 1]:\n                i = 3*k+1   (which is the first character of the k-th block, which is 'B')\n                j = 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1? \n                Actually: (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k - 1 + 1 = 3*(n-k) \n                But note: the last character of the (n-k-1)-th block? \n\n          Let me index the blocks: \n            Block0: indices 1,2,3 -> B, A, N\n            Block1: indices 4,5,6\n            ...\n            Block n-1: indices 3*(n-1)+1, 3*(n-1)+2, 3*(n-1)+3 = 3*n-2, 3*n-1, 3*n.\n\n          For k=0: \n            i = 1 (the first B)\n            j = 3*n - 1 + 1? -> actually the code: (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 0? \n            Actually: \n                ans = 3*k+1 = 1\n                then j = 3*n - 1 + 1 = 3*n? \n            So we swap index1 and index(3*n).\n\n          What is at index1? 'B'\n          What is at index(3*n)? the last character of the last block: 'N'\n\n          So after swap: \n            index1 becomes 'N'\n            index(3*n) becomes 'B'\n\n          Then for k=1 (if n>=4, so we have at least two swaps for n=4?):\n            i = 3*1+1 = 4\n            j = 3*n - 4 + 1 = 3*n - 3\n\n          For n=4: \n            j = 12 - 3 = 9? \n            So swap index4 and index9.\n\n          What is at index4? the first character of the second block: 'B'\n          What is at index9? the last character of the third block? (because the last block is 10,11,12, so the third block is 7,8,9 -> last character is 9: 'N')\n          So swap: index4 becomes 'N', index9 becomes 'B'\n\n          Now the string becomes:\n            Block0: [1: 'N', 2: 'A', 3: 'N'] -> so \"NAN\"\n            Block1: [4: 'N', 5: 'A', 6: 'N'] -> but wait, we swapped index4 (which was the first of block1) to 'N', so block1 becomes \"NAN\"\n            Block2: [7: 'B', 8: 'A', 9: 'B'] -> because we swapped index9 (which was the last of block2) to 'B', so block2 becomes \"BAB\"\n            Block3: [10: 'B', 11: 'A', 12: 'B'] -> but wait, we swapped the last character of block3? Actually we swapped index12? no, we swapped index9 (which is in block2) and index4 (block1). The last block remains? \n\n          Actually, we swapped index4 and index9: \n            index4 was in block1 (which is the first character of block1) and index9 is the last character of block2.\n\n          So the entire string becomes:\n            Block0: [1: 'N', 2: 'A', 3: 'N'] -> \"NAN\"\n            Block1: [4: now the character that was at index9 -> which was the last character of block2: originally 'N'? but wait, we already swapped the last character of block2? \n          Actually, we haven't done anything to block3? \n\n          This is getting messy.\n\n        Alternate known solution from contests: \n          We can break the pattern by swapping the first B of the first block with the last N of the last block? and then the next B with the next last N? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n          m = (n+1)//2\n          Then for i in range(m):\n              print(3*i+1, 3*n - 3*i)\n\n        Why 3*i+1 and 3*n - 3*i?\n\n        For n=1: \n            m = (1+1)//2 = 1\n            i=0: 3*0+1 = 1, and 3*1 - 0 = 3 -> swap index1 and index3.\n\n            Original: \"BAN\" -> swap index1 and index3: becomes \"NAB\" -> which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n            But note: the example in the problem swapped index1 and 2 to get \"ABN\". \n            Both are valid.\n\n        For n=2:\n            m = (2+1)//2 = 1 (since integer division: 3//2=1 in integer)\n            i=0: 1 and 3*2 - 0 = 6 -> swap index1 and index6.\n\n            Original: \"BANBAN\" -> \n                swap index1 and 6: \n                  index1: originally 'B' becomes the last character of the last block: 'N'\n                  index6: originally 'N' becomes the first character: 'B'\n                becomes: \"NANBAB\"\n\n            We already checked that \"NANBAB\" does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\n        But the example in the problem swapped index2 and 6 to get \"BNNBAA\". \n\n        However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n        So we can use: \n            m = (n+1)//2   [which is the same as: for even n: n//2, for odd n: (n+1)//2 = (n//2)+1]\n\n        Then for i in range(m):\n            print(f\"{3*i+1} {3*n - 3*i}\")\n\n        But wait: \n          For n=3 (odd): \n            m = (3+1)//2 = 2\n            i=0: swap index1 and 9\n            i=1: swap index4 and 6\n\n          Why 6? because 3*3 - 3*1 = 9-3=6.\n\n          Let's simulate for n=3: \n            Original: \"BANBANBAN\"\n\n            After first swap (index1 and 9):\n                index1: originally 'B' becomes the last character of the last block: 'N'\n                index9: originally 'N' becomes the first character: 'B'\n                -> \"NANBANBAB\"\n\n            After second swap (index4 and 6):\n                index4: originally the first character of the second block: 'B'\n                index6: originally the last character of the second block: 'N'\n                swap: so index4 becomes 'N', index6 becomes 'B'\n                -> \"NAN\" (first block) then \"NAB\" (second block: index4 becomes 'N', index5 remains 'A', index6 becomes 'B') then the third block: \"BAB\" (but wait, the third block: index7='B', index8='A', index9='B'? but we swapped index9 already? \n                Actually, the third block: \n                  index7: 'B'\n                  index8: 'A'\n                  index9: we swapped index9 with index1, so now index9 is 'B'? \n                But then the third block is \"BAB\"\n\n                The entire string: \"NANNABBAB\" -> but wait, let me write by index:\n                  index1: 'N'\n                  index2: 'A'\n                  index3: 'N'\n                  index4: 'N' (swapped: originally 'B', now swapped with index6 which was 'N')\n                  index5: 'A'\n                  index6: 'B' (swapped: originally 'N', now swapped with index4)\n                  index7: 'B'\n                  index8: 'A'\n                  index9: 'B'\n\n                So: \"N\", \"A\", \"N\", \"N\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\"\n\n            Now, can we form \"BAN\" as a subsequence?\n                We need a 'B' then an 'A' then an 'N'. \n                The first 'B' is at index6? Then we look for an 'A' after index6: we have index8: 'A'. Then we look for an 'N' after index8? There is no 'N' after index8. \n                What about a 'B' at index7? Then an 'A' at index8, then no 'N' after? \n                What about a 'B' at index6: then an 'A' at index8, then no 'N'? \n                What about a 'B' at index1? no, because index1 is 'N'. \n                The first 'B' is at index6? Actually, we have:\n                  index6: 'B'\n                  index7: 'B'\n                  index9: 'B'\n                and the only 'A's are at index2,5,8. \n                The 'N's are at index1,3,4.\n\n                To form \"BAN\", we need a 'B' at an index i, then an 'A' at j>i, then an 'N' at k>j. \n                But note: after any 'B' (at index6,7,9) the only 'A' that comes after is at index8 (for index6 and index7) and then after index8 there is no 'N'. \n                Also, the 'B' at index9: after that there is no character. \n\n                So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n            m = (n+1)//2\n            for i in range(m):\n                print(f\"{3*i+1} {3*n - 3*i}\")\n\n        But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n        However, the example for n=1: \n            swap index1 and index3 -> which is 1 and 3.\n\n        The example for n=2: \n            swap index1 and index6 -> 1 and 6.\n\n        But the example in the problem for n=2 swapped index2 and 6. \n\n        Why is that? \n\n        Actually, the known solution from contests uses the above pattern. \n\n        So we'll output:\n\n          if n==1: \n            m=1, and swap 1 and 2? or 1 and 3? \n            The problem example for n=1: swap 1 and 2 -> but our solution swaps 1 and 3.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n        But note: the problem also says: \"the minimum number of operations\", and for n=1, 1 operation is minimal.\n\n        So we can output:\n\n          For any n:\n            m = (n+1)//2\n            operations: for i in range(m): \n                         a = 3*i+1\n                         b = 3*n - 3*i   # because 3*i+1 and 3*n - 3*i\n\n        However, wait: for n=1: \n            a = 1, b = 3*1 - 0 = 3 -> swap indices 1 and 3.\n\n        But the example in the problem for n=1 swapped 1 and 2. \n\n        Why 1 and 2? \n          Original: \"BAN\" -> swap(1,2): \n            index1: 'B' becomes 'A'\n            index2: 'A' becomes 'B'\n            -> \"ABN\"\n\n          Our solution: swap(1,3): \n            index1: 'B' becomes 'N'\n            index3: 'N' becomes 'B'\n            -> \"NAB\"\n\n        Both break the subsequence \"BAN\".\n\n        So we can use the known pattern.\n\n        But note: the provided code in the problem for even n was:\n\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                print(n // 2)\n                for k in range((n // 2)):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This is different: \n            For n=2: \n                k=0: ans=1, then (3*2) - 1 + 1 = 6 -> so it prints \"1 6\", which is the same as our known solution? \n            But wait: our known solution for n=2: \n                i=0: 1 and 6 -> same.\n\n        However, for n=3 (odd) the provided code does:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO.\n\n        The known solution for odd n: \n            m = (n+1)//2 = (3+1)//2 = 2\n            for i in range(2):\n                print(3*i+1, 3*n - 3*i)   # for i=0: 1 and 9, for i=1: 4 and 6.\n\n        But the provided code for even n used: \n            for k in range(n//2):\n                ans = 3*k+1\n                print(ans, 3*n - ans + 1)\n\n        For even n: \n            k=0: 1 and 3*n - 1 + 1 = 3*n\n            k=1: 4 and 3*n - 4 + 1 = 3*n-3\n\n        But our known solution for even n: \n            k=0: 1 and 3*n\n            k=1: 4 and 3*n - 3   [if n>=4, then k=1: i=1 -> 3*1+1=4, and 3*n-3*1=3*n-3]\n\n        So the known solution and the provided even code are the same? \n\n        Actually, the provided even code: \n            prints: (3*k+1, 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1) = (3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        Because: 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k - 1 + 1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n        So it is the same as the known solution: 3*k+1 and 3*n - 3*k.\n\n        Therefore, we can do for both even and odd:\n\n            m = (n+1)//2   [which is the same as: (n//2) if n even? no: for even: (n+1)//2 = n//2 + n%2, but for even n%2=0 -> n//2, for odd: (n+1)//2 = (n//2)+1]\n\n            Then for k in range(m):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n        But note: the provided code for even n used m = n//2, and for odd n we are going to use m = n//2+1.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                m = n // 2\n            else:\n                m = n // 2 + 1\n\n            Then for k in range(m):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n        Alternatively, we can write m = (n+1)//2, which is the same.\n\n        So we can simplify:\n\n            m = (n+1) // 2   # because for even: (n+1)//2 = n//2 (if n is even, then n=2k -> (2k+1)//2 = k, integer division) and for odd: (n+1)//2 = (2k+1+1)//2 = (2k+2)//2 = k+1.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            print((n+1)//2)\n            for k in range((n+1)//2):\n                print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But wait: the provided code for even n in the problem was:\n\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                print(n // 2)\n                for k in range((n // 2)):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        And we see that: \n            (3 * n) - ans + 1 = 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k = 3*(n-k)\n\n        And our solution: 3*n - 3*k = 3*(n-k) -> same.\n\n        However, the provided code for even n uses the same formula? \n\n        But the problem says: the example for n=2: they swapped index2 and 6, but our solution swaps 1 and 6.\n\n        But the problem accepts any solution.\n\n        So we can complete the code for odd n by:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    i = 3*k+1\n                    j = 3*n - 3*k\n                    print(i, j)\n\n        But note: the provided code for even n used: \n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)   -> which is the same as: (3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k) because 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n        So we can write the same for both? \n\n        Actually, we can unify the entire code:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                m = (n+1)//2\n                print(m)\n                for k in range(m):\n                    i = 3*k+1\n                    j = 3*n - 3*k\n                    print(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n        But the problem's initial code had:\n\n            if n==1: \n                print(1)\n                print(\"1 2\")\n            elif n==2:\n                print(1)\n                print(\"2 6\")\n            else:\n                if n%2==0:\n                    ... \n                else:\n                    ...\n\n        Why did they have n==1 and n==2 separately? \n\n        For n=1: \n            Our unified: m = (1+1)//2 = 1\n            k=0: i=1, j=3*1 - 0 = 3 -> so we print \"1 3\"\n\n        But the problem's initial code for n=1 printed \"1 2\".\n\n        And for n=2: \n            m = (2+1)//2 = 1\n            k=0: i=1, j=6 -> \"1 6\"\n\n        But the problem's initial code for n=2 printed \"2 6\".\n\n        So the initial code for n=1 and n=2 is different from our unified solution.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n        But the problem also says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to complete the given code.\n\n        The given code has:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"1 2\")\n\n                elif n == 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"2 6\")\n\n                else:\n                    if n % 2 == 0:\n                        print(n // 2)\n                        for k in range((n // 2)):\n                            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n                    else:\n                        print(n // 2 + 1)\n                        for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO for the odd case.\n\n        We have two options:\n          Option 1: use the same pattern as the even case? \n          Option 2: use the known solution pattern.\n\n        The even case in the provided code uses: \n            for k in range(n//2):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n        For the odd case, we are going to do n//2+1 swaps.\n\n        We can do the same pattern: \n            for k in range(n//2+1):\n                i = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - 3*k   # because 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n        But note: the even case in the provided code uses j = 3*n - ans + 1, which is 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            for k in range((n//2)+1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This will be consistent with the even case.\n\n        Let me test for n=3 (odd):\n            k=0: ans=1 -> j = 3*3 - 1 + 1 = 9 -> so \"1 9\"\n            k=1: ans=4 -> j = 9 - 4 + 1 = 6 -> \"4 6\"\n            k=2: ans=7 -> j = 9 - 7 + 1 = 3 -> \"7 3\"\n\n        But wait, k goes from 0 to n//2 (which is 1) -> so k=0 and k=1? \n            n//2 for n=3 is 1, so range(1+1)=range(2) -> k=0 and k=1.\n\n        So we get:\n            swap 1 and 9\n            swap 4 and 6\n\n        This is the same as the known solution.\n\n        However, note the known solution for n=3: \n            swap 1 and 9, and 4 and 6.\n\n        But the known solution we discussed earlier for n=3: \n            i=0: 1 and 9\n            i=1: 4 and 6   -> same.\n\n        So we can complete the TODO with:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the provided code for even n uses the same formula.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        This will work for the odd case.\n\n        However, let me check the indices for k in the odd case: \n            n=3: k from 0 to 1 (inclusive) -> two swaps.\n\n        But what about n=1? \n            The provided code already handled n=1 separately: \n                if n==1: \n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"1 2\")\n\n            So for n>=3 we use the else.\n\n        But wait, what if n=3? \n            We are printing two swaps: \n                k=0: 1 and 9\n                k=1: 4 and 6\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 200000, but note that the number of test cases t<=10000, but the sum of n<=200000, so we are safe.\n\n        But note: the provided code for even n and the odd n use the same formula for the indices? \n\n        Actually, the even n code uses the same formula: \n            for k in range(n//2):\n                ans = 3*k+1\n                j = 3*n - ans + 1\n\n        And the odd n code we are writing the same.\n\n        So we can write the entire else block as:\n\n            else:\n                print(n // 2 + 1)\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the example for n=1 and n=2 are handled separately and are different.\n\n        Why did they handle n=1 and n=2 separately? \n          For n=1: they printed \"1 2\", but the formula for k=0: \n                ans = 3*0+1 = 1\n                j = 3*1 - 1 + 1 = 3 -> \"1 3\", but they printed \"1 2\".\n\n          For n=2: they printed \"2 6\", but the formula for k=0: \n                ans=1, j=6 -> \"1 6\", but they printed \"2 6\".\n\n        So the provided code for n=1 and n=2 is different from the formula.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are only to complete the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is only in the else part for n>=3 and odd. \n\n        So we complete the TODO with:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the provided code for even n uses the same two lines.\n\n        Therefore, the entire program becomes:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"1 2\")\n                elif n == 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"2 6\")\n                else:\n                    if n % 2 == 0:\n                        print(n // 2)\n                        for k in range((n // 2)):\n                            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n                    else:\n                        print(n // 2 + 1)\n                        for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        However, we note that the known solution for n=1 and n=2 can be generalized, but the problem already has specific cases.\n\n        We are only to complete the TODO.\n\n        So the missing code for the odd case is:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the problem expects the output for the odd case to be the same as the even case in terms of the formula.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\n        The missing block is the body of the for-loop in the else part for odd n.\n\n        But note: the for-loop is already written: \n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n\n        We are to complete the body.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\n        However, the problem has two programs? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        But we are only given one code block for program1.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the output format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        But we have two programs? \n\n        Looking back: \n          The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n        But in the input, we see two code blocks? \n\n        Actually, the problem has two parts: \n          We are to complete two programs? \n\n        But the problem statement only shows one code block (for program1.py) and then the next code block (for program2.py) is not provided? \n\n        Wait, the problem says: \n          \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        Then it shows:\n\n          # program1.py\n          ... (code)\n\n          Code:\n\n          for t in range(int(input())):\n              ... (with a TODO)\n\n          Then:\n\n          # program2.py\n          ... (code)\n\n          But we don't see program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem only provided program1.py? \n\n        Rethink: \n          The problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        And then: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n        And the output format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So we are to complete two programs? \n\n        But the problem only provided one program (program1.py) and we don't see program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \n          \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py.\n\n          Then it says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n        But we don't see program2.py? \n\n        And the example output format: \n          {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So we must complete both? \n\n        However, the problem only provided one code block (for program1.py) and then the next code block (for program2.py) is missing? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n          \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        But in the input, we only see one program? \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n          \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        This implies that program1.py outputs something and program2.py reads from stdin and processes.\n\n        But the problem only provided program1.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py.\n\n        Then it shows the code for program1.py.\n\n        Then it says: \n          # program2.py\n          ... (but then there is no code for program2.py, instead we see:)\n\n          Code:\n\n          for t in range(int(input())):\n              ... (this is actually the code for program1.py)\n\n        So I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Actually, the problem has two parts: \n          Part1: program1.py (which we are given and we completed the TODO for the odd case) \n          Part2: program2.py (which we are not given? but the problem says we are given both with missing lines or blocks)\n\n        But the problem only provided one code block? \n\n        Looking at the entire problem statement: \n          It says: \n            You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\n\n          Then it shows:\n\n            # program1.py\n            ... (description of program1)\n\n            Code for program1.py:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                ... (with a TODO)\n\n            Then:\n\n            # program2.py\n            ... (description of program2)\n\n            Code for program2.py:\n\n            ... (with a TODO)\n\n        But in the problem statement, after program1.py, we see:\n\n            # program2.py\n            Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n            Description: ... (the same description as program1.py? or different?)\n\n        Actually, the problem statement for program2.py is not shown? \n\n        I think there is a mistake in the problem presentation.\n\n        But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        And the output format is a json with two keys.\n\n        So we must complete two programs? \n\n        However, the problem only provided one program? \n\n        Let me read the initial problem: \n          \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n        But then it only shows one program? \n\n        And then it says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        And the example output format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So I think we are expected to complete both.\n\n        But we only have one TODO in program1.py? \n\n        And we don't see program2.py? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        After re\u2010reading the entire problem, it seems that the problem has two separate programs. \n        However, the problem statement only provided the description and code for program1.py.\n\n        But then it says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py, and then immediately after that, it says:\n\n          # program2.py\n\n          with missing lines or blocks.\n\n        But there is no description for program2.py? \n\n        And then it shows:\n\n          Code:\n\n          for t in range(int(input())):\n              ... (this is the same as program1.py)\n\n        This is likely a formatting issue.\n\n        Given the constraints, I think the problem might have intended to have only one program? \n\n        But the output format requires two completions.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have two programs: \n          program1.py: which outputs the operations for each test case (which we completed above)\n          program2.py: which might be a program that reads the output of program1.py and does something? \n\n        But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        And the description of the problem is the same for both? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n          \"For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total.\"\n\n        But wait, that is the output specification for program1.py? \n\n        And then for program2.py, we don't have a description.\n\n        I think there might be a mix-up.\n\n        Let me look at the problem again: \n          The first part: \n            \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\"\n            Description: ... (about candies and Alice and Bob) -> that is program1.py.\n\n          Then: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          Then it shows:\n\n            # program1.py\n            ... (the code we have)\n\n            # program2.py\n            ...

(the same description as for program1.py) \n\n        But wait, the description for program1.py was about candies, and now for program2.py it is the same? \n\n        And then the input specification is the same? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        But then it says: \n          \"Output Specification: For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total.\"\n\n        And then it shows code for program2.py? \n\n        But the code for program2.py is:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                ... (with a TODO)\n\n        This is the same as program1.py? \n\n        I think there is a duplication.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and we have two programs to complete, but both seem to have the same code? \n\n        And the TODO in program1.py is in the else block for odd n.\n\n        But what about program2.py? \n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n        And then it shows two code blocks? \n\n        Actually, the first code block is for program1.py and the second code block is for program2.py? \n\n        But the second code block is labeled as:\n\n            # program2.py\n\n            Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n            Description: ...

(with a TODO)\n\n        But the TODO in program2.py is different? \n\n        In program1.py, the TODO was in the else block for odd n.\n\n        In program2.py, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input())\r\n            for i in range(n):\r\n                h = 1\r\n                g = 1\r\n                counter = 0\r\n                m = int(input())\r\n                lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n                index =0\r\n                e= 0\r\n                r =m-1\r\n                highest = lst[m-1]\r\n                lowest = lst[0]\r\n                while h+g <= m:\r\n                    if lowest<highest:\r\n                        lowest+=lst[e+1]\r\n                        e+=1\r\n                        g +=1\r\n                    elif highest<lowest:\r\n                        # TODO: Your code here\r\n                    elif highest == lowest:\r\n                        lowest+=lst[e+1]\r\n                        e+=1\r\n                        g+=1\r\n                        index = e + (m - r)\r\n                print(index)\n\n        This is a different program.\n\n        So we have two programs:\n\n          program1.py: about the BAN problem.\n          program2.py: about the candies problem (Alice and Bob eating from left and right).\n\n        And we are to complete both.\n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        How does that work?\n\n          program1.py reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and a list of n integers, and outputs the answer for that test case.\n\n          But program2.py also reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads m and a list of m integers, and outputs the answer.\n\n        Then piping: \n          program1.py outputs the answers for its test cases, but program2.py is expecting test cases as input.\n\n        This doesn't match.\n\n        Unless program1.py is not outputting the answer but the operations? \n\n        Let me read the output specification for program1.py: \n          \"For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total.\"\n\n        But wait, that is the output specification for program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the description for program1.py is the candies problem? \n\n        But the code for program1.py is labeled as the BAN problem? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me reread the entire problem statement:\n\n          The problem has two parts:\n\n          Part1: \n            # program1.py\n            Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n            Description: ...

(candies)\n\n            Code for program1.py is missing a block? \n\n          Part2:\n            # program2.py\n            Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n            Description: ... (about BAN)   [This is the BAN problem]\n\n            Input Specification: ... (BAN)\n\n            Output Specification: ... (BAN)\n\n            Notes: ... (BAN)\n\n            Code for program2.py is missing a block? \n\n        But in the problem statement, the first description is about candies, and then the second description is about BAN? \n\n        However, the code provided for program1.py is for the BAN problem, and the code for program2.py is for the candies problem? \n\n        This is swapped.\n\n        Given the output of program1.py is piped to program2.py, and program1.py (BAN) outputs the operations (which are integers and pairs of integers) and program2.py (candies) expects test cases (which start with an integer t), it doesn't match.\n\n        I think there is a mix-up in the labeling.\n\n        But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        And the output of program1.py becomes the input of program2.py.\n\n        For the BAN problem (program1.py), the output for one test case is:\n          First line: m (an integer)\n          Then m lines of two integers.\n\n        For the candies problem (program2.py), the input for one test case is:\n          First line: an integer m (the number of candies)\n          Second line: m integers.\n\n        So if program1.py outputs:\n          1\n          2 6\n\n        then program2.py would read:\n          t = 1 (the first integer) -> then it would expect one test case: \n             first line of the test case: m = 2 (from the first integer after t? but there is no t in the output of program1.py for the next test case)\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem asks for the missing code for two programs, and we have two distinct programs with TODOs, we will complete both TODOs.\n\n        We already completed program1.py (the BAN problem) for the odd case.\n\n        Now for program2.py (the candies problem), we have a TODO in the while loop:\n\n            while h+g <= m:\n                if lowest<highest:\n                    lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                    e+=1\n                    g +=1\n                elif highest<lowest:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif highest == lowest:\n                    lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                    e+=1\n                    g+=1\n                    index = e + (m - r)\n\n        We are to complete the TODO for the condition \"highest<lowest\".\n\n        Description of the candies problem:\n\n          There are n candies. Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right.\n          They want to have the same total weight.\n\n          We are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: \n              t=1\n              n=2\n              weights = [1,1]\n\n            Output: 2\n\n          Approach:\n\n          We can use two pointers: \n            left = 0, right = n-1\n            sum_left = 0, sum_right = 0\n            count_left = 0, count_right = 0\n            total_count = 0\n\n          We want to find the maximum total candies such that sum_left == sum_right.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            while left <= right:\n                if sum_left <= sum_right:\n                    sum_left += arr[left]\n                    left += 1\n                    count_left += 1\n                else:\n                    sum_right += arr[right]\n                    right -= 1\n                    count_right += 1\n\n                if sum_left == sum_right:\n                    total_count = count_left + count_right\n\n          But note: we might have to continue to find the last time they are equal.\n\n          However, the provided code in program2.py uses:\n\n            h = 1   (probably representing something)\n            g = 1   (probably representing something)\n            counter = 0   (not used?)\n            m = n? (the number of candies)\n            lst = the list of weights\n            e = 0 (left pointer index)\n            r = m-1 (right pointer index)\n            highest = lst[m-1]   (the current sum for Bob? but it's initialized to the last element)\n            lowest = lst[0]      (the current sum for Alice? initialized to the first element)\n\n            while h+g <= m:   (h and g are counts? so h is count for Alice, g for Bob? or vice versa? \n                if lowest < highest:\n                    lowest += lst[e+1]   -> then e increases, and g increases? \n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1   -> why g? \n\n            This is confusing.\n\n          Let me try to understand the variables:\n\n            e: index for the next candy for Alice? (from the left) -> currently Alice has eaten [0, e]?\n            r: index for the next candy for Bob? (from the right) -> currently Bob has eaten [r, m-1]?\n\n            But then:\n\n            lowest = sum of candies eaten by Alice? \n            highest = sum of candies eaten by Bob?\n\n            However, initially:\n                Alice has eaten the first candy: lst[0] -> so e=0 means she has eaten index0? \n                But then in the if block: \n                    if lowest < highest:\n                        she eats the next candy: e+1 -> so now she eats from index0 to index1? \n                But then g increases? g is for Bob? \n\n            Why does g increase when Alice eats?\n\n            The variable g might be the count of candies eaten by Bob? and h for Alice? \n\n            But initially: h=1, g=1 -> so both have eaten one candy? \n                Alice: one candy (index0) -> sum = lst[0]\n                Bob: one candy (index m-1) -> sum = lst[m-1]\n\n            Then the condition: while h+g <= m -> total candies eaten so far is h+g, and we can continue until we've eaten all.\n\n            In the if block for lowest < highest:\n                Alice eats the next candy: e+1 -> so e was 0, now e=1, and she adds lst[1] to lowest.\n                Then g increases by 1? -> now g=2, meaning Bob has eaten 2 candies? but Bob hasn't eaten another candy.\n\n            This is not matching.\n\n          Let me read the code again:\n\n            if lowest < highest:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1   -> this is likely a mistake.\n\n          It should be: when Alice eats, only Alice's count (h) increases.\n\n          Similarly, when Bob eats, only Bob's count (g) should increase.\n\n          But in the code:\n\n            if lowest < highest:\n                # Alice eats the next candy\n                e += 1   -> moving the left pointer to the next\n                lowest += lst[e]   -> but wait, the code says: lowest += lst[e+1] and then e+=1 -> that would be lst[e+1] before incrementing e? \n\n          Actually, initially e=0.\n          Then: lowest = lst[0] (from initialization)\n          Then in the if block: \n                lowest += lst[e+1]  -> lst[1]\n                then e becomes e+1 -> e=1.\n\n          So after this, Alice has eaten two candies: index0 and index1.\n\n          But then g (Bob's count) is increased by 1? \n\n          This is not logical.\n\n          In the condition for equal: \n                lowest == highest:\n                then Alice eats the next candy: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1   -> again, Bob's count increases?\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          Let me look at the variable 'index': \n                index = e + (m - r)\n\n          And at the end, we print index.\n\n          What is index? \n            e: the last index that Alice has eaten? but she has eaten [0, e]? -> count = e+1? \n            r: the current right pointer? Bob has eaten [r, m-1]? -> count = m - r?\n\n          So total candies eaten = (e+1) + (m - r) = e+1 + m - r.\n\n          But in the equal condition, we set index = e + (m - r) [but note: at that moment, we have just added one candy to Alice, so e is the new e, and r hasn't changed?]\n\n          However, in the equal condition, we do:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]   -> then e becomes e+1, and then g increases, and then set index = e + (m - r)\n\n          But why do we increase g (Bob's count) when Alice eats? \n\n          I think the variables are named poorly.\n\n          Let me try to reinterpret:\n\n            The code uses:\n                h: count of candies eaten by Alice? \n                g: count of candies eaten by Bob?\n\n            But then in the if block for Alice: \n                we do: \n                    e += 1   -> so e is the next index for Alice? \n                    lowest += lst[e]   -> but the code says: lowest += lst[e+1] and then e+=1 -> that would be using e+1 as the index, then e becomes e+1.\n\n            This is equivalent to: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e = e+1\n\n            which means Alice is eating the candy at index e+1? and then e becomes e+1.\n\n            But initially e=0, so she eats index1? and then e becomes 1.\n\n            But she had already eaten index0 (from initialization: lowest = lst[0]), so now she has eaten two candies: index0 and index1.\n\n            Then g (Bob's count) is increased by 1? \n\n          This is not making sense.\n\n          In the equal condition, we do the same: Alice eats one more candy, and then we set index = e + (m - r) [which is the total candies eaten: Alice: e+1 (because e is the last index she ate, so count=e+1) and Bob: m - r (because Bob has eaten from r to m-1, count = m-1 - r + 1 = m - r)].\n\n          But then we also increase g by 1? \n\n          And then we also increase g in the Alice block and in the Bob block (the TODO) we would do the same for Bob? \n\n          It seems that g is not the count for Bob, but something else.\n\n          Let me see the while condition: while h+g <= m.\n\n          What is h and g? \n            Initially: h=1, g=1 -> total=2, and m is the total candies.\n\n          In the Alice block: \n                g increases by 1 -> so g becomes 2, then the next condition: h+g = 1+2 = 3, which is <= m (if m>=3)\n\n          In the Bob block: we would do similarly: increase h by 1? \n\n          But the TODO is in the Bob block.\n\n          The code for the equal condition also increases g by 1.\n\n          This suggests that g is not the count for Bob.\n\n          Another possibility: \n            h: count of candies eaten by Alice?\n            g: count of candies eaten by Bob?\n\n          Then when Alice eats, we should do: \n                h += 1\n          and when Bob eats, we should do:\n                g += 1\n\n          and the condition: while h+g <= m (which is while the total eaten is <= m)\n\n          But in the code, in the Alice block, we are increasing g, not h.\n\n          This is likely a mistake.\n\n          Let me change the variable names for clarity:\n\n            Let alice_count = h\n            bob_count = g\n\n          Then in the Alice block, we should do:\n                alice_count += 1   (so h should increase)\n\n          In the Bob block, we should do:\n                bob_count += 1   (so g should increase)\n\n          In the equal condition, we should do:\n                alice_count += 1   (if we are giving the next candy to Alice) or bob_count += 1? \n\n          But in the equal condition, the code does:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]   -> Alice eats the next\n                e += 1\n                g += 1   -> this should be h += 1.\n\n          So the code has a mistake: in the Alice block and in the equal condition, it increases g (bob_count) instead of h (alice_count).\n\n          But the TODO is for the Bob block.\n\n          In the Bob block, we should do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]   [because currently highest is the sum for Bob, and he eats from the right, so the next is r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                and then increase the bob_count (g) by 1? \n\n          But the code in the Alice block for the condition \"lowest < highest\" does:\n\n                lowest += lst[e+1]   -> Alice eats the next candy to the right: at index e+1\n                e += 1\n                g += 1   -> this should be h += 1\n\n          Similarly, in the condition \"highest < lowest\", we should do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]   -> Bob eats the next candy to the left: at index r-1\n                r -= 1\n                and then we should increase g (bob_count) by 1? -> but the code in the equal condition increases g, so we are consistent in the mistake.\n\n          However, the variable 'g' is used in the condition and in the assignment to index.\n\n          The variable 'index' in the equal condition: index = e + (m - r)\n\n          What is e? the last index eaten by Alice is e, so the count of Alice is e+1? \n          What is r? the next index for Bob is r, so the count of Bob is m - r? \n\n          But then the total eaten = (e+1) + (m - r) = e+1 + m - r.\n\n          In the while condition: we use h+g, which is alice_count + bob_count.\n\n          But if in the Alice block we do:\n                g += 1   [which is bob_count increases] \n          then bob_count is not the count for Bob.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the code is likely to have a bug in the variable names, we will complete the TODO in the same style.\n\n          For the condition \"highest < lowest\", we do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          But wait, the code in the Alice block for \"lowest < highest\" does:\n\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n\n          and in the equal condition:\n\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n\n          So for consistency, in the Bob block we should do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          Why h? because in the Alice block they used g, and in the Bob block they use h? \n\n          This is swapping the counters.\n\n          Alternatively, the author intended:\n\n            h: count for Bob?\n            g: count for Alice?\n\n          Then in the Alice block, we increase g (Alice's count) -> that makes sense.\n          In the Bob block, we increase h (Bob's count) -> that makes sense.\n\n          And in the equal condition, we increase g (Alice's count) when Alice eats.\n\n          Then the while condition: h+g is the total candies eaten.\n\n          And the assignment: index = e + (m - r)\n\n          What is e? \n            Alice has eaten from index0 to index e -> count = e+1? \n            But the count for Alice is g, so g = e+1? \n\n          Initially: \n            Alice: e=0, g=1 -> g = 1 = 0+1 -> matches.\n            Bob: r = m-1, and he has eaten one candy (at index m-1), so count = 1 = m - (m-1) = 1 -> matches.\n\n          When Alice eats again:\n            e becomes 1, and g becomes 2 -> count=2 = 1+1 -> matches.\n\n          So the assignment in the equal condition: \n                index = e + (m - r) \n            is the total candies eaten: (e+1) [for Alice] + (m - r) [for Bob] = (g) + (h) because:\n                g = e+1, and h = m - r? \n\n          But wait, initially: \n                h = 1, and m - r = m - (m-1) = 1 -> matches.\n          After Alice eats one more: \n                e=1, g=2 -> Alice count=2.\n                r is still m-1, so Bob count = 1 = h.\n                then index = 1 + (m - (m-1)) = 1+1 = 2, but the total eaten is 3 (Alice:2, Bob:1) -> not matching.\n\n          In the equal condition, after Alice eats, we set:\n                index = e + (m - r) \n                e is now 1 (after increment) -> so e=1.\n                r is unchanged -> m - r = 1.\n                index = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          But the total eaten is Alice:2, Bob:1 -> 3.\n\n          So it should be (e+1) + (m - r) = 2+1 = 3.\n\n          Therefore, the assignment should be: index = (e+1) + (m - r)\n\n          But the code does: index = e + (m - r) \n\n          And e is the index of the last candy eaten by Alice, so the count is e+1.\n\n          So the code is missing the +1.\n\n          However, in the equal condition, we do:\n                e += 1   -> so after this, e is the new index (which is the last index eaten by Alice), so count = e+1? \n                but wait, initially e=0 -> count=1.\n                after one eat: e=1 -> count=2.\n\n          So count = e+1.\n\n          Therefore, index = (e+1) + (m - r) \n\n          But the code says: index = e + (m - r)\n\n          This is off by one for Alice.\n\n          Similarly, for Bob: \n                when we do r -= 1, then the count for Bob is m - r? \n                initially: r = m-1, count = 1 = m - (m-1) = 1.\n                after Bob eats one more: r becomes m-2, count = 2 = m - (m-2) = 2.\n\n          So count for Bob = m - r.\n\n          Therefore, total = (e+1) + (m - r)\n\n          But the code sets: index = e + (m - r)\n\n          So we should change the assignment in the equal condition to:\n                index = (e+1) + (m - r)\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is only in the condition \"highest<lowest\".\n\n          So we cannot change the equal condition.\n\n          Given the time, and since the online judge might be using the flawed counting, we will complete the TODO in the same style as the Alice block.\n\n          For the condition \"highest<lowest\", we do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          But note: in the Alice block, they used the next index for Alice: lst[e+1] and then e+=1.\n          For Bob, we should use the next index to the left: lst[r-1] and then r-=1.\n\n          However, what if r-1 is out of bounds? \n            initially r = m-1, then r-1 = m-2, which is valid as long as m>=2.\n\n          The while condition: h+g<=m, and we start with h=1, g=1, so initially 2<=m -> so m>=2.\n\n          But what if m=1? \n            The while condition: h+g=2, and m=1 -> 2<=1 is false, so we skip the while loop.\n            Then we print index=0? \n            But the answer for m=1 should be 0? because Alice and Bob cannot eat the same weight: \n                Alice eats the only candy: weight w, Bob has nothing -> not equal.\n            So 0 is correct.\n\n          But the code for m=1: \n            We don't enter the while loop, and we print index=0.\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n          Therefore, for the TODO in program2.py:\n\n            elif highest<lowest:\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          But wait, in the equal condition, they do:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n                index = e + (m - r)\n\n          Should we update index in the other conditions? \n            In the Alice block and Bob block, they do not update index. \n            Only in the equal condition.\n\n          The idea is: we update index only when we have an equal total, and we want the last time they were equal? or the maximum total when they are equal.\n\n          We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n          So we should update index whenever we have an equal total, and we want the maximum total.\n\n          But the code currently updates index only in the equal condition.\n\n          However, the while loop might have multiple equal conditions, and we take the last one? \n\n          But the last one might not be the maximum? \n\n          Actually, we want the maximum total candies eaten with equal weight.\n\n          We should record the maximum total candies whenever we have an equal.\n\n          The code currently updates index in the equal condition, and then continues.\n\n          But after that, we continue to eat and might get a higher total.\n\n          However, the code in the equal condition does: \n                Alice eats one more candy, and then updates index = e + (m - r) [which is the total candies at that moment]\n\n          But after that, the totals might become unequal, and then we might get another equal later.\n\n          And we want the maximum.\n\n          So we should do: \n                if we have an equal, then we record the total candies eaten (which is (e+1)+(m-r)) and then continue.\n\n          But the code does: \n                index = e + (m - r)   [which is not the total, because it should be e+1 + m - r]\n\n          and then continues.\n\n          And at the end, we print index.\n\n          But if there are multiple equals, we take the last one? \n\n          We want the maximum, so we should take the maximum over the equals.\n\n          However, the code does not compare with the previous index.\n\n          We should do: \n                if we have an equal, then total = (e+1) + (m - r)\n                if total > current_max, then current_max = total\n\n          But the code doesn't do that.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we are only to complete the TODO.\n\n          So for the TODO in program2.py, we write:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          And hope that the rest of the code is correct.\n\n          But note: the index in the equal condition is computed as e + (m - r), which is not the total candies (it is off by one for Alice).\n\n          However, the sample: \n            n=2, [1,1]\n            We want to output 2.\n\n          Let's simulate for [1,1]:\n\n            m=2, lst=[1,1]\n            e=0, r=1 (m-1=1)\n            lowest = lst[0]=1\n            highest = lst[1]=1\n            -> they are equal.\n            Then we enter the equal condition:\n                lowest += lst[e+1] = lst[1] = 1 -> lowest=2\n                e += 1 -> e=1\n                g += 1 -> g=2\n                index = e + (m - r) = 1 + (2-1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n            Then we print 2.\n\n          But wait, after the equal condition, we have:\n                Alice has eaten [0,1] -> two candies, sum=2.\n                Bob has eaten [1] -> one candy, sum=1.\n            They are not equal.\n\n          And the total candies eaten is 3? \n\n          But the condition in the while loop: \n                h+g = 1 (initial) + 1 (initial) = 2, then in the equal condition we did g+=1 -> g=2, so h+g=1+2=3, and m=2 -> 3<=2 is false, so we break.\n\n          Then we print index=2.\n\n          And the expected answer is 2.\n\n          Why is the answer 2? \n            Because they can eat in such a way that the total weight is equal: \n                Alice eats the first candy (weight1), Bob eats the last candy (weight1) -> total candies=2.\n\n          But in our simulation, after the first equal (when they had both eaten one candy and the sums were 1 and 1) we did not record that.\n\n          We recorded only when we had the second equal? \n\n          But the first equal happened at the beginning, and then we made Alice eat another candy.\n\n          We should record the first equal: \n                when e=0, r=1: \n                    lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal.\n                then we should record: total = (0+1) + (2-1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          But the code only updates index in the equal condition AFTER we have added one more candy for Alice.\n\n          So we are not recording the first equal.\n\n          This is a flaw in the code.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is only for the condition \"highest<lowest\".\n\n          We are not to fix the entire code.\n\n          Given the sample n=2 works by accident (because after overeating by Alice we break and then output 2, which is the answer) but the recorded index=2 is the answer.\n\n          How did we get 2? \n            index = e + (m - r) = 1 + (2-1) = 2.\n\n          And that matches the expected answer.\n\n          But the state at that time is not equal, but the recorded index is 2.\n\n          And 2 is the maximum total candies eaten with equal weight (the first state: one each).\n\n          So the code is using the total candies eaten at the moment of the last equal (even if we then added more and made it unequal) and that total is the sum of the counts at the moment of the equal (before the extra eat) plus the extra eat? \n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          Given the time, we will complete the TODO as:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n          and hope that the rest of the code works.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        But note: we must be cautious for index out of bounds? \n          In the condition, we are about to access lst[r-1]. \n          Initially r = m-1, so r-1 = m-2, which is valid for m>=2.\n          And the while condition: h+g<=m, and initially h=g=1, so m>=2 to enter the loop.\n\n          In the Bob condition, we do r-=1, so r becomes m-2, then next time r-1 = m-3, which is valid until r-1>=0.\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n        Summary:\n\n          program1.py (BAN problem) for the odd case:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n          program2.py (candies problem) for the TODO in the condition \"highest<lowest\":\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        Now, we output in the required json format.\n\n        Note: The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is the body of the for-loop in the else block for odd n.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the elif condition.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n        And the output format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        We must output the string for the completion of program1 and program2.\n\n        For program1, the completion is:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the code for program1.py is in the else block for odd n, and the for-loop is already there.\n\n        For program2, the completion is:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        We output these as strings in the json.\n\n        However, the program1 completion has two lines.\n\n        We can use triple quotes?

\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines as they would appear in the program, with the same indentation.\n\n        The for-loop is indented by 8 spaces (because the else: is 4, then the for is 8, then the body 12).\n\n        But the problem does not specify the indentation level.\n\n        However, the provided code for even n in program1.py has:\n\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        which is 20 spaces?

(12 spaces for the body)\n\n        So the body should be indented by 12 spaces.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the two lines of the body.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        with 12 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n        But the provided code for even n has:\n\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        which is 12 spaces.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the missing code is in the elif block, which is at the same level as the if block.\n\n        In program2.py, the if block is:\n\n            if lowest<highest:\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g +=1\n\n        which is indented by 12 spaces (because the while loop is 8, then the if is 12, then the body 16).\n\n        So the completion for program2 should be:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        with 16 spaces for each line.\n\n        But the problem does not require the spaces? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body, so we output the body as it would appear.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: two lines, each with 12 spaces at the beginning.\n            program2: three lines, each with 16 spaces at the beginning.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the output is a json string.\n\n        We'll create a string for program1:\n\n            s1 = \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        and for program2:\n\n            s2 = \"            highest += lst[r-1]\\n            r -= 1\\n            h += 1\"\n\n        But wait, in program2, the if block has:\n\n                if lowest<highest:\n                    lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                    e+=1\n                    g +=1\n\n        which is three lines, each with 16 spaces.\n\n        So our s2 has three lines with 12 spaces? \n\n        We must match the indentation.\n\n        In the provided program2.py, the while loop is at 8 spaces, then the if, elif, else are at 12 spaces, and their bodies at 16 spaces.\n\n        So the TODO is in the body of the elif, so it should be 16 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we use 16 spaces for each line in program2.\n\n        But the provided if block in program2 has 16 spaces.\n\n        So:\n\n            s1 = \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n            s2 = \"                highest += lst[r-1]\\n                r -= 1\\n                h += 1\"\n\n        However, in the program2 code, the if block has:\n\n                if lowest<highest:\n                    lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                    e+=1\n                    g +=1\n\n        The body has three lines, each with one level of indentation (which is 4 more spaces than the if statement).\n\n        The if statement is at 12 spaces, so the body is at 16 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2: three lines, each starting with 16 spaces.\n\n        But the string for program2 should be:\n\n            \"                highest += lst[r-1]\\n                r -= 1\\n                h += 1\"\n\n        But note: the code in the if block uses \"lowest+=lst[e+1]\" and we are using \"highest += lst[r-1]\" -> note the space after 'highest' is not in the if block.\n\n        We can include the space for consistency.\n\n        Alternatively, the if block has no space: \"lowest+=lst[e+1]\" -> so we can do \"highest += lst[r-1]\" or \"highest+=lst[r-1]\"? \n\n        The if block uses no space, so we do without space for consistency.\n\n        But the code in the if block: \n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g +=1\n\n        So we do:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]   -> with space? \n        or \n                highest+=lst[r-1]      -> without space.\n\n        The if block uses without space.\n\n        So for consistency, we do without space.\n\n        Therefore, for program2:\n\n            line1: \"                highest+=lst[r-1]\"\n            line2: \"                r -= 1\"\n            line3: \"                h += 1\"\n\n        But the if block uses \"e+=1\" without space, and \"g +=1\" with space? \n          \"g +=1\" has a space before the = but not after? \n\n        We'll follow the style of the if block.\n\n        The if block: \n            \"lowest+=lst[e+1]\" -> no spaces\n            \"e+=1\" -> no spaces\n            \"g +=1\" -> space before = and no space after.\n\n        So for the Bob block:\n\n            \"highest+=lst[r-1]\" -> no spaces\n            \"r-=1\" -> no spaces\n            \"h +=1\" -> space before = and no space after.\n\n        But the if block for the equal condition has:\n\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g+=1\n\n        So they are not consistent.\n\n        We'll follow the exact string as in the if block for the condition \"lowest<highest\", which is:\n\n            \"                lowest+=lst[e+1]\"\n            \"                e+=1\"\n            \"                g +=1\"\n\n        So for the Bob block, we do:\n\n            \"                highest+=lst[r-1]\"\n            \"                r-=1\"\n            \"                h +=1\"\n\n        But the second line: \"r-=1\" -> no space, and the third line: \"h +=1\" -> space before =.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2 is:\n\n            \"                highest+=lst[r-1]\\n                r-=1\\n                h +=1\"\n\n        Now, we output the json.\n\n        Example:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\",\n                \"program2\": \"                highest+=lst[r-1]\\n                r-=1\\n                h +=1\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program1 completion has a print function call, which is correct.\n\n        And the program2 completion has three lines.\n\n        We are done."
