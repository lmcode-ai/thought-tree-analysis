For n=2: we swap index2 (which is the 'A' of the first BAN) and index6 (which is the 'N' of the second BAN).

For i=1, the partner is (n-1-1)=3-1-1=1 -> so the same block? Then we swap the A and the N in the same block? Then the block becomes B, N, A -> which is not BAN. So that works. But the problem: the example for n=1 we did not use the same method? Because the code already handled n=1 separately. So for the for loop in program2.py (which runs for aux times, and aux = ceil(n/2)), we do:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        # we output: str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: for n=1, we don't enter the for loop because aux = (1+1)//2 = 1? But the code already handled n=1 above. So the for loop is for n>=2? Actually, the code does:\n\n   if n==1: \n        result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n        continue\n\n   Then for n>=2, we compute aux = ... and then the for loop.

But note: the problem says the indices must be distinct and in the range [1, 3n]. So we output:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the example for n=1 was handled separately, so we don't use the for loop for n=1.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight they each eat to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (l from left, h from right) and two variables (a for Alice's total weight, b for Bob's total weight). The idea is to try to balance the weights a and b. The code already handles the case when a > b: then Bob eats the candy at h (from the right). The TODO is for the else part (when a <= b). In that case, we should let Alice eat a candy from the left.\n\nAdditionally, note that whenever a == b, we update the answer (ans) to be the total number of candies eaten so far (which is l candies from the left and (n - h - 1) from the right, so total l + (n - h - 1)).\n\nHowever, the current code does not update the left side in the else block. We need to add the left candy and move the left pointer.\n\nAlso note: the condition for updating the answer is only when a == b. But we must update the answer at that point because we are trying to maximize the total number of candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total number of candies eaten is the sum of the candies eaten by Alice and Bob. And we are updating ans = l + (n - h - 1) when a==b.\n\nHowever, the current code does not cover the case when we are in the else block and after adding the left candy, a might become equal to b? So we should check after every addition.\n\nBut the code structure is: we have a while loop (l<=h). Inside, we check if a>b: then we do Bob's candy. Else: we do Alice's candy. Then we check if a==b? and update.\n\nBut note: after we do the else block, we have added a candy from the left, so we should check if a==b.\n\nBut the code already has the check after the if-else.\n\nHowever, there is a bug: the else block is incomplete.\n\nLet me complete the else block: we want to add the left candy to Alice and then move the left pointer.\n\nSo:\nelse:\n    a = a + l1[l]\n    l = l + 1\n\nBut wait: what if a==b? Then we update ans. But note that we are moving the pointers and updating a and b.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice has eaten (l) plus the number of candies Bob has eaten (n - h - 1). And when a==b, we record that total.\n\nHowever, we must note that the while loop continues even after we have found a valid partition? We want the maximum total candies. So we should continue because we might find a larger total? Actually, we are moving the pointers and the total candies we are going to eat is increasing? But note: we are only updating ans when a==b, and we are continuing until we have eaten all? Actually, we are not stopping until l>h.\n\nBut the problem is: we are updating ans every time we have a==b. And we want the maximum total candies. So we are capturing every time we have a balance and then we continue? But note: if we continue, we break the balance? So we are capturing every balanced state and then we continue to see if we can get a larger total? Actually, the total number of candies eaten at a balanced state is l + (n-h-1). And as we move the pointers, we are increasing the total? Actually, we are adding more candies, but we break the balance. Then we try to rebalance by having the other person eat.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that they stop when they are balanced. They can continue as long as at the end they are balanced. However, the problem is: they can choose any contiguous segments from the left and right? Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (contiguous) and Bob from the right (contiguous). But note: they are eating in turns? The problem does not specify turns. But the code is simulating a two-pointer method: we are building Alice's set from the left and Bob's from the right, and we are trying to balance the weights.\n\nBut note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and cannot skip, and Bob from the right and cannot skip. But they can choose how many to eat? However, the code is building the sets by alternating: if the current Alice's total is less than or equal to Bob's, then Alice eats one more. Otherwise, Bob eats one more.\n\nThis is a greedy method. And we record the total number of candies whenever the two totals are equal.\n\nBut we must note: we are allowed to skip some candies in the middle? Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (contiguous) meaning she must take a contiguous segment starting from the left. Similarly, Bob takes a contiguous segment from the right. And they cannot overlap. So the entire set of candies is partitioned into three: Alice's (left), some middle (uneaten), and Bob's (right). And we want the total weight of Alice's part to equal Bob's part, and we want to maximize the total number of candies (i.e., the sum of the lengths of Alice's and Bob's parts).\n\nThe two-pointer method is standard for this problem. We start with Alice having eaten nothing and Bob having eaten nothing. Then we add candies to the side that has the smaller total until we have no more candies or we cross. And we record the total candies whenever the two totals are equal.\n\nSo the code for program1.py should be:\n\nIn the else block:\n    a += l1[l]\n    l += 1\n\nBut note: what if we are in the else block and then we break the condition? Actually, the code then checks if a==b and updates.\n\nBut there is a problem: the condition for the else block is \"else\" meaning when a<=b. But note: initially a and b are 0, so we start by adding the leftmost candy to Alice.\n\nHowever, the provided code does not have the else block filled. So we fill it.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 200000, so the two-pointer is efficient.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We have a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We can swap any two characters any number of times. We want that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence. We are to find the minimum number of operations and one such sequence.\n\nThe provided code already has:\n    if n==1: \n        result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n\nFor n>=2, the code computes aux = n//2 if n is even, else n//2+1 (which is the ceiling of n/2). Then it outputs aux as the minimum number of operations.\n\nThen we need to output aux lines, each with two indices (i, j) to swap.\n\nThe note gives an example:\n  n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"ABN\"\n  n=2: swap indices 2 and 6 -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\nHow to generalize?\n\nWe note that the string is of length 3n. The positions are 1-indexed.\n\nThe idea: break every occurrence of \"BAN\" as a subsequence. Note that in the original string, we have n occurrences of \"BAN\". Each occurrence is at positions (3k-2, 3k-1, 3k) for k from 1 to n: \n  position 1: 'B', 2: 'A', 3: 'N'\n  position 4: 'B', 5: 'A', 6: 'N', etc.\n\nTo break the subsequence \"BAN\", we need to break the order of at least one of the letters in each occurrence. One efficient way is to swap the 'N' of one occurrence with the 'B' of another (or with the 'A' of another). However, the example for n=1 swaps the 'B' (index1) and the 'A' (index2) -> becomes \"ABN\", which breaks the subsequence because now the 'A' comes before the 'B', so we cannot form \"BAN\" (which requires B then A then N).\n\nFor n=2: we swap index2 (which is the 'A' of the first BAN) and index6 (which is the 'N' of the second BAN). Then the string becomes:\n  Original: B A N B A N\n  After swap: B (swapped with the last N) -> so the first two: B and then the last N becomes: B N ... and the last two: ... B A becomes ... A and the swapped A goes to the last? Actually, the swap is between index2 and index6.\n\n  So:\n      index1: 'B'\n      index2: originally 'A' becomes the character at index6 which is 'N'\n      index3: 'N'\n      index4: 'B'\n      index5: 'A'\n      index6: originally 'N' becomes the character at index2 which is 'A'\n\n  So the string is: B, N, N, B, A, A -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\nNow, how to break all the occurrences? We note that we have n occurrences. We can break two occurrences with one swap? Actually, in the example n=2, we broke two occurrences with one swap? Let's see:\n\n  The first occurrence: originally (B at1, A at2, N at3). Now we have (B at1, N at2, ...). Now the first occurrence: we have B at1 and then we have an N at2. Then we need an A after the B? But we have an N at2 and then later we have A's? Actually, we can form a subsequence: take B at1, then skip the N at2, then take the A at5 and then the N at3? But wait, the N at3 is before the A at5? So we cannot take the A at5 after the N at3? Actually, the subsequence must be in increasing index order. So we have: \n      B at index1, then we can take A at index5 and then N at index6? That forms BAN. So actually the example says that after the swap, the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence. How?\n\n  The note says: \"which does not contain 'BAN' as a subsequence\". So we must trust the example.\n\nBut let me check: \n  We have \"BNNBAA\". \n  We look for a subsequence: \n      B: we can take the first B at index1.\n      Then we need an A after index1: we have A's at indices 5 and 6.\n      Then we need an N after the A: but after index5 we have only A at index6? No N? So we cannot form the N after the A? \n  Alternatively, if we take the second B at index4, then we have an A at index5, but then we need an N after index5: we have no N after index5? The last two are A's.\n\n  So indeed, we cannot form \"BAN\".\n\nHow did one swap break two occurrences? \n  The first occurrence: we broke the A in the first BAN by moving it to the end (so the first occurrence now has B and then N, but then we don't have an A in between? Actually, we moved the A to the end, so the first occurrence is now B and then N (without an A in between) and then the A is at the end. Similarly, the second occurrence: we moved the N from the end of the second BAN to the second position, so the second occurrence now has B at4 and A at5, but then we have an A at6? But we don't have an N at the end? So the second occurrence is broken because we need an N after the A? But we have two A's at the end.\n\nSo the idea: we can break two BANs with one swap by swapping the second character (the 'A') of a BAN from the beginning with the third character (the 'N') of a BAN from the end.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n  We pair the first ceil(n/2) BANs with the last ceil(n/2) BANs? Actually, we only need n/2 swaps (if n is even) or (n+1)//2 swaps (if n is odd). \n\nSpecifically, we can do:\n  For i in range(0, aux):   # aux = ceil(n/2)\n      We take the i-th BAN (starting from 0) and the (n-1-i)-th BAN.\n\n  In the i-th BAN, the positions are:\n      B: 3*i + 1\n      A: 3*i + 2\n      N: 3*i + 3\n\n  In the (n-1-i)-th BAN, the positions are:\n      B: 3*(n-1-i) + 1 = 3*n - 3*i - 2\n      A: 3*n - 3*i - 1\n      N: 3*n - 3*i\n\n  We want to swap the 'A' of the i-th BAN with the 'N' of the (n-1-i)-th BAN.\n\n  So swap the character at position (3*i+2) with the character at position (3*n - 3*i).\n\nBut note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\nExample for n=2:\n  i=0: \n      swap (3*0+2 = 2) and (3*2 - 3*0 = 6) -> matches.\n\nExample for n=1:\n  i=0: \n      swap (3*0+2=2) and (3*1 - 3*0 = 3) -> so swap index2 and index3? \n      But the example swapped index1 and index2? \n\nWait, the example for n=1: \n  They swapped index1 and index2. \n\nBut our plan for n=1: we would swap index2 (the 'A') and index3 (the 'N') -> then the string becomes: \n  Original: B A N\n  After swap: B N A -> which is \"BNA\". \n  Now, is \"BAN\" a subsequence? \n      We can take B at1, then we skip N at2, then take A at3? But we need an N after the A? There is no N after the A. So it breaks? \n  But the example did swap index1 and index2: \n      becomes A B N -> \"ABN\". \n      Then we cannot form BAN because the B is after the A.\n\nSo which is better? Both break the subsequence. But the problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any. \n\nHowever, the example output for n=1 was \"1\\n1 2\". \n\nBut our plan for n=1 would output: \n  1\n  2 3\n\nBut the problem does not require the minimal operations? We are already outputting the minimal number of operations (which is 1). And the problem says \"output any\".\n\nBut the problem statement for n=1 says: we can swap indices 1 and 2. So we must be consistent with the example? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"In the first testcase, s(1) = \"BAN\", we can swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2, converting s(1) to \"ABN\"\". So the example solution is swapping 1 and 2.\n\nWe can adjust: instead of swapping the A and the N of the same BAN, we swap the B and the A? \n\nBut then we break the first BAN? \n\nAlternatively, we can do: \n  For the first half (ceil(n/2)) we swap the 'B' of the i-th BAN with the 'N' of the (n-1-i)-th BAN? \n\nBut for n=1: \n  i=0: swap the B at 3*0+1 = 1 and the N at 3*1 = 3 -> becomes: N A B -> \"NAB\". Then we don't have BAN? \n\nBut the problem does not require a particular swap, so we can choose.\n\nHowever, the example for n=2 swapped the A of the first and the N of the last. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"In the second testcase, s(2) = \"BANBAN\", we can swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6\". \n\nSo we can do: \n  For i in range(aux):\n      swap the A in the i-th BAN (at index = 3*i+2) with the N in the (n-1-i)-th BAN (at index = 3*(n-1-i)+3 = 3*n - 3*i - 3 + 3 = 3*n - 3*i) -> wait, the (n-1-i)-th BAN: \n          The starting index of that BAN is 3*(n-1-i) (if we consider 0-indexed block index). Then the N is at 3*(n-1-i) + 3? But that is 3*(n-1-i+1) = 3*(n-i) -> but that is beyond the string? \n\nActually, the positions for the k-th BAN (0-indexed) are:\n  B: 3*k + 1\n  A: 3*k + 2\n  N: 3*k + 3\n\nSo for the (n-1-i)-th BAN (which is the (n-1-i)-th block, 0-indexed), the N is at 3*(n-1-i) + 3 = 3*(n-i) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-i).\n\nBut note: the total length is 3n, so the last character is at 3n. So 3*(n-i) is within the string.\n\nSo for the i-th swap (0-indexed), we swap:\n   index1 = 3*i+2   (the A in the i-th BAN)\n   index2 = 3*(n-i)   (the N in the (n-1-i)-th BAN? Actually, the (n-1-i)-th BAN is the same as the (n-i-1)-th, and the N is at 3*(n-i-1)+3 = 3*(n-i). \n\nBut note: when i=0, we swap 3*0+2 = 2 and 3*(n-0) = 3n. \n  For n=2: 3n=6 -> so swap 2 and 6 -> matches.\n\nBut for n=1: \n  i=0: swap 2 and 3*1 = 3 -> so swap index2 and index3.\n\nBut the example for n=1 swapped index1 and index2. \n\nSo we have two possibilities. The problem says \"if there are multiple, output any\". \n\nHowever, the provided example for n=1 in the code is:\n   result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n\nSo we must output that for n=1? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to complete the code. The code already handles n==1 separately. So for n>=2, we are in the for loop. \n\nSo for the for loop (which runs for aux times, and aux = ceil(n/2)), we do:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        # we output the two indices: \n        #   first index = 3*i+2   (the A in the i-th BAN)\n        #   second index = 3*(n-i)   (the N in the (n-i)-th ...? Actually, note: the last block is the (n-1)-th, so the block at position n-1-i is the one that is i-th from the end? Then the N in that block is at 3*(n-1-i)+3 = 3*(n-i) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-i). \n\nBut wait: the last block (n-1) has N at 3*(n-1)+3 = 3n. Then the block n-2 has N at 3n-3, etc.\n\nSo for the i-th swap (0-indexed), we swap the A in the i-th block (at 3*i+2) and the N in the (n-1-i)-th block (at 3*(n-1-i)+3 = 3*(n-i)).\n\nBut note: when i = n-1-i, that is when we are swapping the same block? Only when n is odd and i = (n-1)/2? Then we are swapping the middle block? But that is okay.\n\nBut for n=3: \n   aux = ceil(3/2)=2.\n   i=0: swap (3*0+2=2) and (3*(3-0)=9) -> swap index2 and index9.\n   i=1: swap (3*1+2=5) and (3*(3-1)=6) -> swap index5 and index6.\n\nBut wait, the blocks for n=3:\n   Block0: positions 1,2,3 -> B, A, N\n   Block1: positions 4,5,6 -> B, A, N\n   Block2: positions 7,8,9 -> B, A, N\n\nAfter swap0: \n   swap index2 (which is the A in block0) and index9 (which is the N in block2) -> \n        block0: [1: 'B', 2: becomes the original N from block2, 3: 'N' (from block0)] -> but wait, we swapped index2 and index9, so:\n            index2 becomes the N from block2 (which is the last character) and index9 becomes the A from block0.\n        So the string becomes: \n            index1: B\n            index2: N (from the last block)\n            index3: N (from block0) -> but wait, the N from block0 was at index3? Then we swap index2 and index9: \n                So the A at index2 goes to index9, and the N at index9 goes to index2.\n            Then block0: [B, N, ...] but the ... at index3 is still the original N? \n            Actually, the entire string becomes:\n                index1: B\n                index2: N (from the last block's N)\n                index3: N (from block0) -> but wait, the block0's N was at index3? Then we didn't move it? \n            Then block1: unchanged? \n            Then block2: \n                index7: B\n                index8: A\n                index9: A (from block0's A)\n\n        So the string: B, N, N, B, A, N, B, A, A -> \"BNN BAN BAA\"\n\n        Now, is there a subsequence \"BAN\"? \n          We can take the first B (index1), then skip the next two N's, then take the A at index5, then the N at index6? -> that forms BAN.\n\n        So we broke the first block and the last block, but the middle block is still intact? \n\n        Then we do the next swap: i=1: swap index5 (which is the A in block1) and index6 (which is the N in block1) -> wait, we are swapping within the same block? \n            Then block1: becomes B, N, A -> so \"BNA\", which is not BAN? \n\n        Then the entire string: \n            block0: B, N, N -> becomes at indices1,2,3: B, N, N -> but the original N at index3 is still there? Actually, we swapped index2 and index9, so the original N at index3 remains? \n            block1: becomes B, N, A (because we swapped the A at index5 and the N at index6) -> so at indices4,5,6: B, N, A -> \"BNA\"\n            block2: becomes ... at indices7,8,9: B, A, A -> and we moved the A from block0 to index9? \n\n        Now, can we form BAN? \n          We can take the first B (index1), then we can take the A at index8 (in block2) and then the N at index3? -> but the N at index3 is before the A at index8? So we cannot use that. \n          Alternatively, take the B at index1, then the A at index5? But index5 is now N (because we swapped the A at index5 with the N at index6, so index5 becomes N). \n          Then take the A at index8? Then we need an N after index8? There is no N after index8? \n\n        So it breaks.\n\nBut the problem says we break the subsequence. \n\nAlternatively, we can swap the A in the i-th block with the N in the (n-1-i)-th block? But note: the (n-1-i)-th block is the same as the (n-i-1)-th. \n\nBut in the example for n=2, we swapped the A in the first block (i=0) with the N in the last block (which is the (n-1-0)=1st block? but the last block is the 1st from the end? which is the same as the 1st block? Actually, for n=2, the blocks are 0 and 1. Then we swap the A in block0 with the N in block1 (which is the last block). \n\nSo for n=3, we want to swap:\n   i=0: swap the A in block0 (index2) with the N in block2 (index9) -> as above.\n   i=1: swap the A in block1 (index5) with the N in block1? -> but wait, the last block for the second swap? We are pairing block0 with block2, and then block1 with ...? There is no block left? \n\nBut our aux is ceil(n/2)=2. So we do two swaps. And we break two blocks? But we have three blocks. How do we break the middle block? \n\nWe swapped the A in block1 with the N in block1? That breaks the middle block? Because then the middle block becomes B, N, A -> which is not BAN.\n\nBut note: we are swapping the A in the i-th block with the N in the (n-1-i)-th block. For i=1, the partner is (n-1-1)=3-1-1=1 -> so the same block? Then we swap the A and the N in the same block? Then the block becomes B, N, A -> which is not BAN.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut the problem: the example for n=1 we did not use the same method? Because the code already handled n=1 separately.\n\nSo for the for loop in program2.py (which runs for aux times, and aux = ceil(n/2)), we do:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        # we output: str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: for n=1, we don't enter the for loop because aux = (1+1)//2 = 1? But the code already handled n=1 above. So the for loop is for n>=2? Actually, the code does:\n\n   if n==1: \n        result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n        continue\n\n   Then for n>=2, we compute aux = ... and then the for loop.\n\nBut for n=1, we don't go into the for loop. For n=2, aux=1, so we do one swap: i=0: 3*0+2=2, 3*(2-0)=6 -> \"2 6\"\n\nFor n=3: aux=2, so we do two swaps: \n   i=0: 2 and 9\n   i=1: 5 and 6\n\nBut wait, for n=3, 3*(n-i) for i=1: 3*(3-1)=6 -> so 5 and 6.\n\nBut note: the problem says the indices must be distinct and in the range [1, 3n]. \n\nSo we output:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the example for n=1 was handled separately, so we don't use the for loop for n=1.\n\nBut what about n=4? \n   aux = 4//2 = 2.\n   swaps:\n        i=0: swap index2 and index3*4=12\n        i=1: swap index5 and index3*(4-1)=9\n\nThen the string: \n   Original: BANBANBANBAN\n   After swap0: \n        swap index2 (A of first BAN) and index12 (N of last BAN) -> \n            first block: B, (now the N from last block), N (from first block) -> but wait, the first block's N is at index3? \n            last block: B, A, (now the A from first block) -> so last block: B, A, A\n   After swap1:\n        swap index5 (A of second block) and index9 (N of the third block) -> \n            second block: B, (now the N from third block), ... -> but the second block's N was at index6? \n            third block: B, A, (now the A from second block) -> so third block: B, A, A\n\n   Then the string: \n        block0: [B, N (from last), N (from block0)] -> B, N, N\n        block1: [B, N (from block2), ...] -> but we swapped index5 (which is the A in block1) with the N at index9 (which is the N in block2). So:\n            block1: at index4: B, index5: becomes the N from block2, index6: the original N from block1? \n            block2: at index7: B, index8: A, index9: becomes the A from block1.\n\n        So: \n            indices1-3: B, N, N\n            indices4-6: B, N, N   (because the original N at index6 remains? and we swapped the A at index5 with the N at index9, so the N at index9 goes to index5, and the A at index5 goes to index9)\n            indices7-9: B, A, A\n            indices10-12: B, A, A   (because the last block: we swapped the N at index12 with the A at index2, so the last block: index10: B, index11: A, index12: A)\n\n        Now, can we form BAN? \n          We can take a B from block0 (index1), then skip the next two N's, then take an A from block1? but block1 has no A? It has B, N, N. Then we can take an A from block2 (index8) and then an N? But we don't have an N after index8? \n\n        So it breaks.\n\nTherefore, the plan for program2.py is:\n\n   For each test case:\n        if n==1: \n            output \"1\\n1 2\"\n        else:\n            aux = ceil(n/2)  [but note: the code already computes aux = n//2 if n even, else n//2+1]\n            output str(aux)\n            for i in range(aux):\n                output str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i))\n\nBut note: the indices we output must be 1-indexed and the formula for the second index is 3*(n-i). \n\nBut wait: for the last block, the N is at 3*(n-1)+3 = 3n? So 3*(n-i) = 3n - 3*i? Actually, no: \n   We are using 3*(n-i) -> for i=0: 3n, for i=1: 3n-3, etc.\n\nBut the last block's N is at 3n? Then the block that is k-th from the start has N at 3k+3? and the block that is k-th from the end (if we count the last block as the 0-th from the end? no) we are using the block index: the block at position j (0-indexed) has N at 3j+3. And j = n-1-i? Then the N is at 3*(n-1-i)+3 = 3n - 3i - 3 + 3 = 3n-3i? \n\nBut we are using 3*(n-i) = 3n - 3i? \n\nSo they are the same? \n\nTherefore, we can use 3*(n-i) for the N in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n\nBut note: the block index for the partner is (n-1-i). The N is at 3*(n-1-i)+3 = 3n-3i. \n\nSo we can use 3n-3i? \n\nBut the code uses: 3*(n-i) = 3n-3i? \n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for the for loop in program2.py:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the example for n=1 is handled separately, so we don't use this for n=1.\n\nBut what about n=1? We already handled it.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code for both programs.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the else block.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the for loop body.\n\nBut note: the program2.py code already has the for loop:\n\n   for i in range(aux):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we complete the TODO.\n\nTherefore, the missing code:\n\nprogram1.py: \n   else block: \n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\nprogram2.py: \n   in the for loop: \n        result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the program2.py code already has the result string, and we are appending.\n\nBut wait: the program2.py code after the for loop does: \n   print(result[:-1])\n\nWhy [:-1]? Because the last character is a newline? But we are appending a newline for each swap. And the last swap also appends a newline. Then we remove the last character? \n\nBut the example for n=1: \n   result = \"1\\n1 2\\n\" -> then we print result[:-1] -> \"1\\n1 2\" -> which is two lines: \n        1\n        1 2\n\nBut for n=2: \n   result = \"2\\n\"   (from the line: result += str(aux) + \"\\n\")\n   then for i in range(aux): \n        result += \"2 6\\n\"\n   so result = \"2\\n2 6\\n\"\n   then we print result[:-1] -> \"2\\n2 6\" -> which is two lines: \n        2\n        2 6\n\nBut the problem requires: \n   First line: m (the number of operations)\n   Then m lines of two integers.\n\nSo the last line should not have an extra newline? But the example output for n=1 is \"1\\n1 2\", which is two lines. And the problem does not require a trailing newline? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in JSON.\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l + 1\", \"program2\": \"        result += str(3*i+2) + \\\" \\\" + str(3*(n-i)) + \\\"\\\\n\\\"\"}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has the else block and then the condition \"if(a==b): ...\" is after the if-else. So the else block must be exactly as above.\n\nBut the program1.py code has:\n\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with two lines.\n\nBut note: the indentation: the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The else block is at the same level as the if block. The two lines inside the else should be indented one more level.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is two lines, each indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nBut the existing code uses 4-space indentation. So the two lines should be indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while) or 4 spaces relative to the else? \n\nIn the provided code, the if block inside the while has two lines (with 4 extra spaces). Similarly, the else block should have two lines with 4 extra spaces.\n\nBut the TODO is at the same level as the if block? Actually, the TODO is a comment. We replace the comment with two lines that are indented one more level.\n\nSo the two lines for the else block should be indented by 8 spaces (from the outer while) or 4 spaces from the else? \n\nIn Python, we use consistent indentation. The existing code:\n\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n\nSo the body of the if is indented by 4 spaces. Similarly, the body of the else should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the two lines for the else block should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the else.\n\nBut the else is at the same level as the if. So the entire block:\n\n        else:\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nBut note: the existing code after the else has a comment that is at the same level as the if body? Actually, the comment is at the same level as the if body? Then we replace the comment with two lines at the same level.\n\nSo the two lines should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the while? \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nBut the existing code has 4 spaces for the while, then 4 more for the if/else, then 4 more for the body? Actually, the while is at 4 spaces (because the for loop is at 0, then the while is at 4). Then the if and else are at 8, and the bodies at 12? \n\nBut the provided code:\n\nfor t in range(int(input())):   # 0\n    n=int(input())              # 4\n    l1=list(map(int,input().split()))   #4\n    l=0                         #4\n    h=n-1                       #4\n    ans=0                       #4\n    a=0                         #4\n    b=0                         #4\n    while(l<=h):                #4\n        if(a>b):                #8\n            b=b+l1[h]           #12\n            h=h-1               #12\n        else:                   #8\n            # TODO: Your code here   #12? but it's a comment\n\nSo the two lines we add should be at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the output we are to provide is the two lines of code without the surrounding context.\n\nSo we output:\n\n   \"program1\": \"            a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the for loop body is:\n\n        for i in range(aux):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n            result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the existing code has the for loop at 4 spaces (because the while t: is at 0, then the for loop is at 4). The body of the for loop should be at 8. But the TODO is a comment at 8? Then we replace with a line at 8.\n\nBut the code we write is:\n\n            result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut note: the variable 'result' is already defined.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        result += str(3*i+2) + \" \" + str(3*(n-i)) + \"\\n\"\n\nBut the existing code has 4 spaces for the for loop, so the body should be 8 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        result += str(3*i+2) + \\\" \\\" + str(3*(n-i)) + \\\"\\\\n\\\"\"\n}\n\nBut note: we must escape the quotes and backslashes? The problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. And we are to output in JSON.\n\nSo we use double quotes and escape the inner double quotes and backslashes.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the string with escaped double quotes.\n\nBut the example: \n   program1: two lines: \n        line1: \"            a = a + l1[l]\"\n        line2: \"            l = l + 1\"\n\n   program2: one line: \"        result += str(3*i+2) + \\\" \\\" + str(3*(n-i)) + \\\"\\\\n\\\"\"\n\nBut note: the program2 line has a newline at the end? Yes, we are appending a newline.\n\nBut the program2.py code then does: print(result[:-1]) to remove the last newline? So we are including the newline in the appended string.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
