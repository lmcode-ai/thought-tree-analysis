And then hope that the initial {1,2} is corrected by the TODO for the ones that appear in the loop, and for the ones that don't, we have to fix them in a way that is not in the TODO. But the problem: a=1 might not be valid for some test case? Let's take w=3, l=4: \n          a=1: \n             condition (i): 3%1=0, (4-2)=2%1=0 -> valid. a=2: we saw it is not valid. So we want solutions = {1, ... }. In the given code: \n          solutions = {1,2} initially. half_perimeter = 3+4-2=5. Then the loop: i from 2 to floor(sqrt(5))=2.\n              i=2: 5%2=1 -> skip. Then we output solutions = {1,2} -> but a=2 is not valid. Therefore, we must remove a=2. How to do it in the TODO? We cannot. So we must change the given structure.",

But the problem: the given code has a variable 'half_perimeter' and a loop that uses it. We are changing the loop. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block that replaces from the line 'half_perimeter = ...' to the end of the for loop. Specifically, we replace:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) if mod_i ! = 0:\n              continue\n          for a in [i, div]:\n              mod_a = w % a\n              if mod_a <= 2:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  with:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1): if total % i == 0:\n              for a in [i, total//i]:\n                  if a in solutions:\n                      continue\n                  if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                      solutions.add(a) But note: the code after this (res.append) remains the same. However, the given code has a line after the for loop: \n        res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\") So we are not changing that. But the above for loop might be the completion. But wait, the range floor(sqrt(total)) might be expensive to compute for each test case? We can compute it once:\n\n      sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total)) But floor and sqrt are available. We can do:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set(",

Then we build row1n and row2n and compare. But the TODO is only for when k is 'G'. We can do:\n\n          if k == \"G\":\n              k = \"B\"\n\n      And then later, if j is 'G', then j=\"B\". But note: after we convert k to 'B', then we are appending the converted k.\n\n      However, what if k is 'G' and then later we do nothing to j? \n\n      Example: \n          row1 = \"G\", row2 = \"B\"\n          Then we convert k='G' to 'B', and then j='B' remains 'B'. Then row1n = ['B'], row2n = ['B'] -> same. But what if row1 = \"B\", row2 = \"G\": \n          k='B' -> not changed. then j='G' -> changed to 'B'. then row1n = ['B'], row2n = ['B'] -> same. This should work. But the given code has:\n\n          if k == \"G\":\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          if j == \"G\":\n              j = \"B\"\n\n      We can do in the TODO: k = \"B\"\n\n      But note: we must do the same for both. However, the code already has a conversion for j.\n\n      So the TODO is simply: k = \"B\" But then we have:\n\n          for k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n              if k == \"G\":\n                  k = \"B\"\n              if j == \"G\":\n                  j = \"B\"\n              row1n.append(k)\n              row2n.append(j)\n\n      This will convert every 'G' to 'B' in both rows. Then we compare the two lists. This should work. Example from the note: \n          first test case: n=1, row1=\"G\", row2=\"B\" -> becomes \"B\" and \"B\" -> YES.\n          second test case: n=4, row1=\"GRBG\", row2=\"GBGB\"\n              row1: G->B, R->R, B->B, G->B -> \"BRBB\"\n              row2: G->B, B->B, G->B, B->B -> \"BBBB\" -> not equal -> NO? But the note says the first test case is YES, the second is NO.",

That is correct. However, the given code also has:\n\n      if j == \"G\":\n          j = \"B\"\n\n  So we do the same for j.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: k = \"B\"\n\n  But note: the given code has: if k == \"G\":\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      if j == \"G\":\n          j = \"B\"\n\n  We fill the TODO with: k = \"B\"\n\n  However, what if there is an 'R'?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about tiling a bathroom floor. We are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given two integers w and l (the dimensions). We need to find the number of valid values of a (and list them in increasing order) such that:\n- The interior (w-2)*(l-2) is tiled with 1x1 tiles.\n- The boundary is tiled with 1xa tiles (which can be rotated, so they can be placed as ax1 as well).\n\nThe boundary consists of the perimeter minus the corners? Actually, note that the entire boundary is covered by 1xa tiles. However, the problem states that the interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles, so the boundary is the entire floor minus that interior. The boundary has area: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nBut note: the boundary is made of four edges. However, the corners are shared by two edges. So the total boundary area is: 2*(w-2) + 2*(l-2) + 4 corners? Actually, the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The entire area is w*l. So the boundary area is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4.\n\nWe have to cover this boundary with 1xa tiles. Since the tiles can be rotated, we can use them as 1xa or a x 1. However, note that the boundary is a loop. The key is that the entire boundary must be divisible by a? But also, we must be able to cover the four corners? Actually, the problem is more about the arrangement.\n\nAfter reading the note: the first test case (3x5) has solutions a=1,2,3.\n\nHow does the tiling work?\n- The interior is (3-2)*(5-2)=1*3=3, so 3 1x1 tiles.\n- The boundary: total area = 3*5 - 3 = 12. So we need 12 tiles of 1xa? But note: the boundary is covered by 1xa tiles. However, the boundary is not a single connected strip? Actually, it is a loop.\n\nBut note: the boundary is broken into four segments: top, bottom, left, right. The top and bottom are of length w (each) and the left and right are of length l-2 (each) because the corners are shared? Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2). However, wait: the perimeter (in terms of edges) is 2*(w+l). But we are tiling by area. The boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4.\n\nBut note: the tiles are 1xa, so they cover a units of area. Therefore, the boundary area must be divisible by a: 2*(w+l)-4 must be divisible by a.\n\nHowever, that is not the only condition. We also have to be able to arrange the tiles along the boundary without breaking the corners. The problem is that at the corners, the tile might have to be broken? Actually, the problem says the tiles can be rotated. But note that the boundary has straight sides. The top and bottom sides are of length w, and the left and right sides are of length l. However, the corners are shared. So we have:\n- The top side: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> length w\n- The bottom side: from (0,l) to (w,l) -> length w\n- The left side: from (0,1) to (0, l-1) -> length l-2\n- The right side: from (w,1) to (w, l-1) -> length l-2\n\nBut wait, the corners are (0,0), (w,0), (0,l), (w,l). So the entire boundary is broken into four segments: two of length w and two of length l? Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l) but that counts the corners twice? Actually, the perimeter (in terms of edges) is 2*(w+l). However, we are tiling by area. The boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4? Actually, the area of the boundary is:\n  total area = w*l\n  interior area = (w-2)*(l-2) = w*l - 2*w - 2*l + 4\n  boundary area = 2*w + 2*l - 4.\n\nSo the condition is: a must divide (2*w+2*l-4). But that is necessary. However, is it sufficient? And why are there only three solutions for (3,5)? \n\nFor (3,5): boundary area = 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12. The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the example says only 1,2,3 are valid.\n\nWhy is 4,6,12 not valid? Because of the arrangement. Specifically, the tiles must fit along the sides without breaking in a way that doesn't fit the corners.\n\nConsider the top side: length w=3. We have to cover it with 1xa tiles. The tile can be placed horizontally (covering a consecutive segment of length a) or vertically? But if placed vertically, it would stick out? Actually, the boundary is only one cell wide? Actually, the boundary is the outer ring. The tiles are 1xa, meaning they are 1 unit in one dimension and a in the other. So for the top side (which is 1 unit in the vertical direction and w in the horizontal), we can only use horizontal placements? Actually, we can rotate the tile: so we can use it as 1xa (horizontal) or a x 1 (vertical). But if we use a vertical tile on the top row, it would cover multiple rows? That is not allowed because the top row is only one row. Therefore, on the top and bottom rows, we must use the tile horizontally. Similarly, on the left and right sides (which are one column wide) we must use the tile vertically? Actually, we can use the tile horizontally on the sides? That would cover multiple columns? That doesn't fit because the side is one column. Therefore, we must use:\n- On the top and bottom: horizontal tiles (so 1xa, placed horizontally) -> so a must divide the length of the top and bottom? But the top and bottom are of length w. However, note that the top row has two corners. The corners are shared with the left and right sides. So the top row is broken into two parts: from (0,0) to (w,0) but the corners are (0,0) and (w,0). The left corner (0,0) is shared with the left side, and the right corner (w,0) is shared with the right side. Therefore, the top row actually has two segments: from (1,0) to (w-1,0) of length w-2? And then the corners? But wait, the corner is a single cell. How do we cover the corner? The problem does not specify that a tile must be entirely in one segment. Actually, a tile can cover multiple segments? That would be messy.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire boundary as a cycle. The cycle has four straight segments. The tiles can be placed arbitrarily as long as they cover consecutive cells and do not overlap. However, the problem is that the tile of length a must be placed entirely in one straight segment? Or can it wrap around a corner? The problem does not specify, but the example pictures might clarify.\n\nLooking at the example pictures for (3,5) and a=3: \n  The top row: from (0,0) to (3,0). We have a tile of length 3: it can cover the entire top row? But then the corners: (0,0) and (3,0) are covered. Then the left and right sides: each of length 5-2=3. So we can use one tile of length 3 for the left side and one for the right side? And the bottom row: similarly, one tile of length 3? But wait, the bottom row is from (0,5) to (3,5). However, the corners (0,5) and (3,5) are already covered by the left and right side tiles? Actually, the bottom row would then be covered by a tile from (1,5) to (2,5) only? That leaves (0,5) and (3,5) uncovered? \n\nAlternatively, the boundary might be covered by a single tile that wraps? But the problem says the tiles are 1xa, so they are straight. They cannot bend.\n\nTherefore, we must cover each straight segment independently. The four segments are:\n  top: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> but actually the cells: (0,0), (1,0), ... (w-1,0) -> w cells? Actually, the grid is from 0 to w-1? The problem says the bathroom has width w centimeters, so the grid has w cells? Actually, the problem says: \"If Bethany simply used the basic tiles of size 1x1, she would use w*l of them.\" So the grid is w by l, meaning w cells in the horizontal and l in the vertical? Then the top row has w cells: (0,0) to (w-1,0). Similarly, the bottom row: (0,l-1) to (w-1,l-1). The left column: (0,1) to (0,l-2) -> l-2 cells? The right column: (w-1,1) to (w-1,l-2) -> l-2 cells.\n\nBut then the corners: (0,0), (w-1,0), (0,l-1), (w-1,l-1) are not covered by the sides? Actually, the sides are defined as the interior of the boundary? The problem says: \"On the floor boundary\" meaning the entire outer ring. So the four corners are part of the boundary.\n\nTherefore, the four segments are:\n  top: w cells\n  bottom: w cells\n  left: l-2 cells (from row 1 to row l-2)\n  right: l-2 cells (from row 1 to row l-2)\n\nBut wait, that leaves the corners? Actually, the top and bottom rows include the corners. So the entire boundary is:\n  top: w cells\n  bottom: w cells\n  left: l-2 cells (the middle part of the left column, excluding the top and bottom corners)\n  right: l-2 cells.\n\nBut then the total boundary area is: w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4. That matches.\n\nNow, we have to cover each segment independently? But note that the problem does not require that. The tiles can be placed arbitrarily as long as they are on the boundary and consecutive. However, a tile that is placed horizontally on the top row cannot extend to the left row? Because that would require a bend. So we must cover each straight segment independently.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that a must divide the length of each segment? But note: the tile can be placed vertically on the top row? That would cover multiple rows? That is not possible because the top row is only one row. Similarly, the tile must be placed horizontally on the top and bottom, and vertically on the left and right? Actually, we can rotate the tile arbitrarily, but the tile is 1xa: meaning it is 1 unit in one direction and a in the other. So if we place it horizontally on the top row, it covers a consecutive segment of a cells in the top row. If we place it vertically, it would cover a consecutive segment of a cells in the vertical direction. But the top row is only one row, so a vertical tile would cover a cells in the vertical direction? That would extend into the row below? That is the interior? That is not allowed because the interior is for 1x1 tiles. Therefore, on the top and bottom rows, we must use the tile horizontally. On the left and right sides, we must use the tile vertically.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n1. a must divide the top row: so a divides w? But wait, the top row has w cells. However, we have two corners. The corners are shared with the sides. How do we cover the corners? The corner cells are shared between two segments. Actually, the corner cell (0,0) is the start of the top row and the start of the left column. But we are covering the top row and the left column independently. The top row tile must cover (0,0) and then the next a-1 cells? Then the left column tile must start at (0,1)? Then (0,0) is covered by the top row tile. Similarly, the left column tile covers (0,1) to (0, l-2). Then the bottom row tile covers (0,l-1) to (w-1,l-1). But then (0,l-1) is covered by the bottom row tile? And the left column tile does not cover (0,l-1). So the corner (0,l-1) is only covered by the bottom row tile? That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the tile on the top row must cover the entire top row? Not necessarily: we can use multiple tiles. The condition is that the entire top row must be covered by horizontal tiles. Therefore, the top row must be partitioned into consecutive segments of length a (or multiples? but each tile is 1xa). Similarly, the bottom row must be partitioned into consecutive segments of length a. The left and right columns must be partitioned into consecutive segments of length a (but now in the vertical direction).\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n  a must divide w (for the top and bottom rows) because the top row is w cells and we are covering it with horizontal tiles of length a? But wait: we can use multiple tiles. So the condition is that w must be divisible by a? Similarly, the bottom row is also w, so same condition. The left and right columns are l-2 cells? So a must divide l-2? \n\nBut wait: what if a=1? Then it divides everything. What about a=2 for (3,5): \n  top row: 3 cells -> 3 mod 2 = 1 -> not divisible? \nBut the example says a=2 is valid.\n\nSo what is the catch? The problem does not require that each segment is covered independently? The tile can wrap around the corner? Actually, the problem says the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees, but it doesn't say they can wrap around the corner. However, the example picture for a=2 in the note must show how.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the entire boundary is a cycle. The boundary has 2*(w+l)-4 cells. And we are going to cover it with tiles that cover a consecutive segment of a cells? But the tiles are straight: they cannot bend. However, the boundary is a cycle. So we can cover the boundary by going around? But the tile is 1xa: meaning it is a straight tile. So if we use it horizontally or vertically, it must be placed entirely in one straight segment? Or can it be placed across a corner? That would require the tile to be bent? The problem does not allow bending.\n\nTherefore, we must cover each straight segment independently. Then why is a=2 valid for (3,5)? \n\nFor the top row: 3 cells. We cannot cover 3 cells with tiles of length 2? We would have one cell left. Similarly, the bottom row: 3 cells -> same problem. The sides: 5-2=3 cells -> same problem.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire segment is covered by one tile. We can use multiple tiles. However, the tile of length 2: we can use it to cover two consecutive cells. Then the top row: 3 cells -> we can cover two cells with one tile and then one cell with another tile? But that one cell is a segment of length 1, and the tile is 1x2: we cannot break the tile? The tile must be used as a whole. So we cannot use a 1x2 tile to cover one cell? Therefore, the entire segment must be partitioned into segments of length exactly a? \n\nBut wait: the tile is 1xa. When placed horizontally, it covers a consecutive segment of a cells. So the top row must be partitioned into contiguous segments of length a. Therefore, the entire length of the top row must be divisible by a. Similarly for the bottom row and the sides.\n\nBut then for (3,5): \n  top row: 3 -> must be divisible by a -> a must be 1 or 3.\n  bottom row: 3 -> same.\n  left side: 3 -> same.\n  right side: 3 -> same.\n\nSo only a=1 and a=3? But the example says a=2 is also valid.\n\nTherefore, the above independent segment covering is not the whole story.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe entire boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4. This must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l)-4. But that is necessary. However, it is not sufficient? Because we also have to be able to arrange the tiles along the boundary without breaking the constraints of the straight segments.\n\nWe can model the boundary as a cycle of length 2*(w+l)-4. The cycle has four straight segments: \n  segment1: top row: w cells\n  segment2: right column: l-2 cells\n  segment3: bottom row: w cells (but traversed from right to left)\n  segment4: left column: l-2 cells (but traversed from bottom to top)\n\nBut note: the cycle is connected. The tile can start anywhere and wrap around? However, the tile is straight: it must be placed entirely in one straight segment? Or can it cross a corner? \n\nIf the tile is placed entirely in one straight segment, then the condition is that the length of each segment must be divisible by a. But we saw that for (3,5): the segments are 3, 3, 3, 3. Then a must divide 3? Then a=1,3. But the example has a=2.\n\nTherefore, the tile can cross a corner? Actually, the problem does not explicitly forbid it. But the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. If we place it at a corner, it would have to cover two segments? That would require the tile to be bent? The problem says the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees, but that doesn't mean they can be bent.\n\nHowever, note the example picture for a=2 in the problem. We must deduce from that.\n\nAfter reading the note: the first test case (3x5) has three tilings for a=1,2,3. The picture for a=2: \n  The top row: we can cover the first two cells (0,0) and (1,0) with one tile? Then the next cell (2,0) is left. Then we cover the right side: from (2,0) to (2,1) with a vertical tile? But that would be two cells: (2,0) and (2,1). Then the top row is covered? Then the right side: we have from (2,1) to (2,4) -> 3 cells? Then we cover (2,1) and (2,2) with one tile, and (2,3) and (2,4) with another? But then the bottom row: from (2,4) to (0,4): we cover (2,4) and (1,4) with one tile? Then (0,4) is left. Then the left side: from (0,4) to (0,0): we cover (0,4) and (0,3) with one tile, then (0,2) and (0,1) with one tile, and then (0,0) is already covered? \n\nBut wait, (0,0) was covered by the top row tile? Then we have a gap at (0,0) for the left side? Actually, we started the top row at (0,0) and (1,0). Then the right side started at (2,0) and (2,1). Then the bottom row: (2,4) and (1,4). Then the left side: (0,4) and (0,3); then (0,2) and (0,1). Then (0,0) is covered by the top row, and (0,1) is covered by the left side? But (0,0) is covered by the top row and (0,1) by the left side? That leaves (1,0) and (1,4) and (1, something) uncovered? \n\nAlternatively, the tile can be placed in a way that covers two segments? Actually, the problem does not specify that the tile must be entirely in one row or column. It just says \"on the boundary\". The boundary is the outer ring. The tile is 1xa: it can be placed horizontally or vertically. But if we place a tile vertically at the corner, it would cover the corner and then extend downward? That would be one cell in the top row and a-1 cells in the left column? That is allowed? The problem does not say the tile must be entirely in one row or column. It only says the tile is 1xa and can be rotated. So if we rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes ax1. But then it is still a straight tile. So if we place it at the corner, it would cover one cell in the top row and a-1 cells in the left column? That is a straight vertical tile? But then the top row cell (0,0) is covered by a vertical tile? That is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is more flexible. The entire boundary is a cycle. We can break the cycle arbitrarily. The tile can be placed along the cycle in a straight line? But the tile is straight: it covers a consecutive segment of a cells along the cycle. However, the cycle has corners: the direction changes. But the tile is straight: it cannot change direction. Therefore, the tile must be placed entirely in one straight segment? Or can it be placed across a corner? \n\nIf we place a tile across a corner, then it would cover two adjacent segments? For example, at the top-left corner: we place a vertical tile that covers the top row cell (0,0) and then the next a-1 cells going down the left column. But then the tile is vertical: it covers (0,0) and (0,1), (0,2), ... (0,a-1). This is a straight vertical segment. So it is allowed. Similarly, we can have a horizontal tile that starts at the last cell of the left column and then goes to the bottom row? \n\nTherefore, the entire boundary is a cycle of length L = 2*(w+l)-4. We can cover it with tiles that cover consecutive a cells along the cycle? But the tile is straight: it must be placed in a straight line? The cycle is not straight: it has right angles. However, the tile is placed on the grid: it must be placed in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically). Therefore, the consecutive a cells along the cycle might not be in a straight line? For example, if we start at the last cell of the top row and then go to the first cell of the right column, that is a corner: the next cell is not in the same row or column. Therefore, the tile must be placed entirely in one straight segment? \n\nBut wait: the tile is 1xa: it is one cell wide. So if we place it horizontally, it must be in one row. If vertically, in one column. Therefore, it cannot wrap around a corner because that would require it to be in two different rows or columns? \n\nTherefore, the tile must be placed entirely within one straight segment. Then we are back to the independent segments. \n\nBut then how is a=2 valid for (3,5)? \n\nLet me try to draw the 3x5 grid:\n\nCells:\nTop row: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)\nRight column: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) -> but wait, the grid has 3 rows? Actually, the grid has 3 columns and 5 rows? Or 3 rows and 5 columns? The problem says: width w and length l. The example: 3 cm wide and 5 cm long. The interior is (3-2)*(5-2)=1*3. So it has 3 columns and 5 rows? \n\nBut the boundary:\nTop row: row0: columns0,1,2 -> 3 cells.\nBottom row: row4: columns0,1,2 -> 3 cells.\nLeft column: column0: rows1,2,3 -> 3 cells.\nRight column: column2: rows1,2,3 -> 3 cells.\n\nTotal boundary: 3+3+3+3 = 12 cells.\n\nNow, with a=2: we need 6 tiles.\n\nHow to cover?\nWe can cover the top row: \n  (0,0) and (1,0) with one horizontal tile -> covers 2 cells.\n  Then (2,0) is left.\nThen the right column:\n  (2,0) and (2,1) with one vertical tile -> covers 2 cells.\n  Then (2,2) and (2,3) with one vertical tile -> covers 2 cells.\n  Then (2,4) is left.\nThen the bottom row:\n  (2,4) and (1,4) with one horizontal tile -> covers 2 cells.\n  Then (0,4) is left.\nThen the left column:\n  (0,4) and (0,3) with one vertical tile -> covers 2 cells.\n  Then (0,2) and (0,1) with one vertical tile -> covers 2 cells.\n\nBut then we have covered:\n  top row: (0,0),(1,0) -> then (2,0) is covered by the right column tile.\n  right column: (2,0) [already counted] and (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) -> then (2,4) is covered by the bottom row tile.\n  bottom row: (2,4) and (1,4) -> then (0,4) is covered by the left column tile.\n  left column: (0,4) and (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) -> and (0,0) is already covered.\n\nBut (0,0) is covered by the top row tile, and (0,1) and (0,2) and (0,3) and (0,4) are covered by the left column tiles? That leaves (1,4) and (1,0) and (1, something) uncovered? \n\nWe have not covered the entire boundary. We missed the cells (1,0) and (1,4)? Actually, (1,0) is covered by the top row tile (with (0,0)). And (1,4) is covered by the bottom row tile (with (2,4)). \n\nBut what about the cell (1,0) is in the top row? Yes, and we covered it with the top row tile. Similarly, (1,4) is in the bottom row? Covered by the bottom row tile.\n\nAnd the left column: we covered (0,1) to (0,4) -> but what about (0,0)? (0,0) is covered by the top row. And the right column: (2,0) is covered by the right column tile? and (2,1) to (2,3) and (2,4) is covered by the bottom row.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: the tile that covers (2,0) is placed vertically in the right column? But (2,0) is the top-right corner. The right column is from row1 to row4? But we placed a tile from (2,0) to (2,1) -> that covers row0 and row1. That is acceptable because the right column boundary includes row0? Actually, the right column boundary should include the entire right column: from row0 to row4. But earlier we said the left and right columns are from row1 to row4-1? That was a mistake.\n\nThe boundary of the right column should be from (2,0) to (2,4) -> 5 cells? But wait, the grid has 5 rows: rows0 to 4. The right column has 5 cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Similarly, the left column has 5 cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). \n\nBut then the top row: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) -> 3 cells.\nThe bottom row: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) -> 3 cells.\nThe left and right columns: each has 5 cells, but the top and bottom cells of the columns are already counted in the top and bottom rows? So the boundary area is: \n  top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 5-2=3, right: 5-2=3 -> total 12.\n\nBut the cells (0,0) is in the top row and the left column? We count it only once? In the boundary area, each cell is counted once. So the left column boundary cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) -> 3 cells? and similarly for the right. But then the corners (0,0), (2,0), (0,4), (2,4) are only in the top and bottom rows.\n\nTherefore, the segments are:\n  top: w = 3 cells: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)\n  bottom: w = 3 cells: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)\n  left: l-2 = 5-2 = 3 cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n  right: l-2 = 3 cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nTotal: 12 cells.\n\nNow, with a=2, how do we cover the top row of 3 cells? We cannot cover 3 cells with tiles of length 2? We would have one cell left. \n\nBut in the successful covering above, we used a vertical tile at (2,0) and (2,1) -> that covers (2,0) (which is in the top row) and (2,1) (which is in the right column). This tile is not entirely in the top row nor entirely in the right column? It is in the right column? But (2,0) is the corner: it is in the top row and the right column. \n\nThe problem: can a tile cover two different segments? The tile is 1x2: if placed vertically, it covers two consecutive cells in the same column. The cell (2,0) and (2,1) are in the same column (column2). So this tile is entirely in the right column? But the right column segment is defined as (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) -> it does not include (2,0) because (2,0) is in the top row. \n\nThis indicates that our segmentation is flawed. The boundary is not partitioned into four disjoint segments. The corners are shared. In fact, the boundary is a single cycle. The covering above used the right column tile to cover the corner cell (2,0) and then (2,1). But then the top row only has to cover (0,0) and (1,0) -> 2 cells, which is divisible by 2. Similarly, the right column now has to cover (2,2) and (2,3) -> 2 cells, and then (2,4) is in the bottom row. \n\nTherefore, the segments are not fixed. We can assign the corner cells arbitrarily to the adjacent segments? \n\nIn other words, we can decide how to break the cycle. We can have:\n  segment1: top row from (0,0) to (1,0) -> 2 cells, then the corner (2,0) is covered by the next segment (the right column) which then covers (2,0) and (2,1) and then (2,2) and (2,3) in two tiles, and then (2,4) is covered by the bottom row segment which covers (2,4) and (1,4) and then (0,4) is covered by the left column segment which then covers (0,4) and (0,3) and then (0,2) and (0,1), and finally (0,0) is covered by the top row? But (0,0) is the start.\n\nThis is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire boundary is a cycle of length L = 2*(w+l)-4. We will cover it with tiles of length a. The tile must be placed in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically). Therefore, the consecutive a cells covered by one tile must be in the same row or the same column. \n\nThis means that the tile cannot turn a corner. Therefore, the tile must be contained within one straight segment. But then we are back to the independent segments. \n\nUnless we allow the segments to be defined flexibly: the top row might be covered in two parts: the first part from (0,0) to (x,0) and the last cell (x+1,0) might be covered by the right column. But then the right column starts at (x+1,0) and goes down. This is not a fixed segmentation.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: we have a cycle of length L = 2*(w+l)-4. We want to know if we can cover it with tiles of length a, where each tile is placed in a straight line (so it covers a contiguous segment within one of the four sides). \n\nThe four sides have fixed lengths: \n  side1 (top): w\n  side2 (right): l-2\n  side3 (bottom): w\n  side4 (left): l-2\n\nBut the corner cells are shared between two sides? Actually, the cycle has four corners. The covering must start and end at the boundaries between sides.\n\nWe can break the cycle at a corner. For example, we can break between the top and the right side. Then we have a path of four segments: \n  top: w cells\n  right: l-2 cells\n  bottom: w cells (from right to left)\n  left: l-2 cells (from bottom to top)\n\nTotal: 2*w + 2*(l-2) = 2*w+2*l-4 = L.\n\nNow, we want to cover this path with tiles of length a, and each tile must be contained within one segment. This is the independent segments condition: each segment must be divisible by a.\n\nBut we can also break the cycle at a point that is not a corner? For example, in the middle of a side. Then the segments become:\n  part of side1: x\n  side2: l-2\n  side3: w\n  side4: l-2\n  the rest of side1: w - x\n\nThen the condition is that x, l-2, w, l-2, w-x must be divisible by a? This is more complicated.\n\nHowever, note that the entire length L must be divisible by a. And then we require that there exists a breakpoint (in the cycle) such that the breakpoint does not split any tile, and every tile is within one side. \n\nThe breakpoint can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, we require that the side lengths modulo a can be arranged in a way that the breakpoint falls at the boundary of a tile. This is equivalent to: the sequence of side lengths (in the cycle) must have a circular substring that can be partitioned into segments of length a. \n\nBut note that the sides are: [w, l-2, w, l-2]. \n\nThe condition is that the side lengths must be such that the cumulative sums modulo a can be made to be 0 at the boundaries between sides. \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the following: the only constraint is that the length of each side is at least a? and that the entire boundary is divisible by a. But that is not sufficient.\n\nKnown solution approach from similar problems:\n\nWe must find all divisors a of the boundary area (which is 2*(w+l)-4) such that:\n  a <= max(w, l)   [because the tile must fit in the longest side] \n  and one of the following holds:\n    1. w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n    2. (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n    3. (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   [???]\n\nBut the example (3,5) with a=2: \n  boundary area = 12, a=2 divides 12.\n  Condition 1: w % a = 3 % 2 = 1 -> not 0.\n  Condition 2: (w-2) % a = 1 % 2 = 1 -> not 0.\n  Condition 3: (w-1) % a = 2 % 2 = 0, (l-1) % a = 4 % 2 = 0 -> holds.\n\nTherefore, condition 3 might be the answer.\n\nWhat does condition 3 mean? \n  It means that we can break the boundary into two parts: \n    part1: from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> covering the left column and the bottom row? \n    part2: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> covering the top row and the right column? \n  But then the tile might cover the corner in a different way.\n\nIn fact, condition 3 might correspond to covering the corners with the adjacent sides in a particular way.\n\nTherefore, the valid a are the divisors of the boundary area (2*(w+l)-4) that also satisfy at least one of the following:\n  (1) a <= w and a <= l-2 and w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0   [covering the top/bottom with a and the sides with a, and the corners are handled naturally?]\n  (2) a <= w-2 and a <= l and (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0   [covering the top/bottom with a and the sides with a, but swapping the roles?]\n  (3) a <= w-1 and a <= l-1 and (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   [covering the boundary by having the tiles at the corners cover one cell from the row and one from the column?]\n\nBut wait, condition (3) might be: \n  We cover the top row except the last cell, and the right column except the first cell, and then the bottom row except the first cell, and the left column except the last cell? \n  Then the top row: w-1 cells, must be divisible by a.\n  The right column: l-1 cells, must be divisible by a.\n  The bottom row: w-1 cells, must be divisible by a.\n  The left column: l-1 cells, must be divisible by a.\n  But note: the boundary is then (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) + (l-1) = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4, which matches.\n\nHowever, condition (3) only requires (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0. But then the bottom row and left column would also be covered because they are the same as the top row and right column in terms of length? \n\nBut note: the bottom row is also w-1? No, the bottom row is w cells. We are covering only w-1 cells? \n\nAlternatively, condition (3) might be for a different segmentation: \n  We might break the cycle after the first cell of the top row. Then the segments become:\n    segment1: the first cell of the top row: (0,0) -> then we cover the left column: (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> length l, but wait.\n\nActually, condition (3) might be for a different arrangement: \n  The entire boundary is covered by tiles that are placed in a way that each corner is covered by a tile that is in the adjacent side. For example, the top-left corner is covered by a tile that is in the left column. Then the top row starts at (1,0). The top row then has w-1 cells. Similarly, the bottom row has w-1 cells (because the bottom-left corner is covered by the left column and the bottom-right corner by the right column). The left column has l-1 cells (because the top-left corner is covered and the bottom-left corner is covered) -> but then the left column would have l-2+2 = l cells? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nKnown solution from a similar problem (Codeforces problem \"Tiling a Cycle\"):\n\nWe are to find all a such that:\n  a divides the boundary area: L = 2*(w+l)-4.\n  and a <= L\n  and (one of the following)\n      (i) a <= w and a <= l-2 and w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n      (ii) a <= w-2 and a <= l and (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n      (iii) a <= w-1 and a <= l-1 and (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0\n      (iv) a <= w-1 and a <= l-1 and (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   [duplicate?]\n\nBut wait, there might be a fourth condition:\n      (iv) a <= w-1 and a <= l-1 and (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   -> already have (iii)\n\nActually, in the example (3,5) with a=2:\n  condition (iii): (w-1)=2, divisible by 2; (l-1)=4, divisible by 2 -> holds.\n\nAnd a=1: \n  condition (i): 1<=3 and 1<=3 and 3%1==0 and 3%1==0 -> holds.\n  condition (ii): 1<=1 and 1<=5 and 1%1==0 and 5%1==0 -> holds.\n  condition (iii): 1<=2 and 1<=4 and 2%1==0 and 4%1==0 -> holds.\n  But we don't want duplicates. We want to list each a once.\n\nAnd a=3:\n  condition (i): 3<=3 and 3<=3 and 3%3==0 and 3%3==0 -> holds.\n\nSo the valid a are 1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n  a must be a divisor of L = 2*(w+l)-4.\n  and ( \n        ( (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0) ) \n        or ( ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0) )\n        or ( ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0) )\n      )\n\nBut note: a=1 always works. And a=2 for (3,5) works by condition (w-1 and l-1).\n\nHowever, we must also ensure that the lengths are nonnegative and the modulo is defined for positive a. And a must be at least 1.\n\nBut also, we must ensure that the segments are long enough: \n  For condition (i): we require a<=w and a<=l-2? But what if a>w? then w % a = w (which is not 0) so it fails. Similarly, if a>l-2, then (l-2) % a = l-2 (which is not 0) unless l-2==0. But l>=3, so l-2>=1. So if a>l-2, then (l-2) % a = l-2 !=0. Therefore, we don't need to explicitly check a<=w and a<=l-2 because the modulo condition will fail.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut what if l-2 is negative? The problem states l>=3, so l-2>=1.\n\nTherefore, the plan for program1.py:\n\n  For each test case (w, l):\n      L = 2*(w+l) - 4\n      We will find all divisors a of L (with a>=1) that satisfy at least one of:\n          (i)   (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n          (ii)  ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n          (iii) ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0)\n\n      But note: a=1 might be counted multiple times -> we use a set.\n\n  However, the divisor enumeration: L can be up to 4e9? We are iterating t up to 100 test cases. We can factorize L? But 100 test cases, and each L up to 4e9, and we need to iterate over the divisors? The number of divisors is about O(sqrt(L)) which is about 1e5 per test case? worst-case 100 * 1e5 = 10e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. So the total number of divisors over all test cases is at most 200000? But worst-case one test case might have 1344 divisors (like 2^20 has about 21 divisors, but worst-case is around 1344 for numbers near 1e9). And 100 test cases * 1344 = 134400, which is within 200000.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the output contains at most 200000 integers\", meaning the total a_i over all test cases.\n\n  So we can iterate over the divisors of L for each test case.\n\n  Steps for one test case:\n      L = 2*(w+l) - 4\n      Find all divisors of L.\n      For each divisor a (>=1) of L:\n          if ( (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) ):\n               then add a to the set.\n\n      Then sort the set and output the number of solutions and the sorted list.\n\n  However, note: the modulo operation for a=0 is undefined. But a is at least 1.\n\n  But what if l-2 is 0? The problem states l>=3, so l-2>=1.\n\n  But what if w-2 is 0? w>=3, so w-2>=1.\n\n  But what if w-1 is 0? w>=3, so w-1>=2.\n\n  Similarly for l-1.\n\n  However, note: the conditions (i) and (ii) and (iii) are not mutually exclusive. We use a set to avoid duplicates.\n\n  But note: the divisor a might be very large? But we are iterating over all divisors, which are symmetric: we can iterate up to sqrt(L).\n\n  How to get the divisors of L:\n      We can iterate i from 1 to sqrt(L) (inclusive) and record i and L//i.\n\n  But note: the original code in program1.py already has a loop that iterates from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))? Actually, the given code:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2   -> that is not L, L = 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * (w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n      So L = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n      The given code iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then uses i and div = half_perimeter // i.\n\n      But we need the divisors of L = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n      The divisors of L can be found by factoring 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n  However, the given code already has a set initialized with {1,2}. Why 2? \n\n  Let me check with the example (3,5): \n      half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6.\n      Then L = 2*6 = 12.\n\n      The divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n      The given code starts with solutions = {1,2}. Then it iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6))=2.\n          i=2: 6 % 2 == 0 -> then div = 6//2=3.\n          Then it considers a in [2,3]:\n              for a=2: \n                  mod_a = w % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1.\n                  if mod_a <= 2: -> true, then what? \n                  Then it does something (the TODO) and then adds a=2? \n              for a=3:\n                  mod_a = 3 % 3 = 0, which is <=2 -> then do something.\n\n      Then it also has 1 and 2 already.\n\n      But then it misses 4,6,12? \n\n  The given code does not iterate over all divisors. It only iterates up to sqrt(half_perimeter) and then uses i and half_perimeter//i. But half_perimeter = 6, so it gets divisors 2 and 3. But we need the divisors of L=12, not half_perimeter=6.\n\n  And the divisors of L=12 are not the same as the divisors of half_perimeter=6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n  Therefore, the given code is not iterating over the divisors of L.\n\n  We must change the approach.\n\n  But the problem says: complete the code. We are not allowed to change the given structure arbitrarily.\n\n  Given code:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n          if mod_i != 0:\n              continue\n          for a in [i, div]:\n              mod_a = w % a\n              if mod_a <= 2:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  Why is 2 already in the set? And 1.\n\n  And then it checks mod_a = w % a, and if mod_a<=2, then it does something.\n\n  This suggests an alternative approach.\n\n  Insight: the condition (w % a <= 2) might be related to the conditions (i), (ii), (iii). \n\n  Let me test with a=2 for (3,5): \n      w=3, a=2: 3 % 2 = 1, which is <=2 -> then we do something.\n\n  What should we do? We should check if a is valid by one of the conditions.\n\n  So in the TODO, we might check the conditions.\n\n  But the given code already has a set 'solutions'. We are to add a to solutions if it satisfies one of the conditions.\n\n  However, the given code also has 1 and 2 initially. And then it iterates and might add more.\n\n  But why 2 is initially there? For a=2, we have to check the conditions.\n\n  So the plan for the TODO:\n\n      We have a candidate a (which is either i or div). We know that a is a divisor of half_perimeter? But note: we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, not L. And L = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of L are: \n          the divisors of half_perimeter, and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2, and also the divisors of half_perimeter that are even? \n\n      Actually, the divisors of L = 2 * half_perimeter are:\n          all divisors of 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n      But the given code only considers divisors of half_perimeter. So we are missing the divisors of L that are not divisors of half_perimeter? For example, 4 is a divisor of 12 but not of 6.\n\n  Therefore, we must also consider the divisors of L that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n  But the problem says the output for (3,5) must include 1,2,3. The divisors of half_perimeter=6 are 1,2,3,6. The divisors of L=12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. We only want 1,2,3.\n\n  How to get 4 and 6 and 12? They might be valid by one of the conditions? \n      a=4: \n          condition (i): 3 % 4 = 3 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (ii): (3-2)=1 %4=1 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (iii): (3-1)=2 %4=2 !=0 -> fail.\n      a=6: \n          condition (i): 3%6=3 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (ii): 1%6=1 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (iii): 2%6=2 !=0 -> fail.\n      a=12: similarly fail.\n\n  So we don't want them.\n\n  Therefore, the divisors we are iterating over (the divisors of half_perimeter) might be sufficient? But note: the conditions (i), (ii), (iii) might be satisfied by divisors of L that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n  For example, consider a=4 for a different test case: w=4, l=4.\n      L = 2*(4+4)-4 = 12.\n      half_perimeter = 4+4-2 = 6.\n      Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n      Divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n      Check a=4:\n          condition (i): w=4, a=4 -> 4%4=0, l-2=2 -> 2%4=2 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (ii): w-2=2 -> 2%4=2 !=0 -> fail.\n          condition (iii): w-1=3 -> 3%4=3 !=0, l-1=3 -> 3%4=3 !=0 -> fail.\n      So a=4 is not valid.\n\n  Consider a=12 for (4,4): \n      condition (i): 4%12=4 !=0 -> fail.\n\n  So it seems that only the divisors of half_perimeter might be the candidates? But note: the conditions involve modulo by a, and a might be any divisor of L. However, if a is a divisor of L and a>half_perimeter, then a must be L itself or L//2, etc. But we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, not L.\n\n  We must iterate over divisors of L, not half_perimeter.\n\n  Given the constraints, we can change the loop to iterate over divisors of L. But the problem says: complete the code, so we are allowed to change the loop? \n\n  However, the given code has:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          ...\n\n  We are iterating up to sqrt(half_perimeter). But we need to iterate up to sqrt(L) = sqrt(2 * half_perimeter). \n\n  And we are not using L explicitly.\n\n  Let me reframe: \n      Let L = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n  We can find the divisors of L by iterating i from 1 to floor(sqrt(L)).\n\n  But the given code already has a set 'solutions' initialized with {1,2}. Why 2? \n\n  Note: a=1 and a=2 might be valid for many cases. But we should check them by the conditions.\n\n  However, the given code does not check a=1 and a=2 in the loop. It assumes they are always valid? But they might not be? \n\n  For example, if w=3, l=3:\n      L = 2*(3+3)-4 = 8.\n      half_perimeter = 3+3-2=4.\n      Conditions for a=1: always valid.\n      Conditions for a=2:\n          (i): w%2=3%2=1, (l-2)=1 -> 1%2=1 -> fail.\n          (ii): (w-2)=1 -> 1%2=1, l%2=3%2=1 -> fail.\n          (iii): (w-1)=2%2=0, (l-1)=2%2=0 -> valid.\n      So a=2 is valid.\n\n  But what if we have a test case where a=2 is not valid? \n\n  Example: w=3, l=4.\n      L = 2*(3+4)-4 = 10.\n      half_perimeter = 3+4-2=5.\n      Conditions for a=2:\n          (i): 3%2=1, (4-2)=2 -> 2%2=0 -> but 1 is not 0 -> fail.\n          (ii): (3-2)=1 -> 1%2=1, 4%2=0 -> fail.\n          (iii): (3-1)=2%2=0, (4-1)=3%2=1 -> fail.\n      So a=2 is not valid.\n\n  Therefore, we should not assume a=2 is always valid.\n\n  Given the above, we must change the given code to iterate over the divisors of L.\n\n  But the problem says: complete the code. We are allowed to change it as long as we fill in the missing lines.\n\n  We see that the given code does not work for the example (3,5) because it does not include a=3? \n      For (3,5): half_perimeter=6.\n      The loop: i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6))=2.\n          i=2: 6%2==0 -> then a in [2, 6//2=3].\n          For a=2: \n              w % a = 3 % 2 = 1, which is <=2 -> then we do the TODO.\n          For a=3:\n              w % a = 3 % 3 = 0, which is <=2 -> then we do the TODO.\n\n      Then the set initially has {1,2}. After the loop, we must have added a=2 and a=3? But then the set becomes {1,2,3}. That is correct.\n\n  But how do we know that a=1 is valid? It is in the set initially. But we haven't checked it by the conditions. We should check it.\n\n  Similarly, a=2 is in the set initially, but we also encounter a=2 in the loop. We will check it in the TODO and then add it again? (set doesn't duplicate).\n\n  But the TODO: what should we do? We should check if a is valid by one of the conditions. If it is, then we add it to solutions? But it is already in the set.\n\n  And what about the divisors that are greater than sqrt(half_perimeter)? The given code uses [i, div] and div might be large. That is correct for the divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n  But we are missing the divisors of L that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n  For example, in (3,5): L=12, and 4 is a divisor of 12 but not of 6. We are not iterating on 4.\n\n  Therefore, we must change the loop to iterate over the divisors of L, not half_perimeter.\n\n  How to do it within the given structure?\n\n  We can change the first line to:\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)   # which is L\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # we might not need it? but the sqrt is on half_perimeter? \n\n  Then we want to iterate over the divisors of total. But the given loop uses half_perimeter.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):   # but total might be up to 4e9, sqrt is about 63245, which is acceptable? 100 test cases * 63245 = 6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n          if total % i == 0:\n              divisors = [i, total//i]\n              for a in divisors:\n                  ... \n\n  But the given code has:\n\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n  We are not using total.\n\n  Given the constraints, we are allowed to change the loop.\n\n  But the problem says: complete the code, and the given code has that loop. We are only to fill in the TODO.\n\n  However, the TODO is inside the loop, and we are allowed to change the structure of the program if necessary? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We might be allowed to change the loop.\n\n  But the output format is fixed: we must output only the missing code.\n\n  Alternatively, we can leave the loop as is (which iterates over divisors of half_perimeter) and then also iterate over the divisors of total that are not covered? \n\n  But that would be outside the given structure.\n\n  Let me read the note in the given code: the output contains at most 200000 integers. We can iterate over the divisors of total in a separate loop. But the given code already has a set and a loop.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says to complete the code, we will assume that the given loop is intended to iterate over the divisors of half_perimeter, and that we will also consider the divisors that are total//2 (which might be half_perimeter) and also the factor 2 explicitly.\n\n  But note: the divisors of total = 2 * half_perimeter are:\n      all divisors of half_perimeter, and also 2 times the divisors of half_perimeter? \n      But not exactly: if d is a divisor of half_perimeter, then d and 2*d are divisors of total, but only if d is not already even? \n\n  Actually, the divisors of total are: \n      the divisors of half_perimeter, and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2, but only if they are not already divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n  For example, half_perimeter=6: divisors are 1,2,3,6. Then total=12: divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n      The new ones are 4 and 12? \n      4 = 2*2, and 2 is a divisor of 6.\n      12 = 2*6, and 6 is a divisor of 6.\n\n  So we can generate the divisors of total by:\n      divisors_total = set()\n      for d in divisors_half_perimeter:\n          divisors_total.add(d)\n          divisors_total.add(2*d)\n\n  But is that always true? Only if half_perimeter is even? \n      If half_perimeter is even, then 2*d might be a divisor of total? \n      But total = 2 * half_perimeter, so if d is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*d is a divisor of total.\n\n  And if half_perimeter is odd, then total = 2 * (odd) -> then the divisors of total are: \n        divisors of half_perimeter (which are all odd) and 2 times these divisors.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      We have a set of divisors from half_perimeter: we get them by iterating as in the given loop, and we start with {1,2}? \n      But 2 might not be a divisor of half_perimeter if half_perimeter is odd.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem expects at most 200000 integers in the output, we can simply iterate over the divisors of total.\n\n  But the given code structure is fixed. We are to fill in the TODO.\n\n  We decide to change the given code to iterate over the divisors of total. We will do:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()   # remove the initial {1,2} and then we will add all valid a.\n\n      # But then we must ensure we consider a=1 and a=2 if they are valid.\n\n  However, the given code has solutions = {1,2}. We cannot remove that because we are only to fill in the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, we must leave the initial set as {1,2} and then in the loop we will add more. But then we will have to remove the ones that are not valid.\n\n  Alternatively, in the TODO, we will add the candidate a to the set only if it is valid. But then after the loop, we might remove the initially added 1 and 2 if they are not valid.\n\n  But the problem: we might have to remove 1 and 2 if they are not valid. \n\n  How about: after the loop, we will check a=1 and a=2 and remove them if they are not valid.\n\n  But then we would have to do that for every test case.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says to output only the missing code, we will assume that the TODO is only the part inside the loop.\n\n  We will do in the TODO:\n\n      if ( (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or\n           ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or\n           ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) ):\n           solutions.add(a)\n\n  But note: the candidate a might be the same as one of the initial 1 or 2? Then we add it again, but set doesn't duplicate.\n\n  But what about the divisors that are not in the initial set? For example, a=3 in (3,5) is not in {1,2} initially, so we add it.\n\n  But what about a=4? We never consider it because the loop only iterates over divisors of half_perimeter, and 4 is not a divisor of 6. So we won't add it, and it is not in the initial set.\n\n  But a=1 and a=2 are in the initial set, and we haven't checked them. They might be invalid.\n\n  Therefore, after the loop, we must check a=1 and a=2 and remove them if they are not valid.\n\n  But the problem: we are not allowed to change the code after the loop? We are only to fill in the TODO.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check a=1 and a=2 in the TODO? But the loop does not iterate on a=1 and a=2.\n\n  We can do: before the loop, we remove 1 and 2 from the set and then in the loop and also in a separate check for a=1 and a=2, we add them if valid.\n\n  But that would be outside the TODO.\n\n  Given the constraints, and since the problem says to complete the code by filling in the missing lines, we will output the TODO part only.\n\n  And then hope that the initial {1,2} is corrected by the TODO for the ones that appear in the loop, and for the ones that don't, we have to fix them in a way that is not in the TODO.\n\n  But the problem: a=1 might not be valid for some test case? \n      Let's take w=3, l=4: \n          a=1: \n             condition (i): 3%1=0, (4-2)=2%1=0 -> valid.\n          a=2: we saw it is not valid.\n          So we want solutions = {1, ... }.\n\n      In the given code: \n          solutions = {1,2} initially.\n          half_perimeter = 3+4-2=5.\n          Then the loop: i from 2 to floor(sqrt(5))=2.\n              i=2: 5%2=1 -> skip.\n          Then we output solutions = {1,2} -> but a=2 is not valid.\n\n  Therefore, we must remove a=2.\n\n  How to do it in the TODO? We cannot.\n\n  So we must change the given structure.\n\n  Since the problem allows \"missing lines or blocks\", we might be allowed to add a block after the loop to check the initial 1 and 2.\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  We will output the TODO part and also a block after the loop.\n\n  However, the output format is: only the missing code, and in the specified JSON.\n\n  Given the complexity, we will do the following for program1.py:\n\n      We will change the loop to iterate over the divisors of total = 2*(w+l-2). And we will remove the initial {1,2} and then iterate over the divisors of total and add them if they are valid.\n\n  But that would be a significant change.\n\n  Alternatively, we will do:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      # We will iterate over the divisors of total.\n      # First, we iterate i from 1 to isqrt(total) to get the divisors.\n      # But note: the given code has a for loop that goes from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)). We will replace that loop.\n\n  But the problem: we are to output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n  We must output only the completion for program1.py in the JSON.\n\n  Given the above, and since the initial code is given, we will output the following for program1.py:\n\n      We will replace the given loop with a loop over the divisors of total.\n\n  Steps for one test case in program1.py:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      # get all divisors of total\n      i = 1\n      while i * i <= total:\n          if total % i == 0:\n              divisors = [i, total//i]\n              for a in divisors:\n                  if a < 1: \n                      continue\n                  if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                      solutions.add(a)\n              i += 1\n          else:\n              i += 1\n\n      # But note: the above while loop is not optimized. We can use for i in range(1, int(sqrt(total))+1)\n\n  But the range might be up to 1e5, and 100 test cases -> 100 * 1e5 = 1e7, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the given code has:\n\n      res = []\n      for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n          half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n          solutions = {1, 2}\n          for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n              ...\n\n  We will change this to:\n\n      res = []\n      for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n          total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n          solutions = set()\n          # If total==0, then w+l-2==0, but w>=3, l>=3, so total>=2*(3+3-2)=8, so not zero.\n          # Iterate i from 1 to the integer square root of total.\n          import math\n          sqrt_total = math.isqrt(total)\n          for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n              if total % i == 0:\n                  for a in [i, total//i]:\n                      # Check conditions\n                      if a in solutions: \n                          continue\n                      if a < 1: \n                          continue\n                      if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                          solutions.add(a)\n          # But note: a=1 might be missed if total==0, but total>=8.\n          # We have iterate from 1, so a=1 is included.\n\n          # Sort the solutions\n          sorted_solutions = sorted(solutions)\n          res.append(f\"{len(sorted_solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted_solutions))}\")\n\n  But the problem: the divisors might be duplicated. We use a set.\n\n  However, the condition might be satisfied for both i and total//i, but we add both if they are distinct.\n\n  This should work.\n\n  But note: the range for i: from 1 to sqrt_total. This will give us all divisors.\n\n  However, the original code had a set initially with {1,2}. We now start with an empty set.\n\n  We must ensure that we include a=1 and a=2 if they are valid. The loop will include them because i=1 and i=2 (if they are<=sqrt_total) will be iterated.\n\n  For example, (3,5): total=12, sqrt_total=3.\n      i=1: 12%1==0 -> a in [1,12]\n          a=1: valid? \n             condition (i): 3%1==0, (5-2)=3%1==0 -> valid -> add 1.\n          a=12: \n             condition (i): 3%12=3, 3%12=3 -> fail.\n             condition (ii): 1%12=1, 5%12=5 -> fail.\n             condition (iii): 2%12=2, 4%12=4 -> fail. -> skip.\n      i=2: 12%2==0 -> a in [2,6]\n          a=2: valid by condition (iii) -> add 2.\n          a=6: fail.\n      i=3: 12%3==0 -> a in [3,4]\n          a=3: valid by condition (i) -> add 3.\n          a=4: fail.\n\n      solutions = {1,2,3} -> sorted: [1,2,3]\n\n  For (3,4): total=2*(3+4-2)=10.\n      i=1: a in [1,10]\n          a=1: valid.\n          a=10: \n             condition (i): 3%10=3, (4-2)=2%10=2 -> fail.\n             condition (ii): (3-2)=1%10=1, 4%10=4 -> fail.\n             condition (iii): 2%10=2, 3%10=3 -> fail.\n      i=2: 10%2==0 -> a in [2,5]\n          a=2: \n             condition (i): 3%2=1, (4-2)=2%2=0 -> fail because 1!=0.\n             condition (ii): (3-2)=1%2=1, 4%2=0 -> fail.\n             condition (iii): 2%2=0, 3%2=1 -> fail.\n          -> skip.\n          a=5: \n             condition (i): 3%5=3, 2%5=2 -> fail.\n             condition (ii): 1%5=1, 4%5=4 -> fail.\n             condition (iii): 2%5=2, 3%5=3 -> fail.\n      i=3: 10%3!=0 -> skip.\n      i=4: 4>sqrt(10) (which is ~3.16) -> break.\n      solutions = {1} -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, we will output for program1.py the following completion:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      # We'll iterate i from 1 to the integer square root of total\n      # Note: we must import math for isqrt if not already, but the given code imports sqrt and floor.\n      # Use: from math import isqrt   # but the given code has from math import sqrt, floor -> we can use floor(sqrt(total)) but then we have to convert to int.\n      # Alternatively, use range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1) but then we might miss perfect squares? \n      # But the for loop goes to floor(sqrt(total)) inclusive, and then we get i and total//i.\n      # We can do:\n      #   sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total))\n      #   for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n      # But note: if total is a perfect square, then i*i==total, and we will add the same divisor twice? -> we can avoid by the set.\n\n      # However, the given code does not have isqrt, so we use:\n      #   import math\n      #   sqrt_total = math.isqrt(total)\n      # But we are not allowed to import extra. We have from math import sqrt, floor.\n\n      # We can do: sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total))\n      # But sqrt might return float, and for large total, it might be inexact. We can use:\n      #   i = 1\n      #   while i * i <= total:\n      #       ...\n      #       i += 1\n\n      # But the given code uses a for loop. We will use a for loop.\n\n      # Since the given code already uses floor and sqrt, we do:\n      #   for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n      # But note: if total is 0, but total>=8, so safe.\n\n      for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n          if total % i == 0:\n              for a in [i, total//i]:\n                  if a in solutions: \n                      continue\n                  # Check the conditions\n                  if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                      solutions.add(a)\n\n      # But note: it is possible that i and total//i are the same (when total is a perfect square) -> then we would have duplicates, but the set handles it.\n\n      # Then we sort and output.\n\n  However, the range floor(sqrt(total)) might be large. total up to 4e9, then sqrt(total) up to 63245, and 100 test cases * 63245 = 6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton.\n\n  But the given code has a loop from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)). We are changing it to from 1 to floor(sqrt(total)).\n\n  We must also note that the initial set solutions = {1,2} is replaced by solutions = set().\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the entire block from the assignment of total to the end of the for loop.\n\n  But the given code has:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          ...\n\n  We will change that.\n\n  So for program1.py, we output:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      # If total is 0, skip, but total>=8\n      # Calculate the square root of total\n      # Use a for loop from 1 to floor(sqrt(total)) (inclusive)\n      # Note: we have from math import floor, sqrt\n      # Let's compute:\n      #   sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total))\n      # But for very large total, sqrt might be inexact. We can use:\n      #   i = 1\n      #   while i * i <= total:\n      # but the for loop is more efficient.\n\n      # We'll use:\n      #   for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n      # However, we can use:\n      #   for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n      # But note: if total is a perfect square, then i=sqrt(total) will be included.\n\n      for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n          if total % i == 0:\n              for a in [i, total//i]:\n                  if a in solutions:\n                      continue\n                  if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                      solutions.add(a)\n\n      # Then we proceed to output.\n\n  But note: the range floor(sqrt(total)) might be very large, but total up to 4e9, then sqrt(total) up to 63245, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the given code has an extra variable 'half_perimeter' that is not used anymore. We can remove it, but it's not necessary.\n\n  But the problem: the given code has a variable 'half_perimeter' and a loop that uses it. We are changing the loop.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block that replaces from the line 'half_perimeter = ...' to the end of the for loop.\n\n  Specifically, we replace:\n\n      half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n      solutions = {1, 2}\n      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n          div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n          if mod_i != 0:\n              continue\n          for a in [i, div]:\n              mod_a = w % a\n              if mod_a <= 2:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  with:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(total)) + 1):\n          if total % i == 0:\n              for a in [i, total//i]:\n                  if a in solutions:\n                      continue\n                  if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                      solutions.add(a)\n\n  But note: the code after this (res.append) remains the same.\n\n  However, the given code has a line after the for loop: \n        res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\")\n\n  So we are not changing that.\n\n  But the above for loop might be the completion.\n\n  But wait, the range floor(sqrt(total)) might be expensive to compute for each test case? We can compute it once:\n\n      sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total))\n\n  But floor and sqrt are available.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n      solutions = set()\n      # Avoid duplicates: use a set for the divisors we've seen? but we are using a set 'solutions' for the valid ones.\n      # Iterate i from 1 to the integer part of the square root of total.\n      # Let's compute:\n      high = floor(sqrt(total))\n      for i in range(1, high+1):\n          if total % i == 0:\n              candidates = [i, total//i]\n              for a in candidates:\n                  if a in solutions: \n                      continue\n                  # Check the three conditions\n                  cond1 = (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n                  cond2 = ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n                  cond3 = ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0)\n                  if cond1 or cond2 or cond3:\n                      solutions.add(a)\n\n  This is the completion for program1.py.\n\n  For program2.py:\n\n      The given code:\n\n          for k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n              if k == \"G\":\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              if j == \"G\":\n                  j = \"B\"\n              row1n.append(k)\n              row2n.append(j)\n\n      The idea: Vasya can't distinguish green and blue. So he sees 'G' and 'B' as the same.\n\n      We are to determine if the two rows are the same in his eyes.\n\n      We can convert every 'G' to 'B' in both rows and then compare.\n\n      In the given code, they are iterating over the characters of row1 and row2 (which are strings of length n).\n\n      For each pair (k from row1, j from row2):\n          if k is 'G', then we should convert it to 'B'? \n          similarly, if j is 'G', then convert it to 'B'.\n\n      Then we build row1n and row2n and compare.\n\n      But the TODO is only for when k is 'G'. We can do:\n\n          if k == \"G\":\n              k = \"B\"\n\n      And then later, if j is 'G', then j=\"B\".\n\n      But note: after we convert k to 'B', then we are appending the converted k.\n\n      However, what if k is 'G' and then later we do nothing to j? \n\n      Example: \n          row1 = \"G\", row2 = \"B\"\n          Then we convert k='G' to 'B', and then j='B' remains 'B'. Then row1n = ['B'], row2n = ['B'] -> same.\n\n      But what if row1 = \"B\", row2 = \"G\": \n          k='B' -> not changed.\n          then j='G' -> changed to 'B'. \n          then row1n = ['B'], row2n = ['B'] -> same.\n\n      This should work.\n\n      But the given code has:\n\n          if k == \"G\":\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          if j == \"G\":\n              j = \"B\"\n\n      We can do in the TODO: k = \"B\"\n\n      But note: we must do the same for both. \n\n      However, the code already has a conversion for j.\n\n      So the TODO is simply: k = \"B\"\n\n      But then we have:\n\n          for k,j in zip(row1, row2):\n              if k == \"G\":\n                  k = \"B\"\n              if j == \"G\":\n                  j = \"B\"\n              row1n.append(k)\n              row2n.append(j)\n\n      This will convert every 'G' to 'B' in both rows.\n\n      Then we compare the two lists.\n\n      This should work.\n\n      Example from the note: \n          first test case: n=1, row1=\"G\", row2=\"B\" -> becomes \"B\" and \"B\" -> YES.\n          second test case: n=4, row1=\"GRBG\", row2=\"GBGB\"\n              row1: G->B, R->R, B->B, G->B -> \"BRBB\"\n              row2: G->B, B->B, G->B, B->B -> \"BBBB\" -> not equal -> NO? \n          But the note says the first test case is YES, the second is NO.\n\n          However, the example in the note says:\n              \"The first test case, ... Therefore, Vasya will say that the two rows are coloured the same\"\n              \"In the second test case, Vasya can see that the two rows are different.\"\n\n          But the example input has: \n              \"6 2 RG RB 4 GRBG GBGB ...\"\n\n          The second test case: n=4, row1=\"GRBG\", row2=\"GBGB\"\n\n          After conversion:\n              row1: G->B, R->R, B->B, G->B -> \"BRBB\"\n              row2: G->B, B->B, G->B, B->B -> \"BBBB\" -> not equal -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n          Third test case: n=5, row1=\"GGGGG\", row2=\"BBBBB\"\n              row1: all G -> becomes \"BBBBB\"\n              row2: all B -> becomes \"BBBBB\" -> equal -> \"YES\"\n\n      Therefore, the TODO is: k = \"B\"\n\n  But note: the variable k is the character from row1. We are iterating with for k,j in zip(row1, row2). \n      When we do k = \"B\", does it change the value that is appended? \n          In Python, k is a local variable. We are changing it to \"B\", and then we append it. That is correct.\n\n  However, the given code also has:\n\n      if j == \"G\":\n          j = \"B\"\n\n  So we do the same for j.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: k = \"B\"\n\n  But note: the given code has:\n\n      if k == \"G\":\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      if j == \"G\":\n          j = \"B\"\n\n  We fill the TODO with: k = \"B\"\n\n  However, what if there is an 'R'? \n      We leave 'R'"
