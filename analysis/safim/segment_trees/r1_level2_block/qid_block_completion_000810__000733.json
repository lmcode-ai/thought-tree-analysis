Then we try to extend: a becomes 1? but then a=1 and b=1 -> break? Then we print ans=2. Example: [1,2,2,1]\n      Initially: a=-1, b=4, suma=0, sumb=0 -> equal: so we set ans=0? then we take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2 -> then we set ans=2? Then we continue: Now we have a=0, b=3, and we are in the loop: Check: suma=1, sumb=1 -> equal -> so we set ans=2 (but then we update to the current cur? actually we set ans=cur which is 2, then we take two more: \n          a becomes 1, b becomes 2: \n          suma = 1+2=3, sumb=1+2=3, cur=4 -> then we set ans=4? Then we try to extend: a becomes 2, b becomes 1 -> a>=b? break. Then we print 4. But what if we have [1,2,3,6]? We want: Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [6] = 6 -> not equal. Alternatively: Alice: [1] = 1, Bob: [6] = 6 -> not equal. Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3,6] = 9 -> not equal. Alice: [1,2,3] = 6, Bob: [6] = 6 -> total 4 candies.",

Now: suma=3 < sumb=6 -> take from left: a=2, suma=3+3=6, cur=4. Now: suma=6 == sumb=6 -> set ans=4, then take two: a=3, b=2 -> but then a=3 and b=2 -> a>=b -> break? Then print 4. So it works.

Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the `suma < sumb` branch is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious that a+1 might be beyond the array? Actually, we break when a>=b, so we are safe. However, what if a+1 == b? Then we are about to take the last candy in the middle? Example: [1,1] -> \n            Initially: a=-1, b=2 -> then we are in the equal state (0==0) -> set ans=0, then we take two: a=0, b=1 -> suma=1, sumb=1 -> then we set ans=2? Then we try to extend: a becomes 1? and b becomes 0 -> then a>=b -> break. So we set ans=2 and then break. Therefore, the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nFor program2.py:\n  We are to complete the condition for division 2. The divisions:\n      Division 1: rating >= 1900\n      Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n      Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n      Division 4: rating <= 1399 The code already has:\n      if 1900<= b: d = 1\n      elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      elif 1400 <= b <= 1599: d = 3\n      elif b <= 1399: d = 4\n\n  We need to set d=2 for the division 2. So the missing code is:\n\n        d = 2\n\n  But note: the condition is already written: 1600<=b<=1899, so we just set d=2. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \" d = 2\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program1.py: the current code has 8 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1 So we use the same indentation: 8 spaces?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the missing part in the solve function. The current code has a TODO in the condition for when suma < sumb.\n\nThe problem: \nAlice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They want the total weight eaten by Alice (suma) to equal that eaten by Bob (sumb). We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is the count).\n\nThe approach in the code:\nWe have two pointers: a starting at -1 (so the next candy on the left is at index 0) and b starting at n (so the next candy on the right is at index n-1). We also have:\n  suma: the total weight Alice has eaten so far (initially 0)\n  sumb: the total weight Bob has eaten so far (initially 0)\n  cur: the current total count of candies eaten (initially 0)\n  ans: the best total count of candies eaten so far when the two sums were equal.\n\nThe loop runs while a < b (meaning there are candies in between that haven't been taken by both? Actually, note: a and b are indices that have been taken? Actually, the code uses:\n  a starts at -1, so the first candy Alice takes is at index0: a becomes 0, then she takes the next at 1, etc.\n  b starts at n, so the first candy Bob takes is at index n-1, then n-2, etc.\n\nThe condition:\n  if a>=b: break -> when the pointers cross, we break.\n  elif suma > sumb: then Bob must take more (from the right) to try to catch up. So we take one candy from the right (b decreases by 1, then add arr[b] to sumb, and cur increases by 1).\n  elif suma < sumb: then we should take one candy from the left to increase Alice's sum. This is the missing part.\n\nSo for the missing part in program1.py in the condition `suma < sumb`:\n  We do the symmetric of the `suma > sumb` case: take from the left.\n\nWe'll do:\n  a += 1\n  suma += arr[a]\n  cur += 1\n\nBut note: initially a is -1, so we can do a+=1 to get 0 and then take arr[0].\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the condition `a>=b` must be checked after each move. Also, note that in the equal case, we take one from the left and one from the right at the same time (and update by 2).\n\nBut in the `suma < sumb` case, we are only taking one candy from the left. Similarly, in the `suma > sumb` case, we take one from the right.\n\nAlso note: when the sums become equal, we record the current count (cur) as a candidate for the answer (ans = cur). Then we take one more from the left and one more from the right (so we are trying to extend the current equal state). This is because we want the maximum total candies.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: they cannot eat the same candy. And the pointers a and b are moving towards each other.\n\nBut there is a catch: when we are in the equal state, we record the current total as the best so far, and then we take one more from the left and one more from the right. This is because we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence? Actually, the problem wants the maximum total candies.\n\nBut note: the example: \n  For the second test case: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6] -> but wait, the example says: \n      Alice: [7, 3, 20] and Bob: [10, 8, 11, 1] -> total 30 each, and total candies 7.\n\nHowever, the sample input in the note: \n  For the second test case: n=6, weights: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> but the example says Alice eats the first three (1+2+3=6) and Bob eats the last three (4+5+6=15) -> that doesn't equal. Actually, the example says: \n      \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nWait, the example must be: [2,5,3,1,4,1]? Actually, the note says: \n  \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nSo the array must be: [2,5,3,1,4,1] -> \n  Alice: [2,5,3] = 10? -> wait, 2+5+3=10, but the example says 7? \n  Actually, the example says: \"the first three candies from the left\" with total weight 7? \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \n  \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nSo the array must be: [1,1,1,1,1,1]? -> that would be 3 and 3, but 3=3. But then total weight 3, not 7.\n\nAlternatively, the array: [3,1,4,1,5,9] -> \n  Alice: [3,1,4] = 8, Bob: [9,5,1] = 15 -> not 7.\n\nWait, the example says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" meaning the last three? \n  But the array: [2,5,3,1,4,1] -> \n      Alice: [2,5,3] = 10, Bob: [1,4,1] = 6 -> not 7.\n\nActually, the example in the note for the fourth test case: \n  \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\nSo the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? -> but then the middle is 5? and they skip the 5? \n\nBut the problem says: \n  Alice can eat any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right (in a row). They cannot skip. So if Alice eats [7,3,20] then the next candy is 5, which she hasn't eaten. Then Bob starts from the right: [1,11,8,10] -> but that is 1+11+8+10=30. And Alice: 7+3+20=30. So the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So Bob must eat the last four: [1,11,8,10] in the order from right to left: first 1, then 11, then 8, then 10? But the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the last four are 1,11,8,10? Actually, the array is given from left to right: \n  index0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:10, index5:8, index6:11, index7:1.\n\nSo Bob eats from the right: first the last (index7:1), then index6:11, then index5:8, then index4:10. So the candies Bob eats are [10,8,11,1] in the order of the array? Actually, when we list the candies Bob eats in the order from left to right, it would be [10,8,11,1]? But that is the order from the array? Actually, the array is from left to right. Bob eats from the rightmost moving left. So the candies Bob eats, if we list from left to right, would be [10,8,11,1]? But that is the order in the array: index4, index5, index6, index7? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning contiguous at the right? Actually, the problem says: \"from the right\" and \"he can't skip\", meaning he must take a contiguous segment from the right? \n\nBut the example: Bob eats [10,8,11,1] which are the last four. So contiguous at the right.\n\nSo the array is: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] and Alice takes [7,3,20] (the first three) and Bob takes [10,8,11,1] (the last four). The middle 5 is left.\n\nSo the algorithm: \n  We are using two pointers: \n      a: the last index Alice has taken (initially -1, meaning none)\n      b: the first index from the right that Bob has taken (initially n, meaning none)\n\n  We have three states:\n      if suma > sumb: then we add one more from Bob (right pointer moves left: b--, and we add arr[b] to sumb, and cur++ because one candy added)\n      if suma < sumb: then we add one more from Alice (left pointer moves right: a++, and we add arr[a] to suma, and cur++)\n      if equal: then we record the current total (ans = cur) and then we take one from the left and one from the right? Why? Because we are trying to extend the sequence? \n\n  But note: when we are in an equal state, we have a chance to extend: we take one more from the left and one more from the right. Then we continue. \n\n  However, we must break when a>=b? Actually, when we take one from the left and one from the right, we do:\n        a += 1 -> now a becomes the next left\n        b -= 1 -> now b becomes the next right\n        then we add arr[a] to suma and arr[b] to sumb, and cur += 2.\n\n  But what if after this the sums become equal again? Then we update ans again? \n\n  Actually, the problem wants the maximum total candies. So we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence that ends with the same sum? \n\n  Example: [1,1] \n      Initially: a=-1, b=2, suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0 -> equal? then we do: \n          a becomes 0, b becomes 1, suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2 -> then we set ans=2? \n          Then we try to extend: a becomes 1? but then a=1 and b=1 -> break? \n          Then we print ans=2.\n\n  Example: [1,2,2,1]\n      Initially: a=-1, b=4, suma=0, sumb=0 -> equal: so we set ans=0? then we take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2 -> then we set ans=2? \n      Then we continue: \n          Now we have a=0, b=3, and we are in the loop: \n          Check: suma=1, sumb=1 -> equal -> so we set ans=2 (but then we update to the current cur? actually we set ans=cur which is 2, then we take two more: \n          a becomes 1, b becomes 2: \n          suma = 1+2=3, sumb=1+2=3, cur=4 -> then we set ans=4? \n          Then we try to extend: a becomes 2, b becomes 1 -> a>=b? break. \n          Then we print 4.\n\n  But what if we have [1,2,3,6]? \n      We want: Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [6] = 6 -> not equal. \n      Alternatively: Alice: [1] = 1, Bob: [6] = 6 -> not equal.\n      Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3,6] = 9 -> not equal.\n      Alice: [1,2,3] = 6, Bob: [6] = 6 -> total 4 candies.\n\n  How does the algorithm work for [1,2,3,6]?\n      Start: a=-1, b=4, suma=0, sumb=0 -> equal -> so we set ans=0, then we take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=6, cur=2.\n      Now: suma=1 < sumb=6 -> so we take from the left: a=1, suma=1+2=3, cur=3.\n      Now: suma=3 < sumb=6 -> take from left: a=2, suma=3+3=6, cur=4.\n      Now: suma=6 == sumb=6 -> set ans=4, then take two: a=3, b=2 -> but then a=3 and b=2 -> a>=b -> break? \n      Then print 4.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  But what if we have [1,2,3,4]? \n      Start: a=-1, b=4 -> equal -> set ans=0, then take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=4, cur=2.\n      Then: 1<4 -> take left: a=1, suma=1+2=3, cur=3.\n      Then: 3<4 -> take left: a=2, suma=3+3=6, cur=4 -> now a=2, b=3 -> but we haven't taken the candy at index3 for Bob? Actually, Bob has taken only the candy at index3 (which is 4). \n      Now: 6>4 -> so we take from the right: but wait, the next candy to the left of Bob's current is index2? but we are at a=2 and b=3 -> we can't take index2 for Bob because Alice hasn't taken it? Actually, the candy at index2 is already taken by Alice? \n\n  The algorithm: \n      We have two independent sets: Alice takes from the left and Bob from the right. The candies in the middle are not taken by either until we assign them to one.\n\n  The pointers: \n      a: the last index that Alice has taken (so the next available for Alice is a+1)\n      b: the first index that Bob has taken (so the next available for Bob is b-1)\n\n  The condition a>=b: meaning that the next available for Alice is at least the next available for Bob? Actually, we break when a>=b meaning we have no more candy in the middle? \n\n  In [1,2,3,4]:\n      Initially: a=-1, b=4 -> then we take one from the left (a becomes0) and one from the right (b becomes3) -> now a=0, b=3 -> next available: Alice at index1, Bob at index2.\n      Then we take from the left: a becomes1 -> now a=1, b=3 -> next available: Alice at index2, Bob at index2 -> so we can take index2 for Alice? Then a becomes2 -> now a=2, b=3 -> then we have suma=1+2+3=6, sumb=4 -> then we try to take from the right: but the next available for Bob is index2? but a=2 and b=3: we can take index2 for Bob? But index2 is already taken by Alice? \n\n  Actually, the algorithm does not allow the same candy to be taken twice. The pointers a and b are moving towards the center. The condition a>=b means that the next candy for Alice is at an index that is at or beyond Bob's next candy? \n\n  We break when a>=b: meaning that the next candy for Alice would be at index a+1, but if a+1 >= b, then there is no candy for Alice? Similarly, for Bob: the next candy is at b-1, and if a>=b-1, then there is no candy for Bob? \n\n  Actually, the condition in the loop: \n        while True:\n            if a>=b: break\n\n  After the first move: a=0, b=3 -> a=0, b=3 -> a<b -> continue.\n  Then we take from the left: a becomes1 -> now a=1, b=3 -> 1<3 -> continue.\n  Then we take from the left: a becomes2 -> now a=2, b=3 -> 2<3 -> continue.\n  Then we have suma=6, sumb=4 -> so we take from the right: \n        b becomes2 -> now b=2, and we add arr[2] (which is 3) to sumb -> now sumb=4+3=7, cur=5.\n        Then we check: a=2, b=2 -> a>=b? yes -> break.\n\n  Then we print ans? But when was the last time we set ans? It was set to 0 initially and then we never set it again? \n\n  So we must set ans only when we have an equal state? \n\n  In [1,2,3,4]: \n      We never have an equal state after the initial? \n\n  But the answer should be 0? because there is no way to have the same total? \n\n  However, the problem says: they can choose to eat zero candies? Then the total is 0. But the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". \n\n  The note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" -> meaning they eat zero candies? \n\n  So the algorithm: \n      We start with 0 candies and 0 weight -> which is equal. So we set ans=0? \n      Then we take two? and then we break? \n\n  But the problem: they can choose to eat zero? but they can also choose to eat some? \n\n  The algorithm: \n      We start with 0, which is equal -> so we set ans=0 (and then we take two: the first and last). Then we continue until we break.\n\n      Then at the end we print ans.\n\n  So in [1,2,3,4]: \n      We start: ans=0, then we take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=4 -> then we take from the left until we get to a=2, then we take from the right to b=2 -> then we break. \n      Then we print ans=0? \n\n  But that is not correct because we had an equal state at 0? \n\n  However, the problem says: they want to eat the same total weight. The state of eating 0 candies is valid? \n\n  But the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". So we are looking for the maximum total candies. The state of 0 candies gives 0, but we found a state of 4 candies? but that state was not equal? \n\n  So the algorithm only records the state when the two sums are equal? \n\n  Therefore, the answer for [1,2,3,4] is 0? \n\n  But wait, what if we have: \n      Alice: [1,2] = 3, Bob: [3] = 3 -> total candies=3? \n      How do we get that? \n\n  The algorithm: \n      Start: a=-1, b=4 -> equal (0==0) -> set ans=0, then take two: a=0, b=3 -> suma=1, sumb=4 -> cur=2.\n      Then: 1<4 -> take from left: a=1, suma=1+2=3, cur=3.\n      Then: 3<4 -> take from left: a=2, suma=3+3=6, cur=4 -> then we break? because we cannot take from the left? \n      Then we have not encountered an equal state? \n\n  But we had an equal state at a=1 and b=3: \n        Alice: [1,2] -> a=1 (the last taken is index1)\n        Bob: [4] -> b=3 (the last taken is index3)\n        Then we have suma=3, sumb=4 -> not equal.\n\n  How do we get the state [1,2] for Alice and [3] for Bob? \n        Alice: [1,2] -> a=1\n        Bob: [3] -> which is at index2? but Bob must take from the right? He can only take contiguous from the right? \n\n  The problem: Bob can only take a contiguous segment from the right. So he cannot skip the candy at index3 (which is 4) and take index2? \n\n  Therefore, Bob must take the entire right segment: he can take any contiguous segment from the right? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So he must take the rightmost candy first, then the next, etc. He cannot skip the candy at index3 to take index2? \n\n  Therefore, the state [1,2] for Alice and [3] for Bob is not allowed because Bob must take the candy at index3 (the rightmost) first? \n\n  So Bob must take the entire right segment? \n\n  Then the only possibility for Bob is to take a contiguous segment from the right. Similarly, Alice takes a contiguous segment from the left. \n\n  Therefore, the candies they eat are: \n        Alice: [0, a] (a contiguous from the left)\n        Bob: [b, n-1] (a contiguous from the right)\n\n  And the two segments must not overlap: so a < b.\n\n  Then the algorithm we have is: \n        We are effectively simulating: \n          We start with Alice taking nothing and Bob taking nothing -> valid (0,0) -> record 0.\n          Then we try to extend: we take one from the left and one from the right? \n          Then we have two candies: one at the left and one at the right.\n\n          Then we adjust: if Alice's total is less, we give her the next left; if Bob's total is less, we give him the next right; if equal, we record the current total and then take one more from each side.\n\n  This is a two-pointer method that moves from the ends and tries to balance the sums.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the `suma < sumb` branch is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious that a+1 might be beyond the array? Actually, we break when a>=b, so we are safe.\n\n  However, what if a+1 == b? Then we are about to take the last candy in the middle? \n        Example: [1,1] -> \n            Initially: a=-1, b=2 -> then we are in the equal state (0==0) -> set ans=0, then we take two: a=0, b=1 -> suma=1, sumb=1 -> then we set ans=2? \n            Then we try to extend: a becomes 1? and b becomes 0 -> then a>=b -> break.\n\n        So we set ans=2 and then break.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nFor program2.py:\n  We are to complete the condition for division 2.\n\n  The divisions:\n      Division 1: rating >= 1900\n      Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n      Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n      Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n  The code already has:\n      if 1900<= b:\n          d = 1\n      elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n          d = 3\n      elif b <= 1399:\n          d = 4\n\n  We need to set d=2 for the division 2.\n\n  So the missing code is:\n\n        d = 2\n\n  But note: the condition is already written: 1600<=b<=1899, so we just set d=2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        d = 2\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program1.py: the current code has 8 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nSo we use the same indentation: 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the `elif`). The `elif` is at the same level as the `if` and `else`. The `if` and `elif` and `else` are at the same level.\n\nThe code for the `suma>sumb` branch is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nSo for the `suma < sumb` branch, we do:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is written without extra indentation? Actually, it is:\n\n    elif suma>sumb:\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nSo we write:\n\n    elif suma<sumb:\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program1, we output the three lines for the `suma<sumb` branch.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we output the line \"d = 2\" with the same indentation as the other branches.\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2 for the division 1 branch is:\n\n    if 1900<= b:\n        d = 1\n\nSo the indentation is 4 spaces for the inner block. Therefore, for the missing part in program2, we output:\n\n        d = 2\n\nwith 8 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n    elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO line with \"d = 2\", and the indentation level is 8? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent. The for-loop is:\n\nfor x in range(1, a+1):\n    b = int(input())\n    if ...:\n        ...\n    elif ...:\n        ...\n\nSo each condition and the following statement are indented by 4 more. Therefore, the body of the if/elif is indented by 8? Actually, the existing code:\n\n    if 1900<= b:\n        d = 1   # this is indented by 4 (relative to the if) and 8 relative to the for-loop.\n\nBut in the given code, the existing condition for division 3 and 4 are:\n\n    elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n        d = 3\n    elif b <= 1399:\n        d = 4\n\nSo the body is indented by 4 spaces (relative to the elif). Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n        d = 2\n\nwith 4 spaces? Actually, the existing code for the other branches uses 4 spaces for the body. So we use 4 spaces.\n\nBut the code we are given for program2 has:\n\n    elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the comment with:\n\n        d = 2\n\nwith the same indentation as the other branches (which is 4 spaces relative to the `elif`). However, the entire code block is:\n\n    if 1900<= b:\n        d = 1\n    elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n        d = 3\n    elif b <= 1399:\n        d = 4\n\nSo the TODO line is at the same indentation as the other bodies? Actually, the comment is indented by 8? \n\nBut the code we are given for program2 is:\n\nk = 0\na = int(input())\nfor x in range(1, a+1):\n    b = int(input())\n    if 1900<= b:\n        d = 1\n    elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n        d = 3\n    elif b <= 1399:\n        d = 4\n    print('Division', d)\n\nThe body of the for-loop is indented by 4. The if/elif chain is at the same level. The bodies of the if/elif are indented by 4 more (so 8 relative to the for-loop). The TODO comment is at 8 spaces. So we replace the TODO comment with:\n\n        d = 2\n\nwith 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code for d=1, d=3, d=4 are all at 8 spaces. So we use 8 spaces? \n\nBut the code we are to output: we are to output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nTherefore, for program1, the missing code is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nwith the same indentation as the `suma>sumb` branch (which is 8 spaces). \n\nBut note: the existing `suma>sumb` branch in program1 is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nSo we write three lines: each with 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is written as three separate lines, each with 8 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the output for program1 is:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nBut wait, the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nand the indentation is 8 spaces? Actually, the code we are given for program1 has:\n\n    while True:\n        if a>=b: break\n        elif suma>sumb:\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else :\n            ans=cur\n            a+=1\n            b-=1\n            suma+=arr[a]\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=2\n\nThe `if`, `elif`, `else` are at the same level (indented by 4 relative to the while). The bodies of these are indented by 4 more (so 8). \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 should be three lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\nBut the existing `suma>sumb` branch has three lines, each with 8 spaces. So we write:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch uses 8 spaces? Actually, the code we are given uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\nThe structure:\n\ndef solve():\n    ... (4 spaces for the function body)\n    while True:\n        ... (4 more, so 8 in total for the while body)\n        if ...: ... (this is at 8)\n        elif ...: ... (this is at 8) and then the body of the elif is indented by 4 more (so 12)? \n\nBut the code we are given:\n\n        elif suma>sumb:\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n\nThe body of the elif is indented by 4 more (so 8+4=12)? \n\nWait, the code we are given for program1 is:\n\ndef solve():\n    n=read()\n    arr=readline()\n    ans,cur=0,0\n    a,suma=-1,0\n    b,sumb=n,0\n    while True:\n        if a>=b: break\n        elif suma>sumb:\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else :\n            ans=cur\n            a+=1\n            b-=1\n            suma+=arr[a]\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=2\n\nThe while loop body is indented by 4 (relative to the function). The if/elif/else are at the same level (4 more, so 8). The bodies of the if/elif/else are indented by 4 more (so 12). \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 should be three lines, each indented by 12 spaces? \n\nBut the existing `suma>sumb` branch has:\n\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n\nwith 12 spaces? \n\nSo we write:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nwith 12 spaces? \n\nSimilarly, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n        d = 2\n\nwith 8 spaces? Because the for-loop body is 4, and the if/elif body is 4 more (so 8). \n\nBut the existing code for d=1 is:\n\n        d = 1\n\nwith 8 spaces? \n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        d = 2\"\n}\n\nBut note: the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch uses 12 spaces? Actually, the code we are given uses 4 spaces per indent. The function body is 4, the while body is 4 more (so 8), and the body of the elif is 4 more (so 12). \n\nSo the three lines for program1 are each with 12 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2, the for-loop body is 4, and the body of the elif is 4 more (so 8). \n\nBut the existing code in program2 for d=1 is:\n\n        d = 1\n\nwhich is 8 spaces? \n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: three lines with 12 spaces each (the same as the existing branch above)\n  program2: one line with 8 spaces (the same as the other branches)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we output the exact string that would replace the TODO.\n\nIn program1, the TODO is at:\n\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the entire line with the three lines? Actually, we replace the comment line with the three lines? \n\nBut note: the existing `suma>sumb` branch has three lines. So we write three lines. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nBut note: the existing `suma>sumb` branch has three lines, so we write three lines. \n\nSimilarly, for program2, we replace the comment line with:\n\n        d = 2\n\nBut the existing branch for division1 has one line: \"d = 1\", so we write one line.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        d = 2\"\n}\n\nBut note: the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch has no extra spaces at the end? We use the same.\n\nLet me write the exact string for program1: \n  Line1: 12 spaces + \"a += 1\"\n  Line2: 12 spaces + \"suma += arr[a]\"\n  Line3: 12 spaces + \"cur += 1\"\n\nBut the existing code in the `suma>sumb` branch is:\n\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n\nSo we write:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nSimilarly, for program2: 8 spaces + \"d = 2\"\n\nBut the existing code for d=1 is:\n\n        d = 1\n\nSo we write:\n\n        d = 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
