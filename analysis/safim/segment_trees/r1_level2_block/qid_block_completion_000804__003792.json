So for [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> the entire array is eaten: Alice eats the first 3: 3+2+2=7, Bob eats the last 3: 2+2+3=7. How to achieve that? We require: prefix_sum(2) = 3+2+2 = 7, and suffix_sum(3) = 2+2+3 = 7. So the array: \n             A = [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> \n                 prefix_sum(2)=7, and suffix_sum(3) = 2+2+3 = 7.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given multiple test cases. The input starts with t (number of test cases). For each test case, we are given n and a list of n integers.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can process each test case in O(n log n) or similar.\n\n The problem: We have an array A of n integers. We can do operations on an index i (2<=i<=n-1) which:\n   A[i-1] becomes A[i-1] + A[i]\n   A[i+1] becomes A[i+1] + A[i]\n   A[i] becomes -A[i]\n\n We wish to make all the temperatures non-negative, and we want the minimum number of operations.\n\n Important note: The operations can be done in any order and any number of times.\n\n Observation:\n Let's denote the state of the array as a vector. Each operation is a linear transformation. In fact, we can represent the transformation as:\n\n   Operation at index i: \n        v_{i-1} becomes v_{i-1} + v_i\n        v_i becomes -v_i\n        v_{i+1} becomes v_{i+1} + v_i\n\n This is equivalent to multiplying by a matrix. However, note that the operations are reversible and they form a group.\n\n Alternate Insight (known from similar problems, e.g., CodeForces problems like \"Lemper Cooking\"):\n\n We can think of the problem as transforming the array A into an array B such that:\n   B_i = (-1)^(number of operations at i) * (some linear combination of the original A)\n\n Actually, we can derive:\n\n Let x_i be the number of operations (modulo 2) at position i (for i from 2 to n-1). Then the final value at position 1 is:\n   A1 + x2 * A2\n   because: an operation at index 2 will add A2 to A1.\n\n Similarly, the final value at position 2 is:\n   A2 + x2 * (A1 + A3) - x2 * A2? \n\n Actually, we can write the transformation as:\n\n   Let x_i be the number of operations at position i (but note: the operation can be done multiple times? However, note that doing the operation twice at the same index is equivalent to doing nothing: \n        first: \n            A[i-1] becomes A[i-1] + A[i]\n            A[i] becomes -A[i]\n            A[i+1] becomes A[i+1] + A[i]\n        second at the same i:\n            A[i-1] becomes (A[i-1]+A[i]) + (-A[i]) = A[i-1] \n            A[i] becomes -(-A[i]) = A[i]\n            A[i+1] becomes (A[i+1]+A[i]) + (-A[i]) = A[i+1]\n        so indeed two operations at the same index cancel.\n\n Therefore, we can assume x_i is either 0 or 1.\n\n Then the final value at position i is:\n   v_i = A_{i-1} * x_{i-1} + A_i * (1 - 2*x_i) + A_{i+1} * x_{i+1}   ??? \n\n But note the operation at i affects:\n   v_{i-1} = A_{i-1} + A_i * x_i   (if we do an operation at i, then we add A_i to A_{i-1})\n   v_i = -A_i * x_i + ... but also note that operations at i-1 and i+1 also affect i.\n\n Actually, the known solution for this problem (from CodeForces round) is:\n\n   We note that the operations are equivalent to:\n\n        Let x0 = 0, x1, x2, ..., x_{n-1} (for positions 0-indexed) be the number of operations (mod 2) at each position (for positions 1-indexed, the operations are at indices 2 to n-1, so in 0-indexed: indices 1 to n-2).\n\n        Then the final value at index 0 (first element) is:\n            v0 = A0 + x1 * A1\n\n        At index 1 (second element) is:\n            v1 = A1 + x0 * A0 + x2 * A2   but note x0 is not defined? Actually, we don't have an operation at index0 (which would be position 1, but the operations start at index1 which is the second stove).\n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n        v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} * A_{i-1} - 2 * x_i * A_i + x_{i+1} * A_{i+1}   ??? \n\n        This is not linear because of the term -2*x_i*A_i? \n\n Alternatively, we can write the transformation as:\n\n        v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} * A_i + x_{i+1} * A_i - x_i * A_i   ??? \n\n        Actually, note that when we do an operation at i, we add A_i to A_{i-1} and to A_{i+1}, and set A_i to -A_i. But then if we do an operation at i-1, that operation will add A_{i-1} (which now includes the effect of the operation at i) to A_{i-2} and to A_i. So the effect on A_i is cumulative.\n\n This becomes complex.\n\n Known solution from CodeForces (problem name: Lemper) is:\n\n   We note that the operations can be thought of as:\n\n        Let x_i be the number of operations (mod 2) at position i (for i from 1 to n-2, 0-indexed).\n\n        Then the final value at position i is:\n\n            v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} - 2*x_i + x_{i+1}   ??? \n\n        But wait, that doesn't look right.\n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n        v_0 = A_0 + x_1 * A_1\n        v_1 = A_1 + x_0 * A_0 + x_2 * A_2   -> but x_0 is not allowed (operation at index0? not allowed because operations only from index1 to n-2)\n\n        So for i=0: v0 = A0 + x1 * A1\n        for i=1: v1 = A1 + x0 * A0 + x2 * A2 -> but x0 is not defined? Actually, we don't have an operation at index0 (which would be the first element, but the first element is at index0 and we cannot operate on it because operations require at least one left and one right).\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} * A_i   for the left neighbor? \n\n        But note: an operation at index i (0-indexed) will:\n          add A_i to A_{i-1} and to A_{i+1}, and set A_i to -A_i.\n\n        So the effect on A_i is: \n          It gets subtracted when we do an operation at i (so -A_i) and then it gets added the operations from the left neighbor (if we do an operation at i-1, then we add A_{i-1} to A_i, but note that A_{i-1} might have been altered) and similarly from the right neighbor (if we do an operation at i+1, then we add A_{i+1} to A_i, but again altered).\n\n        This is a linear system? \n\n        We can write:\n\n          v = M * x + A   ??? \n\n        However, note that the operations are not independent in a linear way? \n\n Known solution from CodeForces contests:\n\n   We can reframe the problem: \n\n        Let d_0 = A_0, d_1 = A_1, ... , d_{n-1}=A_{n-1}.\n\n        After operations, we want:\n\n          v_i >= 0 for all i.\n\n        And we have:\n\n          v_0 = d_0 + d_1 * x_1\n          v_1 = d_1 + d_0 * x_1 + d_2 * x_2   -> wait, but note: an operation at index1 (0-indexed) adds d1 to d0 and to d2, and sets d1 to -d1. Then an operation at index2 (0-indexed) would add d2 (which now is d2 + x1*d1) to d1 and to d3? \n\n        This becomes messy.\n\n Alternate Insight (from known AC solutions for \"Lemper\"):\n\n   We note that the operations are reversible and the entire process can be transformed into a problem about prefix sums.\n\n   Let P be the prefix sum: P0 = 0, P1 = A0, P2 = A0+A1, ... , P_n = total sum.\n\n   Then, after operations, the condition that the total sum is preserved? Actually, note:\n\n        Operation at i: \n          Before: ... , a, b, c, ... \n          After: ... , a+b, -b, b+c, ...\n\n          The total sum: a+b - b + b+c = a+b+c -> same as before.\n\n        So the total sum is invariant.\n\n        Therefore, if the total sum is negative, it's impossible? But note: we require non-negative for each stove. However, the total sum might be nonnegative but we might still have negative stoves? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"they want to eat the same total weight of candies\". This means that the total weight eaten by Alice and Bob must be equal. But note: the entire set of candies is being eaten? Actually, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy. So the candies are partitioned: Alice eats a prefix and Bob eats a suffix, and the middle is not eaten? \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right (in a row)\". And they cannot eat a candy that the other ate. So the entire set of candies is partitioned into three parts: \n          - a prefix (eaten by Alice)\n          - a suffix (eaten by Bob)\n          - and the middle (uneaten)\n\n        However, the operations are done on the entire array? And then after the operations, we require that every candy is non-negative? And then we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want to maximize the sum of the lengths of the prefix and the suffix.\n\n        How do the operations relate to the uneaten part?\n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". And the operations are done on the entire array (including the candies that will be eaten). But note: after the operations, we require non-negative for every candy, even the uneaten ones? \n\n        Yes, the problem says: \"the temperatures of all stoves at non-negative values\". So every candy must be non-negative.\n\n        How to solve:\n\n          Step 1: Check if it is possible.\n\n          Since the total sum is invariant, and note that the entire array must be non-negative, the total sum must be non-negative. But also, we have constraints on the operations.\n\n          Known solution from CodeForces (from AC submissions for problem \"Lemper\"):\n\n            We can use a greedy / two pointers:\n\n            Let:\n                total = sum(A)\n            We want to choose a prefix [0, i] and a suffix [j, n-1] (with i<j) such that:\n                prefix_sum(i) = suffix_sum(j)   (the sum of the prefix and the suffix must be equal, because they eat the same total weight)\n                and the middle part [i+1, j-1] can be transformed to be non-negative by operations.\n\n            And we want to maximize (i+1) + (n - j) = i + n - j + 1.\n\n            How to check if the middle part can be made non-negative?\n\n            The known solution: \n\n                We can use a greedy from the ends? \n\n            Actually, there is a known solution that uses a Fenwick tree or segment tree to count inversions? But note the note in the example: \n\n                For the fourth example: \n                    A = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 9, 2] \n                    -> Alice eats [7,3,20] (sum=30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> wait, the example output says: \n                        Alice: [7,3,20] -> sum=30\n                        Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> but wait, the array is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,9,2] and the suffix of 4 candies: [9,2] is only 11? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n            How does [10,8,11,1] come from the suffix? The last four are: 15,1,11,9,2 -> the last four: 11,9,2? \n\n            Let me check the example: \n                Input: \n                    n=9, A = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 9, 2]\n\n                The example says: Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30? 10+8+11+1 = 30.\n\n            How do we get Bob's part? The suffix: the last 4: 9,2 -> that's 11, but that's not 30. \n\n            Actually, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" in the second example? \n\n            Let me re-read the problem: Bob eats from the right. So Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right. In the fourth example, Bob eats the last 4 candies? But the last four are: 15,1,11,9,2 -> wait, the array has 9 elements: \n                index0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:15, index5:1, index6:11, index7:9, index8:2.\n\n            How can Bob eat [10,8,11,1]? \n\n            This suggests that the operations have changed the array. \n\n            After operations, the array becomes such that the last four are [10,8,11,1]? \n\n            How? \n\n            We are told that the operations are:\n\n                Operation at index i (2<=i<=n-1) meaning 1-indexed. So 0-indexed: i from 1 to n-2.\n\n            The example does not specify the operations, but we know the answer is 7 (so they eat 7 candies: 3 by Alice and 4 by Bob).\n\n            Therefore, the middle part (uneaten) is from index3 to index5: [5,15,1] -> but then how do we get Bob's part to be 10,8,11,1? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: after the operations, the entire array must be non-negative. And then Alice eats a prefix and Bob eats a suffix. \n\n            So the array after operations must be: \n                [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 9, 2] -> but then Bob eats the last 4: 15,1,11,9,2 -> that's 5 elements? \n\n            The example says Bob eats 4 candies: [10,8,11,1] -> which sum to 30. \n\n            This suggests that the array after operations is:\n\n                [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1, 9, 2]? \n\n            Then Alice eats the first three: 7,3,20 -> 30, Bob eats the last four: 1,9,2 -> that's 12? \n\n            Or maybe the array after operations is:\n\n                [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1] and then the last two are not eaten? But the problem says the entire array must be non-negative, and then we choose a prefix and a suffix. The uneaten part must be non-negative too.\n\n            Actually, the problem does not require the uneaten part to be eaten? It only requires that every candy (whether eaten or not) is non-negative.\n\n            And the goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n            So in the fourth example, they eat 7 candies: Alice eats 3 and Bob eats 4. The entire array has 9 candies, so 2 are left uneaten. The array after operations must have the last four as [10,8,11,1]? But then the suffix of 4 candies is 10,8,11,1? \n\n            How can the last four be 10,8,11,1? The original last four are 15,1,11,9,2 -> we have 5 elements. \n\n            I see: the example says Bob eats the candies with weights [10,8,11,1] -> that is 4 candies. But in the original array, the last four are not 10,8,11,1. So the operations must have changed the values.\n\n            Therefore, we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily to make the entire array non-negative, and then we choose a prefix and a suffix (which are contiguous) to eat. The sum of the prefix must equal the sum of the suffix.\n\n            And we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n            How to solve:\n\n              Step 1: We must assign to each index i (from 1 to n-2, 0-indexed) an operation count x_i in {0,1} such that the entire array becomes non-negative.\n\n              Step 2: Then we choose an index i (for the prefix: [0, i]) and an index j (for the suffix: [j, n-1]) such that i<j and the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix.\n\n              Step 3: We wish to maximize (i+1) + (n - j).\n\n            But note: the operations affect the entire array, so the values in the prefix and suffix are changed by the operations. Therefore, the sum of the prefix is not just the original prefix sum? \n\n            How to compute the final value at each index? \n\n            We can derive:\n\n                Let x_i be the number of operations (0 or 1) at position i (0-indexed, for i in [1, n-2]).\n\n                Then the final value at index i is:\n\n                  v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} * A_{i-1} - 2 * x_i * A_i + x_{i+1} * A_{i+1}   ??? \n\n                But wait, consider:\n\n                  Operation at i: \n                    v_i becomes -A_i.\n                    Also, an operation at i-1 adds A_{i-1} to v_i? But note: if we do an operation at i-1, then we add the original A_{i-1}? or the modified one? \n\n                Actually, the operations are done in any order? And they are linear? \n\n                We can write the system as:\n\n                  v = (I + M) * A\n\n                where M is a matrix with:\n\n                  M[i-1, i] = x_i   (because operation at i adds A_i to A_{i-1})\n                  M[i+1, i] = x_i   (adds A_i to A_{i+1})\n                  M[i, i] = -2*x_i   (because: A_i becomes -A_i, which is A_i - 2*A_i, and also we get additions from operations at i-1 and i+1? but note: the operation at i-1 adds to A_i the value of A_{i-1} (which might have been altered) -> so it's not linear in the original A? \n\n            This is very complex.\n\n        Known solution from CodeForces (AC code for \"Lemper\"):\n\n            We can use dynamic programming? \n\n            But note: the constraints: n up to 200000, and total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n            There is a known solution that uses a greedy and two pointers:\n\n                Let S = total sum.\n\n                We want to find the maximum k such that we can have a prefix of length i and a suffix of length j (with i+j <= n) and the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and the middle part (if any) can be made non-negative by operations.\n\n                And note: the operations can be used to adjust the middle part arbitrarily? \n\n            Actually, the operations are only allowed on the middle part? because the prefix and suffix are eaten, so we don't care about their values? But the problem says: \"the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values\". So we must make the entire array non-negative, including the prefix and suffix? \n\n            However, note: after the operations, we then choose the prefix and suffix to eat. So the operations are done first, then we see the entire array is non-negative, then we choose the prefix and suffix.\n\n            But the problem does not require the eaten candies to be non-negative? It says \"the temperatures of all stoves\" meaning the entire array must be non-negative at the moment after the operations and before the eating.\n\n            Therefore, the prefix and suffix must be non-negative too.\n\n            How to make the entire array non-negative? \n\n            There is a known necessary condition: the total sum must be non-negative? but not sufficient.\n\n            Also, we know that the operations preserve the total sum.\n\n            Insight: \n\n                The problem is equivalent to: \n\n                  We wish to assign to each index i (from 1 to n-2) a value x_i in {0,1} such that:\n\n                    v_i = A_i + x_{i-1} * A_{i-1} - 2*x_i * A_i + x_{i+1} * A_{i+1}   ??? \n\n                But wait, let's try small:\n\n                  n=3: \n                    indices: 0,1,2.\n                    We can only operate on index1.\n\n                    Operation at 1: \n                      v0 = A0 + A1\n                      v1 = -A1\n                      v2 = A2 + A1\n\n                    We require v0>=0, v1>=0, v2>=0.\n\n                    So: A0+A1>=0, -A1>=0 => A1<=0, and A2+A1>=0.\n\n                How about n=4:\n\n                  Operation at index1 (0-indexed) and index2.\n\n                  Without operations: \n                    v0 = A0\n                    v1 = A1\n                    v2 = A2\n                    v3 = A3\n\n                  Operation at index1:\n                    v0 = A0+A1\n                    v1 = -A1\n                    v2 = A2+A1\n                    v3 = A3\n\n                  Then operation at index2:\n                    v0 = A0+A1\n                    v1 = -A1 + A2+A1 = A2   [because operation at index2 adds the current value at index2 (which is A2+A1) to index1 and to index3]\n                    v2 = -(A2+A1)\n                    v3 = A3 + (A2+A1)\n\n                  But wait, the operation at index2 after the first operation: \n                    Before: [A0+A1, -A1, A2+A1, A3]\n                    Operation at index2 (which is the third element? index2 is the third element? no: indices:0,1,2,3 -> operation at index2 (0-indexed) is the third element? but the condition requires 2<=i<=n-1 -> in 0-indexed: i from 1 to n-2, so for n=4, we can operate at index1 and index2.\n\n                    Operation at index2 (0-indexed index2, which is the third element, value=A2+A1) does:\n                      index1 (which is the second element) becomes: (-A1) + (A2+A1) = A2\n                      index2 becomes: -(A2+A1)\n                      index3 becomes: A3 + (A2+A1)\n\n                  So the final array: [A0+A1, A2, -(A2+A1), A3+A2+A1]\n\n                  We require non-negative: \n                    A0+A1>=0, A2>=0, -(A2+A1)>=0 -> A2+A1<=0, and A3+A2+A1>=0.\n\n            This is very complex.\n\n        There is a known solution that uses a greedy from the ends and a segment tree for counting inversions? \n\n        Actually, the sample code provided in the problem is:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                # ... and then a function process(A)\n\n            And the process function uses a segment tree and does:\n\n                A1 = []\n                curr = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    curr += A[i]\n                    A1.append([curr, i])\n\n                if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]:\n                    print(\"-1\")\n                    return\n\n                ... then it sorts A1 and builds a segment tree and counts something.\n\n        What is this doing?\n\n          It is computing the prefix sums. Then it checks:\n            - if any prefix sum is negative -> then it's impossible?\n            - and if the maximum prefix sum is not the last prefix sum (which is the total sum) -> then it's impossible?\n\n          Why? \n\n          This is reminiscent of the problem: \"Non-negative Prefix Sums\". But note the operations in our problem are not the typical prefix sum problem.\n\n        However, note the example: \n\n            The first test case: n=2, A=[-1,1] -> then prefix sums: [-1,0]. \n                min(A1)[0] = -1 -> so output -1.\n\n            But the sample input: \n                t=?\n                The first example: \n                    Input: \n                        7\n                        2 -2 1 4 2 -2 9\n\n                How about the prefix sums: \n                    [2, 0, 1, 5, 7, 5, 14]\n\n                min = 0, max=14, and last=14 -> so it passes.\n\n            The second example: \n                n=5, [1,2,3,4,5] -> prefix sums: [1,3,6,10,15] -> min=1, max=15, last=15 -> passes.\n\n            The third example: \n                n=3, [-1,-1,-1] -> prefix sums: [-1,-2,-3] -> min=-3 -> output -1.\n\n            The fourth example: \n                [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,9,2] -> prefix sums: \n                  7, 10, 30, 35, 50, 51, 62, 71, 73 -> min=7, max=73, last=73 -> passes.\n\n          So the condition: \n            if min(prefix)[0] < 0 or max(prefix)[0] != prefix[-1] then output -1.\n\n          Why is that? \n\n          This is the condition for the array to be made non-negative by a series of operations? \n\n          But note: the problem says the entire array must be non-negative. And the operations preserve the total sum. \n\n          However, there is a known result: the array can be made non-negative by these operations if and only if every prefix sum is non-negative and the total sum is non-negative? \n\n          But wait: in the first example: \n                A = [2,-2,1,4,2,-2,9] -> prefix sums: [2,0,1,5,7,5,14] -> non-negative and total=14>=0 -> so it's possible.\n\n          Why is that? \n\n          Consider: \n\n            We can simulate the operations in reverse. In reverse, an operation at index i (0-indexed) would be:\n\n                We have an array v, and we can choose an index i (from 1 to n-2) such that:\n\n                    v_{i-1} = v_{i-1} - v_i\n                    v_{i+1} = v_{i+1} - v_i\n                    v_i = -v_i\n\n                But note: the forward operation: \n                    (a, b, c) -> (a+b, -b, b+c)\n\n                Reverse: \n                    We have (a+b, -b, b+c) and we want to recover (a,b,c):\n\n                    Let x = -b -> then b = -x.\n                    Then a = (a+b) - b = (a+b) - (-x) = (a+b)+x -> but we don't know x? \n\n                Alternatively, we can think of the reverse operation:\n\n                    Operation at i in reverse: \n                        We require that the current array v has the property that v_i is negative? and then we do:\n\n                            v_{i-1} = v_{i-1} - v_i\n                            v_{i+1} = v_{i+1} - v_i\n                            v_i = -v_i\n\n                But note: the forward operation preserves the total sum, and the reverse does too.\n\n          There is a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces 727E) that uses the prefix sum condition.\n\n          In fact, the condition that all prefix sums are non-negative and the total sum is non-negative is necessary and sufficient for the array to be made non-negative? \n\n          Why? \n\n          We can use a greedy: \n\n            Start from the left. We want to make the first element non-negative. But the first element can only be changed by an operation at index1 (0-indexed index1). \n\n          However, note the prefix sum condition: \n\n            Let P0 = 0, P1 = A0, P2 = A0+A1, ... , P_n = total.\n\n          The known solution in the code then does:\n\n            A1 = sorted by the prefix sum, but then it does:\n\n                A1.sort()\n                A1 = [[i, A1[i][1]] for i in range(n)]   -> this is creating a list of [rank, original index] for the prefix sums?\n\n            Then it sorts by the original index? \n\n            Then it builds a segment tree of zeros of length n, and then for each element in the order of increasing index (but wait, the loop is: for x, i in A1: ... and A1 is sorted by the original index? because after the second sort: key=lambda a:a[1] -> so by the original index)\n\n            Then:\n\n                for x, i in A1:   # but note: in the code, the list A1 is built as: for each i, [curr, i] then sorted, then reassigned to [rank, original index] and then sorted by the original index.\n\n                Actually, the code:\n\n                    A1 = []\n                    curr = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        curr += A[i]\n                        A1.append([curr, i])\n\n                    if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]:\n                        print(\"-1\")\n                        return\n\n                    A1.sort()   # sorts by the prefix sum, then by the index (if same sum, by index)\n                    A1 = [[i, A1[i][1]] for i in range(n)]   # now each element is [rank, original index] where rank is the order of the prefix sum (if we sort by the prefix sum, then the smallest prefix sum gets rank0, next rank1, ...)\n                    A1.sort(key=lambda a:a[1])   # now sort by the original index: so we get an array of [rank, original index] for each index in the original order.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    S = SegmentTree(data=[0 for i in range(n)])\n                    answer = 0\n                    for x, i in A1:   # x is the rank of the prefix sum at index i? \n                        answer += S.query(x+1, n)\n                        S[x] = 1\n\n                Then print(answer)\n\n          What is this doing? \n\n            It is counting the number of inversions in the array of ranks? \n\n            Specifically, it is counting the number of pairs (i, j) with i<j and the rank of the prefix at i is greater than the rank of the prefix at j? \n\n            But note: we are iterating by the original index i (because A1 is sorted by the original index). For each index i, we get the rank x of the prefix sum at i. Then we do:\n\n                answer += S.query(x+1, n)   -> which is the number of indices j (that we have seen so far) that have a rank greater than x? \n\n            Then we set S[x]=1.\n\n            This is counting the number of inversions in the sequence of ranks? \n\n          Why would the answer be the number of inversions? \n\n          And what is the answer for the first example? \n\n            Example: n=7, A=[2,-2,1,4,2,-2,9]\n\n            Prefix sums: [2,0,1,5,7,5,14]\n\n            Sort the prefix sums: [0,1,2,5,5,7,14] -> then assign ranks:\n\n                prefix[0]=2 -> rank = 2\n                prefix[1]=0 -> rank = 0\n                prefix[2]=1 -> rank = 1\n                prefix[3]=5 -> rank = 3 (or 4? because there are two 5's: the first 5 is at index3, then at index5 we have 5 again)\n\n            How are duplicates handled? \n\n                When we sort: \n                    [0,1,2,5,5,7,14] -> \n                    index0: value=0 -> rank0\n                    index1: value=1 -> rank1\n                    index2: value=2 -> rank2\n                    index3: value=5 -> rank3\n                    index4: value=5 -> rank4\n                    index5: value=7 -> rank5\n                    index6: value=14 -> rank6\n\n                Then we create A1: \n                    For index0: [2,0] -> becomes [rank2, 0] -> then when we sort by the original index, we get for index0: [2,0] -> so x=2, i=0.\n                    index1: [0,1] -> becomes [0,1] -> x=0, i=1.\n                    index2: [1,2] -> becomes [1,2] -> x=1, i=2.\n                    index3: [5,3] -> becomes [3,3] -> x=3, i=3.\n                    index4: [7,4] -> becomes [5,4] -> x=5, i=4.\n                    index5: [5,5] -> becomes [4,5] -> x=4, i=5.\n                    index6: [14,6] -> becomes [6,6] -> x=6, i=6.\n\n                Now we iterate by i from 0 to 6:\n\n                    i=0: x=2 -> query from 3 to 6 (x+1=3 to n-1=6) -> currently no 1's -> add 0. Then set S[2]=1.\n                    i=1: x=0 -> query from 1 to 6: currently we have S[2]=1 -> so we get 1.

Then set S[6]=1.\n\n                Total answer = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0 = 3.\n\n            But the sample output for the first test case is 4 operations? \n\n            And the sample input had 7 stoves, and the answer was 4.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"output the maximum number of candies eaten\", not the number of operations.\n\n            But wait, the problem asks: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\", and the example says 2, 6, 0, 7.\n\n            The code we are given is printing \"answer\" which we computed as 3 for the first test case? \n\n            But the first test case should output 2? \n\n            This suggests that the provided code is not for the same problem.\n\n        Let me re-read the problem: \n\n            \"Output: For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\"\n\n        The provided code is printing \"answer\" and for the first test case we computed 3, but the expected answer is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is not complete? \n\n        The problem says: \"Complete the code in program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the code we see in program1.py is:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())): \n                n = int(input())\n                A = list of n integers\n\n                ... and then it calls process(A)\n\n            And the process function does:\n\n                A1 = []\n                curr = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    curr += A[i]\n                    A1.append([curr, i])\n\n                if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]:\n                    print(\"-1\")\n                    return\n\n                A1.sort()\n                A1 = [[i, A1[i][1]] for i in range(n)]\n                A1.sort(key=lambda a:a[1])\n\n                S = SegmentTree(data=[0 for i in range(n)])\n                answer = 0\n                for x, i in A1:\n                    answer += S.query(x+1, n)\n                    S[x] = 1\n\n                print(answer)\n\n        This does not match the sample output.\n\n        What is the sample output for the first test case? 2.\n\n        How can we get 2? \n\n          The first test case: n=2, A=[-1,1] -> then the condition fails (min prefix is -1) -> output -1. That matches.\n\n          The first example in the note: n=7, A=[2,-2,1,4,2,-2,9] -> the condition passes, then the code outputs 3, but expected total candies eaten is 4? \n\n          But the problem says: the answer for the first example is 2? \n\n          Wait, the problem says: \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\". But the first test case in the input has n=2? \n\n          The problem says: \"The first line contains an integer t\", and then the first test case: n=2, then the array.\n\n          In the note, they say: \"For the first test case\" and then describe n=2? \n\n          But then they give an example with n=7? \n\n          Actually, the note has multiple examples:\n\n            Example 1: n=2, A=[-1,1] -> output -1? but the note says the first test case is: Alice eats one from the left and Bob one from the right -> so n=2, and they eat 2 candies. \n\n          How can that be? \n\n          The first test case in the note: \n              Input: \n                  t=?\n                  n=2\n                  A = [1, -1]   -> but the note says: Alice eats one candy from the left (which is 1) and Bob eats one from the right (which is -1) -> but then the condition is that the total weight eaten is 1 and -1 -> not equal.\n\n          The note says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\n          But how can they eat if the weights are 1 and -1? \n\n          They must first do operations to make the array non-negative. \n\n          For n=2, we cannot do any operation (because the operation requires an index i with 2<=i<=n-1, so i=2 to 1? -> no operation). \n\n          So the array remains [1, -1] -> which has a negative value. Then they cannot eat? \n\n          But the problem says: \"they need to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value\". So if the array has a negative, they cannot eat? \n\n          However, the note says the answer is 2.\n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me read the sample input: \n\n          The first test case: \n              n=2\n              A = [1, -1] -> then we cannot do any operation, and the array has a negative. So we cannot achieve non-negative for all stoves. \n\n          But the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\"\n\n          How can they eat if the stove with -1 is not non-negative? \n\n          The problem says: \"they need to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value\" BEFORE they eat? or AFTER they eat? \n\n          The problem says: \"in order for his lempers to be cooked, he needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value\". \n\n          This suggests that the cooking requires the stove to be non-negative during the cooking. But then they eat the candy. \n\n          However, the operations are done first to make the stoves non-negative, then they eat. \n\n          So for the first test case: \n              We have [1, -1] -> we cannot do any operation -> so we cannot make the second stove non-negative. \n\n          Therefore, it is impossible -> output -1.\n\n          But the note says the answer is 2.\n\n        There is a mistake in the note? \n\n        Let me read the sample input in the note: \n\n          \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\n          and \n\n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n          and \n\n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n          and \n\n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7\"\n\n        The first test case in the note must be: \n            n=2, A = [1, 1] -> then they can eat one from the left and one from the right, and the total weight is 1 and 1 -> equal.\n\n        But then the array is [1,1] -> already non-negative. \n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        The second test case: \n            n=5? -> but the example says they eat 6 candies? \n\n        The example says: \n            \"For the second test case\", and then \"the first three from the left\" and \" the first three from the right\" -> but that would be 3+3=6, and the total candies is 6, so n=6.\n\n        The array for the second test case: \n            We are told that the total weight eaten by Alice is 7, and by Bob is 7, and they eat all candies.\n\n        So the array must have sum 14. \n\n        The example says: \"the first three from the left: [?,?,?] sum to 7, and the first three from the right: [?,?,?] sum to 7\". \n\n        But note: the first three from the left and the first three from the right might overlap? \n\n        The problem says: Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix. They cannot overlap. \n\n        So if they eat 3 from the left and 3 from the right, and the total is 6, then the array has at least 6 candies. \n\n        The example says: \"they cannot eat more since all the candies have been eaten\", so n=6.\n\n        Array: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]\n\n        Alice eats [a0, a1, a2] = 7\n        Bob eats [a3, a4, a5] = 7\n\n        Then the entire array is non-negative? \n\n        But the operations: do we need to do any? \n\n        The array might be already non-negative. \n\n        So the answer is 6.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code in program1.py does not solve the problem as described.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the provided code structure, it is likely that the intended solution is to count the number of ways to choose the prefix and suffix with equal sum and maximize the total number of candies eaten, but only if the array can be made non-negative. \n\n        How to do that? \n\n          We are allowed to do operations to make the array non-negative. The condition for that is: every prefix sum is non-negative and the total sum is non-negative.\n\n          Then, we wish to choose i and j (with i<j) such that:\n\n             prefix_sum(i) = suffix_sum(j)   [where suffix_sum(j) = total_sum - prefix_sum(j-1)]\n\n          and we want to maximize i+1 + (n - j).\n\n          Note: the entire array from 0 to i (prefix) and from j to n-1 (suffix) is eaten. The middle is not eaten.\n\n          But note: the condition for the array to be non-negative by operations is independent of how we choose i and j? \n\n          However, the operations are done first to make the entire array non-negative, and then we choose i and j. \n\n          So if the array can be made non-negative, then we can then choose any i and j such that prefix_sum(i) = suffix_sum(j) and maximize i+1 + n-j.\n\n          How to compute the maximum total candies eaten? \n\n          We want to maximize (i+1) + (n-j) = i - j + n + 1.\n\n          And the condition: prefix_sum(i) = suffix_sum(j) = s, and also note that the middle part is not eaten, so the sum of the middle part is total_sum - 2*s >= 0.\n\n          We can iterate i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, we want to find the largest j>i such that prefix_sum(i) = suffix_sum(j) = s, and then candidate = i+1 + n-j.\n\n          But note: suffix_sum(j) = total_sum - prefix_sum(j-1)   [because prefix_sum(j-1) + (suffix starting at j) = total_sum]\n\n          Actually, the suffix_sum(j) = sum_{k=j}^{n-1} A_k = total_sum - prefix_sum(j-1)   [if we define prefix_sum(j-1) = sum_{k=0}^{j-1} A_k]\n\n          So the condition: prefix_sum(i) = total_sum - prefix_sum(j-1)\n\n          => prefix_sum(j-1) = total_sum - prefix_sum(i)\n\n          Let P[i] = prefix_sum(i) = sum_{k=0}^{i} A_k.\n\n          Then we require: P[j-1] = P[n-1] - P[i]   [because total_sum = P[n-1]]\n\n          And we require j>i+1? because the middle part must be non-empty? not necessarily, but j must be at least i+1.\n\n          We wish to maximize (i+1) + (n-j) = i - j + n + 1.\n\n          For a fixed i, we want to find the smallest j>i such that P[j-1] = P[n-1] - P[i]. Why the smallest j? because we want to minimize j to maximize n-j.\n\n          But note: j must be at least i+1, and j-1>=i, so j>=i+1.\n\n          However, we want to maximize n-j, so we want the smallest j>=i+1 such that P[j-1] = total_sum - P[i].\n\n          But note: there might be multiple j. We want the smallest j>=i+1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate from the right. \n\n          Steps:\n\n            total = P[n-1]\n            We want to find for each i, the value j = the smallest index >= i+1 such that P[j-1] = total - P[i].\n\n            Then candidate = i+1 + n - j.\n\n            And we maximize candidate over i.\n\n          But note: it is possible that there is no j for a given i.\n\n          Also, we must have the array made non-negative by operations, which we already checked: every prefix sum>=0 and total_sum>=0.\n\n          How to do it fast? \n\n            We can precompute for each prefix sum value, the list of indices i such that P[i] = that value.\n\n            Then for each i, we want the smallest j>=i+1 such that j-1 is in the list for value = total - P[i], and j-1>=i.\n\n            But note: j-1>=i, and j = (j-1)+1, so we want an index k = j-1 >= i such that P[k] = total - P[i], and then j = k+1.\n\n            And we want the smallest j, which means the smallest k>=i.\n\n            So for each value, we can have a sorted list of indices. Then for a given i, we do a binary search in the list for value = total - P[i] for the smallest k>=i.\n\n          However, note: the total_sum - P[i] might be negative? but we have total_sum>=0 and P[i]>=0, so total_sum - P[i] could be negative if total_sum < P[i]. But we also have the condition that the array can be made non-negative, and one of the conditions is that the maximum prefix sum is the total_sum? \n\n          In the code we did: \n              if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]: \n                  print(\"-1\")\n                  return\n\n          This ensures that the minimum prefix sum is non-negative and the maximum prefix sum is the total_sum. \n\n          Why does the maximum being the total_sum matter? \n\n          Because if the maximum prefix sum is not the total_sum, then there is a dip at the end? \n\n          Actually, the condition is that the array can be made non-negative by the operations if and only if every prefix sum is non-negative and every suffix sum is non-negative? \n\n          But note: the total_sum is the last prefix sum. And the condition in the code is that the maximum prefix sum is the last prefix sum. This ensures that the array is \"balanced\" in some sense.\n\n          However, we are not using the suffix sum condition explicitly.\n\n          But note: if every prefix sum is non-negative and the total_sum is non-negative, then every suffix sum is also non-negative? \n\n          Suffix sum from i: total_sum - prefix_sum(i-1) >= total_sum - prefix_sum(n-1) + prefix_sum(i-1) ? \n\n          Actually, we only know prefix_sum(i)>=0 for every i, and total_sum>=0. \n\n          But the suffix sum from i: S_i = total_sum - prefix_sum(i-1). We don't have a direct condition on S_i.\n\n          However, the condition in the code is: max_prefix = total_sum. This is not obviously necessary. \n\n          Let me try: \n              A = [1, -1, 2] \n              prefix: [1,0,2] -> min=0, max=2, and total_sum=2 -> but max != last? last=2 -> so it passes? \n              But then the array can be made non-negative? \n                  Operation at index1 (0-indexed index1, which is the second element):\n                      [1+(-1), -(-1), -1+2] = [0,1,1] -> non-negative.\n\n          So the condition in the code is not necessary? \n\n          But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", and the sample condition in the code might be from a different approach.\n\n          Given the complexity, and that the provided code has a segment tree for counting something, it is likely that the intended solution is to count the number of operations needed? \n\n          But the problem asks for the maximum number of candies eaten, not the number of operations.\n\n        I am confused.\n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        In program1.py, there is a TODO in the SegmentTree's query method:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        And in the main part, the code is given.\n\n        In program2.py, we are not given any code.\n\n        But the problem says: \"program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And then: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the output format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        So we are to complete both program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        However, the example input only shows program1.py.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n\n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        But in the input, we only see program1.py.\n\n        This is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\n        The sample output format suggests that we are to output two completions.\n\n        But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        So program1.py outputs something, and program2.py reads from stdin and outputs the answer.\n\n        Therefore, the provided program1.py is not complete, and program2.py is not provided.\n\n        How to solve the problem then? \n\n          We must write the missing part in program1.py and the entire program2.py.\n\n        The missing part in program1.py is in the SegmentTree.query method:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        In the query method of the segment tree, the standard implementation for a segment tree that does range queries is:\n\n            def query(self, start, stop):\n                start += self._size\n                stop += self._size\n\n                res_left = res_right = self._default\n                while start < stop:\n                    if start & 1:\n                        res_left = self._func(res_left, self.data[start])\n                        start += 1\n                    if stop & 1:\n                        stop -= 1\n                        res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n                    start //= 2\n                    stop //= 2\n\n                return self._func(res_left, res_right)\n\n        So the TODO part should be:\n\n            stop -= 1\n            res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n        Because the segment tree is built with the leaves at [size, size+n-1], and the query is for [start, stop) (half-open).\n\n        Then, in the main part, the code for program1.py is given.\n\n        What does program1.py do? \n\n          It reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and the list A.\n\n          Then it calls process(A).\n\n          In process(A):\n\n            It computes the prefix sums in A1: for each index i, [prefix_i, i].\n\n            Then it checks: if the minimum prefix sum is negative or the maximum prefix sum is not the last prefix sum, then output -1.\n\n            Then it sorts A1 by the prefix sum, and then assigns a rank to each prefix sum (based on the sorted order) and then sorts back by the original index.\n\n            Then it initializes a segment tree S of size n with zeros.\n\n            Then for each index i (in the order of the original index), it:\n\n                does: answer += S.query(x+1, n)   # where x is the rank of the prefix sum at index i.\n\n                then sets S[x] = 1.\n\n            Then it prints(answer)\n\n          This is counting the number of inversions in the array of ranks of the prefix sums.\n\n          Why would the number of inversions be the answer for the test case? \n\n          The problem asks for the maximum number of candies eaten.\n\n          In the sample: n=2, A=[1,1] -> \n             prefix sums: [1,2]\n             sorted: [1,2] -> ranks: \n                 index0: value=1 -> rank0\n                 index1: value=2 -> rank1\n             Then A1 sorted by index: [ (0,0), (1,1) ]\n             Then we do:\n                 i=0: x=0 -> query(1,2) = 0 -> then set S[0]=1.\n                 i=1: x=1 -> query(2,2)=0 -> then set S[1]=1.\n             answer=0.\n\n          But the expected answer for [1,1] is 2.\n\n          This does not match.\n\n        Therefore, the provided program1.py is not for the problem of maximizing the number of candies eaten.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem has a known solution using two pointers for the maximum candies eaten, and the condition on prefix sums for the possibility, I think we are to complete program1.py as given and then write program2.py that will transform the output of program1.py into the answer for the test cases.\n\n        What does program1.py output for the sample test cases?\n\n          Example 1: n=2, A=[1,1] -> outputs 0.\n          Example 2: n=6, and the array such that the prefix sums are [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> then the ranks are [0,1,2,3,4,5] -> the inversion count is 0.\n          Example 3: n=3, A=[-1,-1,-1] -> outputs -1.\n          Example 4: the first example in the note: n=7, A=[2,-2,1,4,2,-2,9] -> we computed the inversion count as 3.\n\n        The sample test cases in the problem:\n\n          Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n          Test case 2: n=6, [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> then Alice can eat the first 2 and Bob the last 2: \n                prefix_sum(1)=3+2=5, suffix_sum(4)=2+3=5, and the middle [2,2] can be made non-negative? \n                The array: [3,2,2,2,2,3] is already non-negative.\n                So they eat 2+2=4 candies? \n                But the example in the note for the second test case says answer=6.\n\n          Test case 2 in the note: n=6, and they eat 6 candies.\n\n          So for [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> the entire array is eaten: Alice eats the first 3: 3+2+2=7, Bob eats the last 3: 2+2+3=7.\n\n          How to achieve that? \n             We require: prefix_sum(2) = 3+2+2 = 7, and suffix_sum(3) = 2+2+3 = 7.\n\n          So the array: \n             A = [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> \n                 prefix_sum(2)=7, and suffix_sum(3) = 2+2+3 = 7.\n\n          So the answer for this test case is 6.\n\n          What would program1.py output for this test case?\n\n             prefix sums: \n                0: 3\n                1: 5\n                2: 7\n                3: 9\n                4: 11\n                5: 14\n\n             condition: min=3>=0, and max=14, last=14 -> passes.\n\n             Sort the prefix sums: [3,5,7,9,11,14] -> ranks:\n                0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5.\n\n             Inversion count = 0.\n\n          So program1.py outputs 0.\n\n        Therefore, the output of program1.py is not the answer for the test case.\n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" should output the answer for each test case.\n\n        So program2.py should take the output of program1.py and transform it to the answer.\n\n        What is the output of program1.py for the test cases?\n\n          It outputs either -1 (if the test case is impossible) or a nonnegative integer (the inversion count).\n\n        And we know the expected answers:\n\n          Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> program1.py outputs 0, and the expected answer is 2.\n          Test case 2: n=6, [3,2,2,2,2,3] -> program1.py outputs 0, expected answer is 6.\n          Test case 3: n=3, [-1,-1,-1] -> program1.py outputs -1, expected answer is -1.\n          Test case 4: n=7, [2,-2,1,4,2,-2,9] -> program1.py outputs 3, expected answer is 4 (candies eaten) -> but the note says the answer is 2 for the first test case (which is n=2) and for this n=7 example, the note says the answer is 4 operations? \n\n        But the problem asks for the maximum number of candies eaten, not the number of operations.\n\n        In the note for the n=7 example, the answer is 4 operations, but the number of candies eaten is 7 - 2 = 5? \n\n        Let me read the note for the first example (n=7) in the problem: \n            \"For the first test case\" in the note is n=2, then they describe an example with n=7 and say the answer is 4 (operations), and then they say the answer is 2 (candies eaten) for the first test case (n=2) and 6 for the second test case (n=6) and 0 for the third and 7 for the fourth.\n\n        The fourth example in the note: \n            Alice eats 3 candies, Bob eats 4 candies, total 7.\n\n        So the output for the test cases should be:\n\n            Test case 1: 2\n            Test case 2: 6\n            Test case 3: 0\n            Test case 4: 7\n\n        What does program1.py output for the fourth example?\n\n            We computed the inversion count as 3.\n\n        How to transform the inversion count to the answer? \n\n          For the examples:\n\n            Test case 1: inversion_count=0 -> answer=2\n            Test case 2: inversion_count=0 -> answer=6\n            Test case 3: outputs -1 -> answer=-1\n            Test case 4: inversion_count=3 -> answer=7\n\n          What is the relation? \n\n          In Test case 1: 0 -> 2: 2 = 0 + 2\n          Test case 2: 0 -> 6: 6 = 0 + 6\n          Test case 4: 3 -> 7: 7 = 3 + 4\n\n          But 2, 6, 4 are not related.\n\n        Alternatively, the answer = n - inversion_count?\n\n          Test case 1: 2 - 0 = 2 -> matches.\n          Test case 2: 6 - 0 = 6 -> matches.\n          Test case 4: 7 - 3 = 4 -> but expected 7.\n\n        Or: answer = n + something.\n\n        Another idea: the note says for the fourth example they use 4 operations, and the answer is 7 candies eaten. \n\n        The inversion count in program1.py for the fourth example is 3, which is not 4.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem has a known solution using a segment tree for the number of operations, it is possible that the provided program1.py is for the purpose of \n        computing the number of operations, and then the answer for the test case (number of candies eaten) = n - (number of operations) ? \n\n        In the fourth example: n=9 (because the example has 9 elements) -> 9 - 3 = 6, but expected 7.\n\n        Or: = n - (number of operations) + something.\n\n        The fourth example: 9 - 3 = 6, but expected 7.\n\n        Or: = n - (number of operations) + 1 = 7.\n\n        Test case 1: 2 - 0 + 1 = 3, but expected 2.\n\n        Alternatively, the number of operations might be stored in 'answer' in program1.py, and then program2.py should output n - answer for the test case.\n\n        But in the fourth example: n=9, answer=3, then 9-3=6, not 7.\n\n        What if we output n - answer + 1? \n            Test case 1: 2-0+1=3 -> not 2.\n            Test case 2: 6-0+1=7 -> not 6.\n\n        I am out of ideas.\n\n        Let me try to understand the fourth example with the provided process in program1.py for the array [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,9,2] (n=9) -> \n\n          prefix sums: \n            0:7\n            1:10\n            2:30\n            3:35\n            4:50\n            5:51\n            6:62\n            7:71\n            8:73\n\n          condition: min=7>=0, and max=73, last=73 -> passes.\n\n          Sort the prefix sums: [7,10,30,35,50,51,62,71,73] -> ranks:\n            0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8.\n\n          Inversion count: 0.\n\n          So program1.py outputs 0.\n\n          Then if we do n - 0 = 9, but expected answer is 7.\n\n        Therefore, the provided program1.py and the process function might be for a different purpose.\n\n        Given the time, and the instruction to only complete the TODO in program1.py and write program2.py that will make the entire thing work, and the sample test cases, I will complete the TODO in program1.py as in a standard segment tree and then write program2.py that will output the answer as follows:\n\n          If the output of program1.py for a test case is -1, then output -1.\n          Otherwise, output n - (output of program1.py) for that test case.\n\n        But we saw that for the fourth example, n=9 and output of program1.py=0, then 9-0=9, but expected 7.\n\n        Alternatively, for the fourth example, the output of program1.py should be 2, then 9-2=7.\n\n        How to make program1.py output 2 for the fourth example? \n\n          The fourth example: \n             A = [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,9,2]\n\n          prefix sums: [7,10,30,35,50,51,62,71,73]\n\n          sorted: [7,10,30,35,50,51,62,71,73] -> ranks: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n\n          Then we create the array of ranks by index: \n             index0: rank0\n             index1: rank1\n             index2: rank2\n             index3: rank3\n             index4: rank4\n             index5: rank5\n             index6: rank6\n             index7: rank7\n             index8: rank8\n\n          Then we compute the inversion count in this array of ranks (which is sorted so no inversion) -> 0.\n\n          So it is 0.\n\n        Unless the sorting is not stable? \n\n        The code does:\n\n            A1.sort()   # by the first element (prefix sum) then by the second (index) if tie.\n            then assigns ranks by the index in the sorted array: [0,1,...,n-1]\n\n          This is the standard way to get the rank.\n\n        Then it rebuilds A1 as [rank, original index] and sorts by the original index.\n\n        Then the array of ranks is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] -> no inversion.\n\n        Therefore, the inversion count is 0.\n\n        How to get 2? \n\n        One possibility: the segment tree is for counting the number of operations needed? \n\n        But the process function is named 'process', and it is not described.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem has a known solution using a segment tree for the number of operations in a different way, I think we are to trust the provided code and assume that the inversion count is the number of operations.\n\n        Then the number of candies eaten = n - (number of operations) is not matching.\n\n        Another possibility: the answer = n - (number of operations) + (something else) \n\n        In the first example: n=2, number of operations=0, then 2 - 0 = 2.\n        In the second example: n=6, number of operations=0, then 6 - 0 = 6.\n        In the fourth example: n=9, number of operations=0, then 9 - 0 = 9, but expected 7.\n\n        Unless the fourth example in the note has n=7? \n\n        The fourth example in the note: \n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n        So Alice eats 3, Bob eats 4, total 7.\n\n        So n= the total number of candies = 3 (Alice) + 4 (Bob) + (uneaten) = at least 7. \n\n        The example says: \"There is no better partition\", and the array has 9 elements: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,9,2] -> n=9.\n\n        So there are 2 uneaten.\n\n        Therefore, the number of candies eaten = 7.\n\n        How to get 7 from n=9 and the number of operations=0? \n\n        9 - 2 = 7, so if the number of operations is 0, then the number of uneaten is 2, and eaten = 9 - 2 = 7.\n\n        What is the number of uneaten in general? \n\n          It might be the number of operations? \n\n          In the first example: n=2, operations=0, uneaten=0, eaten=2.\n          In the second example: n=6, operations=0, uneaten=0, eaten=6.\n          In the fourth example: n=9, operations=0, uneaten=2, eaten=7.\n\n        But the number of operations in the fourth example is not 2, it's 4 (according to the note) and in program1.py it's 0.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Given the time, and the instruction to output the missing code, I will:\n\n          Complete program1.py by filling in the TODO in the segment tree.\n\n          Write program2.py that will read the output of program1.py and the input for the test cases to compute the answer.\n\n        How can program2.py know n? \n\n          program1.py outputs for each test case either -1 or a nonnegative integer.\n\n          But program2.py does not have the input.\n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So program2.py will read from stdin what program1.py writes to stdout.\n\n        But program1.py writes for each test case one integer.\n\n        And the input to program1.py is the test cases.\n\n        program2.py does not have access to the input.\n\n        Therefore, program2.py cannot know n.\n\n        This is a dead end.\n\n        I think the intended solution is that the answer for a test case is the number output by program1.py for that test case.\n\n        But then the examples don't match.\n\n        Unless the fourth example in the note is not tested in this way.\n\n        Given the complexity, I will output the completion for program1.py and a dummy program2.py.\n\n        For program1.py, the TODO in the segment tree is:\n\n            stop -= 1\n            res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n        For program2.py, since we don't know how to transform, and the problem is to output the answer for the test cases, and program1.py already outputs -1 for impossible and a number for the inversion count, and the examples don't match, I will assume that program2.py is not needed and the answer is the output of program1.py.\n\n        But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" should output the correct answers.\n\n        So program2.py might be a simple identity program: it reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n        Then the final output would be the output of program1.py, which for the sample test cases is:\n\n          Test case 1: 0\n          Test case 2: 0\n          Test case 3: -1\n          Test case 4: 3\n\n        and the expected answers are 2,6,-1,7.\n\n        This is not identity.\n\n        Another possibility: program2.py knows the input? \n\n        No, because it only reads from stdin the output of program1.py.\n\n        I am out of ideas.\n\n        Given the time, I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py I will output a program that for each test case, if the number is -1, output -1, otherwise output n - number, but then program2.py needs to know n for each test case.\n\n        How can program2.py know n? \n\n          It doesn't.\n\n        Unless program1.py outputs n and the inversion count for each test case.\n\n        The problem does not say that.\n\n        Therefore, I will assume that the provided program1.py is correct for the number of operations, and the number of candies eaten = n - (number of operations) \n        and then for the fourth example: 9 - 3 = 6, but expected 7, so it's not.\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the problem statement or the provided code.\n\n        Since the problem asks for the missing code, I will only complete the TODO in program1.py and for program2.py I will output an empty string.\n\n        But the output format requires a string for program2.\n\n        I will output the TODO for program1.py and for program2.py I will output a program that copies stdin to stdout.\n\n        For program1.py:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                stop -= 1\n                res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n        For program2.py: we output a program that does nothing to the output of program1.py.\n\n        Code for program2.py:\n\n            import sys\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line.strip())\n\n        Then the final output would be the output of program1.py.\n\n        But then the sample test cases will be: 0,0,-1,3 for the examples, which is not the expected answer.\n\n        I think the only safe option is to output the completion for program1.py and leave program2.py as the identity.\n\n        Therefore, I will do that.\n\n        However, the problem says \"runs correctly\", and it will not.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the instructions, I output:\n\n          \"program1\": \"stop -= 1\\n                res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\"\n          \"program2\": \"import sys\\nfor line in sys.stdin:\\n    print(line.strip())\"\n\n        But then the sample test case n=2, [1,1] will output 0, and the expected is 2.\n\n        So it's not correct.\n\n        I notice that in the fourth example in the note, the answer is 7, and the number of operations is 4, and the inversion count in the provided code is 3, which is not 4.\n\n        How to get the number of operations from the inversion count? \n\n          We might have: number of operations = inversion_count\n\n          and then the number of candies eaten = n - 2 * inversion_count? \n\n          Test case 1: 2 - 2*0 = 2.\n          Test case 2: 6 - 2*0 = 6.\n          Test case 4: 9 - 2*3 = 3, not 7.\n\n        or = n - inversion_count\n\n          test case 4: 9-3=6, not 7.\n\n        or = n - uneaten, and uneaten = inversion_count.\n\n          test case 4: 9-3=6, not 7.\n\n        or = n - uneaten, and uneaten = inversion_count / something.\n\n        I give up.\n\n        I will output the completion for program1.py and hope that program2.py is not needed, but the problem says to write it.\n\n        Alternatively, program2.py might be provided and we only need to write program1.py's TODO.\n\n        But the problem says both are missing.\n\n        Given the instructions, I will output the following for program2.py: it takes the output of program1.py and for each test case, if it is -1, output -1, otherwise output n - (value) where n is the number of stoves in the test case.\n\n        But program2.py does not know n.\n\n        Unless program1.py outputs n and the value for each test case.\n\n        The problem does not say that.\n\n        Therefore, I will not solve it.\n\n        Since we must output something, I output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py a program that \n        reads the input for the test cases (which is the same as what program1.py read) from stdin, and then for each test case, it reads the output of program1.py for that test case and then computes the answer as n - (output of program1.py) if the output is not -1, and then outputs that.\n\n        But then program2.py would need to know the input.\n\n        However, program1.py has already read the input and we cannot reread it from stdin because it's piped: program1.py's output is piped to program2.py, and the input to program1.py is from the console.\n\n        So program2.py cannot get the input.\n\n        This is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, I think the only possibility is that the answer for the test case is the output of program1.py.\n\n        And the examples in the problem are not using the provided code.\n\n        So I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py the identity.\n\n        This is the best I can do.\n\n        Completion for program1.py: in the TODO, put:\n\n            stop -= 1\n            res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n        For program2.py: a program that copies stdin to stdout.\n\n        Code for program2.py:\n\n            import sys\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line.strip())\n\n        Then the output for the sample test cases will be:\n          0\n          0\n          -1\n          3\n\n        for the four examples in the note.\n\n        But the expected outputs are:\n          2\n          6\n          -1\n          7\n\n        So it does not match.\n\n        I am not sure what to do.\n\n        Perhaps the segment tree is for a different purpose, and the answer = (n - 1) - (output of program1.py) or something.\n\n        For the first example: (2-1) - 0 = 1, not 2.\n\n        For the fourth example: (9-1)-3=5, not 7.\n\n        I give up.\n\n        I will output the following as the answer:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"stop -= 1\\n                res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\",\n          \"program2\": \"\"\n        }\n\n        But the problem requires program2 to be a string with the code.\n\n        Given the above, I output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py the identity.\n\n        This is the best I can do."
