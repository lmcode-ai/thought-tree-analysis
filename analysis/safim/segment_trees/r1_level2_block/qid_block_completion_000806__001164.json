The right edge: 3 -> one tile. So total tiles: 4, and 4*3 = 12, and the boundary area is 2*(3+5)-4 = 12. So it fits. But what if a=4? Then the top edge: 3 mod 4 != 0 -> doesn't fit?

So if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2 * half_perimeter is divisible by a only if a is even?",

Yes, because 2*half_perimeter = 2 * (half_perimeter) = 2 * (k * a) = (2k)*a. But wait: if a divides half_perimeter, then half_perimeter = k * a, so 2*half_perimeter = 2k * a, so divisible by a.

After reading a known solution for the problem (e.g., from a Codeforces submission for problem \"Heretical \u2026 M\u00f6bius\" in a contest), we see:\n\n            def solve():\n                w, l = map(int, input().split())\n                ans = set()\n                for _ in range(2):\n                    for __ in range(2):\n                        g = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n                        ans.add(g)\n                        ans.add(g)\n                        for d in range(1, int(g**0.5)+1):\n                            if g % d == 0:\n                                ans.add(d)\n                                ans.add(g//d)\n                        l, w = w, l\n                # and then also consider other cases: gcd(w-2, l), gcd(w, l-2), gcd(w-1, l), gcd(w, l-1)\n                # then output the sorted list of divisors of the total boundary area that are in ans. But the provided code in program2.py is different. Given the complexity, and the provided code structure, I suspect that the TODO is to check the following:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # then check the other dimension: l\n                if (l-2) % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a) But then we might add duplicates, so we use a set. But note: the condition might be that either:\n\n            (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) OR\n            (w % a == 2 and (l) % a == 0) OR   # because w-2 might be divisible by a -> w % a =2\n            (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) OR\n            ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 1)   -> but we only have w % a, not (w-1) % a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can express in terms of w % a and l % a and (l-2) % a, etc. But the provided code only has w and l.\n\n        A more efficient approach is to try the four cases explicitly for each divisor a:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a) But note: the (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) might be covered by the first two? Not exactly. However, the example a=1: \n            w % 1=0, (l-2)%1=0 -> valid. a=2 for w=3, l=5:\n            try case1: w %2 = 3%2=1, (l-2)%2=3%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case2: (w-2)%2 = 1%2=1, l%2=5%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: w%2=1, l%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case4: (w-1)%2=2%2=0, (l-1)%2=4%2=0 -> valid. So a=2 is valid. a=3 for w=3, l=5:\n            case1: 3%3=0, (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid. a=4 for w=3, l=5: \n            case1: 3%4=3, (5-2)=3%4=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (3-2)=1%4=1, 5%4=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: 3%4=3, 5%4=1 -> not 0.\n            case4: (3-1)=2%4=2, (5-1)=4%4=0 -> not both 0.\n            -> invalid. a=6: \n            case1: 3%6=3, (5-2)=3%6=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (3-2)=1%6=1, 5%6=5 -> not 0.\n            case3: 3%6=3, 5%6=5 -> not 0.\n            case4: (3-1)=2%6=2, (5-1)=4%6=4 -> not 0.\n            -> invalid. a=1,2,3 are valid. Therefore, we can do in the TODO:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0):   # this last condition might be for the case where the entire edge is covered including the corners by the same edge? solutions.add(a) But wait, the last condition (w % a ==0 and l % a==0) is not necessary because it is covered by the first two? If w % a==0 and l % a==0, then the first condition: w % a==0 and (l-2) % a might not be 0. For example, w=4, l=4, a=2: \n                first condition: 4%2=0, (4-2)=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid. So we don need the last condition. But wait, what if a=1 for w=4, l=4: \n            first condition: 4%1=0, (4-2)=2%1=0 -> valid.",

For a=1, (w-1)%1=0 always. So we can also write:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 2 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)   # redundant because (w-1)%a==0 means w%a=1 (if a>1) or always true if a=1.

So we can do:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 2 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ( (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 ): But the last condition is the same as the third if we use the modulo in terms of w%a. In fact, (w-1) % a == 0 if and only if w % a == 1, provided that a<=w. If a>w, then (w-1) % a = w-1, and w % a = w. So we must be careful. Therefore, it is better to express in terms of modulo:\n\n            c1 = (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n            c2 = (l % a == 0) and ((w-2) % a == 0)   # note: this is different from the above: above was w%a==2 and l%a==0, but (w-2)%a==0 is not equivalent to w%a==2 (because if a>2, then (w-2)%a==0 means w%a=2, but if a<=2, then it might not). For example, a=1: (w-2)%1=0 always, and l%1=0 always, so c2 is true. a=2: (w-2)%2==0 means w is even, and l%2==0. But note: the condition in the second case should be: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0. Similarly, the third case: (w-1) % a ==0 and (l-1) % a==0. So we can do: c1 = (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n            c2 = ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n            c3 = ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0) Then if c1 or c2 or c3, then add a.\n\n        But note: the modulo operation for (l-2) % a: if l-2 is negative, then in Python it might not be 0 even if a divides l-2. But l>=3, so l-2>=1, and similarly for w-2 and w-1, l-1.

The provided code iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and for each divisor i of half_perimeter, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. But what about a= half_perimeter itself? When i = floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), then if i*i = half_perimeter, then we get a = i and a = i (duplicate). Otherwise, we get a = i and a = half_perimeter//i. And if half_perimeter is a divisor of itself, then when i is the smallest factor, we get a = half_perimeter when i is small and half_perimeter//i is large. So we will get it.

But also, a=8 might be valid? \n            case1: 5%8=5, (5-2)=3%8=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (5-2)=3%8=3, 5%8=5 -> not 0.\n            case3: (5-1)=4%8=4, (5-1)=4%8=4 -> not 0.\n            -> invalid. a=2: \n            case1: 5%2=1, 3%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case2: 3%2=1, 5%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: 4%2=0, 4%2=0 -> valid. a=1: valid. a=4: valid by case3. So the valid a are 1,2,4. But half_perimeter=8, and its divisors are 1,2,4,8. We would consider a=1,2,4,8. And then for a=8, it fails. For a=4, it passes by case3. Therefore, by iterating the divisors of half_perimeter, we get a=1,2,4,8.",

But the set of divisors is not too large, so we can remove the if mod_a<=2. However, the problem says to complete the TODO, and the if mod_a<=2 is there. So we must use it? But the condition mod_a<=2 is necessary to avoid? For example, if w % a =3, then we skip. But in the detailed condition, if w % a =3, then the first condition (w%a==0) fails, the second condition ( (w-2)%a==0 ) would be (3-2=1) % a =1, which is not 0, and the third condition ( (w-1)%a==0 ) would be (3-1=2) % a =2, which is not 0.

So the if mod_a<=2 is redundant if we do the detailed condition. But the if mod_a<=2 might be an optimization to avoid doing the detailed condition for a that have w % a >2. Since the TODO is inside the if mod_a<=2, we will do the detailed condition only when w % a is 0,1, or 2. Therefore, we leave it. So the code for program2.py in the TODO is:\n\n            if ( (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or\n                 ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or\n                 ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) ):\n                solutions.add(a) But note: the condition (w-2) % a ==0 might be true even if w % a is 0 or 1 or 2. For example, if w % a =0, then (w-2) % a = (0-2) mod a = a-2, which is not 0 (unless a=1 or a=2). So the conditions are not redundant.",

Then the left edge has length l. This is messy. Alternatively, known solutions for this problem (from Codeforces submissions) do the following:\n\n   Let T = 2*(w+l-2)\n   Find all divisors of T (but note T can be up to 4e9, but the total number of divisors is at most about 2000, and the total over test cases is at most 200000 integers, so we can factorize? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we can iterate over the divisors? But T can be up to 4e9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(T)) which is about 10^5 per test case? And t up to 100, so total divisors over all test cases could be 100 * 10^5 = 10^7, which is acceptable? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we must not output more than 200000 integers in total.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, such that the total weight they eat is equal, and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n1. It reads the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, it reads n and the list of candy weights.\n3. It computes x = sum(a) // 2. Note that the total weight each can have is at most half the total.\n4. Then it builds a dictionary `d` that maps a cumulative sum (from the left) to the number of candies (index+1) taken to achieve that sum. It breaks when the cumulative sum exceeds x (since we cannot exceed half the total).\n5. Then it does a cumulative sum from the right. For each cumulative sum `s` from the right, it checks if `s` is in the dictionary `d` (which means we have a left cumulative sum equal to `s`). If so, then we can have a total of (d[s] + idx+1) candies. We want the maximum such total.\n\nHowever, the code after the second loop is incomplete. We are to complete the second loop.\n\nWe note that the variable `r` is initialized to 0. We want to update `r` to be the maximum of the current `r` and the total candies (which is the number from the left plus the number from the right) whenever we have a matching sum.\n\nBut note: the second loop is iterating from the right. The variable `idx` in the second loop is 0-indexed from the right (so the first candy from the right is at index0, then index1, etc.). Therefore, the number of candies taken from the right is `idx+1`.\n\nSo, if `s` (the cumulative sum from the right) is found in the dictionary `d`, then we have:\n    total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\nWe then set `r = max(r, total_candies)`\n\nBut note: we must break early if the cumulative sum from the right exceeds x? Actually, the problem says that the total weight each can have is at most half. However, the dictionary `d` only has keys that are at most x. So if `s` becomes greater than x, then we won't find it in `d`. But we don't break explicitly? However, the problem states that the total sum of the candies might be even or odd. But note: the dictionary `d` only has keys that are <= x. So if `s` becomes greater than x, then we won't get a match. However, we can break early for efficiency? The problem constraints are high (n up to 200,000 per test case, but the total n over test cases <= 200,000). So we don't necessarily need to break, but we can.\n\nBut the provided code does not break in the second loop. We are only to complete the if block.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py for the if block is:\n    if s in d:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nHowever, note: the problem says that they cannot eat the same candy. But our method is safe because the left part is taken from the beginning and the right part from the end, and we are only matching the same total weight. But note: the two segments must not overlap. The dictionary `d` was built from the left without considering the right. When we take `d[s]` from the left and `idx+1` from the right, we must ensure that the two segments do not overlap. However, the problem does not explicitly say that the entire set of candies is contiguous and that the left and right segments are disjoint? The note in the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So we must have disjoint segments.\n\nBut note: the way we are computing the cumulative sums: the left part is from the beginning and the right part is from the end. The total candies taken is d[s] (from the left) and idx+1 (from the right). This is valid only if the two segments do not overlap. However, if the entire array is taken (d[s] + idx+1 == n) then we must have that the entire array is partitioned? But note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot skip. So if the entire array is taken, then the two segments must meet in the middle? Actually, they might overlap? We must avoid overlapping.\n\nBut observe: the dictionary `d` was built for the entire left part without considering the right. Then when we take from the right, we are taking from the end. The condition for non-overlapping is that the left segment and the right segment do not cover the same candy. This is achieved if the left segment does not extend beyond the point where the right segment starts. Specifically, the left segment covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the right segment covers indices [n-1-idx, n-1]. We require that d[s] <= n-1-idx. However, the problem does not guarantee that in the current code.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we can do a two-pointer? Actually, the provided method is using a dictionary and then a reverse iteration. We must ensure that we do not count overlapping.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require that the entire set of candies is contiguous? Actually, it is. The candies are in a row. So if we take too many from the left and then too many from the right, they might meet in the middle and then we are counting the same candy twice? \n\nBut note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot skip. So if the entire array is taken, then the left segment and the right segment must meet at the same candy? Actually, no: if the entire array is taken, then the left segment is the entire array and the right segment is the entire array? That would be double counting. \n\nBut observe: the problem states that if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So they cannot both eat the same candy. Therefore, the two segments must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, we must only consider the case when the left segment and the right segment do not overlap. How do we ensure that? The dictionary `d` was built without considering the right. Then when we traverse from the right, we are adding the candies from the end. The condition for non-overlap is that the left segment does not extend beyond the right segment's starting point. Specifically, the left segment ends at index `d[s]-1` (0-indexed) and the right segment starts at index `n - (idx+1)`. We require that `d[s] <= n - (idx+1)`. \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire array is contiguous. The candies are in a row. So the left segment is [0, d[s]-1] and the right segment is [n - (idx+1), n-1]. They are disjoint if d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\nTherefore, we should add this condition.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n    if s in d and d[s] <= n - (idx+1):\n        r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, but note that the second loop runs for the entire array? And the dictionary lookup is O(1). However, we are iterating the entire array from the right. But the condition d[s] <= n - (idx+1) is always true? Not necessarily: if we have a small array and we have taken a lot from the left and a lot from the right, they might overlap.\n\nBut note: the dictionary `d` was built for the entire left without breaking the non-overlap? Actually, no. The dictionary `d` was built without any consideration of the right. So we must check for non-overlap.\n\nHowever, let's consider: the cumulative sum from the left is taken for the first `d[s]` candies. The cumulative sum from the right is taken for the last `idx+1` candies. The total number of candies taken is d[s] + idx+1. But if d[s] + idx+1 > n, then we have taken more candies than available? Actually, we are not taking the entire array? We are taking two disjoint segments. The maximum we can take is n. So if d[s] + idx+1 <= n, then we are safe? But note: the condition for non-overlap is that the left segment does not extend into the right segment. The left segment ends at d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at n - (idx+1). We require that d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1), i.e., d[s] + idx+1 < n+1, which is always true if d[s] + idx+1 <= n. But if d[s] + idx+1 == n, then the left segment ends at d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at n - (idx+1) = d[s] (because d[s] + idx+1 = n => idx+1 = n - d[s] => the right segment starts at n - (n-d[s]) = d[s]). So the left segment ends at d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at d[s]. They are adjacent, not overlapping. So it's valid.\n\nTherefore, the condition for non-overlap is automatically satisfied if the total candies taken is at most n. But note: we are building the dictionary `d` without any constraint on the right? Actually, we are building the dictionary for the entire left without considering the right. Then when we traverse the right, we are starting from the very end. The condition for non-overlap is that the left segment does not extend beyond the right segment's start. The right segment's start is at index n - (idx+1). The left segment ends at index d[s]-1. We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1, which is always true because d[s] is at most n and idx+1 is at most n, but d[s] + (idx+1) can be at most 2*n? Actually, no: d[s] is the count of candies from the left, and idx+1 is the count from the right. The maximum d[s] can be up to the entire left (n) and the right can be up to the entire right (n), but then d[s] + (idx+1) would be 2*n? That's impossible because there are only n candies. \n\nBut note: the dictionary `d` was built only for cumulative sums that are at most x (half the total). And the second loop does not break? So we might get a cumulative sum from the right that is large? However, the condition for non-overlap is necessary because we cannot take the same candy twice.\n\nTherefore, we must check that the left segment and the right segment do not overlap. The condition is: the left segment ends at index d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at index n - (idx+1). We require that d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1. But note: the total candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). Since there are only n candies, we must have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. So if we have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the segments are disjoint. But note: the problem does not require that we take contiguous segments? Actually, the problem says that Alice eats from the left in a row and Bob from the right in a row. So the segments are contiguous and at the ends. Therefore, the condition for non-overlap is that the left segment does not extend beyond the right segment's start. The right segment starts at n - (idx+1). The left segment must end at an index < n - (idx+1). Therefore, we require:\n    d[s] <= n - (idx+1)\n\nSo we must add that condition.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we can do this check without performance issues.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py in the if block is:\n    if s in d and d[s] <= n - (idx+1):\n        r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\nBut wait: what if the same cumulative sum appears multiple times from the left? The dictionary `d` stores the last (largest) index for which we get that sum? Actually, we are building the dictionary in increasing order of the cumulative sum, and for a given cumulative sum we store the smallest number of candies? Actually, no: we are storing the index (which is the count) for the cumulative sum. And we break when the cumulative sum exceeds x. But note: we are storing the cumulative sum for the first time we achieve that sum? Actually, we are storing the last index for that cumulative sum? Because we are iterating and updating the dictionary for the same key? Actually, we are storing the index for the cumulative sum as we go. But if the same cumulative sum appears again? It cannot because we are adding positive numbers. The cumulative sum is strictly increasing. So each key is unique.\n\nTherefore, we can do the above.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the weights are positive. So the cumulative sums are strictly increasing.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the if block as above.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the code that finds the valid values of `a` (the tile size) for tiling the bathroom floor.\n\nThe problem:\n- The bathroom has dimensions w (width) and l (length).\n- The interior uses 1x1 tiles: (w-2)*(l-2) of them.\n- The boundary uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated, so they can be a x 1 as well). The boundary has a total area of: total = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nBut note: the boundary is composed of four edges. However, the corners are shared. So the boundary without corners is: \n   top: w - 2\n   bottom: w - 2\n   left: l - 2\n   right: l - 2\nBut wait, that leaves the corners? Actually, the boundary is the entire perimeter without the interior. The perimeter has 2*(w+l) - 4 squares? Because the four corners are included in both the top/bottom and left/right? Actually, the total boundary squares = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nWe are to cover the boundary with tiles of size 1xa (or ax1). The tiles can be rotated. Therefore, the tile area is a. And the total boundary area must be divisible by a. But that is not the only condition: the tiles must fit along the boundary without breaking the pattern.\n\nThe provided code does:\n    half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # note: 2*(w+l) - 4 = 2*(w+l-2). So the total area is 2*(w+l-2). Therefore, a must divide 2*(w+l-2). But note: the problem says that the boundary is covered by 1xa tiles. However, the boundary is not a single strip? It is a rectangle. The tiles must be placed along the edges.\n\nThe problem says: \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1\u00d7a for some positive integer a. The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\"\n\nThe key is that the tile must fit along the edges. The edges have lengths w and l. The tile of length a must be placed along the edge. Therefore, the condition is that the tile must fit in the sense that the edge length must be divisible by a? But note: the corners are shared. So we have four edges: two of length w and two of length l. However, the corners are part of two edges. So the entire boundary is a cycle? But the problem does not require the tile to be placed continuously around the cycle? They are placed on the edges.\n\nTherefore, we can break the boundary into four segments: \n   top: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> length w\n   right: from (w,0) to (w,l) -> length l\n   bottom: from (w,l) to (0,l) -> length w\n   left: from (0,l) to (0,0) -> length l\n\nBut note: the corners are shared. So the top segment actually has length w-1? Or the entire top edge has w tiles? Actually, the bathroom has w centimeters in width and l in length. The boundary consists of:\n   top: w tiles\n   bottom: w tiles\n   left: l-2 tiles (because the top and bottom already covered the corners of the left)\n   right: l-2 tiles.\n\nBut wait: that would be w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2w + 2l - 4, which matches.\n\nSo the four segments are:\n   top: w\n   bottom: w\n   left: l-2\n   right: l-2\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the exact arrangement. However, the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily? The condition is that the entire boundary must be tiled with 1xa tiles. Therefore, each segment must be divisible by a? Actually, no: because the tiles can be placed across corners? The problem does not specify that the tiles must be contained within one edge. However, the note and the pictures suggest that the tiles are placed along the edges without crossing corners? \n\nLooking at the note: the first test case is 3x5. The valid a are 1,2,3.\n\nHow does a=3 work? The top edge of 3: 3 is divisible by 3 -> one tile. The bottom edge: 3 divisible by 3 -> one tile. The left edge: 5-2=3 -> divisible by 3 -> one tile. The right edge: 3 -> one tile. So total tiles: 4, and 4*3 = 12, and the boundary area is 2*(3+5)-4 = 12. So it fits.\n\nBut what if a=4? Then the top edge: 3 mod 4 != 0 -> doesn't fit? So a must divide each segment? Actually, the tiles can be broken? The problem does not say that the tile must be used as a whole without breaking. But note: the tile is 1xa, so it is a rectangle. It can be broken? The problem does not say. But typically tiling problems do not break tiles. So we assume that the tile must be used as a whole.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that a must divide the length of each edge? But note: the tiles can be placed in any orientation and can be arranged arbitrarily along the edge? Actually, the edge is a straight line. So the condition is that the edge length must be divisible by a? Or the tile can be placed in the other orientation? Since the tile is 1xa, if we place it along the edge, then the length of the tile that is aligned with the edge is either 1 or a. But if a>1, then we can only use the tile in the direction of a? Actually, we can rotate, so we can use it as 1xa or ax1. But if we use it as ax1, then the length along the edge is 1. So we can always use the tile as 1x1? But wait: the tile is 1xa, so if we rotate it, it becomes ax1. Then when placing it along the edge, the dimension that is along the edge can be either 1 or a? \n\nTherefore, the condition for an edge of length L is that we can cover it with tiles of length 1 or a? Actually, we can use any number of tiles of length 1 and a? But note: the tile is 1xa, so if we break it? We cannot break. So we must use entire tiles. Therefore, the edge of length L must be expressible as a nonnegative integer combination of 1 and a? But note: we can use as many 1's as we want? Actually, we can use the tile as 1x1 (if we set a=1, then we have 1x1) or if a>1, then we can use the tile as 1x1 by breaking? But the problem does not allow breaking. \n\nWait: the tile is 1xa. If we place it vertically (so that the 1 is the height and a is the length) then it covers a length of a along the edge. If we place it horizontally (so that a is the height and 1 is the length) then it covers a length of 1 along the edge? But the edge is horizontal? Actually, the edge is a straight line. The tile must be placed so that one side is along the edge and the other side is the height (which must be 1 because the boundary is only 1 tile high). Therefore, the tile must be placed with the length a along the edge? Or the length 1 along the edge? \n\nBut note: the boundary is 1 tile high? Actually, the boundary is the perimeter of the floor. The tiles are placed on the floor. The boundary is one tile wide. So the tile of size 1xa must be placed so that the 1 is the height (perpendicular to the floor) and a is the length along the edge? Actually, the height of the tile is 1 (the same as the interior) and the length is a. So when placed along the edge, the tile covers a consecutive segment of length a. Therefore, the entire edge must be divisible by a? \n\nBut wait: the tile can be rotated? Then we have two possibilities: \n   Option 1: use the tile as 1xa: then it covers a consecutive segment of length a.\n   Option 2: use the tile as a x 1: then it covers a consecutive segment of length 1.\n\nBut note: the problem says the tile is 1xa and can be rotated by 90 degrees, so it becomes ax1. However, the height of the tile must be 1 to match the interior? Actually, the interior is 1x1. The boundary is adjacent to the interior. The boundary tile must have height 1 to match the interior? But the boundary is at the edge of the floor. The tile can extend beyond? The problem does not specify. \n\nLooking at the example: 3x5 with a=3. The top edge is 3, so we use one tile of 1x3. The bottom edge: one tile 1x3. The left edge: 5-2=3, so one tile 1x3. The right edge: one tile 1x3. So we use four tiles. \n\nBut if a=2: \n   top: 3 = 2+1 -> but we cannot break the tile? Actually, we can use one tile of 1x2 and one tile of 1x1? But we don't have 1x1 for the boundary? The problem says the boundary uses 1xa tiles. However, note that a=1 is allowed. So we can use a=1 for the 1x1. But the problem does not say we can mix different a. The entire boundary must use the same a? The problem says: \"use tiles of size 1\u00d7a for some positive integer a\". So the entire boundary uses the same a.\n\nTherefore, we cannot mix. So for a given a, we must cover the entire boundary with tiles of size 1xa (or ax1) without breaking. But note: if we use the tile as 1xa, then we are covering a consecutive segment of a. If we use it as ax1, then we are covering a consecutive segment of 1. But that is the same as having a tile of size 1x1. So if a=1, then we can cover any edge. If a>1, then we can cover an edge of length L only if L is divisible by a? Or we can use a combination of 1 and a? But note: we are forced to use the same a for every tile. So we can use multiple tiles: each tile can be placed as 1xa (covering a) or as 1x1? Actually, no: the tile is 1xa. If we place it as 1x1, we are effectively breaking it? We cannot break. So we must use the entire tile. Therefore, the tile must cover a consecutive segment of either a or 1? \n\nBut wait: if we place the tile as 1xa, we cover a consecutive segment of a. If we place it as ax1, we cover a consecutive segment of 1. So we have two types of placements? But the tile is the same: we can choose for each tile independently whether to place it as 1xa or ax1. Therefore, the condition for an edge of length L is that L must be expressible as a nonnegative integer combination of 1 and a? But note: we can use as many tiles as we want. The total length L must be the sum of some 1's and a's. This is possible if and only if L is at least 0? Actually, we can always use 1's. So if we have enough tiles, we can cover any L? But the problem does not specify the number of tiles. The condition is that the total area of the boundary is divisible by a? And also that the edge lengths are at least the minimum tile length? \n\nBut note: the tile has area a. The total boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4. So a must divide 2*(w+l)-4. However, that is necessary but not sufficient? We also must be able to cover each edge.\n\nBut the example: w=3, l=5, total boundary area=2*(3+5)-4=12. Then a must be a divisor of 12. The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the valid a are 1,2,3. Why not 4,6,12?\n\nLet's try a=4: \n   top edge: 3 -> 3 mod 4 = 3 -> we cannot cover 3 with tiles of 1 and 4? We can: 3 = 3*1. But wait: we can use three tiles of 1x1? But the tile is 1x4. If we use it as 1x1, that is we break it? We cannot break. So we must use the entire tile. Therefore, we cannot use a tile of 1x4 to cover a segment of length 1? We can: by placing it as 1x4 and then we have 4>3? It doesn't fit. Alternatively, we can place it as 4x1? Then it covers 1 in length. So we can use three tiles of 4x1 to cover the top edge? But then each tile covers 1 in length, so three tiles cover 3. Similarly, the bottom edge: 3 -> three tiles. The left edge: 5-2=3 -> three tiles. The right edge: 3 -> three tiles. Total tiles: 12, and total area: 12*1 = 12? But wait: each tile is 1x4, so if we use it as 4x1, then the area covered is 4? Then total area covered would be 12*4 = 48, which is too much. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nActually, the tile is 1x4. When placed as 4x1, it covers 4 square centimeters? But the boundary is 1 cm high. So if we place the tile as 4x1, then it covers 4 cm in length and 1 cm in height? But the edge is only 1 cm high. So it fits. However, the area covered by one tile is 4. The total boundary area is 12, so we need 12/4=3 tiles. But we have four edges: each edge requires 3/1 = 3 tiles? Actually, no: the top edge is 3 cm long. We can cover it with three tiles of 1x1? But we don't have 1x1 tiles for the boundary, we have 1x4. We can use the 1x4 tile as 1x1? Only if we break it? We cannot break. \n\nTherefore, we must cover the entire top edge of 3 cm with tiles of 1x4? We cannot because 3 is not divisible by 4 and we cannot break. Alternatively, we can cover the top edge by placing the tile as 4x1? Then the tile covers 1 cm in length. So we need 3 such tiles for the top edge. Similarly for the others. But then we use 3 tiles per edge, total 12 tiles. But the total area covered is 12 * (1*4) = 48, but the boundary area is 12. This is inconsistent.\n\nI see the mistake: when we place a tile of 1x4 as 4x1, it covers 4 square centimeters? Actually, the tile is 1x4: it has area 4. If we rotate it, it becomes 4x1, which is still area 4. But the boundary area is 12, so we need 12/4=3 tiles in total. But we are using 12 tiles? That is 12*4=48, which is too much.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use 12 tiles. We must use 3 tiles for the entire boundary. How? We have to cover 12 cm^2 with 3 tiles of 4 cm^2 each. But how to arrange them? The boundary is not a single strip? It is a rectangle. The tile of 4x1 is 4 cm long. We can place it along the edge. But the top edge is only 3 cm long. We cannot place a 4 cm tile along the top edge. \n\nTherefore, the condition is not only that a divides the total boundary area, but also that the tile fits on each edge. Specifically, for each edge, the length of the edge must be at least the minimum dimension of the tile? And the tile must be placed so that it covers a contiguous segment of the edge. The tile can cover multiple edges? The problem does not say. The example pictures show the tiles placed on single edges.\n\nTherefore, we assume that the tiles are placed entirely on one edge. Then the condition for an edge of length L is that L must be divisible by a? Or we can use the tile in the 1x1 mode? But we cannot break the tile. And if we use the tile as 1x1, then we are effectively using a tile of size 1, which is only allowed if a=1. \n\nBut wait: the tile is 1xa. If a>1, then we cannot use it as 1x1? We can only use it as 1xa (covering a consecutive a) or as ax1 (covering a consecutive 1). So for an edge of length L, we can cover it if and only if L is a nonnegative integer combination of 1 and a? But note: we can use as many as we want. So L must be at least 0 and we can always cover it if we have enough tiles? But the total number of tiles is fixed: total boundary area / a. And we must cover all four edges. \n\nThis is complex. \n\nThe known solution for this problem is to consider the divisors of 2*(w-1), 2*(l-1), (w-2), (l-2), and other combinations? \n\nAfter reading known solutions for similar problems (like Codeforces Round #747 (Div. 2), problem C), we know that the valid a must be divisors of the total boundary area (which is 2*(w+l)-4) and also satisfy one of the following four conditions:\n\n1. The top and bottom edges can be covered: this requires that a divides w and a divides w (the same for top and bottom) and a divides (l-2) for the left and right? Not exactly.\n\nActually, the known approach is to consider the following four cases for the corners:\n\nCase 1: All four corners are covered by 1x1 tiles (so a=1 is always valid). But also, the remaining parts of the edges must be divisible by a? \n\nAlternatively, we can have:\n\nCase 1: The top-left and bottom-left corners are covered by a vertical tile (which would be placed on the left edge and cover the corner) and the top-right and bottom-right by a horizontal tile? \n\nActually, there are four cases:\n\nCase 1: The four corners are covered by four separate tiles (each covering the corner and extending along the edge). Then each edge has two corners already covered? Then the remaining part of the top and bottom edges is w-2, and the remaining part of the left and right edges is l-2. Then we require that a divides w, a divides w (again), and a divides (l-2), and a divides (l-2). But wait, the top edge has two corners, so the middle part is w-2? Actually, no: the top edge has two corners, so if we cover the corners with separate tiles, then the top edge has a segment of length w-2 in the middle. But the tile might cover part of the top edge and part of the left edge? The problem does not allow a tile to cover two edges? \n\nAfter reading the problem statement: it does not explicitly forbid a tile to cover two edges. But the example pictures show tiles on single edges. \n\nKnown solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problem \"Heretical \u2026 M\u00f6bius\", or from the sample code of the same problem) is to consider the divisors of:\n\n   g1 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n   g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n   g3 = gcd(w, l-2)\n   g4 = gcd(w-1, l-1)   # same as g1?\n\nActually, we have to consider the following:\n\nThe total boundary area is T = 2*(w+l-2). And a must divide T. But also, the arrangement must be such that the corners are covered appropriately. There are several ways to cover the corners:\n\nType 1: \n   - Cover the top-left corner with a vertical tile (covering the entire left edge of the corner and part of the top edge? or vice versa?) -> actually, we can cover the top-left corner by a tile that is placed on the top edge and extends to cover the corner? Or on the left edge.\n\nBut note: the tile is 1xa. It can be placed horizontally or vertically. It cannot cover two edges at once because it is only 1 unit wide. Therefore, each tile is entirely on one edge.\n\nTherefore, the corners must be covered by a tile that is placed on one of the two edges meeting at the corner. \n\nThis leads to four cases:\n\nCase 1: The top-left corner is covered by a tile on the top edge, and the top-right corner by a tile on the top edge, and the bottom-left by a tile on the bottom edge, and the bottom-right by a tile on the bottom edge. Then the left and right edges have no corners. So the left edge has length l-2, and the right edge has length l-2. The top and bottom edges have length w. Then we require:\n   a divides w, and a divides w, and a divides (l-2), and a divides (l-2).\n\nBut note: the top edge has two corners, so if we cover the entire top edge including the corners, then the top edge is covered by tiles that might be of length a. But the top edge is w. So we require a|w. Similarly, the bottom edge: a|w. The left edge: a|(l-2). The right edge: a|(l-2).\n\nCase 2: The top-left corner is covered by a tile on the left edge, and the bottom-left by a tile on the left edge, and the top-right by a tile on the right edge, and the bottom-right by a tile on the right edge. Then the top and bottom edges have no corners. So the top edge has length w-2, the bottom edge has length w-2, the left edge has length l, and the right edge has length l. Then we require:\n   a|(w-2), a|(w-2), a|l, a|l.\n\nCase 3: The top-left corner is covered by a tile on the top edge, the top-right by a tile on the right edge, the bottom-right by a tile on the bottom edge, and the bottom-left by a tile on the left edge. Then the top edge has the left corner covered but not the right? Actually, the top edge has the left corner covered by a tile on the top edge, and the right corner covered by a tile on the right edge. Therefore, the top edge has a segment in the middle of length w-1 (because the left corner is covered by the top edge tile and the right corner is covered by the right edge tile). Similarly, the right edge has a segment in the middle of length l-1. The bottom edge has a segment in the middle of length w-1, and the left edge has a segment in the middle of length l-1. But wait, the bottom edge: the right corner is covered by the bottom edge tile? No, in this case the bottom-right corner is covered by the bottom edge tile? And the bottom-left by the left edge tile. So the bottom edge has the left corner covered by the left edge tile and the right corner covered by the bottom edge tile. Therefore, the bottom edge has a segment of length w-1. Similarly, the left edge has a segment of length l-1 (between the top-left and bottom-left). But the left edge has two corners: top-left and bottom-left. If the top-left is covered by the top edge and the bottom-left by the bottom edge, then the left edge has no corners? Then the left edge has length l. \n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternatively, known solutions for this problem (from Codeforces submissions) do the following:\n\n   Let T = 2*(w+l-2)\n   Find all divisors of T (but note T can be up to 4e9, but the total number of divisors is at most about 2000, and the total over test cases is at most 200000 integers, so we can factorize? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we can iterate over the divisors? But T can be up to 4e9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(T)) which is about 10^5 per test case? And t up to 100, so total divisors over all test cases could be 100 * 10^5 = 10^7, which is acceptable? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, so we must not output more than 200000 integers in total. Therefore, we can iterate over the divisors for each test case? But the number of divisors per test case is at most about 1344 (for numbers up to 10^9)). And 100 test cases * 1344 = 134400, which is within 200000.\n\nBut the provided code does not iterate over all divisors of T. Instead, it uses:\n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # which is (2*(w+l)-4)/2 = T/2? Actually, T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n   Then it iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then considers divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n   Then it has:\n        for a in [i, div]:   # where div = half_perimeter // i, if i is a divisor of half_perimeter.\n\n   Then it checks:\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            ... \n\n   And then there is a TODO.\n\nWhat is the idea? \n\nThe known solution in the provided code snippet is to consider divisors of half_perimeter (which is w+l-2). Then for each divisor a (which is a divisor of half_perimeter), we consider two representations: the divisor i and half_perimeter//i.\n\nThen for each a, we check the remainder when w is divided by a. If the remainder is 0, 1, or 2, then we add a to the solutions? But why?\n\nLet me relate to the cases:\n\nWe have four cases for the corners:\n\nCase 1: The corners are covered by the adjacent edges in a way that leaves the top and bottom edges with length w, and the left and right edges with length l-2. Then the condition is that a must divide w and a must divide (l-2). But note: the total boundary area is 2w + 2(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. And a must divide the entire boundary, so a must divide 2 * half_perimeter. But we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter, so a might not divide 2*half_perimeter? Actually, half_perimeter = w+l-2, and we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter, but the total boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. So if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2 * half_perimeter is divisible by a only if a is even? Not necessarily: if a divides half_perimeter, then 2*half_perimeter is divisible by a? Yes, because 2*half_perimeter = 2 * (half_perimeter) = 2 * (k * a) = (2k)*a.\n\nBut wait: if a divides half_perimeter, then half_perimeter = k * a, so 2*half_perimeter = 2k * a, so divisible by a.\n\nSo the divisibility condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the condition for the edges:\n\nFor case 1: we require that a divides w and a divides (l-2). But note: we are only given one condition: w % a <= 2. Why?\n\nLet me try with the example w=3, l=5, then half_perimeter = 3+5-2=6. Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor a=1: w % 1 = 0 (since any number mod 1 is 0) -> 0<=2 -> valid.\nFor a=2: 3 % 2 = 1 <=2 -> valid.\nFor a=3: 3 % 3 = 0 <=2 -> valid.\nFor a=6: 3 % 6 = 3 >2 -> not valid.\n\nSo we get {1,2,3} for a, which matches.\n\nWhy is w % a <=2 sufficient? \n\nConsider case 1: the top and bottom edges are covered by tiles that might cover the corners. The top edge has length w. We cover the entire top edge with tiles. But the top edge has two corners. If we cover the corners with the top edge tiles, then the tile that covers the top-left corner might extend into the left edge? But we said the tile is on one edge. \n\nAlternatively, the condition might be derived from the possibility of leaving at most 2 cm at the corners to be covered by the adjacent edge's tiles.\n\nIn fact, the condition w % a <=2 might be for the following: the top edge might not be entirely covered by the top edge tiles. The corners might be covered by the left/right edge tiles. Then the top edge has a segment of length w - 2 (the middle) and two segments of length 1 at the corners? But then the top edge is covered by the left/right edge tiles for the corners. Then the top edge's own tiles only need to cover w-2. Similarly, the left edge covers the entire left edge including the corners, so it has length l. \n\nBut then we would require a|(w-2) and a|l. \n\nHow does that relate to w % a? \n\nWe have two conditions: \n   (w-2) mod a == 0   and   l mod a == 0.\n\nBut note: (w-2) mod a = (w mod a - 2 mod a) mod a. This is not linear.\n\nAlternatively, the condition might be that the entire boundary can be covered if one of the following holds:\n\n   (a) w mod a == 0 and (l-2) mod a == 0\n   (b) (w-2) mod a == 0 and l mod a == 0\n   (c) (w-1) mod a == 0 and (l-1) mod a == 0   [for the diagonal corner assignment]\n   (d) (w) mod a == 0 and (l) mod a == 0   # but then the corners? \n\nBut the total boundary area is 2*(w+l-2), and if a divides that, then the area condition is satisfied. And then we need one of the above four conditions for the edges.\n\nThe provided code only checks w % a <= 2. How does that cover the cases?\n\nLet me try the cases:\n\nCase 1: a|w and a|(l-2) -> then w mod a =0, which is <=2 -> valid.\n\nCase 2: a|(w-2) and a|l -> then w mod a = (w-2) mod a + 2 mod a = 0 + 2 = 2, so w mod a = 2? But wait: (w-2) mod a =0 means w mod a = 2? Only if 2 < a? If a<=2, then 2 mod a might not be 2. For example, a=1: then w mod 1=0, and 0<=2 -> valid. a=2: w mod 2 could be 0 or 1. If (w-2) mod 2 =0, then w mod 2 =0? Because (w-2) mod 2 = (w mod 2 - 0) = w mod 2. So we require w mod 2=0. Then w mod 2=0, which is <=2 -> valid.\n\nBut what if a=3 and w=5: then (w-2)=3, divisible by 3. Then w mod 3 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which is <=2 -> valid.\n\nCase 3: a|(w-1) and a|(l-1) -> then w mod a =1? (because (w-1) mod a=0). And 1<=2 -> valid.\n\nCase 4: a|w and a|l -> then w mod a=0, valid.\n\nTherefore, in all four cases, we have w mod a being either 0, 1, or 2. \n\nBut is the converse true? If w mod a is 0,1, or 2, then one of the cases holds? Not necessarily. For example, take w=4, l=4, a=3. \n   half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6, which is divisible by 3? 6 is divisible by 3, so a=3 is a divisor of 6.\n   w mod a = 4 mod 3 = 1 <=2 -> valid by the condition.\n   But can we tile a 4x4 bathroom with a=3?\n        total boundary area = 2*(4+4)-4 = 12, divisible by 3.\n        Now, the edges: \n            top: 4 -> we need to cover 4 with tiles of 3 and 1? We can do: one tile of 3 and one tile of 1. \n            bottom: 4 -> similarly.\n            left: 4-2=2 -> we need to cover 2: we can use two tiles of 1? But we have only 1x3 tiles. We cannot cover 2 with 3 and 1? 2 = 2*1, but we don't have 1x1? We can use the tile as 1x1 by setting it as 3x1? Then it covers 1. So two tiles of 1x1. \n            right: similarly.\n        Total tiles: (1+1) [top] + (1+1) [bottom] + 2 [left] + 2 [right] = 8 tiles. Total area covered: 8*3=24, but the boundary area is 12. This is not matching.\n\n        Alternatively, we might use the tile as 1x3 on the top edge: but 3 covers part of the top edge, then the remaining 1 on the top edge is covered by a tile of 1x1. Similarly for the others. But then we use 2 tiles for the top edge, 2 for the bottom, 2 for the left, 2 for the right: total 8. But the total area is 8*3=24, which is not 12.\n\n        Therefore, it should not be valid.\n\n        What went wrong? The tile has area 3. We need 12/3=4 tiles. But we used 8. \n\n        How to cover with 4 tiles? We cannot.\n\n        Therefore, the condition w % a <=2 is not sufficient? \n\n        But the known solution in the provided code might be incomplete.\n\n        Let me read the TODO in the provided code for program2.py:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        And then what? There is a comment by the problemsetter? \n\n        Looking at the sample code from a known submission for this problem (from Codeforces), we see:\n\n            if w % a <= (w >= a) and (l-2) % a == 0 and (l) % a == 0: \n                # not exactly\n\n        Actually, the known solution in the wild for this problem (e.g., from a past contest) is:\n\n            solutions = set()\n            total = 2*(w+l-2)\n            for d in divisors of total (or divisors of half_perimeter and also consider 2) ... \n\n            for a in candidate_divisors:\n                if a > total: break\n                if total % a != 0: continue\n                if w % a == 0 or w % a == 1 or w % a == 2 or (l % a == 0) or ... \n\n            but then they try the four cases.\n\n        Alternatively, the provided code might be doing:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # then it might be valid for case 1 or 2 or 3 or 4?\n                # but we need to check the other conditions.\n\n            In the TODO, we should also check the other edge.\n\n        Specifically, after checking w % a, we should also check l % a? \n\n        But the code has only w % a.\n\n        Let me try with the example that failed: w=4, l=4, a=3.\n            half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6, and 6 is divisible by 3, so a=3 is considered.\n            mod_a = w % a = 4 % 3 = 1, which is <=2 -> enter the if.\n            then what? We need to check something else.\n\n        The known solution in the provided code might be:\n\n            if mod_a == 0 or mod_a == 2 or (w >= a and mod_a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ... \n\n        This is complex.\n\n        After reading a known solution for the problem (e.g., from a Codeforces submission for problem \"Heretical \u2026 M\u00f6bius\" in a contest), we see:\n\n            def solve():\n                w, l = map(int, input().split())\n                ans = set()\n                for _ in range(2):\n                    for __ in range(2):\n                        g = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n                        ans.add(g)\n                        ans.add(g)\n                        for d in range(1, int(g**0.5)+1):\n                            if g % d == 0:\n                                ans.add(d)\n                                ans.add(g//d)\n                        l, w = w, l\n                # and then also consider other cases: gcd(w-2, l), gcd(w, l-2), gcd(w-1, l), gcd(w, l-1)\n                # then output the sorted list of divisors of the total boundary area that are in ans.\n\n        But the provided code in program2.py is different.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the provided code structure, I suspect that the TODO is to check the following:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # then check the other dimension: l\n                if (l-2) % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        But then we might add duplicates, so we use a set.\n\n        But note: the condition might be that either:\n\n            (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) OR\n            (w % a == 2 and (l) % a == 0) OR   # because w-2 might be divisible by a -> w % a =2\n            (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) OR\n            ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 1)   -> but we only have w % a, not (w-1) % a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can express in terms of w % a and l % a and (l-2) % a, etc.\n\n        But the provided code only has w and l.\n\n        A more efficient approach is to try the four cases explicitly for each divisor a:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) might be covered by the first two? Not exactly.\n\n        However, the example a=1: \n            w % 1=0, (l-2)%1=0 -> valid.\n        a=2 for w=3, l=5:\n            try case1: w %2 = 3%2=1, (l-2)%2=3%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case2: (w-2)%2 = 1%2=1, l%2=5%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: w%2=1, l%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case4: (w-1)%2=2%2=0, (l-1)%2=4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n        So a=2 is valid.\n\n        a=3 for w=3, l=5:\n            case1: 3%3=0, (5-2)=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n        a=4 for w=3, l=5: \n            case1: 3%4=3, (5-2)=3%4=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (3-2)=1%4=1, 5%4=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: 3%4=3, 5%4=1 -> not 0.\n            case4: (3-1)=2%4=2, (5-1)=4%4=0 -> not both 0.\n            -> invalid.\n\n        a=6: \n            case1: 3%6=3, (5-2)=3%6=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (3-2)=1%6=1, 5%6=5 -> not 0.\n            case3: 3%6=3, 5%6=5 -> not 0.\n            case4: (3-1)=2%6=2, (5-1)=4%6=4 -> not 0.\n            -> invalid.\n\n        a=1,2,3 are valid.\n\n        Therefore, we can do in the TODO:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0):   # this last condition might be for the case where the entire edge is covered including the corners by the same edge? \n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But wait, the last condition (w % a ==0 and l % a==0) is not necessary because it is covered by the first two? \n            If w % a==0 and l % a==0, then the first condition: w % a==0 and (l-2) % a might not be 0. \n            For example, w=4, l=4, a=2: \n                first condition: 4%2=0, (4-2)=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid.\n            So we don need the last condition.\n\n        But wait, what if a=1 for w=4, l=4: \n            first condition: 4%1=0, (4-2)=2%1=0 -> valid.\n\n        Therefore, we only need the first three cases? \n\n        However, the fourth case ( (w-1) % a ==0 and (l-1) % a==0 ) is not covered by the first two.\n\n        So we have three cases.\n\n        But note: there is also the case where the assignment is mixed: \n            top-left by left edge, top-right by top edge, bottom-right by right edge, bottom-left by bottom edge? \n        This might be covered by the third case? \n\n        Therefore, the TODO code might be:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the condition (w-1) % a ==0 is equivalent to (w % a == 1) only if a>1? For a=1, (w-1)%1=0 always. So we can also write:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 2 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)   # redundant because (w-1)%a==0 means w%a=1 (if a>1) or always true if a=1.\n\n        Actually, for a=1, all conditions are true.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 2 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 1 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ( (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 ):\n\n        But the last condition is the same as the third if we use the modulo in terms of w%a.\n\n        In fact, (w-1) % a == 0 if and only if w % a == 1, provided that a<=w. If a>w, then (w-1) % a = w-1, and w % a = w. So we must be careful.\n\n        Therefore, it is better to express in terms of modulo:\n\n            c1 = (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n            c2 = (l % a == 0) and ((w-2) % a == 0)   # note: this is different from the above: above was w%a==2 and l%a==0, but (w-2)%a==0 is not equivalent to w%a==2 (because if a>2, then (w-2)%a==0 means w%a=2, but if a<=2, then it might not).\n\n        For example, a=1: (w-2)%1=0 always, and l%1=0 always, so c2 is true.\n\n        a=2: (w-2)%2==0 means w is even, and l%2==0.\n\n        But note: the condition in the second case should be: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0.\n\n        Similarly, the third case: (w-1) % a ==0 and (l-1) % a==0.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            c1 = (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n            c2 = ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n            c3 = ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0)\n\n        Then if c1 or c2 or c3, then add a.\n\n        But note: the modulo operation for (l-2) % a: if l-2 is negative, then in Python it might not be 0 even if a divides l-2. But l>=3, so l-2>=1, and similarly for w-2 and w-1, l-1.\n\n        Therefore, in the TODO, we should do:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But wait, the example a=1: \n            c1: w%1==0 and (l-2)%1==0 -> true.\n            so we add a=1.\n\n        a=2 for w=3, l=5:\n            c1: w%2=1, (l-2)%2=3%2=1 -> not 0 -> false.\n            c2: (w-2)%2 = 1%2=1, l%2=5%2=1 -> not 0 -> false.\n            c3: (w-1)%2=2%2=0, (l-1)%2=4%2=0 -> true.\n            -> add a=2.\n\n        a=3 for w=3, l=5:\n            c1: 3%3=0, (5-2)=3%3=0 -> true.\n            -> add a=3.\n\n        a=6 for w=3, l=5:\n            c1: 3%6=3, (5-2)=3%6=3 -> not 0.\n            c2: (3-2)=1%6=1, 5%6=5 -> not 0.\n            c3: (3-1)=2%6=2, (5-1)=4%6=4 -> not 0.\n            -> skip.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is to add the above condition.\n\n        But note: the condition (w-2) % a ==0 might be written as (w-2) % a, and we want it to be 0.\n\n        So the code for the TODO is:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        However, note that the set `solutions` already contains 1 and 2. We are iterating from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and then for each divisor i we consider a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. And we are also including 1 and 2 initially. But the condition for a=1 and a=2 might be caught by the above condition? Yes, but we might also add them again. But the set will handle duplicates.\n\n        But note: the initial set has 1 and 2. Then we iterate and might add 1 and 2 again? But that is harmless.\n\n        However, we might miss some divisors? The provided code iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and for each divisor i of half_perimeter, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. But what about a= half_perimeter itself? When i = floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), then if i*i = half_perimeter, then we get a = i and a = i (duplicate). Otherwise, we get a = i and a = half_perimeter//i. And if half_perimeter is a divisor of itself, then when i is the smallest factor, we get a = half_perimeter when i is small and half_perimeter//i is large. So we will get it.\n\n        But note: the divisor 1 and 2 are already in the set. The divisor half_perimeter might be large, and we might not have added it initially. But the iteration will add it.\n\n        Also, note that the total boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter, so a must also be a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter. But the provided code only iterates over divisors of half_perimeter. Why?\n\n        Because the condition we are using (the three cases) might only require that a divides half_perimeter? But note: the three cases do not require that. They only require that a divides the expressions in the conditions. And a might be a divisor of 2*half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter. \n\n        For example, a=4 in the example w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, 2*half_perimeter=12. 4 divides 12, but not 6. And we do not iterate over divisors of 12, only over divisors of 6. So we would not consider a=4.\n\n        But a=4 is not valid for w=3, l=5: \n            c1: w%4=3, (l-2)%4=3%4=3 -> not 0.\n            c2: (w-2)%4=1%4=1, l%4=5%4=1 -> not 0.\n            c3: (w-1)%4=2%4=2, (l-1)%4=4%4=0 -> not both 0.\n            -> invalid.\n\n        But what about a=4 for other values? \n\n        For example, w=6, l=6: \n            half_perimeter = 6+6-2=10.\n            total boundary area = 2*(6+6)-4=20.\n            a=4: 20 is divisible by 4.\n            Check:\n                c1: w%4=2, (l-2)=4 -> 4%4=0 -> but w%4=2!=0 -> false.\n                c2: (w-2)=4%4=0, l%4=6%4=2 -> not 0 -> false.\n                c3: (w-1)=5%4=1, (l-1)=5%4=1 -> true.\n            -> valid.\n\n        But half_perimeter=10, and 4 is not a divisor of 10. So the provided code would not consider a=4.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is flawed. It only considers divisors of half_perimeter, but a must be a divisor of the total boundary area (2*half_perimeter). \n\n        How to fix? We should iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter? But the total boundary area is 2*half_perimeter, and the number of divisors might be more. And the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, and the total over test cases is at most 200000, so we can iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter for each test case? But the number of test cases is at most 100, and the number of divisors of 2*half_perimeter is at most about 2 * (number of divisors of half_perimeter) (because 2*half_perimeter has at most twice the divisors of half_perimeter). And the number of divisors of half_perimeter is about O(sqrt(half_perimeter)), which is about 10^5 for half_perimeter up to 10^9? Actually, the maximum number of divisors is about 1344 for numbers up to 10^9. So 100 * 1344 * 2 = 268800, which is within 200000? Wait, 268800 > 200000. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. The output is the sorted list of valid a for each test case. The total number of integers printed is at most 200000. But the set `solutions` for each test case might have up to 1344*2 = 2688 divisors, and 100 test cases would be 268800, which is greater than 200000. \n\n        Therefore, the provided code might be intended to only consider the divisors of half_perimeter, and then also consider the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\n        But the sample initial set has 1 and 2. And then the iteration is for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1). \n\n        To capture divisors of 2*half_perimeter that are not divisors of half_perimeter, we would need to iterate over divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem is known, I think the intended solution is to consider the divisors of the following quantities:\n\n            g0 = 2\n            g1 = w\n            g2 = l\n            g3 = w-1\n            g4 = w-2\n            g5 = l-1\n            g6 = l-2\n\n        and then for each divisor a of the total boundary area (2*(w+l-2)) that is at least 1, we check the three conditions.\n\n        But the provided code structure is fixed.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have a constraint that a must be at most half_perimeter? \n\n        But a can be up to 2*half_perimeter.\n\n        Given the time, and since the provided code only iterates on divisors of half_perimeter, and the sample test cases work, I will assume that the intended solution in the provided code is to consider only the divisors of half_perimeter, and also a=1 and a=2 are given. \n\n        And the note: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\" -> so the intended solution might be to consider only the divisors of half_perimeter, and then also consider the divisors of half_perimeter for the three cases, and that is sufficient because the valid a must divide half_perimeter in the three cases? \n\n        Let me check the three cases:\n\n        In case1: a must divide w and (l-2). Then a must divide gcd(w, l-2). And gcd(w, l-2) might not be a divisor of half_perimeter = w+l-2? \n\n        For example, w=4, l=4: \n            gcd(4, 4-2)=gcd(4,2)=2, and half_perimeter=4+4-2=6, and 2 divides 6.\n\n        In case2: a must divide (w-2) and l -> then a must divide gcd(w-2, l). And gcd(w-2, l) might divide half_perimeter? \n            w=4, l=4: gcd(2,4)=2, which divides 6.\n\n        In case3: a must divide (w-1) and (l-1) -> then a must divide gcd(w-1, l-1). And gcd(w-1, l-1) might divide half_perimeter? \n            w=4, l=4: gcd(3,3)=3, which divides 6.\n\n        In fact, in each case, a must divide a divisor of half_perimeter? Not necessarily. For example, take w=5, l=5:\n            half_perimeter=5+5-2=8.\n            case1: a must divide gcd(5,3)=1.\n            case2: a must divide gcd(3,5)=1.\n            case3: a must divide gcd(4,4)=4, and 4 divides 8.\n            So a=4 is valid.\n\n        But also, a=8 might be valid? \n            case1: 5%8=5, (5-2)=3%8=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: (5-2)=3%8=3, 5%8=5 -> not 0.\n            case3: (5-1)=4%8=4, (5-1)=4%8=4 -> not 0.\n            -> invalid.\n\n        a=2: \n            case1: 5%2=1, 3%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case2: 3%2=1, 5%2=1 -> not 0.\n            case3: 4%2=0, 4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n        a=1: valid.\n\n        a=4: valid by case3.\n\n        So the valid a are 1,2,4.\n\n        But half_perimeter=8, and its divisors are 1,2,4,8. We would consider a=1,2,4,8. And then for a=8, it fails. For a=4, it passes by case3.\n\n        Therefore, by iterating the divisors of half_perimeter, we get a=1,2,4,8. We then filter by the three conditions, and only 1,2,4 are kept.\n\n        But note: the total boundary area is 2*8=16. The valid a must divide 16. The divisors of 16 are: 1,2,4,8,16. We are not considering 16 because it is not a divisor of half_perimeter=8. \n\n        Check a=16 for w=5, l=5:\n            case1: 5%16=5, 3%16=3 -> not 0.\n            case2: 3%16=3, 5%16=5 -> not 0.\n            case3: 4%16=4, 4%16=4 -> not 0.\n            -> invalid.\n\n        So it's fine.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is correct in iterating the divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n        So the final code for the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the condition (w-1) % a == 0 might be written as (w-1) % a, and similarly for (l-1) % a.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        However, note that in program2.py, the TODO is inside a loop that iterates over a in [i, div] (which are divisors of half_perimeter). And we are also inside an if that checks w % a <=2. We can remove that if? Or keep it and then do the detailed condition inside? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO\n\n        We can replace the TODO with the detailed condition, and remove the if mod_a<=2? \n\n        But the condition mod_a<=2 might be an optimization. Without it, we would do the detailed condition for every divisor. The detailed condition is cheap. But the set of divisors is not too large, so we can remove the if mod_a<=2.\n\n        However, the problem says to complete the TODO, and the if mod_a<=2 is there. So we must use it? \n\n        But the condition mod_a<=2 is necessary to avoid? For example, if w % a =3, then we skip. But in the detailed condition, if w % a =3, then the first condition (w%a==0) fails, the second condition ( (w-2)%a==0 ) would be (3-2=1) % a =1, which is not 0, and the third condition ( (w-1)%a==0 ) would be (3-1=2) % a =2, which is not 0. So it would fail. Therefore, the detailed condition would also skip it. So the if mod_a<=2 is redundant if we do the detailed condition. \n\n        But the if mod_a<=2 might be an optimization to avoid doing the detailed condition for a that have w % a >2.\n\n        Since the TODO is inside the if mod_a<=2, we will do the detailed condition only when w % a is 0,1, or 2.\n\n        Therefore, we leave it.\n\n        So the code for program2.py in the TODO is:\n\n            if ( (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or\n                 ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or\n                 ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) ):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the condition (w-2) % a ==0 might be true even if w % a is 0 or 1 or 2. For example, if w % a =0, then (w-2) % a = (0-2) mod a = a-2, which is not 0 (unless a=1 or a=2). So the conditions are not redundant.\n\n        We do the detailed condition only when w % a is 0,1, or 2.\n\n        This is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n            if s in d and d[s] <= n - (idx+1):\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        And for program2.py is:\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        We output in the required JSON format.\n\n        Note: In program2.py, the condition is long, so we write it in one line.\n\n        Let me write the JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] <= n - (idx+1):\\n        r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\",\n            \"program2\": \"if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\\n        solutions.add(a)\"\n        }\n\n        But wait, in the provided program2.py, the TODO is at an indentation level of 8 (inside two loops). We must maintain the same indentation. The provided code has:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with two lines (the if condition and the set add). We must indent by 8 more spaces? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the comment. We can write:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But the if is already at an indentation level of 8 (from the for loops). The two lines should be indented by 8 more spaces? \n\n        In the provided code, the TODO is at the same level as the comment, which is inside the if and inside the for loop. So we add two lines with the same indentation.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py in the TODO is exactly as above, with the same indentation.\n\n        But note: the variable `solutions` is a set.\n\n        We output the string for program1 and program2.\n\n        However, in program1.py, the TODO is in a for loop and inside an if. We must be careful to use the same variable names.\n\n        Let me write the exact string for program1.py:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] <= n - (idx+1):\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: the variable `idx` in the second loop is the index in the reversed array. The number of candies from the right is `idx+1`.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        We output the JSON."
