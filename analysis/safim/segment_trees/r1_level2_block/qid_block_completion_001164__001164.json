When i=2, we consider a=2 and a=3. We don't have a=6 in the loop? How do we get a=6? The current code: for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1) -> for half_perimeter=6, i goes from 2 to 2. Then we consider a=2 and a=3. We don't consider a=6. But note: the initial set has 1 and 2. We are missing 6. We can also note that 6 = half_perimeter, and we are not iterating i=6 because sqrt(6) is about 2.4, so floor is 2. We don't iterate i=6. But the code does: for each divisor i, it also takes a = half_perimeter // i. When i=2, we get a=3. When i=3? we don't iterate i=3 because the range is up to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2.\n\n            To get 6, we can note that 6 = half_perimeter, and we haven't considered it. The initial set has 1 and 2. Should we add half_perimeter? But half_perimeter=6, and 6 is a divisor of half_perimeter? yes, because 6 divides 6. But we haven't iterated it.",

In the loop, i=2: then a in [2,3]. We don't get 6. But we do get 6 as 2*a when a=3. Also, the divisor a=1: we have it in the initial set. We would also consider 2*1=2, which is already there. What about the divisor a= half_perimeter itself (6)? We haven't considered it in the loop, but we will consider it as 2*a when a=3. What about the divisor a=12? We would get it as 2*a when a=6, but a=6 is not in the loop. But note: when a=3, we consider 2*a=6, and then in the next iteration for a=6? we don't have a=6 in the loop. So we miss 12. How to get 12? \n                12 = 2 * 6, and 6 is not in the loop. But 6 = half_perimeter, and we could get it from the divisor i=3: then a = half_perimeter//3 = 2, and then 2*a=4, not 6. Alternatively, we can also consider in the TODO block: for the current a, also consider cand = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) [which is the other divisor we are considering] and also 2 * (half_perimeter // a) might be 2*(6//2)=6 when a=2, and 2*(6//3)=4 when a=3. So we are already considering 6 when a=2: because when a=2, we consider cand=2 and 4, and also we should consider the other divisor for this i: which is half_perimeter//2=3, and then for a=3, we consider 3 and 6. Therefore, we are covering 6. But 12 = 2 * 6, and 6 is not a divisor of half_perimeter?",

Then we consider for a=3: cand=6. So we consider 6. For 12: we would need to consider for a=6: then cand=6 and 12. But a=6 is not in the loop. Therefore, we are missing 12. To get 12, we can also consider in the TODO block: cand = 2 * half_perimeter // a. \n                boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter. cand = boundary_area // a   might be a divisor? But note: a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then boundary_area // a = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) -> which is exactly 2 * (the other divisor for this i).

But note: boundary_area//d = 2 * (half_perimeter // d) -> which is exactly what we are also considering as 2 * (half_perimeter//d) when we process the divisor (half_perimeter//d). Example: half_perimeter=6, boundary_area=12.\n                d=2: we consider a=2 and then cand=2 and 4, and also a=3 (which is half_perimeter//2) and then cand=3 and 6. d=3: we would normally process it, but in our loop we only go up to sqrt(6) which is 2, so we don't process d=3 explicitly, but we do process it as the complementary of d=2. Therefore, by iterating the divisors of half_perimeter and for each divisor a in {i, half_perimeter//i} we consider cand in {a, 2*a, boundary_area//a, boundary_area//(2*a)}? But boundary_area//a = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) -> which is the same as 2 * (the other divisor for the same i) -> and we will get that when we process the other divisor. Example: for i=2, we have a=2 and a=3.\n                for a=2: we consider cand in {2,4} and also boundary_area//2=6 and boundary_area//4=3 (which is not an integer? 12//4=3, which is integer) -> so we consider 2,4,6,3.\n                for a=3: we consider cand in {3,6} and boundary_area//3=4 and boundary_area//6=2.

But it might also be wrong: for example, a=3 in the sample: w=3, 3%3=0<=2 -> true.\n\n            a=2: 3%2=1<=2 -> true. a=4: 3%4=3>2 -> skip. a=6: 3%6=3>2 -> skip. So it filters out a=4 and a=6, which is good because they are not valid. But is it always safe?",

Specifically, the set of divisors of 2 * half_perimeter is the union of:\n\n                { d for d in divisors(half_perimeter) } \n                and { 2*d for d in divisors(half_perimeter) }   -> but not exactly: because if half_perimeter is even, then 2 might already be a divisor of half_perimeter, so 2*d might be in the first set? Actually, the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter are:\n\n                divisors(2 * half_perimeter) = { d, 2*d : d in divisors(half_perimeter) }   -> no, that is not true. Example: half_perimeter=6, then divisors of 6: {1,2,3,6}. Then {d, 2*d} = {1,2,3,6,2,4,6,12}. But the divisors of 12 are {1,2,3,4,6,12}. So it works. But if half_perimeter=3, then divisors of 3: {1,3}. Then {d,2*d} = {1,2,3,6}. And the divisors of 6 are {1,2,3,6}. So it works.",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges: `program1.py` and `program2.py`. Each program has a distinct problem statement and requires a specific approach to find the solution.\n\n### Program1.py: Maximum Candies Eaten by Alice and Bob\nThe goal is to determine the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the sum of the weights of candies Alice eats from the left equals the sum of the weights of candies Bob eats from the right. \n\n#### Approach\n1. **Two Pointers Technique**: Use two pointers, `i` starting at the beginning (left) and `j` starting at the end (right) of the candy array.\n2. **Sum Tracking**: Maintain two sums, `lsum` for Alice (left sum) and `rsum` for Bob (right sum).\n3. **Pointer Movement**:\n   - If `lsum` is less than `rsum`, move the left pointer `i` to the right and add the candy weight to `lsum`.\n   - If `rsum` is less than `lsum`, move the right pointer `j` to the left and add the candy weight to `rsum`.\n   - If `lsum` equals `rsum`, update the best solution (total candies eaten), move both pointers inward, and update their sums if they haven't crossed each other.\n\n#### Solution Code for Program1.py\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n    i += 1\\n    j -= 1\\n    if i < j:\\n        lsum += arr[i]\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n}\n```\n\n### Program2.py: Filling Locks with Minimum Pipes\nThe goal is to determine the minimum number of pipes needed to fill all locks within a given time `t` for each query.\n\n#### Approach\n1. **Precompute Minimum Time**: Calculate the minimum time `t_min` required to fill all locks by iterating through each lock and computing the maximum of the ceiling values of the cumulative sum of volumes divided by the lock index.\n2. **Query Processing**: For each query time `q`:\n   - If `q` is less than `t_min`, output `-1` as it's impossible to fill all locks in time `q`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the minimum number of pipes as the ceiling of the total volume sum divided by `q`.\n\n#### Solution Code for Program2.py\nThe solution for `program2.py` involves using the precomputed total volume sum `s` to determine the minimum pipes required for each query time `q` by computing `(s + q - 1) // q`.\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1.py**: The solution efficiently finds the maximum number of candies by balancing the sums from both ends.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs (program1.py and program2.py) that are identical and have a missing block.\n The problem: We must output the missing code for both program1.py and program2.py such that when run as \n \"python3 program1.py | python3 program2.py\" it works correctly.\n\n However, note that the problem states that both program1.py and program2.py have missing lines or blocks.\n But in the provided code for both, the missing part is the same: a TODO block.\n\n After reading the problem, we understand that we are to find all divisors 'a' (with some conditions) of the half_perimeter (which is w+l-2) \n that satisfy certain tiling conditions.\n\n The current code initializes a set `solutions` with {1,2}. Then it iterates over factors of `half_perimeter` (by iterating up to sqrt(half_perimeter)).\n For each divisor `i` of half_perimeter, it considers two divisors: `i` and `div = half_perimeter // i`.\n Then for each candidate `a` in [i, div], it checks if `w % a <= 2`. But note: the condition is not sufficient.\n\n Actually, the problem has more constraints. The boundary is made of four sides. However, note that the corners are shared by two sides.\n\n There are essentially four ways to assign the boundary tiles (which are 1xa) without overlapping and covering the entire boundary:\n\n 1. The entire boundary is covered by tiles that are placed without rotation? Actually, they can be rotated so they can be either horizontal or vertical.\n\n But note: the boundary is a rectangle of width w and length l. The boundary has:\n   - two sides of length w (left and right) and two sides of length l (top and bottom). However, the corners are shared.\n\n The total boundary tiles (without corners) would be: \n   (w-2) on the top and bottom? Actually, the entire boundary without corners is: \n   top: l-2, bottom: l-2, left: w-2, right: w-2? But wait, that leaves the corners.\n\n Actually, the boundary is: \n   top: l, bottom: l, left: w-2, right: w-2? That doesn't add up.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the boundary as having two horizontal strips (each of length l) and two vertical strips (each of length w-2) but then we have double counted the corners.\n\n Actually, the entire boundary (the perimeter) is 2*(w+l) - 4 (because each corner is shared by two sides, and we subtract the 4 corners that are counted twice? \n But note: the tiles are 1xa, so we are covering the entire boundary with tiles that are 1 unit wide and a units long (or rotated). \n\n However, note the problem says: \n   interior: (w-2)*(l-2) of 1x1 tiles.\n   boundary: the rest, which is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\n So the total boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4. Since each boundary tile has area a (if placed without rotation) or a (if rotated, then it's 1xa so area a), \n we must have that the boundary area is divisible by a. Therefore, a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l)-4.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire boundary is covered by tiles of the same orientation? However, the area condition is necessary.\n\n However, that is not sufficient. We must also be able to assign the tiles without gaps or overlaps.\n\n There are four critical segments (the four sides) and the corners are shared. The problem can be broken down by considering the corners.\n\n Actually, the problem has been discussed in Codeforces problems (e.g., Round #735 (Div. 2), problem C). The solution is known.\n\n The conditions for a valid a (besides being a divisor of the boundary area, which is 2*(w+l)-4) are:\n\n   Condition 1: The entire boundary can be covered if we can cover the four sides. The sides are:\n\n        Top: from (0,0) to (l,0) -> length l\n        Bottom: from (0,w) to (l,w) -> length l\n        Left: from (0,0) to (0,w) -> length w\n        Right: from (l,0) to (l,w) -> length w\n\n   But note: the corners (0,0), (0,w), (l,0), (l,w) are shared.\n\n   We can break the boundary into four segments (each without the corners) and then the corners are covered by two tiles (one from each adjacent side).\n\n   However, the problem allows the tile to be rotated. So a tile can be placed horizontally or vertically.\n\n   The key is that the boundary is divided into four straight segments:\n\n        Segment 1: top row, from (1,0) to (l-1,0) -> length l-2\n        Segment 2: bottom row, from (1,w) to (l-1,w) -> length l-2\n        Segment 3: left column, from (0,1) to (0,w-1) -> length w-2\n        Segment 4: right column, from (l,1) to (l,w-1) -> length w-2\n\n   And the four corners: (0,0), (0,w), (l,0), (l,w). Each corner must be covered by a tile that is placed such that it covers the corner and extends along one of the sides.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the entire boundary is covered by the same tile size? Actually, it does: the boundary uses tiles of size 1xa.\n\n   How can we cover the boundary? There are a few patterns:\n\n   Pattern 1: The entire boundary is covered by horizontal and vertical tiles. The corners are covered by two tiles meeting at the corner.\n\n   However, the problem has been studied and known solutions are:\n\n   We must have that a divides the boundary area: 2*(w+l)-4. But also, we must be able to assign the tiles to the sides without gaps.\n\n   There are four cases for the corners:\n\n   Case 1: The top-left corner is covered by a horizontal tile. Then the top row from (0,0) to (a,0) is covered by one tile. Then the next tile starts at (a,0) and so on.\n\n   But note: the problem is symmetric. The known conditions are:\n\n        Condition A: a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l)-4.\n\n        Additionally, one of the following must hold:\n\n          1. w mod a == 0 and l mod a == 0   -> but wait, this is too strong? \n\n        Actually, we have four conditions at the corners:\n\n          - The top-left corner: the tile that covers (0,0) can extend to the right (covering the top) or downward (covering the left). Similarly for the other corners.\n\n        After analysis, the known solution (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n          The value a is valid if and only if:\n\n            (a divides 2*(w+l)-4) and \n            ( (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) OR\n              (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) OR\n              ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) OR\n              ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) OR   # but note: this might be two different patterns?\n            )\n\n        Actually, there are four cases:\n\n          Case 1: All four corners are covered by horizontal tiles? Not exactly.\n\n        Known solution from Codeforces Round #735 (Div. 2) problem C:\n\n          The conditions are:\n\n            a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l)-4, and also:\n\n            Case 1: a divides w-2 and a divides l.   -> then we can cover the top and bottom with horizontal tiles (without covering the corners? actually we leave the corners for the vertical sides) and the vertical sides (left and right) with vertical tiles? But then the top and bottom would be of length l, and we have to cover the top and bottom without the corners? Actually, the top and bottom would be covered by tiles that cover the entire top including the corners? \n\n          Actually, the known solution is to consider the following four conditions (which are independent of the divisor condition):\n\n            Condition 1: The entire boundary can be covered if:\n\n              Option 1: The top and bottom are covered by horizontal tiles and the left and right by vertical tiles. Then:\n\n                  - The top row: we need to cover a length l. But the leftmost tile on the top must start at (0,0) and go right. Similarly, the rightmost tile must end at (l,0). However, the leftmost tile on the top might be shared with the left wall? Actually, the corner (0,0) is covered by two tiles: one from the top and one from the left? \n\n              Instead, we break the boundary without the corners. The top row without the two corners is l-2. Similarly, the bottom without corners is l-2, the left without corners is w-2, the right without corners is w-2.\n\n              But then we have the four corners: each corner must be covered by a tile that is placed in the corner and then extends along one of the sides? Actually, the problem allows the tile to be rotated arbitrarily. \n\n          After reading known solutions, the typical solution is:\n\n            Let total = 2*(w+l) - 4   # the boundary area\n\n            Then we consider the divisors of total. But we also check:\n\n              if a <= max(w, l):   # because a tile cannot be longer than the side? but note: the tile can be rotated so it can be placed vertically on a side of length w (so a must be <= w) or horizontally on a side of length l (so a must be <= l). Actually, the tile must fit in the side. So a must be <= max(w, l). However, note that the boundary has segments of length w and l, but also the segments without corners are w-2 and l-2. However, the tile might cover multiple segments? Actually, no: each tile is 1xa and must be placed entirely on one side? \n\n            Actually, the tile can be placed on a side and it must cover consecutive cells. So the tile of length a must be placed on a side that has at least a consecutive cells. Therefore, a must be <= the length of the side it is placed on. The sides have lengths: w and l. But note: the side of length w is the left and right, and the side of length l is the top and bottom. So a must be <= max(w, l). However, w and l are at least 3, and a divisor of total (which is 2*(w+l)-4) might be large? But note: the divisors we iterate are up to sqrt(total) and we consider both i and total//i. Since total is about 2*(w+l) and w,l up to 1e9, total can be up to 4e9, so the divisors we iterate are up to sqrt(4e9) which is about 63245, which is acceptable.\n\n            Now, the conditions for the tiling:\n\n              We have four corners. The tile covering a corner must cover the corner and extend along one of the two sides. There are two possibilities for each corner? But the problem has been solved by considering the following:\n\n                Condition 1: The entire boundary can be covered if:\n\n                  - The top row (from (0,0) to (l,0)) is covered by horizontal tiles. The bottom row similarly. The left and right by vertical tiles.\n\n                  Then the top row must be covered by tiles that are placed horizontally. The length of the top row is l. The leftmost tile on the top row must cover (0,0) and extend to the right. Similarly, the rightmost tile must cover (l,0) and extend to the left? Actually, the tile at (0,0) must cover the corner and then extend to the right (covering the top) and also the tile at (0,0) must cover the corner and extend downward (covering the left) is not possible? Because the tile is 1xa: it can only extend in one direction.\n\n                Actually, the tile at (0,0) must be placed either horizontally or vertically. But then the adjacent tile must meet it.\n\n            Known solution (from Codeforces submissions) for this problem:\n\n              We consider the following four cases:\n\n                Case 1: The four corners are covered by two horizontal and two vertical tiles? Actually, the known conditions are:\n\n                  Condition A: (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0)   -> then we can cover the entire boundary by having the top and bottom as horizontal and the sides as vertical? But note: the top row: we need to cover l, and if l % a == 0, then we can cover the top and bottom with horizontal tiles. Similarly, the sides: w % a == 0, so we can cover the sides with vertical tiles. However, the corners: the top-left corner is covered by the top tile and the left tile? But the top tile starts at (0,0) and goes right, and the left tile starts at (0,0) and goes down? Then the corner (0,0) is covered by both? That is not allowed.\n\n                Actually, we must have the top row starting at (0,0) and going right for a units, then the next tile, etc. The left wall would start at (0,0) and go down? But then the tile at (0,0) for the left wall would cover (0,0) to (0,a) and the top tile would cover (0,0) to (a,0). Then the cell (0,0) is covered by both? That is an overlap.\n\n            Correction: The boundary is covered by tiles that are placed on the boundary. The problem does not require that the entire tile is on one side? Actually, the tile must be placed entirely on the boundary. But the boundary is made of four sides. Therefore, a tile that is placed horizontally on the top row will not extend to the left wall? It will be on the top row only.\n\n            How to cover the corner? The corner must be covered by one tile that is placed such that it covers the corner and then extends along one side. The adjacent side then starts at the next cell.\n\n            Therefore, the top row must be covered by tiles that start at the left end and go right. The first tile on the top row must cover (0,0) to (a,0). Then the next tile from (a,0) to (2a,0), etc. Similarly, the left wall must start at (0,1) to (0,1+a) because (0,0) is already covered by the top row.\n\n            Then the condition for the left wall: the left wall has w-1 cells (from (0,1) to (0,w-1))? Actually, the left wall has w cells: from (0,0) to (0,w). But we already covered (0,0) with the top row. So we have (0,1) to (0,w) to cover. Similarly, the bottom row: from (0,w) to (l,w) -> but (0,w) is the bottom-left corner. We cover it with the bottom row? Then the left wall ends at (0,w-1). Similarly, the right wall: from (l,0) to (l,w) -> but (l,0) is covered by the top row? So the right wall starts at (l,1) and goes to (l,w-1).\n\n            Therefore, the top row: length l must be divisible by a? \n            The bottom row: length l must be divisible by a?\n            The left wall: we have to cover from (0,1) to (0,w-1): that's w-1 cells? -> must be divisible by a? \n            The right wall: w-1 cells? -> must be divisible by a?\n\n            But wait: the bottom row: we start at (0,w) and go to (l,w). The first tile covers (0,w) to (a,w). Then the next from (a,w) to (2a,w). But the corner (l,w) is the bottom-right corner. How is that covered? The bottom row tile must end at (l,w). So l must be divisible by a? and the right wall: from (l,1) to (l,w-1) -> that's w-2 cells? \n\n            Actually, the boundary without corners:\n\n              Top: from (0,0) to (l,0) -> l+1 points? But we are covering the edges between the points? Actually, we are covering the cells. The grid has:\n\n                Cells: (i,j) for i in [0, l-1] and j in [0, w-1]? \n\n            The problem states: the bathroom has width w and length l. The grid has w rows and l columns? Or vice versa? The problem does not specify. But note: the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). So the grid has:\n\n                Rows: from 0 to w-1 (height w) and columns from 0 to l-1 (length l).\n\n            The boundary:\n\n                Top row: j=0, i from 0 to l-1 -> l cells.\n                Bottom row: j=w-1, i from 0 to l-1 -> l cells.\n                Left column: i=0, j from 1 to w-2 -> w-2 cells? \n                Right column: i=l-1, j from 1 to w-2 -> w-2 cells.\n\n            And the corners: (0,0), (0,w-1), (l-1,0), (l-1,w-1) are the four corners.\n\n            Therefore, the boundary without the corners is:\n\n                Top: l - 2 (because we remove the two corners) -> but wait, the top row has l cells: we remove the two corners? Actually, the top row has two corners: (0,0) and (l-1,0). So the non-corner part of the top row is l-2 cells? Similarly, the bottom row: l-2 cells. The left column: without the top and bottom corners, we have w-2 cells. Similarly, the right column: w-2 cells.\n\n            Total boundary cells: 2*(l-2) + 2*(w-2) + 4 (the corners) = 2l-4+2w-4+4 = 2*(w+l)-4, which matches.\n\n            Now, the tiling:\n\n              The corners: each corner must be covered by a tile that is placed such that it covers the corner and then extends along one of the sides. But note: the tile is 1xa. So if we place a tile horizontally at the top-left corner, it will cover the top row from (0,0) to (a-1,0). Then the next tile starts at (a,0). Similarly, if we place a tile vertically at the top-left corner, it will cover (0,0) to (0,a-1).\n\n            There are two possibilities for the top-left corner: horizontal or vertical. Similarly for the other corners.\n\n            The known solution in Codeforces for this problem (C. Tiles) is to consider the following four cases:\n\n              Case 1: The top-left corner is covered by a horizontal tile and the top-right corner is covered by a horizontal tile. Then the bottom-left and bottom-right are covered by vertical tiles? \n\n              Actually, we have four patterns:\n\n                Pattern 1: All corners are covered by horizontal tiles on the top and bottom, and vertical tiles on the sides? But then the top row: the entire top row (including the corners) is covered by horizontal tiles. Similarly, the bottom row by horizontal tiles. The left and right columns by vertical tiles. However, the left column: we have to cover from (0,1) to (0,w-2) because the corners (0,0) and (0,w-1) are already covered? Then the left column has w-2 cells. Similarly, the right column: w-2 cells. Then the conditions are:\n\n                  - The top row: l must be divisible by a? \n                  - The bottom row: l must be divisible by a?\n                  - The left column: w-2 must be divisible by a?\n                  - The right column: w-2 must be divisible by a?\n\n                Pattern 2: The top-left corner is covered by a horizontal tile, the top-right corner by a vertical tile, the bottom-left by a vertical tile, and the bottom-right by a horizontal tile? \n\n                Pattern 3: The top-left corner is covered by a vertical tile, the top-right by a horizontal tile, the bottom-left by a horizontal tile, and the bottom-right by a vertical tile? \n\n                Pattern 4: The top-left corner is covered by a vertical tile, the top-right by a vertical tile, and the bottom-left and bottom-right by horizontal tiles? \n\n            Actually, the known solution is to consider the following four conditions (which are necessary and sufficient):\n\n              Condition 1: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n              Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n              Condition 3: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   # this is a different pattern: the corners are covered by two tiles that meet at the corner? \n              Condition 4: (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0)   # but then we have the entire boundary covered by horizontal and vertical tiles? \n\n            However, Condition 4: if w % a == 0 and l % a == 0, then we can cover the top and bottom by horizontal tiles (each of length l) and the sides by vertical tiles (each of length w). But then the corners: the top-left corner is covered by the top tile and the left tile? That would be an overlap. So Condition 4 might not be valid.\n\n            Actually, Condition 4 is not valid? \n\n            Let me check with the sample: w=3, l=5, a=1: \n                Condition 1: (3-2)%1==0 and 5%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition 2: 3%1==0 and (5-2)%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition 3: (3-1)%1==0 and (5-1)%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition 4: 3%1==0 and 5%1==0 -> true.\n\n            But a=1 is valid. So Condition 4 is valid? \n\n            How does it work for a=1? \n                We can cover the entire boundary with 1x1 tiles. Then the top row: 5 tiles, each 1x1 -> 5 tiles. The bottom row: 5 tiles. The left column: 3 tiles, but the top and bottom are already covered? So the left column: only the middle one? Similarly, the right column: the middle one. Actually, the boundary has 2*(3+5)-4 = 12 cells. With 12 tiles of 1x1, we cover the boundary.\n\n            But Condition 4: if we use a=1, then we can cover the top row: 5 tiles of 1x1 -> 5, which is divisible by 1. Similarly, the bottom row: 5. The left column: 3, which is divisible by 1. The right column: 3. However, the corner cells are shared? \n\n            Actually, if we cover the entire boundary with 1x1 tiles, we don't have the problem of overlapping because each tile is 1x1. The top-left tile is placed at (0,0) and covers that cell. Then the next tile to the right is (1,0) and the next tile down is (0,1). There is no overlap.\n\n            But if a>1, then Condition 4: \n                We cover the top row with horizontal tiles: we need l tiles? Actually, we need l/a tiles for the top row. Similarly, the bottom row: l/a tiles. The left column: we cover the entire left column (from (0,0) to (0,w-1)) with w/a tiles. Similarly, the right column: w/a tiles. But then the top-left corner is covered by the top row tile and the left column tile? That is an overlap at (0,0). \n\n            Therefore, Condition 4 is not valid for a>1? \n\n            Actually, we can avoid the overlap by not covering the corners with the side tiles? But the problem says the boundary is covered. The top row must cover (0,0) to (l-1,0). The left column must cover (0,0) to (0,w-1). Then (0,0) is covered by both.\n\n            So Condition 4 is not valid? \n\n            However, the sample a=1 works because the tile at (0,0) is one tile and we assign it to the top row? and then the left column starts at (0,1). But then the left column would not cover (0,0). \n\n            How do we assign the tiles? The problem does not specify how to assign, but we must cover the entire boundary without gaps or overlaps.\n\n            For Condition 4, we can do:\n\n              Top row: from (0,0) to (l-1,0) -> covered by horizontal tiles. \n              Bottom row: from (0,w-1) to (l-1,w-1) -> covered by horizontal tiles.\n              Left column: from (0,1) to (0,w-2) -> covered by vertical tiles.\n              Right column: from (l-1,1) to (l-1,w-2) -> covered by vertical tiles.\n\n            Then the corners: (0,0) and (0,w-1) and (l-1,0) and (l-1,w-1) are covered by the top and bottom rows. The left and right columns do not cover the corners. \n\n            But then the left column has w-2 cells? and we require that (w-2) % a == 0? But Condition 4 does not require that. Condition 4 only requires w % a == 0 and l % a == 0.\n\n            So Condition 4 is not sufficient? \n\n            Actually, Condition 4 might be valid if we cover the top and bottom rows entirely (including the corners) and the left and right columns only the non-corner parts. Then the left column has w-2 cells. So we require (w-2) % a == 0? But Condition 4 does not require that.\n\n            Therefore, Condition 4 is not valid by itself? \n\n            After checking known Codeforces solutions for problem \"C. Tiles\" (Round #735), we see that the typical solution is to consider the divisors of 2*(w+l)-4 and then check the following four conditions:\n\n              if (w % a == 0 && l % a == 0) -> then we can cover the top and bottom with horizontal tiles (each of length l) and the left and right with vertical tiles (each of length w) but then we have double counted the corners? \n\n            Actually, the known solution in C++ for this problem is:\n\n              set<int> s;\n              s.insert(1);\n              s.insert(2);\n              long long total = 2*(w+l) - 4;\n              for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(total); i++) {\n                  if (total % i == 0) {\n                      if (check(i, w, l)) s.insert(i);\n                      if (check(total/i, w, l)) s.insert(total/i);\n                  }\n              }\n\n              where check(a, w, l) is:\n\n                  if (w % a == 0 && l % a == 0) return true;\n                  if (w % a == 0 && (l-2) % a == 0) return true;\n                  if ((w-2) % a == 0 && l % a == 0) return true;\n                  if ((w-1) % a == 0 && (l-1) % a == 0) return true;\n                  if (a == 2) return true;   // but note: 2 is already inserted? \n                  return false;\n\n            But wait, the sample w=3, l=5, a=1: \n                Condition1: 3%1==0 and 5%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition2: 3%1==0 and (5-2)%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition3: (3-2)%1==0 and 5%1==0 -> true.\n                Condition4: (3-1)%1==0 and (5-1)%1==0 -> true.\n\n            So a=1 is valid.\n\n            a=2: \n                Condition1: 3%2=1 !=0 -> false.\n                Condition2: 3%2=1 !=0 -> false.\n                Condition3: (3-2)%2=1%2=1 !=0 -> false.\n                Condition4: (3-1)%2=2%2=0 and (5-1)%2=4%2=0 -> true.\n\n            a=3:\n                Condition1: 3%3=0 and 5%3=2 -> false.\n                Condition2: 3%3=0 and (5-2)=3%3=0 -> true.\n\n            So a=3 is valid.\n\n            Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n              Condition1: (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0)\n              Condition2: (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0)\n              Condition3: ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0)\n              Condition4: ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)\n\n            But note: the problem also allows a=2 to be inserted initially. However, in the sample a=2 is covered by condition4.\n\n            However, the initial set has {1,2}. Why 2? Because the sample also has a=2. But we see that a=2 is covered by condition4.\n\n            But wait: what if a=2 is not a divisor of total? Then we wouldn't consider it. But total = 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12, and 2 is a divisor of 12.\n\n            Therefore, we can remove the initial insertion of 2? But the code already has:\n\n                solutions = {1, 2}\n\n            Why 2? Maybe because the divisor iteration might miss a=2 if total is even? But we iterate divisors, so we will get a=2.\n\n            However, the problem says: the output must be sorted and without duplicates.\n\n            But note: the conditions might add duplicates? We are using a set.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\n              We have a candidate divisor `a` (which is either `i` or `div`). We have already checked that `a` is a divisor of `half_perimeter` (which is w+l-2? but wait: the total boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4, so half_perimeter is defined as w+l-2? that is not the boundary area).\n\n            Let me check:\n\n              half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n\n            But the boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2). So the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*a is a divisor of the boundary area? \n\n            But wait: we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter, but the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of the boundary area include the divisors of half_perimeter and also divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\n            The current code:\n\n                half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                    for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                        ... \n\n            This will only get divisors of half_perimeter. But the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. So we are missing divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\n            For example, if half_perimeter is 6, then the boundary area is 12. The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3,6. We are missing 4 and 12.\n\n            Therefore, the current approach is flawed.\n\n            Correction: the problem says the boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            So we should iterate the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? \n\n            But note: the initial set has {1,2}. Why 2? Because 2 is always a divisor of 2 * half_perimeter? \n\n            How to fix:\n\n              We should iterate the divisors of the boundary area = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            However, the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers. The number of divisors of a number up to 2*(10^9+10^9) = 4e9 is at most about 1344 (since the maximum number of divisors for a number around 4e9 is about 1344). And we have t up to 100, so total divisors considered is 100 * 1344 = 134400, which is less than 200000.\n\n            Therefore, we should change:\n\n                half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n                total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter   # = 2*(w+l-2)\n\n            Then iterate the divisors of total_boundary.\n\n            But the current code does not do that. The current code uses half_perimeter.\n\n            However, the problem says: the provided code has a missing block. We are not allowed to change the existing code? Only fill in the TODO.\n\n            But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we might have to change the surrounding code? \n\n            But the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n            Therefore, we must assume that the provided code is as given and we can only fill the TODO block.\n\n            But the provided code uses half_perimeter and iterates its divisors. This will miss some divisors of the boundary area.\n\n            How to reconcile? \n\n            Note: the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. The divisors of the boundary area include:\n\n              - All divisors of half_perimeter (multiplied by 2? not exactly) -> actually, the divisors of the boundary area are:\n\n                  divisors = { d such that d divides 2 * half_perimeter }\n\n            We can factor 2 * half_perimeter by iterating up to sqrt(2 * half_perimeter). But the current code iterates up to sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\n            Therefore, we must change the iteration. But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n            Alternatively, note that the conditions (the four cases) only require that a divides the boundary area? But the current code only considers divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n            However, the divisors of the boundary area include divisors that are divisors of half_perimeter and divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter. \n\n            We can do: \n\n              In the TODO block, we are given a candidate `a` that is a divisor of half_perimeter. Then 2*a is a divisor of the boundary area? Not necessarily: because if a divides half_perimeter, then 2*a might not divide the boundary area? Actually, the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter, so if a divides half_perimeter, then 2*a divides 2 * half_perimeter? \n\n              Example: half_perimeter=6, a=3: then 2*a=6, and 6 divides 12? yes.\n\n            But also, we might have divisors that are divisors of the boundary area that are not of the form 2*a for a divisor a of half_perimeter? For example, 4: 4 divides 12, but 4 is not 2 times a divisor of 6? because 4/2=2, and 2 divides 6? -> yes, 2 is a divisor of 6. So then we would get a=2 in the iteration? \n\n            Actually, the divisors of the boundary area = 2 * half_perimeter are:\n\n                d in divisors(2 * half_perimeter) \n\n            and they come in pairs: (d, (2 * half_perimeter) // d)\n\n            But note: if d is a divisor, then we can consider d and (2 * half_perimeter)//d.\n\n            However, the current code iterates over divisors of half_perimeter. We are missing divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            For example, if half_perimeter=3, then boundary area=6. Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6. The divisors of half_perimeter=3: 1,3. So we are missing 2 and 6.\n\n            How to get 2 and 6? \n\n            We see that 2 = 6/3, and 6 = 6/1. But we are not iterating over the divisors of 6.\n\n            Therefore, the current code is flawed. But the problem says we can only fill the TODO block.\n\n            Alternatively, the initial set has {1,2}. Why 2? Because 2 is always a divisor of the boundary area? Not always: if half_perimeter is odd, then the boundary area is even? Actually, 2 * half_perimeter is always even. So 2 is always a divisor.\n\n            But what about 6? In the example half_perimeter=3, we would not get 6 in the iteration? \n\n            However, note: the current code iterates for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1). For half_perimeter=3, sqrt(3) is about 1.7, so floor is 1 -> the loop runs from 2 to 1 -> no iteration. Then we only consider the divisors that we have in the initial set: {1,2}. But we are missing 3 and 6.\n\n            How do we get 3? The current code does not consider it because the loop does not run. \n\n            The current code does not consider the divisor 1? It starts at 2. And the initial set has 1 and 2.\n\n            But what about the divisor 3? We are not getting it.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code is incomplete. \n\n            Given the constraints, we must change the approach. But we are only allowed to fill the TODO block.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              In the TODO block, we consider not only the candidate `a` (which is a divisor of half_perimeter) but also 2*a? \n\n            But note: the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter, so the divisors are:\n\n                d such that d divides 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            We can generate all divisors of 2 * half_perimeter by iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter and then also considering the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\n            Specifically, the set of divisors of 2 * half_perimeter is the union of:\n\n                { d for d in divisors(half_perimeter) } \n                and { 2*d for d in divisors(half_perimeter) }   -> but not exactly: because if half_perimeter is even, then 2 might already be a divisor of half_perimeter, so 2*d might be in the first set? \n\n            Actually, the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter are:\n\n                divisors(2 * half_perimeter) = { d, 2*d : d in divisors(half_perimeter) }   -> no, that is not true.\n\n            Example: half_perimeter=6, then divisors of 6: {1,2,3,6}. Then {d, 2*d} = {1,2,3,6,2,4,6,12}. But the divisors of 12 are {1,2,3,4,6,12}. So it works.\n\n            But if half_perimeter=3, then divisors of 3: {1,3}. Then {d,2*d} = {1,2,3,6}. And the divisors of 6 are {1,2,3,6}. So it works.\n\n            Therefore, we can get all divisors of 2 * half_perimeter by taking the divisors of half_perimeter and also 2 times the divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n            But note: the current code iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter. For each divisor i of half_perimeter, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter//i.\n\n            Then in the TODO block, we can also consider a2 = 2*i and a3 = 2*(half_perimeter//i) if they are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? But we know they are.\n\n            However, the problem: the TODO block is inside a loop that iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter. We are currently only considering a in [i, half_perimeter//i]. We could also consider 2*i and 2*(half_perimeter//i) in the TODO block? \n\n            But then we might get duplicates.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the loop to iterate over the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter. But we are not allowed to change the existing code.\n\n            Given the complexity, and since the problem says the provided code has a missing block, we must assume that the provided code already handles the divisor iteration correctly for the boundary area? \n\n            But it does not: it uses half_perimeter.\n\n            Let me reexamine the problem statement: the boundary area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            The sample: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6, boundary area=12.\n\n            The divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n            The current code for half_perimeter=6:\n\n                It iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6)) = 2.\n\n                i=2: 6 % 2 == 0 -> then a in [2, 6//2=3]\n\n                Then we consider a=2 and a=3.\n\n                Also, the initial set has 1 and 2.\n\n                So we have 1,2,3. We are missing 4,6,12.\n\n            Therefore, we must also consider the divisors that are 2 times the ones we have? \n\n            In the TODO block, for each divisor a of half_perimeter, we can also consider 2*a? \n\n            But note: 2*a might be larger than the boundary area? No, because a is at most half_perimeter, and 2*a is at most 2*half_perimeter, which is the boundary area. But we are iterating divisors, and we want divisors that are at most the boundary area.\n\n            However, the problem does not require that a is at most the boundary area? a can be any positive integer. But the tile must fit in the bathroom: a must be <= max(w,l). And w,l>=3 and up to 1e9, and the boundary area is about 4e9, so a can be up to 4e9, but then we would not iterate that far.\n\n            But the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers.\n\n            How to get the divisor 4 in the sample? \n\n              4 = 2 * 2, and 2 is a divisor of half_perimeter=6? -> yes, we have a=2 in the loop. Then we can consider 2*2=4.\n\n            Similarly, 6 = 2*3, and we have a=3 in the loop.\n\n            And 12 = 2*6, and we have a=6 in the loop? But the loop considers a in [i, half_perimeter//i]. When i=2, we consider a=2 and a=3. We don't have a=6 in the loop? \n\n            How do we get a=6? \n\n            The current code: for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1) -> for half_perimeter=6, i goes from 2 to 2.\n\n            Then we consider a=2 and a=3. We don't consider a=6.\n\n            But note: the initial set has 1 and 2. We are missing 6.\n\n            We can also note that 6 = half_perimeter, and we are not iterating i=6 because sqrt(6) is about 2.4, so floor is 2. We don't iterate i=6.\n\n            But the code does: for each divisor i, it also takes a = half_perimeter // i. When i=2, we get a=3. When i=3? we don't iterate i=3 because the range is up to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2.\n\n            To get 6, we can note that 6 = half_perimeter, and we haven't considered it. \n\n            The initial set has 1 and 2. Should we add half_perimeter? \n\n            But half_perimeter=6, and 6 is a divisor of half_perimeter? yes, because 6 divides 6. But we haven't iterated it.\n\n            The typical divisor iteration also includes the divisor half_perimeter itself. We can get it by iterating i such that i*i<=half_perimeter, and then when i is a divisor, we add both i and half_perimeter//i. This will include half_perimeter when i=1? but we start at i=2.\n\n            So we are missing the divisor 1 and half_perimeter? \n\n            But the initial set has 1. And we are missing half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, we should also consider a = half_perimeter.\n\n            How to do that within the TODO block? We are in the loop for i>=2.\n\n            Given the complexity, and since the problem says the provided code has a missing block, and we are not allowed to change the existing code, we must assume that the provided code is intended to iterate over some divisors, and then in the TODO block we will also consider the doubled version and also half_perimeter.\n\n            But this is messy.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do the following in the TODO block:\n\n              We have a candidate a (which is a divisor of half_perimeter). Then we consider two candidates: a and 2*a, and also half_perimeter and 2*half_perimeter? \n\n            But then we might get duplicates and also candidates that are not divisors of the boundary area? \n\n            Actually, a is a divisor of half_perimeter, so 2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter. Similarly, half_perimeter is a divisor of half_perimeter, so 2*half_perimeter is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter.\n\n            But note: the boundary area is 2*half_perimeter, so the divisors are up to 2*half_perimeter.\n\n            However, the sample: half_perimeter=6, then we would consider:\n\n              from the loop: a=2 -> then consider a and 2*a=4.\n                         a=3 -> then consider a and 2*a=6.\n\n              and we also need to consider a=6 (which is half_perimeter) and 2*6=12.\n\n            But we haven't encountered a=6 in the loop? \n\n            We can also consider in the TODO block: for the current a, we also consider the candidate = half_perimeter // something? \n\n            Given the time, and since the sample output for (3,5) is [1,2,3], and we have 1 in the initial set, and from the loop we get a=2 and a=3, and then we consider 2*a=4 and 2*3=6. But 4 and 6 are not in the sample output.\n\n            For a=4: \n                Condition1: 3%4=3, 5%4=1 -> false.\n                Condition2: 3%4=3, (5-2)%4=3%4=3 -> false.\n                Condition3: (3-2)%4=1%4=1, 5%4=1 -> false.\n                Condition4: (3-1)%4=2%4=2, (5-1)%4=4%4=0 -> false.\n            So a=4 is not valid.\n\n            For a=6: \n                Condition1: 3%6=3, 5%6=5 -> false.\n                Condition2: 3%6=3, (5-2)=3%6=3 -> true.\n            So a=6 is valid.\n\n            But the sample output is a=1,2,3. Why is 6 not included? \n\n            The sample says: \"There are three values of a\". So 6 is not valid? \n\n            Why is a=6 valid by condition2? \n                Condition2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0.\n                w=3, a=6: 3%6=3 !=0 -> fails.\n\n            I see, I did: \n                Condition2: w % a == 0 -> 3%6=3 !=0 -> fails.\n\n            Then how did we get condition2 true? \n                Condition2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0.\n                (l-2)=3, 3%6=3 !=0 -> fails.\n\n            So a=6 is not valid.\n\n            Therefore, the sample only has 1,2,3.\n\n            So we only need to consider the candidates that are divisors of half_perimeter (which are 1,2,3,6) and also 2,4,6,12 (from doubling) but 4 and 12 are not valid, and 6 is not valid.\n\n            But the initial set has 1 and 2. The loop gives a=2 and a=3. Then in the TODO block for a=2, we consider a=2 and a=4. For a=3, we consider a=3 and a=6. We also need to consider a=1 (already in the set) and a=6 (half_perimeter) and a=12 (2*half_perimeter) -> but we are not iterating a=6 in the loop? \n\n            For a=6: we would condition in the TODO block for a=3: we consider a=3 and a=6. So we do consider a=6.\n\n            Then we check a=6 and find it doesn't work.\n\n            Therefore, the plan in the TODO block is:\n\n              For each candidate a (which is a divisor of half_perimeter) that we get from the loop (either i or half_perimeter//i), we consider two values: a and 2*a.\n\n            But note: a might be 1, then 2*a=2, but 2 is already in the initial set.\n\n            Also, we might have duplicates.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n              candidates = [ a, 2*a ]\n\n            Then for each candidate in candidates:\n\n                  if candidate > max(w,l): # because the tile must fit in the bathroom: the side has length at most max(w,l), and the tile length a must be at most that side.\n                      continue\n\n                  then check the four conditions with this candidate.\n\n            But wait, the four conditions require that the candidate divides the boundary area? We know that because candidate is either a divisor of half_perimeter (so 2*candidate is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter) or candidate=2*a and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then candidate=2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n              for cand in [a, 2*a]:\n                  if cand > max(w,l): \n                      continue\n                  if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\n                      solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the initial set already has 1 and 2. We might add duplicates, but the set handles that.\n\n            However, the sample a=2: \n                cand = 2 and 4.\n                for 2: \n                    condition4: (3-1)%2=2%2=0, (5-1)%2=4%2=0 -> true, so add 2 (already there) and 4 (which is not valid, so not added).\n\n            a=3:\n                cand=3 and 6.\n                3: condition2: 3%3=0 and (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> true, add 3.\n                6: as above, false.\n\n            a=6 (which we don't have in the loop for half_perimeter=6, but we do have a=3 and then 2*a=6).\n\n            But note: the divisor a=6 (which is half_perimeter) is not iterated in the loop? \n                In the loop, i=2: then a in [2,3]. We don't get 6.\n\n            But we do get 6 as 2*a when a=3.\n\n            Also, the divisor a=1: we have it in the initial set. We would also consider 2*1=2, which is already there.\n\n            What about the divisor a= half_perimeter itself (6)? We haven't considered it in the loop, but we will consider it as 2*a when a=3.\n\n            What about the divisor a=12? \n                We would get it as 2*a when a=6, but a=6 is not in the loop. \n                But note: when a=3, we consider 2*a=6, and then in the next iteration for a=6? we don't have a=6 in the loop.\n\n            So we miss 12.\n\n            How to get 12? \n                12 = 2 * 6, and 6 is not in the loop. \n                But 6 = half_perimeter, and we could get it from the divisor i=3: then a = half_perimeter//3 = 2, and then 2*a=4, not 6.\n\n            Alternatively, we can also consider in the TODO block: for the current a, also consider cand = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) [which is the other divisor we are considering] and also 2 * (half_perimeter // a) might be 2*(6//2)=6 when a=2, and 2*(6//3)=4 when a=3.\n\n            So we are already considering 6 when a=2: because when a=2, we consider cand=2 and 4, and also we should consider the other divisor for this i: which is half_perimeter//2=3, and then for a=3, we consider 3 and 6.\n\n            Therefore, we are covering 6.\n\n            But 12 = 2 * 6, and 6 is not a divisor of half_perimeter? It is, because 6 is half_perimeter. \n            In the TODO block for a=6? we never have a=6 in the loop.\n\n            How to get a=6 in the loop? \n                We would need i to be a divisor of half_perimeter=6 and i>=2 and i<=floor(sqrt(6))=2. \n                i=2: then a in [2,3]. \n                i=3: floor(sqrt(6)) is 2, so we don't iterate i=3.\n\n            So we don't get a=6.\n\n            Then we consider for a=3: cand=6. So we consider 6.\n\n            For 12: we would need to consider for a=6: then cand=6 and 12. But a=6 is not in the loop.\n\n            Therefore, we are missing 12.\n\n            To get 12, we can also consider in the TODO block: cand = 2 * half_perimeter // a. \n                boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter.\n                cand = boundary_area // a   might be a divisor? \n\n            But note: a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then boundary_area // a = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) -> which is exactly 2 * (the other divisor for this i). \n\n            Example: a=i=2, then boundary_area//a = 12//2=6.\n                     a=half_perimeter//i=3, then boundary_area//a=12//3=4.\n\n            So we are already considering 6 and 4.\n\n            boundary_area//a is the complementary divisor of a in the boundary_area. \n\n            Therefore, we are not missing any divisor of the boundary_area? \n\n            Because: \n                The divisors of boundary_area = 2 * half_perimeter come in pairs: (d, boundary_area//d).\n                We are iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter: let d be a divisor of half_perimeter, then we consider:\n                    d, 2*d, boundary_area//d, boundary_area//(2*d) ? \n\n            But note: boundary_area//d = 2 * (half_perimeter // d) -> which is exactly what we are also considering as 2 * (half_perimeter//d) when we process the divisor (half_perimeter//d).\n\n            Example: half_perimeter=6, boundary_area=12.\n                d=2: we consider a=2 and then cand=2 and 4, and also a=3 (which is half_perimeter//2) and then cand=3 and 6.\n                d=3: we would normally process it, but in our loop we only go up to sqrt(6) which is 2, so we don't process d=3 explicitly, but we do process it as the complementary of d=2.\n\n            Therefore, by iterating the divisors of half_perimeter and for each divisor a in {i, half_perimeter//i} we consider cand in {a, 2*a, boundary_area//a, boundary_area//(2*a)}? \n\n            But boundary_area//a = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) -> which is the same as 2 * (the other divisor for the same i) -> and we will get that when we process the other divisor.\n\n            Example: for i=2, we have a=2 and a=3.\n                for a=2: we consider cand in {2,4} and also boundary_area//2=6 and boundary_area//4=3 (which is not an integer? 12//4=3, which is integer) -> so we consider 2,4,6,3.\n                for a=3: we consider cand in {3,6} and boundary_area//3=4 and boundary_area//6=2.\n\n            So we get duplicates.\n\n            Given the complexity, and since the sample only requires up to 200000 integers, and the set will remove duplicates, we can do:\n\n              candidates = set()\n              for a in [i, div]:\n                  for cand in [a, 2*a, (2*half_perimeter)//a, (2*half_perimeter)//(2*a) if 2*a !=0 and (2*half_perimeter) % (2*a)==0 else None]:\n                      if cand is not None and cand <= max(w, l):\n                          candidates.add(cand)\n\n              then for each candidate in candidates:\n                  if (w % candidate == 0 and l % candidate == 0) or ... (the four conditions):\n                      solutions.add(candidate)\n\n            But note: (2*half_perimeter) // (2*a) = half_perimeter // a, which is the other divisor we are already considering in the loop for the same i.\n\n            And (2*half_perimeter) // a = 2 * (half_perimeter // a) -> which is the doubled version of the other divisor.\n\n            Therefore, for each i, we will add for a=i: \n                cand1 = i\n                cand2 = 2*i\n                cand3 = (2*half_perimeter) // i = 2 * (half_perimeter//i)\n                cand4 = (2*half_perimeter) // (2*i) = half_perimeter // i   [if 2*i divides 2*half_perimeter, which it does because i divides half_perimeter]\n\n            So we add: i, 2*i, half_perimeter//i, 2*(half_perimeter//i)\n\n            Example: i=2, half_perimeter=6: \n                cand1=2, cand2=4, cand3= 12//2=6, cand4=12//4=3.\n\n            So we add 2,4,6,3.\n\n            Then for the same i, we also do for a = half_perimeter//i = 3:\n                cand1=3, cand2=6, cand3=12//3=4, cand4=12//6=2.\n\n            So duplicates.\n\n            Therefore, we can do it for one of them and then break symmetry by doing only for one a per divisor pair.\n\n            But the TODO block is inside the loop for a in [i, div] (which is [i, half_perimeter//i]). We can simply do for the current a and not worry because the set will remove duplicates.\n\n            However, the set `solutions` is shared for the test case.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block can be:\n\n              # Let boundary = 2 * half_perimeter\n              boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n              # We'll create a set of candidate a's from the current divisor a0 (which is either i or div)\n              candidates = set()\n              # We consider the current a0 and also 2*a0, and also boundary//a0 and boundary//(2*a0) [if 2*a0 divides boundary]\n              # But note: a0 divides half_perimeter, so boundary = 2 * half_perimeter is divisible by a0 and by 2*a0 (if a0!=0).\n              # But a0>=2, so it's safe.\n              candidates.add(a)\n              candidates.add(2*a)\n              # boundary//a0 might be an integer, and it is.\n              candidates.add(boundary // a)\n              # For boundary//(2*a0): \n              if boundary % (2*a) == 0:\n                  candidates.add(boundary // (2*a))\n              # Also, we might have boundary//a0 might be the same as 2*a? then duplicate, but set handles.\n              # Now, for each candidate in candidates, if candidate is not greater than max(w,l) and candidate>=1, then check the conditions.\n              for cand in candidates:\n                  if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\n                      continue\n                  if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\n                      solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the divisor might be very large: cand = boundary//a = 2 * (half_perimeter//a). Since a>=2, boundary//a might be up to boundary//2 = half_perimeter, which is up to 2e9, and then we do cand > max(w,l) (which is up to 1e9) -> so we skip if cand > max(w,l).\n\n            This is safe.\n\n            However, the sample: w=3, l=5, a=2 (from the loop) in the first test case.\n              half_perimeter = 6, boundary=12.\n              candidates for a=2: \n                  cand1 = 2\n                  cand2 = 4\n                  cand3 = 12//2 = 6\n                  cand4 = 12//4 = 3   [since 12 % (2*2)=12%4==0, so we add 3]\n              So candidates = {2,4,6,3}\n\n              Then we check:\n                2: condition4: (3-1)%2=0, (5-1)%2=0 -> valid.\n                4: not valid.\n                6: not valid.\n                3: condition2: 3%3=0 and (5-2)%3=0 -> valid.\n\n              So we add 2 and 3. (1 is already in the initial set).\n\n            Then for a=3 (which is the other divisor for i=2):\n              candidates for a=3:\n                  cand1=3, cand2=6, cand3=12//3=4, cand4=12//6=2 (but 12%6==0, so add 2)\n              Then we check 3 (valid), 6 (invalid), 4 (invalid), 2 (valid) -> but 2 and 3 are already in the set.\n\n            So we have {1,2,3} as desired.\n\n            But note: the initial set already had 1 and 2. We are adding 2 again and also 3.\n\n            This is acceptable.\n\n            However, we might add the same candidate multiple times, but the set handles it.\n\n            But the problem: the initial set has 1 and 2. We might also add 1 if it appears? \n\n            How would 1 appear? \n                If a=1 is in the loop? \n                The loop starts at i=2, so a=1 is not in the loop. \n                But we have a=1 in the initial set.\n\n            Also, for a=1: we would not process it in the loop.\n\n            Therefore, we are missing the doubled version of 1? which is 2, but 2 is in the initial set.\n\n            And we are also missing boundary//1 = 12, and boundary//2=6. \n                But when a=2, we consider boundary//2=6 and boundary//4=3.\n                when a=3, we consider boundary//3=4 and boundary//6=2.\n\n            So we cover 12? \n                cand = boundary//1 = 12, but a=1 is not in the loop.\n\n            How to get 12? \n                We would need a divisor i such that i=1, but the loop starts at i=2.\n\n            Therefore, we must ensure that the initial set includes all candidates that are divisors of the boundary area that are not covered by the loop? \n\n            The initial set has 1 and 2. \n            We should also add any candidate that is boundary_area // d for d in the initial set? \n\n            But the TODO block is only in the loop. We are not allowed to change the code outside the TODO block.\n\n            Given the complexity, and since the sample does not require 12 (because 12 is not valid for (3,5)), and the problem says the output has at most 200000 integers, we hope that the initial set and the TODO block cover all small divisors and the large ones are skipped by the condition cand > max(w,l).\n\n            For the sample, 12>max(3,5)=5, so we skip 12.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block is as above.\n\n            Let's code accordingly.\n\n            However, note: the condition in the provided code before the TODO is:\n\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO\n\n            This condition is not explained. We are not using it in the known conditions. We should remove it? \n\n            But the problem says: only fill the TODO block.\n\n            We can ignore that condition? \n\n            Or maybe the provided condition is an optimization? \n\n            Let me see: w % a <= 2. \n                This might be because if a tile is placed on the left or right wall, the length of the wall is w, and the tile might cover the entire wall or leave 1 or 2 cells? \n\n            But our conditions are more precise.\n\n            Therefore, in the TODO block, we will do our own conditions and not rely on that.\n\n            So we can remove that condition? But the problem says: only fill the TODO block.\n\n            We must leave the condition as is? or bypass it? \n\n            The condition says: if mod_a <= 2, then we do the TODO block.\n\n            This might be an optimization to avoid checking the four conditions for every candidate.\n\n            But it might also be wrong: for example, a=3 in the sample: w=3, 3%3=0<=2 -> true.\n\n            a=2: 3%2=1<=2 -> true.\n\n            a=4: 3%4=3>2 -> skip.\n\n            a=6: 3%6=3>2 -> skip.\n\n            So it filters out a=4 and a=6, which is good because they are not valid.\n\n            But is it always safe? \n\n            Consider a valid a that might have w % a > 2. \n                For example, condition4: (w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0.\n                w % a could be anything? \n\n            Example: w=4, l=4, a=3.\n                Condition4: (4-1)%3=0, (4-1)%3=0 -> valid.\n                But w % a = 4 % 3 = 1, which is <=2 -> included.\n\n            Another: w=5, l=5, a=3.\n                Condition4: (5-1)%3=4%3=1, (5-1)%3=1 -> not valid.\n\n            What about a=4 for w=5, l=5:\n                Condition4: (5-1)%4=0, (5-1)%4=0 -> valid.\n                w % a = 5 % 4 = 1 <=2 -> included.\n\n            What about an invalid a that has w % a <=2? \n                a=3 for w=4, l=5: \n                    condition1: 4%3=1, 5%3=2 -> fail.\n                    condition2: 4%3=1, (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> fail.\n                    condition3: (4-2)%3=2%3=2, 5%3=2 -> fail.\n                    condition4: (4-1)%3=0, (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> fail.\n                so not valid, but w%a=1<=2, so we would check and then not add.\n\n            Therefore, the condition (w % a <=2) is not sufficient to determine validity, but it might be a necessary condition for some of the cases? \n\n            Actually, it might be a heuristic to prune. We will leave it and then in the TODO block we will do the full condition.\n\n            So the TODO block becomes:\n\n              boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)   # total boundary area\n              candidates = set()\n              # We are here because w % a <= 2.\n              candidates.add(a)\n              candidates.add(2*a)\n              # We also want to consider boundary//a and boundary//(2*a) if it divides evenly for the latter.\n              # Note: boundary is divisible by a because a divides half_perimeter and boundary=2*half_perimeter, so boundary//a is an integer.\n              candidates.add(boundary // a)\n              if boundary % (2*a) == 0:\n                  candidates.add(boundary // (2*a))\n\n              for cand in candidates:\n                  if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\n                      continue\n                  # Check the four conditions\n                  if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\n                      solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the condition (boundary % (2*a)==0) is always true because boundary = 2 * half_perimeter, and a divides half_perimeter, so 2*a divides 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, we can always add boundary// (2*a).\n\n            So we can remove the if condition.\n\n            However, integer division might be exact, so we can do:\n\n                  candidates.add(boundary // (2*a))\n\n            without checking.\n\n            But note: boundary = 2 * half_perimeter, and half_perimeter is divisible by a, so half_perimeter = k * a for some integer k.\n            Then boundary = 2 * k * a, so boundary // (2*a) = (2*k*a) // (2*a) = k, which is an integer.\n\n            Therefore, we can always add it.\n\n            So the TODO block:\n\n              boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n              candidates = {a, 2*a, boundary//a, boundary//(2*a)}\n              for cand in candidates:\n                  if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\n                      continue\n                  if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\n                     ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\n                      solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the initial set solutions already has 1 and 2. We are adding to it.\n\n            This should work.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the candidate might be very large, and the modulo operations with cand might be expensive if cand is 1 (which is cheap) or up to 4e9? But w and l are up to 1e9, and modulo with a number > w or l is defined: w % cand = w (if cand>w), and similarly for l.\n\n            And if cand>w and cand>l, then we skip because cand>max(w,l).\n\n            So we skip.\n\n            Therefore, we output for program1.py and program2.py the same TODO block.\n\n            But note: the problem has two programs, and we output a json with the completions for program1 and program2.\n\n            Since both programs are identical, we output the same string for both.\n\n            Let's write the code for the TODO block.\n\n            Important: we must not output any extra spaces.\n\n            The code for the TODO block:\n\nboundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\ncandidates = {a, 2*a, boundary // a, boundary // (2*a)}\nfor cand in candidates:\n    if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\n        continue\n    if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\n        solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the condition might be long. We can break it into multiple lines, but the problem says to output only the code.\n\n            We can write it in one line or multiple. Since the problem does not specify, we do multiple for clarity, but the output must be a string.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the block as a string.\n\n            We must be careful with the indentation.\n\n            The current TODO block is indented by 8 spaces (two levels: for the for-loop and the if-condition). We will match that.\n\n            Let me format:\n\n                \"        boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\\n        candidates = {a, 2*a, boundary // a, boundary // (2*a)}\\n        for cand in candidates:\\n            if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\\n                continue\\n            if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0):\\n                solutions.add(cand)\"\n\n            But this is one long string.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write with explicit line breaks and indentation.\n\n            Since the problem does not specify, we output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\n            We are replacing the TODO comment with this block.\n\n            The current code has:\n\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO comment with the block.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for both program1 and program2 is the same.\n\n            We output:\n\n              {\"program1\": \"boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\\n        candidates = {a, 2 * a, boundary // a, boundary // (2 * a)}\\n        for cand in candidates:\\n            if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\\n                continue\\n            if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               (w % cand == 0 and (l - 2) % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               ((w - 2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               ((w - 1) % cand == 0 and (l - 1) % cand == 0):\\n                solutions.add(cand)\", \n               \"program2\": \"boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\\n        candidates = {a, 2 * a, boundary // a, boundary // (2 * a)}\\n        for cand in candidates:\\n            if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\\n                continue\\n            if (w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               (w % cand == 0 and (l - 2) % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               ((w - 2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or \\\\\\n               ((w - 1) % cand == 0 and (l - 1) % cand == 0):\\n                solutions.add(cand)\"}\n\n            But note: the backslashes for line continuation might not be needed if we use parentheses. In Python, we can break a long expression in parentheses without backslashes.\n\n            Let me write without backslashes:\n\n            if ((w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n                (w % cand == 0 and (l - 2) % cand == 0) or\n                ((w - 2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n                ((w - 1) % cand == 0 and (l - 1) % cand == 0)):\n\n            This is valid.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            if ((w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n                (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or\n                ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n                ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0)):\n\n            Therefore, the final code for the TODO block is:\n\nboundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\ncandidates = {a, 2*a, boundary // a, boundary // (2*a)}\nfor cand in candidates:\n    if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\n        continue\n    if ((w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n        (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or\n        ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\n        ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0)):\n        solutions.add(cand)\n\n            But note: the initial condition (w % a <=2) is still there. We are inside that if.\n\n            We output the string exactly as it would be in the program, with the same indentation.\n\n            The current indentation: the TODO is at 8 spaces (one level for the for-loop, one level for the if). Then we add:\n\n                8 spaces + the code we have, which has:\n\n                  boundary = ...   -> 8 spaces\n                  for cand ...: -> 8 spaces\n                      if cand ...: -> 12 spaces\n                      if ...: -> 12 spaces\n                          solutions.add(cand) -> 16 spaces\n\n            But the provided code uses 4-space indents.\n\n            The structure:\n\n            for i in ...:\n                ... \n                for a in ...:\n                    ... \n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        [we are here: 12 spaces of indentation]\n\n            So we need 12 spaces for the block.\n\n            Let me count:\n\n                for w, l in ...:   -> 4\n                ...

No, we align by indentation level.\n\n            Actually, we align by the same level as the first condition, which is 20 spaces? \n\n            But the condition is inside an if that is at 20 spaces, and we break the condition into multiple lines, each starting at 20+4=24? \n\n            But the sample code does not break long conditions.\n\n            Given the complexity, and to avoid very long lines, we break it as above.\n\n            We output the string exactly as:\n\n                \"                boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\\n                candidates = {a, 2 * a, boundary // a, boundary // (2 * a)}\\n                for cand in candidates:\\n                    if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\\n                        continue\\n                    if ((w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\\n                        (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or\\n                        ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\\n                        ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0)):\\n                        solutions.add(cand)\"\n\n            But note: the spaces at the beginning of each line: 16 for the first three lines, then 20 for the next, then 24 for the continue, then 20 for the if, then 24 for the condition lines, then 24 for the solutions.add? \n\n            Actually, the condition is one if statement, and the condition spans multiple lines. The subsequent lines of the condition should be aligned with the first condition. We can use 24 spaces for the continuation lines.\n\n            But to match the surrounding, we do:\n\n                Line1: 16 spaces: \"                boundary = ...\"\n                Line2: 16 spaces: \"                candidates = ...\"\n                Line3: 16 spaces: \"                for cand in candidates:\"\n                Line4: 20 spaces: \"                    if cand > max(w, l) or cand < 1:\"\n                Line5: 24 spaces: \"                        continue\"\n                Line6: 20 spaces: \"                    if ((w % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\"\n                Line7: 24 spaces: \"                        (w % cand == 0 and (l-2) % cand == 0) or\"\n                Line8: 24 spaces: \"                        ((w-2) % cand == 0 and l % cand == 0) or\"\n                Line9: 24 spaces: \"                        ((w-1) % cand == 0 and (l-1) % cand == 0)):\"\n                Line10:24 spaces: \"                        solutions.add(cand)\"\n\n            But the condition is one logical line.
