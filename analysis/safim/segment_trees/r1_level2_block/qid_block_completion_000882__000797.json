    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts. We must output the missing code for each in a JSON object.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem: Count the number of pairs (i, j) (i<j) of strings of length 2 (from 'a' to 'k') such that they differ in exactly one position.\n\nThe provided code uses a counter and iterates over the strings. For each string \"ab\", it considers two cases:\n1. Changing the first character: for every letter l (from LETTERS) that is not equal to 'a', it checks the string \"l b\" and adds the count of such strings that have been seen so far.\n2. Changing the second character: the code has a TODO for the second character.\n\nWe need to complete the second part similarly: for every letter l that is not equal to 'b', we should check the string \"a l\" and add the count of such strings that have been seen so far.\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py for the second character should be:\n    s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut note: the variable `a` and `b` are the two characters of the current string. We are building a string with the first character fixed as `a` and the second character as `l` (which runs over all letters except `b`).\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n    s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nHowever, note that the current string is being added to the counter after we do the lookups. This is correct because we are only considering pairs (i, j) with i<j, and the counter has only the strings that appeared earlier.\n\nBut wait: the current string `ab` is not in the counter when we are processing it? That's correct because we do `ctr[ab] += 1` after the lookups. So the pairs we form are with the current string and the ones that came before.\n\nSo the missing line for program1.py is: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nNow for program2.py:\nThe problem: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob. We wish to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code sets up:\n  n: the list of candy weights for the test case.\n  a, b, l, f: initialized to 0. Also r = len(n)-1 (the last index).\n  Then a while loop: while l<=r.\n\nInside the loop:\n  If a<=b, then we add the left candy (at index l) to a and move l to the right.\n  Else if b<a, then we should add a candy from the right to b? The TODO is here.\n\nBut note: the condition is \"elif b<a\", so we are in the case that Bob's current total is less than Alice's. So we should add a candy from the right to Bob.\n\nSo we do:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nAdditionally, when a==b, we update f to be the total number of candies eaten so far? Actually, the variable f is set to: len(n) - r + l - 1.\n\nBut note: \n  Initially: l=0, r = len(n)-1.\n  When we take a candy from the left: we do l+=1 -> so the next left candy is at index l (which is now one more). Similarly, when we take from the right, we do r-=1.\n\nThe number of candies eaten by Alice is l (because we started at 0 and then l becomes the count of left candies eaten? Actually, l started at 0 and we did l+=1 for each left candy -> so l is the count of left candies.\nSimilarly, the number of candies eaten by Bob is (len(n) - 1 - r) because initially r = len(n)-1, and then we do r-=1 for each candy Bob eats -> so the count is (len(n)-1 - r) but note: after each decrement, r becomes the next available right index. Actually, the number of candies Bob has eaten is: (len(n) - 1 - r) is not exactly the count because we start at r = len(n)-1 and then after one candy, r becomes len(n)-2 -> then the count is 1. So the count is (len(n) - 1 - r) doesn't work. Alternatively, we can think: total candies eaten = l + (len(n)-1 - r). But note: the indices l and r are such that the next available left is at l and next available right is at r. The candies eaten by Alice are from index 0 to l-1 -> count = l. The candies eaten by Bob are from index r+1 to len(n)-1 -> count = len(n)-1 - r. So total = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + len(n) - 1 - r.\n\nBut in the code, when a==b, they set:\n    f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n\nBut note: len(n) - r + l - 1 = l + (len(n) - r - 1) -> which is exactly the total candies eaten: l (from left) and (len(n)-r-1) from the right? Actually, the number of right candies is (len(n) - (r+1)) = len(n)-r-1. So total = l + (len(n)-r-1) = l + len(n) - r - 1.\n\nBut the expression in the code: `len(n) - r + l - 1` is the same as `l + len(n) - r - 1`.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nHowever, note that the variable `f` is updated every time a==b. We want the maximum total candies over the entire process. But note: the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum value of (l + (len(n)-r-1)) over the entire process when a==b.\n\nBut the code currently updates `f` every time a==b. Since we are traversing from the ends inward, and we update `f` whenever we have an equal sum, the last update might not be the maximum? Actually, the total number of candies eaten at a moment when a==b is l + (len(n)-r-1). And we are going to eat more? But note: we are still in the process of eating. We are moving l and r inward until they cross. And we update f whenever we have a==b. However, we are not necessarily maximizing the total candies? Actually, we are updating f every time we have a match, and we are going to take the last match? But that might not be the maximum.\n\nBut note: the total candies eaten at a match is l + (len(n)-r-1). As we move inward, we are adding more candies? Actually, we are starting from the outside and moving in. The total candies eaten at a match is increasing? Not necessarily: we are adding one candy at a time. But note: we are not removing any candy. We are only adding. However, when we have a match, we record the current total. And we continue until we have processed all candies? But the problem is: we want the maximum total candies for which the sums are equal. The total candies is increasing as we add more? Actually, no: we are adding one candy at a time (either left or right). The total candies is increasing? It is the sum of the counts. But note: we are not going backward. We are moving from the ends inward. The total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is l + (len(n)-r-1). As we add a candy (either left or right), the total increases by one. Therefore, the last time we have a match (if any) would have the maximum total candies? But wait: it is possible that we have a match at an earlier stage with a large total, and then we break the match and then get a match again? Actually, once we pass a candy, we don't remove it. So the total candies is non-decreasing? Actually, it is increasing by one at each step. Therefore, the last match we get would have the largest total candies. However, what if we have a match at the beginning and then we add more and then we don't get a match again? Then we want the last match? But the problem says: the maximum number of candies. So we want the match with the largest total candies. Since the total candies is increasing, the last match we get would have the largest total. Therefore, updating f every time we have a match and then at the end printing f is correct.\n\nBut note: the variable f is initialized to 0. If there is no match, then we print 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the missing code in program2.py for the \"elif b<a\" branch is:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: we must do the same for the right as we did for the left: update the sum and move the pointer.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nHowever, note that after updating b, we must check if a==b? Actually, the check for a==b is done after updating either a or b. The code has:\n    if a==b:\n        f=len(n)-r+l-1\n\nThis check is done after every update (whether we updated a or b). So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the code structure is:\n\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a += n[l]\n            l += 1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n            # We need to add the right candy to b and move r left.\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n        if a==b:\n            f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n\nBut note: the condition \"if a==b\" is checked after every update. So we are good.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: after we update a or b, we check a==b. But what if we update a and then a becomes equal to b? Then we update f. Similarly for updating b.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <= 200000, so the while loop runs at most 200000 per test case? Actually, the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is two lines:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code is written in a compact form. We must be careful with the indentation.\n\nIn the provided code, the TODO is in the elif block. We need to add two lines (with the same indentation as the if-block above).\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\",\n    \"program2\": \"b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the missing code is exactly one line. And in program2.py, the missing code is two lines.\n\nHowever, in the provided program2.py, the TODO is in the middle of the elif block. We are replacing the TODO comment with two lines of code.\n\nBut wait: the original program2.py code has:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with two lines. So the two lines must be at the same indentation level.\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block (for a<=b) has two lines: \n            a += n[l]\n            l += 1\n\nSimilarly, we do two lines for the elif block.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the two lines for program2.py as a string with a newline and the same indentation? Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the context. The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent? Actually, the provided code for program2.py uses 4 spaces for the inner blocks.\n\nBut the provided code for program2.py is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\r\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\r\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\r\n    while l<=r:\r\n        if a<=b:\r\n            a+=n[l]\r\n            l+=1\r\n        elif b<a:\r\n            # TODO: Your code here\r\n        if a==b:\r\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\r\n    print(f)\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with two lines that are indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the existing code in the if-block is indented by 12 spaces (relative to the while loop). But the code is written without spaces? Actually, the code is minified. However, the problem says to output the missing code as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code so that ... runs correctly\". We must output the code that would be placed in the TODO part.\n\nIn the provided program2.py, the if-block for a<=b has two lines that are indented one level more than the if statement. Similarly, the missing code in the elif block should be two lines with the same indentation.\n\nSo we output for program2.py as a string: \"b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block uses 12 spaces? Actually, in the provided code, the if-block is written as:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nThe first line after if is indented by 4 more spaces (relative to the while). Then the next line is also 4 more. But the entire code is written without extra spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\r\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\r\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\r\n    while l<=r:\r\n        if a<=b:\r\n            a+=n[l]\r\n            l+=1\r\n        elif b<a:\r\n            # TODO: Your code here\r\n        if a==b:\r\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\r\n    print(f)\n\nThe if-block has two lines that are indented by 4 spaces relative to the 'if'. So the missing code should be two lines, each starting with 12 spaces? Actually, the while loop is at 4 spaces, the if is at 8, and the block inside if is at 12. So we need two lines of 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require us to output the entire block, just the two lines of code that replace the TODO. So we output:\n\n\"b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nThe string has the two lines with the same indentation as the if-block above.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact number of spaces? But the problem says the program must run correctly. The provided code uses 4-space indentation? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level. The while is at 4, the if at 8, and the inner block at 12.\n\nBut note: the provided code for program2.py uses 4 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the code is written with 4 spaces per indent. The if-block has two lines that are indented by 4 more than the if. So the missing code should be two lines, each with 12 spaces at the beginning? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the style.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the TODO comment. We can write:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut in the string, we represent the newline and the 12 spaces? Actually, the 12 spaces are the same as the existing if-block. So we output:\n\n\"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut wait, the existing if-block has:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo the two lines we are adding should have the same indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines without the leading spaces? But that would break the indentation.\n\nWe must output the exact code that would be placed in the TODO.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is two lines:\n\nLine 1: 12 spaces and then \"b += n[r]\"\nLine 2: 12 spaces and then \"r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block uses 12 spaces. So we output:\n\n\"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut the problem says: the total of n over test cases is at most 200000, so we are safe.\n\nNow, for program1.py, the missing code is one line: \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the for-loop for the first character has:\n\n            s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nSimilarly, we do for the second character.\n\nBut note: the line is inside the inner for-loop for l in LETTERS, and inside the condition \"if l != b\". So we output exactly that line.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the answer may be large, so we use s as a 64-bit integer? The code uses s as an integer and in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\",\n    \"program2\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has a semicolon in the initialization: a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1. And the while loop condition: l<=r. We are adding two lines that update b and r.\n\nBut wait: in the provided program2.py, the variable n is the list of weights. We are using n[r] to get the weight at the current right index.\n\nOne more note: in program1.py, the line we are adding must be at the same indentation as the first if inside the inner for-loop. The existing code for the first character is:\n\n            s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nSo we output the same indentation? Actually, the problem says to output only the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is in the same block as the first if. The code for the first if is:\n\n        for l in LETTERS:\n            if l != a:\n                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n            if l != b:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with one line: \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\", and that line should be indented one more level? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the first s += ...? But the first s += ... is inside the if l != a. Similarly, the TODO is inside the if l != b. So the missing code should be at the same indentation as the first s += ...? That is, 8 more spaces? Actually, the for-loop is at 4, the ifs are at 8, and the s += ... is at 12. So the missing code should be at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require us to output the entire block, just the line that goes in place of the TODO. So we output the line: \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\" without any leading spaces? But that would be incorrect because it must be indented.\n\nActually, the TODO is at the same level as the first s += ...? The first s += ... is at 12 spaces (relative to the for). The TODO is at 12 spaces? Actually, the TODO is a comment at the same level as the first s += ...? Then we replace that comment with the same level of indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the comment. So we output the line with the same indentation as the comment? But the problem does not specify the exact string of spaces. However, to run correctly, the code must be properly indented.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be placed in the TODO without the surrounding context. The surrounding context has 12 spaces at the beginning of the line? Then we output the line with 12 spaces? But that would be:\n\n\"            s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nBut wait, the existing code for the first if has:\n\n                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nwhich is 16 spaces? Actually, let me count:\n\nThe program1.py code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom itertools import islice\nfrom sys import stdin\n\nLETTERS = 'abcdefghijk'\n\ndata = (line.strip() for line in stdin.readlines()[1:])\n\nres = []\nfor line in data:\n    n = int(line)\n    s = 0\n    ctr = Counter()\n    for ab in islice(data, n):\n        a, b = ab\n        ctr[ab] += 1\n        for l in LETTERS:\n            if l != a:\n                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n            if l != b:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe for-loop over ab: 4 spaces.\nThe for-loop over l: 8 spaces.\nThe if l != a: 12 spaces.\nThe s += ...: 16 spaces.\nSimilarly, the if l != b: 12 spaces, and the TODO is at 16 spaces? Actually, the TODO is at 16 spaces? Then the missing code should be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, to be safe, we output the line with the same indentation as the existing s += ... above. So 16 spaces? But the problem says: output the code that would be placed in the TODO. The TODO is a comment at 16 spaces? Then we replace it with a line at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? Actually, the problem says the program must run. So we must have the correct indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the line without leading spaces and let the existing indentation structure take care? But that would break.\n\nTherefore, we output for program1.py: \"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nBut wait, the existing code for the first if has 16 spaces? Then we do the same for the second.\n\nBut note: the provided code for the first if is:\n\n            if l != a:\n                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nThe first line (if) is at 12 spaces? Then the s += is at 16. Similarly, the second if is at 12, and the TODO is at 16? Then we output the line at 16 spaces.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is: \"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\" (with 16 spaces).\n\nBut how many spaces? The for-loop (for l in LETTERS) is at 8 spaces. Then the ifs are at 12, and the body of the if is at 16. So 16 spaces.\n\nBut 16 spaces is 4 indents of 4 spaces. So we output:\n\n\"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is two lines, each with 12 spaces? Actually, the while loop is at 4, the if and elif are at 8, and the body of the if/elif is at 12. So we output two lines of 12 spaces.\n\nBut 12 spaces is 3 indents of 4 spaces? So:\n\n\"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block for a<=b has:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nwhich is 12 spaces? Actually, the code is minified and we don't see the exact spaces, but we assume 4 per indent.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\",\n    \"program2\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n}\n\nBut wait, in program1.py, the line we are replacing is a comment at 16 spaces? Then we output the code at 16 spaces. Similarly, in program2.py, the two lines are at 12 spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is bounded, so the code should run efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without the exact spaces? But the problem requires the code to run. So we must have the correct indentation.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the existing program's indentation. The existing program uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nFor program1.py: 16 spaces (4 levels) and then the code.\nFor program2.py: 12 spaces (3 levels) for each of the two lines.\n\nBut note: in the provided program1.py, the line after the TODO is:\n\n    res.append(s)\n\nSo the for-loop over ab is at 4 spaces, the for-loop over l is at 8, the ifs are at 12, and the bodies are at 16.\n\nSo we are confident.\n\nLet me write the exact string for program1.py: \"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nAnd for program2.py: two lines: \nLine1: \"            b += n[r]\"\nLine2: \"            r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block for a<=b has two lines at 12 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nThe two lines are at 8 spaces? Actually, the if is at 8, and the body is at 12? But the code is written with 4 spaces per indent. So:\n\nwhile l<=r:   # 4 spaces\n    if a<=b:   # 8 spaces\n        a+=n[l]   # 12 spaces\n        l+=1      # 12 spaces\n\nBut the code we see is:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nThe first line of the if is at 8, and the two lines are at 12. So we output the two lines for the elif block at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the two lines for program2.py are each 12 spaces.\n\nBut 12 spaces is represented as 12 spaces? So:\n\n\"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if-block uses 12 spaces? Then we do the same.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\",\n    \"program2\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n}\n\nBut wait, in program1.py, the line we are adding is inside the inner for-loop and inside the condition \"if l != b\". So the entire block for the second character is:\n\n            if l != b:\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut the TODO is only the line we are adding. So we output only that line.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the TODO is in the elif block, and we are replacing it with two lines.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
