    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\nThe idea is to use two pointers: one starting from the left (Alice) and one from the right (Bob).\nWe maintain two sums: `suma` for Alice and `sumb` for Bob, and a counter `cur` for the total number of candies eaten.\nWe also maintain an answer variable `ans` that records the maximum total candies eaten when the two sums are equal.\n\nThe provided code has a TODO in the condition when `suma < sumb`. We need to complete that part.\n\nThe algorithm:\n- Initialize `a = -1`, `b = n` (so Alice starts before the first candy and Bob after the last), `suma = 0`, `sumb = 0`, `cur = 0`, and `ans = 0`.\n- We loop while `a < b` (the pointers haven't crossed).\n  - If `suma > sumb`: then we move Bob's pointer to the left (so Bob eats one more candy from the right) and update `sumb` and `cur`.\n  - If `suma < sumb`: then we should move Alice's pointer to the right (so Alice eats one more candy from the left) and update `suma` and `cur`.\n  - If they are equal: we record the current total candies (`cur`) as a candidate in `ans` (because it's a valid partition), then we move both pointers (Alice eats one more from the left and Bob one more from the right) and update both sums and `cur` by 2.\n\nHowever, note that when `suma == sumb`, we update `ans` and then move both pointers. But when we move both pointers, we are effectively adding two candies (one from each side) and then we continue.\n\nBut note: the condition `a>=b` must break the loop. Also, we must be cautious when moving the pointers: when `suma < sumb`, we do:\n\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nSimilarly, for `suma > sumb` we do:\n\n    b -= 1\n    sumb += arr[b]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut the provided code for `suma > sumb` is already there. We need to write the `suma < sumb` part.\n\nAlso note: the condition `a>=b` must break the loop. We break when the pointers cross.\n\nSo for the missing part in program1.py:\n\n    elif suma < sumb:\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because `a` starts at -1, so the first move sets `a` to 0 (the first candy). Similarly, `b` starts at `n` (which is the index after the last), so the first move for Bob sets `b` to `n-1`.\n\nHowever, we must also note that after moving `a` we might break the condition? The loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration.\n\nBut the problem: what if moving `a` makes `a` become `b-1`? Then in the next iteration we break? That's acceptable.\n\nBut note: when `suma == sumb`, we update `ans` and then move both. Then we have to check if after moving both, `a` becomes `b-1`? Then the next iteration we break? Or if we move both and then `a` becomes `b`? Then we break at the next iteration.\n\nBut note: the condition `a>=b` is checked at the top. So if we have two candies and we move both, then `a` becomes 0 and `b` becomes 0? Actually, we start with `a=-1, b=n`. Then in the first `suma==sumb` (which is 0==0) we do:\n    a becomes 0, b becomes n-1, then we add arr[0] and arr[n-1] and set cur=2.\n\nThen we continue until the pointers cross.\n\nBut what if n is odd? We have to be cautious.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so the two pointers will run in O(n) per test case, but note the constraint on the total n is 200,000, so it's acceptable.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py in the `elif suma < sumb` block is:\n\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious of the index. Since `a` starts at -1, the first time we do `a += 1` we get 0, which is valid.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the code that, for each test case (after the first line which is the number of test cases), reads an integer `rating` and outputs the division.\n\nThe divisions:\n  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nWe note that the input has the first line as the number of test cases, and then each subsequent line is a rating.\n\nThe provided code uses: `for n in [*open(0)][1:]`\n\nThis reads all lines from standard input, and then takes from the second line to the end (because the first line is the number of test cases).\n\nWe need to convert `n` to an integer? Actually, `n` is a string from the input. We can strip it and convert to integer.\n\nBut note: the input might have negative numbers and the range is from -5000 to 5000.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    for rating_str in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        rating = int(rating_str)\n\nThen we check:\n\n    if rating >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif rating >= 1600:   # then it must be between 1600 and 1899\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif rating >= 1400:   # then between 1400 and 1599\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the conditions are exclusive? Actually, the divisions are defined as:\n\n  Division 1: 1900 <= rating\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> which is the same as 1600<=rating and rating<=1899, but in our condition, if rating>=1900 is taken by division1, then the next condition (rating>=1600) will catch 1600 to 1899 because we have already excluded 1900 and above.\n\nSimilarly, the next condition (rating>=1400) will catch 1400 to 1599 because we have excluded 1600 and above.\n\nAnd the rest (rating < 1400) are division 4.\n\nBut note: the problem says division 4 is rating<=1399, so that includes negative numbers and numbers up to 1399.\n\nSo the code for program2.py can be:\n\n    for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the first line is the number of test cases, and then each test case is one integer.\n\nWe are reading from the second line to the end, and converting each line to an integer.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the block for `elif suma < sumb`:\n\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: the code in program1.py is indented. We must output the exact code with the same indentation. The current code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nSo the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nFor program2.py, the entire code after the first line is missing. The provided code is:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the code. So we can write:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the original line is already there. We are only to complete the TODO. The original line is:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can write:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n.strip())   # it's safer to strip in case of newlines\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the input might have spaces? The problem says one integer per line. So using `strip()` is good practice.\n\nAlternatively, we can do `int(n)` without strip because `int` ignores surrounding whitespace. But to be safe, we can use `int(n.strip())` or just `int(n)`.\n\nHowever, the problem says the input is integers. So `int(n)` is sufficient.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The description of each test consists of one line containing one integer\", so we can use `int(n)`.\n\nSo the code for program2.py is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the original line is a single line. We are replacing the TODO with a block. We must indent the block appropriately.\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program1.py: the missing block is inside an `elif` block that is already indented. The current code has 8 spaces of indentation (two levels). So we output 8 spaces for each line.\n\nFor program2.py, the code we are adding is the body of the for-loop. The for-loop line is already there. We are replacing the TODO with the body. The body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop? Actually, the for-loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces. But the provided code in the example for program2.py is:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with a block. We can write the block with 4 spaces of indentation for the entire block. However, the example output format does not require the for-loop line, only the body? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". For program1.py, we are only outputting the three lines that are missing. For program2.py, the entire body of the for-loop is missing? Actually, the TODO is at the end of the for-loop line. So we are to write the body of the for-loop.\n\nBut note: the for-loop line is already present. We are only to write the block that goes inside.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the block that goes under the for-loop, which is 4 spaces of indentation. However, in the example, the code we are writing is at the same level as the for-loop? Actually, no: the body of the for-loop must be indented.\n\nIn Python, we use 4 spaces per indent. So the body should be indented by 4 spaces. But in the JSON string, we have to represent the entire block as a string.\n\nWe can write:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the for-loop line is already there, so we are only providing the body. The body must be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop. However, the entire program2.py code after the for-loop line is the body. So we are providing:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut this body must be indented. In the overall program, the for-loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces. Therefore, each line of the body should start with 4 spaces. However, in the string we are providing, we are representing the entire body as a string. We must include the 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code for program2.py is the body of the for-loop, and it should be indented by 4 spaces. But note: the for-loop line is already present and we are to put the body after it. So the body must be indented.\n\nBut in the example, the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with the body. We can write:\n\n    for n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nSo the body we are providing is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nEach line of the body starts with 4 spaces. Therefore, in the JSON string, we must represent each line of the body with 4 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the first line of the body (r = int(n)) should be indented by 4 spaces, and the rest accordingly.\n\nBut note: the conditionals are nested, so they require more indentation. However, we are writing the entire block as a string. We must represent the exact code.\n\nSo the string for program2.py should be:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut wait, the first line of the body is indented by 4 spaces, then the next line (the if) is also 4 spaces? Actually, the entire body is at the same indentation level (4 spaces). Then the conditionals are indented by 8 spaces (4 for the body and 4 for the block). But in the string above, we have:\n\n    Line1: \"    r = int(n)\"   -> 4 spaces\n    Line2: \"    if r >= 1900:\" -> 4 spaces? That is not enough.\n\nActually, the body of the for-loop is one block. The entire block is indented by 4 spaces. Then inside, the if-elif-else structure is indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 in total) for the conditionals, and the print statements by 8 (for the conditionals) plus 4 more? Actually, in Python, the body of an if is indented by 4 more than the if.\n\nSo the correct representation:\n\n    for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\nSo the body:\n\nLine1: 4 spaces + \"r = int(n)\"\nLine2: 4 spaces + \"if r >= 1900:\"\nLine3: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\"\nLine4: 4 spaces + \"elif ...\"\netc.\n\nBut in the string we are going to output, we have to represent the entire body as a string. We can write:\n\n    body = \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nThis has:\n    Line1: 4 spaces\n    Line2: 4 spaces for the 'if'\n    Line3: 8 spaces for the print (which is 4 for the body and 4 for the if block) -> that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the conditionals (if, elif, else) are at the same level as the assignment? They are, so they are also at 4 spaces. Then the print statements are at 8 spaces.\n\nSo the above string is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the extra 4 spaces? But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing. The missing code is the body of the for-loop, which must be indented by 4 spaces. Therefore, we output the body with each line starting with 4 spaces? Actually, no: the entire body is a block that is indented. The first line of the body is at 4 spaces, and the conditionals and the rest are also at 4 spaces? Actually, the conditionals are at the same level as the assignment? They are. The conditionals are part of the same block.\n\nBut the conditionals have their own blocks. The print statements are indented by 8 spaces (relative to the top) or 4 relative to the conditionals.\n\nSo the representation above is correct.\n\nBut note: the original for-loop line ends with a colon, so the next line must be indented.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    \"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut wait, the program1.py missing code is three lines, each with 8 spaces (because it is inside two levels: the function and the elif). So we have:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nEach line has 8 spaces. So we represent as:\n\n        \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\nBut note: the first line of the missing block in program1.py is at the same indentation as the comment `# TODO: Your code here`. The existing code has:\n\n        elif suma < sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with three lines, each indented by 8 spaces (so 8 spaces from the function level). Therefore, the three lines we output must each start with 8 spaces.\n\nSo the string for program1.py is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nEach line has 8 spaces. So we write:\n\n    \"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the body of the for-loop is:\n\n    Line1: 4 spaces: \"    r = int(n)\"\n    Line2: 4 spaces: \"    if r >= 1900:\"\n    Line3: 8 spaces: \"        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\"\n    Line4: 4 spaces: \"    elif r >= 1600:\"\n    Line5: 8 spaces: \"        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n    etc.\n\nSo the entire string for program2.py is:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the for-loop line is already present, so we are only providing the body.\n\nNow, we must escape the double quotes in the print statements.\n\nSo the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the entire JSON must be on one line? The problem does not specify, but we can output it as a single line.\n\nAlternatively, we can output a pretty-printed JSON? The problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And the output format is JSON.\n\nBut the example output format is a JSON object with two string fields.\n\nWe can write the JSON as a single line.\n\nBut to avoid errors, we escape the double quotes and newlines.\n\nWe'll write the JSON string without extra spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `json` module to dump, but we are writing by hand.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\", \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"}\n\nBut note: the program2.py string has double quotes inside. We must escape them. We did: we wrote `\\\"`.\n\nSo it should be valid.\n\nLet me check:\n\nThe program2 string: \n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nThis is a valid string.\n\nSimilarly, the program1 string is valid.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
