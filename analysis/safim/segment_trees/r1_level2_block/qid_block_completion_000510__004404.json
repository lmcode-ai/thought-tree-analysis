Actually, the recurrence: \n                            dp[u] = max_i (dp[child_i] + i)  for i from 1 to k? but then we add 1?

Example: one child: \n                            f = [dp[child1]] (sorted descending, but only one)\n                            then dp[u] = f[0] + 0 + 1 = dp[child1] + 1. But the time for the child's subtree is dp[child1] seconds, and we started at time1 (injecting the root) and then at time2 we spread to the child? Then the child's infection starts at time2 and takes dp[child1] seconds? so total time = 1 + 1 + dp[child1] = 2 + dp[child1]? But the recurrence gives 1 + dp[child1]? This is off by one.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about processing queries for a promotion: for each query (x, y), we need to compute the maximum total value of free items when a customer must buy at least x items and then gets the y cheapest ones free.\n\n Approach:\n We note that the customer can choose any set of at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest in the chosen set), we want to maximize the sum of the y cheapest. However, note that the free items are the cheapest ones, so we want as many high-priced items as possible to be included without being among the free ones.\n\n Actually, the problem can be rephrased: we want to choose a set of exactly x items (because if we choose more, we can always drop the extra ones that are expensive and not free, because they don't help in increasing the free part) such that the sum of the y smallest items in that set is maximized.\n\n But note: the free items are the y cheapest in the set. So we want the set to have the y cheapest as large as possible. How? We can try to have as many large numbers as possible, but the free ones are the smallest in the set. Therefore, the best strategy is to take the largest x items and then the free ones are the smallest y of these x. However, note that the problem says \"maximum total value of items received for free\". \n\n Why is that optimal? Because if we take the top x items by price, then the free ones are the smallest y in these top x. If we were to take a set that includes a smaller item, then that smaller item would be included in the free part and might reduce the overall free value (because we could have had a larger item in the free part if we avoided the small one).\n\n However, note: the example: \n   Input: [5, 3, 5] for x=3, y=2 -> free = 3+5 = 8? \n   But wait: the prices are [1,2,3,5,5] (n=5). Then we sort in descending order: [5,5,3,2,1]. \n   For the first query: x=3, y=2 -> we take the top 3: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest in this set are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But note: the set is [5,5,3] -> the two smallest are 3 and 5? Then the free value is 3+5=8.\n\n However, the example output is 8.\n\n But wait: the example says: \"a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\". But note: the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest numbers are 3 and 5? But there are two 5's. How do we get 3 and 5? The set {5,5,3} has the two smallest as 3 and 5? Then the sum is 8.\n\n How do we compute this quickly?\n We sort the prices in descending order. Then we note that for a fixed x (we take the top x items) the free items are the last y items in this top x (which are the smallest in the set). Therefore, the free value is the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) (0-indexed) in the descending sorted array? Actually, if we have:\n   sorted_prices = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] in descending order.\n\n Then the top x items are: a0, a1, ..., a_{x-1}. The smallest y items in this set are the last y: a_{x-y}, a_{x-y+1}, ..., a_{x-1}. \n\n But note: the example: \n   n=5, prices = [5,5,3,2,1] (sorted descending)\n   Query: x=3, y=2 -> we take indices 0,1,2: [5,5,3]. The last two in this segment are at indices 1 and 2? Actually, the segment from index 1 to 2? But that would be 5 and 3 -> sum=8.\n\n However, the current code in program1.py does:\n   l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n   print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\n This does not look like a prefix sum. And the example output for the first query is 8, but the current code for the first query (x=3, y=2) would do:\n   l = prices[3-2-1] = prices[0] = 5\n   then print(prices[2] - 5) = 3 - 5 = -2 -> which is not 8.\n\n So the current code is flawed. We must fix it.\n\n Actually, the intended solution is to precompute a prefix sum array so that we can quickly get the sum of the last y in the top x.\n\n Steps for program1.py:\n   Step 1: Read n, q.\n   Step 2: Read the list of prices and sort in descending order? Actually, the problem says: we want the free items to be the cheapest in the set. If we sort in descending order, then the set of x items we take is the first x. The cheapest in that set are the last y of the first x.\n\n   But note: the example: [5,5,3,2,1] -> for x=3, y=2: the last two of the first three are [3,5]? Actually, if we have the array in descending order, then the segment we want is from index (x-y) to (x-1) is the last y of the first x? Actually, the array is:\n        index0:5, index1:5, index2:3, index3:2, index4:1.\n        For x=3: we take indices0,1,2 -> the last two are indices1 and 2? But that gives 5 and 3 -> which is 8.\n\n   However, the problem: we need the sum of the free items. So we need the sum of the segment [x-y, x-1] (0-indexed). \n\n   But note: the constraints: n, q up to 200,000. We cannot do a loop for each query to sum y elements. Therefore, we precompute a prefix sum array.\n\n   Let's do:\n        prices.sort(reverse=True)   # descending order\n        prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n\n   Then for a query (x,y):\n        We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) -> that's prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]\n\n   Example: x=3, y=2 -> prefix[3] = 5+5+3 = 13, prefix[1] = 5 -> then 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   But the current code in the given program1.py does not have a prefix sum. It has a loop that does:\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   And then in the query loop, it does:\n        l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n        print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\n   This is clearly a different approach. And it doesn't work for the example.\n\n   Therefore, we must change the program to use prefix sums.\n\n   However, note the note in the code: \n        # 5 5 3 2 1\n        # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n   This comment suggests that the array is being transformed into a prefix sum? The second line: 5, 10, 13, 15, 16 looks like the prefix sum of the descending sorted array.\n\n   So the TODO in the for loop is to build the prefix sum in-place? \n\n   We can do:\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   Then the array becomes the prefix sum of the descending sorted array.\n\n   Then for a query (x,y):\n        We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1). \n        If we have the prefix sum array (call it pre), then:\n            total = pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\n        But note: our array is 0-indexed. The prefix array we built: \n            pre[0] = prices[0] (the first element)\n            pre[1] = prices[0]+prices[1]\n            ...\n            pre[i] = sum of prices[0] to prices[i]\n\n        Then the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1) is:\n            pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\n        However, if x-y==0, then we want the entire segment from 0 to x-1? Actually, if x-y==0, then we want the segment from 0 to x-1? But that is pre[x-1] - pre[-1] for negative index? \n\n        Actually, if x-y==0, then we are taking the segment from index0 to index (x-1). So we can write:\n            if x-y == 0:\n                total = pre[x-1]\n            else:\n                total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n        Alternatively, we can define pre[-1] = 0? We can set pre = [0] * (n+1) and then pre[1..n] for the array? But the current code does not have an extra element.\n\n   How about we build the prefix array in a new array? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The existing code already has:\n\n        n, q = ... \n        prices = ... \n        prices.sort(reverse=True)\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We can complete the TODO to build the prefix sum in the prices array? \n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   Then in the query loop:\n\n        We note: \n            We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1). \n\n        Let start_index = x - y   (the first index of the free segment, which is the (x-y)th element in 0-indexed, but note: we have the prefix array so that the element at index i is the prefix sum from 0 to i)\n\n        Then the sum = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\n        However, if x-y==0, then we subtract nothing? \n\n        But note: if x-y==0, then we are taking the entire prefix from 0 to x-1, which is prices[x-1] (because we built the prefix in the array).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if x == y:\n                # then we are taking the entire set of x items? Actually, the free part is the entire set? \n                # then the free value = prices[x-1] (because the prefix sum at index x-1 is the sum of the first x items)\n                total = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                total = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n        But wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? We have x>=y, so x-y>=0. Then x-y-1 can be negative only when x-y==0? Actually, when x==y, then x-y-1 = -1 -> which is negative. So we can write:\n\n            if x-y-1 < 0:\n                total = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                total = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n        Alternatively, we can set a variable for the index: \n            start_index = x - y - 1   # because we want to subtract the prefix at index (x-y-1) to get the segment from (x-y) to (x-1)\n            if start_index < 0:\n                total = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                total = prices[x-1] - prices[start_index]\n\n        But note: the example query: x=2, y=1: \n            We have: x-y-1 = 0 -> then total = prices[1] - prices[0] \n            prices[0] = 5 (the first element in the descending sorted array: [5,5,3,2,1])\n            prices[1] = 5+5 = 10\n            then total = 10 - 5 = 5 -> which is correct.\n\n        Another example: x=5, y=3: \n            We want the last 3 of the top 5: which are the last three in [5,5,3,2,1] -> [3,2,1] -> sum=6.\n            How do we compute?\n                x=5, y=3 -> start_index = 5-3-1 = 1 -> then total = prices[4] - prices[1] \n                prices[4] = 5+5+3+2+1 = 16\n                prices[1] = 5+5 = 10\n                total = 16-10 = 6 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can change the query loop to:\n\n        while q:\n            x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            # We have the prefix array in prices (0-indexed, with the prefix built for the descending sorted array)\n            # The entire set of x items: from index0 to index (x-1) -> prefix sum at index (x-1) is the total sum of the top x.\n            # The free part: the last y of these x -> from index (x-y) to (x-1) -> which is the segment of length y starting at (x-y) in the array of the top x.\n\n            # We want: \n            #   if x-y-1 < 0: then the free part is the entire prefix at index (x-1)\n            #   else: free part = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n            if x == y:\n                # then we are taking the entire set? \n                # Actually, when x==y, then x-y-1 = -1 -> so we use the if branch.\n                total_free = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                # But note: if x-y-1 is negative, we use the if branch. So we can write:\n                if x-y-1 < 0:\n                    total_free = prices[x-1]\n                else:\n                    total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n            print(total_free)\n            q -= 1\n\n   However, we can write without an explicit if for x==y:\n\n        start_index = x - y - 1\n        if start_index < 0:\n            total_free = prices[x-1]\n        else:\n            total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[start_index]\n\n   But note: the array we built is the prefix of the descending sorted array. The descending sorted array has the largest at index0.\n\n   However, the example in the note: \n        # 5 5 3 2 1\n        # 5 10 13 15 16   -> this is the prefix array.\n\n   So the code in the while loop currently is:\n\n        l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n        print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\n   This is incorrect because:\n        For the first query: x=3, y=2 -> \n            l = prices[3-2-1] = prices[0] = 5\n            then print(prices[2] - 5) -> prices[2] is 13? because the array is now [5,10,13,15,16] -> 13-5=8 -> which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the array we built is the prefix array. So the element at index0 is 5, index1 is 10, index2 is 13.\n\n        Then for x=3: \n            prices[x-1] = prices[2] = 13\n            l = prices[0] = 5\n            then 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n        How about x=2, y=1:\n            l = prices[2-1-1] = prices[0] = 5\n            then print(prices[1] - 5) = 10-5=5 -> correct.\n\n        How about x=5, y=3:\n            l = prices[5-3-1] = prices[1] = 10\n            then print(prices[4] - 10) -> but wait, the array has 5 elements: indices0 to 4. \n            prices[4] = 16 -> 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n        How about x=1, y=1:\n            l = 0 if x==y -> then l=0\n            print(prices[0] - 0) = 5 -> but the free value for one item? The customer must buy at least 1, and then the cheapest one (which is the only one) is free -> 5. Correct.\n\n        How about x=4, y=2:\n            l = prices[4-2-1] = prices[1] = 10\n            print(prices[3] - 10) = 15-10=5 -> \n            The set: top 4: [5,5,3,2] -> the two cheapest: 2 and 3 -> sum=5 -> correct.\n\n        So the current code in the while loop is actually correct if we have built the prefix array? \n\n        But note: the condition for x==y: \n            Then we do l=0, and then total = prices[x-1] - 0 = prices[x-1] -> which is the entire prefix of the top x? \n            For x=3, y=3: \n                total = prices[2] = 13 -> which is the entire set of 3: 5+5+3=13 -> correct.\n\n        However, what if we have x=1, y=1: \n            Then we do l=0, and total = prices[0] = 5 -> correct.\n\n        But what if we have x=2, y=2: \n            Then l=0, total = prices[1] = 10 -> which is 5+5=10 -> correct.\n\n        So the current while loop code is correct if we have built the prefix array.\n\n        Therefore, the only missing part is the for loop to build the prefix array.\n\n        We complete the for loop:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n                prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n        And then the while loop remains as is.\n\n        But note: the example in the note: \n            # 5 5 3 2 1\n            # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n        That is exactly what we get.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is just:\n\n        prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   However, note the indentation: the for loop body is one line.\n\n   But the existing code has:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with: prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   But note: the array is 0-indexed and we are building the prefix in-place.\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n   But note: the while loop is already there. We are only adding one line in the for loop.\n\n   But wait: the existing code in the for loop has a comment and then a TODO. We are replacing the TODO with the line.\n\n   But the TODO is the only thing missing? \n\n   Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must replace the TODO with the code. So we write the line.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing code is the line: \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   But note: the existing code has a while loop that is correct? We are not changing it.\n\n   But wait: the example in the note: \n        # 5 5 3 2 1\n        # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n   And the while loop uses:\n\n        l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n        print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\n   This matches our reasoning.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: when x-y-1 is negative? The condition \"x == y\" handles the case when we would get a negative index? \n\n        In the condition: if x==y, then we set l=0. Otherwise, we set l = prices[x-y-1]. \n\n        But note: if x>y, then x-y-1 is at least 0? Because x>=y+1 -> x-y-1>=0. So we are safe.\n\n        Example: x=1, y=1 -> then x==y -> l=0 -> then we print prices[0] -> correct.\n\n        x=2, y=1 -> x>y -> then l = prices[0] -> correct.\n\n        x=3, y=2 -> l = prices[0] -> correct.\n\n        x=3, y=3 -> l=0 -> then we print prices[2] -> which is the prefix sum of the first 3 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py is fixed by adding the line in the for loop.\n\n   But note: the problem says the array has n elements. The for loop runs from 1 to n-1 (if n is the length). \n\n   We are building the prefix array: \n        index0: unchanged -> the first element.\n        index1: becomes prices[0]+prices[1]\n        index2: becomes (prices[0]+prices[1]) + prices[2] -> which is the prefix for the first three.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and we are to output in a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n   So we write: \"program1\": \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that is missing.\n\n   But note: the existing code has the for loop and the while loop. We are only adding one line in the for loop.\n\n   But the for loop body is currently empty (with a TODO). We are replacing the TODO with that line.\n\n   But the TODO is a comment? Then we remove the comment and put the line.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the line that is missing.\n\n   But note: the existing code has:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line with the code. So the missing code for the for loop body is: \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   But we must be cautious: the existing code has an indentation. The for loop body must be indented. But the problem says to output the missing code without the entire program. So we output the line as it would appear in the program.\n\n   The line is: \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\" (with 4 spaces of indentation) or the same as the existing for loop? The existing for loop has 4 spaces for the body? The problem code shows:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So we output the same indentation: 4 spaces.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match. Since the existing code uses 4 spaces, we use 4 spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\" and the missing code is the line that goes in the for loop. So we output:\n\n        prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   with the same level of indentation as the comment. But the comment is at one level of indentation (4 spaces). So we output 4 spaces and then the code? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\n   But note: the example output format is a JSON string. We must escape if necessary.\n\n   We'll output the string without newlines? The missing code for program1 is one line.\n\n   So: \"program1\": \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   But wait: the existing code has a for loop that is:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO comment with the line. So we remove the comment and put the line. Therefore, the entire for loop becomes:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n   So the missing code is the line: \"prices[i] += prices[i-1]\" with the same indentation as the comment. The comment is at 4 spaces. So we output 4 spaces and then the code.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are not outputting the entire for loop, just the body.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". Here we are missing one line.\n\n   So for program1.py: \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n\n   But note: the problem code has a while loop that is already there. We are not changing it.\n\n   Now for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: infecting a tree in minimal seconds.\n\n   The code provided:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n\n        counter = defaultdict(int)\n\n        def solve(a):\n            for ai in a:\n                counter[ai] += 1\n            count = list(counter.values())\n            num_level = len(count)\n            count.sort()\n\n            for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n            if R == 0:\n                return num_level + 1\n\n            def check(k):\n                b = count.copy()\n                for i in range(len(b)):\n                    b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                if sum(b) <= k:\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            return num_level + 1 + R\n\n        for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            counter.clear()\n            res = solve(a.split())\n            print(res)\n\n   The problem: we are to complete the TODO in the else branch.\n\n   The algorithm:\n\n        We are building a counter for the children count? The input for a test case: \n            first integer n, then n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn, where p_i is the parent of i.\n\n        Then the code:\n\n            for ai in a:   # a is the list of the n-1 parent indices\n                counter[ai] += 1\n\n            count = list(counter.values())   # this gives the frequency of each parent? meaning the number of children that each node has? But note: the root (node1) is not in the list? \n\n        However, the root node1 might appear as a parent? The list a has the parent of node2, node3, ... node n. So the root (node1) might appear multiple times? \n\n        Then we sort the count list.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n        What is this? \n\n        Then we set L=0, R = max(count). If R==0, then we return num_level+1.\n\n        Then we define a function check(k) that for each element in count, subtracts k and then takes max(0, ...), and then checks if the sum of the resulting array is <= k.\n\n        Then we do a binary search on k in the range [L, R] (but note: R is max(count)) and we are looking for the minimal k such that check(k) is true? Actually, the binary search is:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (L+R)//2\n                if check(mid):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: set L to mid? \n\n        In a typical binary search for the minimal k that satisfies the condition, we do:\n\n            while L < R:\n                mid = (L+R)//2\n                if check(mid):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    L = mid+1\n\n        But here the condition is: while R-L>1, and then we set mid = (L+R)//2.\n\n        If check(mid) is true, we set R=mid. Then the interval becomes [L, mid] and [mid, R] -> but we are keeping R as the candidate.\n\n        If check(mid) is false, then we should set L=mid? Because we know that k must be at least mid+1.\n\n        Example: \n            L=0, R=10 -> mid=5 -> if check(5) is false, then we set L=5? Then the new interval is [5,10] and then mid=7, etc.\n\n        So the TODO is: L = mid\n\n        Therefore, the missing line is: \"L = mid\"\n\n        But note: the binary search condition: we break when R-L<=1. Then we return num_level+1+R.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The problem: we are infecting the tree. The process:\n\n            Initially: no infected.\n\n            Each second:\n                Spreading: for each vertex v that has at least one child infected, we can choose at most one additional child to infect (so we can choose one if available).\n                Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex to infect.\n\n            We want the minimal seconds.\n\n        How is the solution structured?\n\n        We note that the root must be infected at time 0? Actually, the problem says: initially all are healthy. Then at second 1, we can do an injection to the root? \n\n        But note: the problem does not say we start at time 0. We start at time 0 and then at each second we do spreading and then injection.\n\n        The known solution:\n\n            We build the children count for each node? But note: the root is node1, and it may have multiple children.\n\n            The infection starts by injecting the root? But we don't have to: we can start anywhere.\n\n        However, the known approach:\n\n            Step 1: We build an array for the number of children for each node? Actually, the frequency of the parent in the list is the number of children? But note: the root is not in the list? So we must account for the root.\n\n            The root (node1) is not in the list of parents? But the root might have children. How do we count the children of the root? \n                The list a has the parent of node2, node3, ... node n. If the root is the parent of some nodes, then the root (value 1) will appear in the list.\n\n            So the counter for the root is the frequency of '1' in the list.\n\n            Then we have an array of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? Actually, the counter only counts the nodes that appear as a parent at least once. But what about nodes that are leaves? They are not in the counter? \n\n            However, the counter is built from the list a. So we have the count for each parent that appears. The leaves do not appear as a parent? So they are not in the counter.\n\n            Then we have an array \"count\" of the children counts for the nodes that are not leaves.\n\n            Then we sort this array.\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                for i in range(len(count)):\n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            Why? \n\n            Explanation from known solutions:\n\n                We start by infecting the root at time 0? Actually, the root is infected at time 1? \n\n                The known solution steps:\n\n                    We consider the spread as a process that can be accelerated by the branching factor.\n\n                Alternate known solution (from similar problems):\n\n                    We can simulate the infection as:\n\n                        We start with the root infected at time 0? Then at each second, we can do:\n\n                            Spreading: for each node that has at least one infected child, we can infect one more child (if available) in that second.\n\n                            Injection: we can inject one node arbitrarily.\n\n                    But we are allowed to choose which child to spread to and which node to inject.\n\n                    The minimal time can be computed by:\n\n                        Let deg(v) be the degree of the node (or the number of children? actually, the root has no parent, so the number of children is the degree? for others, the number of children = deg(v)-1?).\n\n                    Actually, the problem: the tree is rooted. The root has no parent, so the number of children is the degree. For others, the number of children = deg(v)-1.\n\n                    However, the problem says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\". So we care about the number of children.\n\n                    Steps:\n\n                        We start at time 0: no infected.\n\n                        At time 1: we inject the root -> now the root is infected.\n\n                        Then at time 2: \n                            Spreading: the root has at least one child infected? Actually, the root has no infected child at the start of time2? \n                            But note: at the end of time1, the root is infected. Then at the spreading phase of time2: the root has one infected child? Actually, the root is the parent of its children. The children are not infected yet. So no spreading? Then we do injection: we can inject one more node.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can inject a node at time1? and then at time2 we can spread from the root to one child? \n\n                    The known solution:\n\n                        We consider the children counts of the nodes. We start with the root being infected at time0? Actually, the problem says: initially all are healthy. Then the first operation is at second1: we do spreading (which does nothing) and then we inject the root.\n\n                        Then at second1: the root is infected.\n\n                        Then at second2: \n                            Spreading: the root has one infected child? (the root itself is not a child) -> actually, the root has no infected child? because the children are not infected. So we do injection: we inject one child of the root.\n\n                        Then at second3: \n                            Spreading: the root has one infected child, so we can spread to one more child of the root. Also, we can inject anywhere.\n\n                        However, we are allowed to do both: spreading and then injection.\n\n                    The known solution in code:\n\n                        We build an array of the number of children for each node? Then we sort in descending order? But the code sorts in ascending order? \n\n                        Then we subtract an index and a constant? \n\n                    The idea:\n\n                        The infection starts at the root. Then we have two operations per second: spreading and injection.\n\n                        The spreading operation: for a node v, if it has multiple children, we can only spread one per second after the first child is infected. But the first child must be infected by injection? \n\n                        Actually, the root: \n                            At second1: we inject the root -> infected: {root}\n                            Then at second2: we can inject one child -> infected: {root, child1}\n                            Then at second3: we can spread from the root to child2 (because the root has one infected child) -> infected: {root, child1, child2}\n                            Then at second4: we can spread from the root to child3 -> infected: {root, child1, child2, child3}\n\n                        But if the root has 3 children, it takes 4 seconds? \n\n                        However, we can also inject non-root children? \n\n                    Alternate approach:\n\n                        We note that we can inject arbitrarily. The spreading operation is limited: for a node v, we can only spread one child per second after the first child is infected by injection.\n\n                        The minimal time is computed by:\n\n                            Let f(v) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree rooted at v.\n\n                            For a leaf: f(v)=0? but we start at time0 with nothing. Actually, we need to infect the leaf: \n                                At time1: we inject the leaf -> then it's done. So f(leaf)=1.\n\n                            For a node v with k children: \n                                We first infect one child by injection at time t0. Then we can use spreading to infect the remaining children. But note: we can interleave injections and spreadings arbitrarily.\n\n                                However, the spreading for node v can only start after at least one child is infected.\n\n                                We can infect the children in any order. We want to minimize the total time.\n\n                                We can model: \n                                    We have k children. We can assign an infection time to each child: t1, t2, ... tk. \n                                    The constraint: at time t_i, the node v must have at least one child already infected to allow spreading? Actually, for the spreading to happen at a second, at least one child must be infected at the start of that second.\n\n                                But note: we can also use injection on the children arbitrarily.\n\n                                The infection of child i takes f(child_i) seconds? Actually, the entire subtree of child i takes f(child_i) seconds? \n\n                                Then the time for the entire subtree v: \n                                    We start at time0. \n                                    We can inject one child at time1, then at time2 we can inject another or spread? \n\n                                Actually, the process is global: we are allowed one injection per second and one spreading per node per second? \n\n                                The known solution: \n                                    We sort the children by the time they get infected (or the time they are available to help in spreading) in descending order.\n\n                                    Then the time for the node v is: \n                                        max( f(child_i) + i ) for i from 1 to k, where the children are sorted in descending order of f(child_i).\n\n                                But wait: we can choose the order.\n\n                                We want to minimize the maximum over i of (f(child_i) + the order index i).\n\n                                Then f(v) = max_i (f(child_i) + i) \n\n                                But then we add the root? \n\n                            However, the root is special: we start with nothing. We must inject the root? Actually, we can start by injecting the root at time1? Then the root is infected at time1.\n\n                            Then the children of the root: we can start infecting them at time2.\n\n                            So the total time for the root's subtree: \n                                Let the root has k children. We assign an order to the children: \n                                    child1: infected at time = 1 (injection at time2) + f(child1) -> but wait, the infection of the child1's subtree takes f(child1) seconds? \n\n                            Actually, the time for the entire tree is: 1 (for the root) + max_i (f(child_i) + i) \n\n                        But the known solution does not do DFS? It does a frequency count? \n\n                    The provided code:\n\n                        We count the frequency of the parent nodes. This gives the number of children for each node.\n\n                        Then we sort the count array (the array of children counts) in ascending order.\n\n                        Then we do:\n\n                            for i in range(num_level):\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                        Then we set L=0, R = max(count). If R==0, then we return num_level+1.\n\n                        Then we do a binary search for the minimal k such that:\n\n                            b = [max(c - k, 0) for c in count]\n                            and then check if sum(b) <= k.\n\n                        Then the answer is: num_level+1+R, where R is the result of the binary search.\n\n                    What is num_level? It is the length of the count array? which is the number of nodes that have at least one child? \n\n                    How does this relate to the infection time?\n\n                    Known similar solution (from a Codeforces problem) for \"Infected Tree\":\n\n                        The solution:\n\n                            n = int(input())\n                            g = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n                            for i in range(2, n+1):\n                                p = int(input())\n                                g[p].append(i)\n\n                            # dp[u] = minimal seconds to infect the entire subtree of u\n                            # But the known solution does:\n\n                            # Let children = g[u]\n                            # if not children: \n                            #   return 1\n                            # else:\n                            #   let f = sorted([dp[v] for v in children], reverse=True)\n                            #   return max(f[i] + i + 1 for i in range(len(f))) \n\n                        But then the answer for the root is dp[1]? \n\n                        However, the problem says: we start with no infected. Then the first injection is at second1. So the entire process for the root's subtree might be dp[1] seconds? \n\n                        But the known solution returns 1 for a leaf? \n\n                        Actually, for a leaf: \n                            We must inject it -> at second1: inject -> done. So 1 second.\n\n                        For a node with one child:\n                            We inject the child at second1: then at second2, we can spread from the node to the child? But wait, the node is not infected? \n\n                        Actually, we must start by infecting the node? \n\n                        The known solution for a node u:\n\n                            We assume that at time0, the node u is not infected. Then at the first second: we can inject the node u? Then at the same second, we cannot spread? \n\n                            Then at the next second, we can spread to one child? But we have one child. So we spread to the child? Then the child is infected at time2? Then the entire subtree is infected at time2? \n\n                            But the child might have a subtree? \n\n                        The recurrence:\n\n                            We start at time0: nothing.\n\n                            Time1: inject u -> u is infected.\n\n                            Time2: we can spread from u to one child -> child1 is infected. Then we start the infection in child1's subtree. The time for child1's subtree is dp[child1]? but note: the infection of child1's subtree starts at time2? \n\n                            Then the total time for the subtree of u: 2 + dp[child1]? \n\n                            But the recurrence: \n                                f = [dp[child1]]  (only one child)\n                                then dp[u] = max(f[0] + 1) = dp[child1] + 1? \n\n                            But we have 2 + dp[child1]? \n\n                        Actually, the recurrence: \n                            dp[u] = max_i (dp[child_i] + i)  for i from 1 to k? but then we add 1? \n\n                        The known solution: \n                            f = sorted([dp[v] for v in children], reverse=True)\n                            dp[u] = max( [f[i] + i + 1 for i in range(len(f))] )\n\n                        Why +1? \n\n                        Example: one child: \n                            f = [dp[child1]] (sorted descending, but only one)\n                            then dp[u] = f[0] + 0 + 1 = dp[child1] + 1.\n\n                        But the time for the child's subtree is dp[child1] seconds, and we started at time1 (injecting the root) and then at time2 we spread to the child? Then the child's infection starts at time2 and takes dp[child1] seconds? so total time = 1 + 1 + dp[child1] = 2 + dp[child1]? \n\n                        But the recurrence gives 1 + dp[child1]? \n\n                        This is off by one.\n\n                    After reading known solutions for the problem (from Codeforces): \n\n                        The problem is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1665/problem/C\n\n                        The solution:\n\n                            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                            using namespace std;\n\n                            int main() {\n                                int t;\n                                cin >> t;\n                                while (t--) {\n                                    int n;\n                                    cin >> n;\n                                    vector<int> deg(n+1, 0);\n                                    deg[1]++; // the root has one extra?

Then they did:\n\n                                cnt[i] = max(0, cnt[i] - (k - i) - 1)\n\n                            But note: they sorted in descending order, so the largest count is at index0.\n\n                            In our code, we sorted in ascending order? \n\n                                count.sort()   # ascending\n\n                            Then we do:\n\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                            This is not the same.\n\n                        How to make it the same?\n\n                            If we sort in ascending order, then the smallest count is at index0. The known solution uses the largest count first.\n\n                            We can reverse the array to get descending order? \n\n                            But the known solution then does: \n                                for i in range(k):\n                                    cnt[i] = cnt[i] - (k - i) - 1\n\n                            In our code, if we sort in ascending order, then the largest count is at the end. \n\n                            We want to subtract: for the j-th largest count, we subtract (j) and then a constant? \n\n                            Let j = k-1-i: then the largest count is at index k-1 in an ascending sorted array.\n\n                            Then for the largest count (at index k-1), we subtract (k - (k-1) - 1) = 0? \n\n                            That doesn't match.\n\n                        Alternatively, the known solution's subtraction:\n\n                            They subtract (k - i) and then 1.\n\n                            In our code, we subtract i (the index in the ascending sorted array) and then 2.\n\n                            Why 2? \n\n                        Let me try with a small example: n=3, tree: 1-2, 1-3.\n\n                            Then the list a: [1,1] (for node2 and node3, parent=1)\n\n                            Then counter: { '1':2 }\n\n                            Then count = [2] -> num_level=1.\n\n                            Then for i in range(1): \n                                count[0] = max(2 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(0,0)=0.\n\n                            Then R = max(count)=0 -> then return num_level+1 = 2.\n\n                            But the known solution: \n                                They would have: \n                                    cnt = [2] (after sorting descending and removing zeros) -> k=1.\n                                    ans = k+1 = 2.\n                                    then for i=0: cnt[0] = 2 - (1-0) - 1 = 2-1-1=0.\n                                    then they remove zeros -> cnt becomes empty -> then they do binary search? no, then they break and then output ans=2.\n\n                            Then they output 2.\n\n                            But the minimal seconds for a tree with 3 nodes: \n                                Second1: inject the root (node1) -> infected: {1}\n                                Second2: \n                                    Spreading: the root has one child infected? none -> so we do injection: inject node2 -> infected: {1,2}\n                                Second3:\n                                    Spreading: the root has one child infected (node2) -> we can spread to node3 -> infected: {1,2,3}\n                                -> 3 seconds.\n\n                            But the known solution outputs 2? \n\n                            This is not matching.\n\n                        The known solution I found online for the problem \"C.

This takes as many seconds as there are groups (because we can inject one per second) -> but note, we start with no injections, and we can do one injection per second.\n\n                                Part2: The remaining nodes in the groups can be infected by spreading. For a group with size s, the number of remaining nodes is s-1. The spreading for a group can happen only after the first node in the group is infected (by injection) and then one per second.\n\n                                However, the spreading for different groups can happen in parallel: in one second, for each group that has at least one infected node and has remaining nodes, we can spread to one node in that group.\n\n                                Therefore, the additional seconds needed after the initial injections (which take group_count seconds) is the maximum over the groups of the remaining nodes? \n\n                                But note: the spreading for a group with s-1 remaining nodes will take s-1 seconds, and these can be done in parallel. So the additional seconds is the maximum s-1 over the groups.\n\n                                Then total time = group_count + max(s-1 over groups)\n\n                            For the example: \n                                groups: \n                                    group1 (root): size=1 -> remaining=0.\n                                    group2 (children of root): size=2 -> remaining=1.\n                                group_count = 2.\n                                additional seconds = max(0,1) = 1.\n                                total = 3 seconds.\n\n                            But the known solution that outputs 2 is not this.\n\n                        The editorial solution for the problem:\n\n                            Let k be the number of groups (families) -> groups = k.\n                            We inject one node in each group, which takes k seconds.\n\n                            Then we have in each group i, we have (s_i - 1) nodes left.\n\n                            Then we can spread in the groups. In one second, we can spread in at most as many groups as we want? (one per group) -> so the additional seconds is the ceiling of the sum of the (s_i-1) over the seconds? \n\n                            Actually, the spreading can be done in parallel for all groups. So the additional seconds is the maximum over the groups of the remaining nodes? \n\n                            But consider: \n                                Group1: 3 nodes initially, then after injection: 2 left.\n                                Group2: 3 nodes initially, then after injection: 2 left.\n\n                                Then after the initial k seconds (which is 2 seconds), we have:\n\n                                    Second2+1: spread in group1 and group2 -> then both become 1 left.\n                                    Second2+2: spread in group1 and group2 -> done.\n\n                                So additional seconds = 2.\n\n                                But the maximum remaining is 2, and we took 2 seconds.\n\n                            Therefore, the additional seconds is the maximum over i of (s_i - 1) ? -> then total = k + max_i (s_i-1)\n\n                            Example n=3: \n                                groups: \n                                    group1 (root): s1=1 -> 0\n                                    group2 (children of root): s2=2 -> 1\n                                then total = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n                            Example with two groups of size 3: \n                                total = 2 + (3-1) = 2+2 = 4 seconds.\n\n                            But the known solution that uses the binary search does something else.\n\n                        The provided code in program2.py does:\n\n                            count = list(counter.values())   # the children counts for the nodes that are parents (not including the root's group if the root is not in the list)\n                            num_level = len(count)\n                            count.sort()   # ascending\n                            for i in range(num_level):\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                            then if R==0: return num_level+1\n                            else: do binary search on R in [0, max(count)] for the minimal R such that sum(max(count[i]-R,0)) <= R.\n\n                            then return num_level+1+R.\n\n                        For the example n=3:\n                            count = [2]  (because the root is in the list? and has count=2)\n                            num_level=1.\n                            count[0] = max(2-0-2,0)=0.\n                            R=0 -> then return 1+1 = 2.\n\n                        This matches the known solution that outputs 2, but the expected is 3.\n\n                        The discrepancy: the known solution might consider the root as a group of size 1? \n\n                        In the provided code, we are not including the root's group? \n\n                        The input: \n                            The tree has n-1 edges. The parents are given for nodes 2..n.\n\n                        The groups: \n                            The root (node1) has no parent, so it is not in the list of parents? \n                            But the list of parents has the parent of node2 and node3, which is 1. So the counter for '1' is 2.\n\n                        Should we consider the root as a group? \n\n                        The spreading: the root is a vertex. To infect the root, we must inject it. So the root forms a group of size 1.\n\n                        Therefore, we should have an extra group for the root.\n\n                        In the known solution that passed, they did:\n\n                            vector<int> v;\n                            v.push_back(1);   // for the root\n                            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                                if (p[i]) v.push_back(p[i]);\n                            }\n\n                        In our code, we only have the counter for the parents that appear. We are missing the root's group.\n\n                        How to fix program2.py:\n\n                            We should account for the root. The root is node1, and it is not in the list of parents? But it is the parent of some nodes, so it is in the list? \n\n                            However, the root might appear in the list. But the counter for the root is the number of its children, not including itself.\n\n                            The group for the root should be of size 1 (the root itself) plus its children? \n\n                        The editorial solution: a group is defined by the children of a common parent. The root is a parent, and its group includes its children. The root itself is not in the group of its children? \n\n                        The spreading for the root: \n                            To infect the root, we must inject it.\n                            Then to infect its children, we can spread from the root.\n\n                        Therefore, the root's group is the children of the root. The root itself is not in any group? \n\n                        But then the root must be injected separately.\n\n                        So the groups are the sets of children for each parent. The root is not in a group, so we must inject it.\n\n                        Then the number of groups is (number of nodes that have at least one child) and also the root is an extra node to inject.\n\n                        Therefore, the initial injections: \n                            We must inject the root and one node in each group.\n                            The number of initial injections = (number of groups) + 1.\n\n                        And the number of groups = len(count) = the number of nodes that have at least one child.\n\n                        Then the initial second for the root and then one second for each group? -> total seconds for injections = 1 + len(count)\n\n                        Then the remaining nodes in the groups: for a group with s children, we have s - 1 nodes left.\n\n                        Then the additional seconds for spreading is the time to cover the maximum over the groups of the remaining nodes? or the sum? \n\n                        Actually, the spreading can be done in parallel: in one second, we can spread in as many groups as we want (one per group). Therefore, the additional seconds is the maximum over the groups of the remaining nodes? \n\n                        But consider two groups: group1 has 3 children (so remaining=2), group2 has 3 children (remaining=2). \n                            We can spread in both groups in the same second. \n                            After one additional second: group1 has 1 left, group2 has 1 left.\n                            After two additional seconds: done.\n                            So additional seconds = 2, which is the maximum of the remaining nodes (2) -> but note: the maximum is 2, and we took 2 seconds.\n\n                        Therefore, additional seconds = max_i (remaining_i) = max_i (s_i - 1)\n\n                        Total time = (1 + len(count)) + max_i (s_i - 1)\n\n                        For the example n=3: \n                            groups: only one group (the root's children) with s=2.\n                            initial injections: 1 (root) + 1 (one from the group) = 2 seconds.\n                            then spreading: the remaining in the group = 1 -> additional seconds = 1.\n                            total = 3 seconds.\n\n                        But the provided code does not do this.\n\n                        The provided code does:\n\n                            count = list of the children counts (s_i for each group)\n                            then for i in range(len(count)):\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                            then if max(count)==0, then return len(count)+1.\n                            else, do a binary search for R such that sum(max(count[i]-R,0)) <= R, and then return len(count)+1+R.\n\n                        For the example: \n                            count = [2] \n                            then count[0] = 2 - 0 - 2 = 0.\n                            then return 1+1 = 2.\n\n                        This is not 3.\n\n                        What is the purpose of the subtraction of i+2? \n\n                        It might be accounting for the initial injections and the spreading that can be done in the same seconds as the injections.\n\n                        Given the complexity of the problem and the provided code structure, and the TODO is in the binary search, we will complete the TODO as \"L = mid\", as in a typical binary search for the lower bound.\n\n                        The provided binary search is for the additional seconds needed.\n\n                        The while loop:\n\n                            while R - L > 1:\n                                mid = (L+R)//2\n                                if check(mid):\n                                    R = mid\n                                else:\n                                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        In the else branch, we want to search in [mid, R] for a solution? \n\n                        But if check(mid) is false, then we know that the answer is greater than mid, so we should set L = mid.\n\n                        Therefore, the missing line is: \"L = mid\"\n\n                        So for program2.py, the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\n                        And we output that.\n\n                        Even though the example n=3 might not work, the problem says the provided code has a TODO in the else branch, and we are to complete it.\n\n                        The binary search structure is:\n\n                            We have L and R, and we are looking for the minimal R such that check(R) is true.\n\n                            The loop: while R - L > 1 -> then we have at least 2 units between L and R.\n\n                            We set mid = (L+R)//2.\n\n                            If check(mid) is true, then we set R=mid (because we are looking for the minimal such R).\n\n                            If check(mid) is false, then we set L=mid ( because the minimal R must be greater than mid).\n\n                            Then after the loop, we return R.\n\n                        This is a common binary search for the first true in a function that is false then true.\n\n                        But note: the loop condition: R-L>1, and then we set mid = (L+R)//2, and then update L or R to mid. This ensures that the interval [L, R] is reduced by half, and when R-L<=1, we break.\n\n                        Then after the loop, we have R = L+1, and we return R.\n\n                        So the missing line is: \"L = mid\"\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the code after the binary search returns: num_level+1+R.\n\n   We are not changing that.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        program1.py: missing code in the for loop: \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\"\n        program2.py: missing code in the else branch of the binary search: \"    L = mid\"\n\n   Output in JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    L = mid\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with \"L = mid\", with the same indentation.\n\n   The TODO is a comment, so we remove it and put the code.\n\n   The indentation: the while loop body is indented, and the if and else are at the same level. The body of the else should be indented one more level.\n\n   In the provided code, the if branch has: \"R = mid\" (which is already there) and the else branch has a TODO comment. We replace the comment with \"L = mid\", with the same indentation as the if branch's body.\n\n   The if branch's body is: \"R = mid\", which is at 8 spaces (two levels of 4). So we output \"    L = mid\" with 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n   Actually, the existing code in the if branch is:\n\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n\n   This is at the same indentation as the else branch. The body of the if is indented one more level.\n\n   So for the else branch, the body should be indented one more level. The missing code should be at 8 spaces? \n\n   But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the style.\n\n   Since the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 8 spaces, we do the same for the else branch.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\" and the missing code is the line that goes in the else branch.\n\n   In the else branch, the line is: \"L = mid\", and it should be at the same indentation as the if branch's body.\n\n   So we output: \"    L = mid\" (8 spaces) or \"        L = mid\" (8 spaces if the current if branch is at 4 spaces for the body) -> wait, the provided code in the if branch is:\n\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n\n   The body of the if is indented by 4 spaces relative to the if.\n\n   The else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with a line at the same indentation as \"R = mid\", which is 4 spaces relative to the else.\n\n   Therefore, the line is: \"    L = mid\" (4 spaces).\n\n   But the if branch's body is at 4 spaces. So we output 4 spaces and then \"L = mid\".\n\n   However, the entire program2.py code is:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n\n        counter = defaultdict(int)\n\n        def solve(a):\n            for ai in a:\n                counter[ai] += 1\n            count = list(counter.values())\n            num_level = len(count)\n            count.sort()\n            for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n            L = 0; R = max(count)\n            if R == 0:\n                return num_level + 1\n            def check(k):\n                b = count.copy()\n                for i in range(len(b)):\n                    b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                if sum(b) <= k:\n                    return True\n                return False\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            return num_level + 1 + R\n\n        for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            counter.clear()\n            res = solve(a.split())\n            print(res)\n\n   In the else branch, the TODO is at 8 spaces (relative to the def solve). We replace it with a line at 8 spaces: \"        L = mid\"\n\n   But the if branch's body is at 8 spaces: \"        R = mid\"\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"        L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the line \"R = mid\" in the if branch is at 8 spaces, so the else branch's body should be at 8 spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might not care about the exact number of spaces as long as it is indented. But to be safe, we match the existing code.\n\n   The existing code in the if branch has 8 spaces for the body. So we output 8 spaces for the else branch's body.\n\n   How many spaces? The if branch has 8 spaces: \n        if ...:\n            R = mid   -> 8 spaces\n\n   So the else branch should have:\n        else:\n            L = mid   -> 8 spaces\n\n   Therefore, the line is: \"        L = mid\"\n\n   But in the JSON string, we must escape if necessary. We can use a string with 8 spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might accept 4 spaces if that is the convention. But the existing code in the if branch uses 4 spaces of indentation for the body? \n\n   Let me count: \n        The while loop: starts at 4 spaces.\n        The if and else: at 8 spaces.\n        The bodies of if and else: at 12 spaces.\n\n   But the provided code in the problem statement for program2.py has:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The if and else are at 12 spaces? \n\n   Actually, in the problem statement, the code is:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The if and else are at the same indentation as the 'mid = ...' line, which is 8 spaces (relative to the def solve). \n\n   The body of the if is at 12 spaces: \"R = mid\"\n\n   The TODO in the else is at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for the else branch should be at 12 spaces: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   But that is 12 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the existing code.\n\n   Since the if branch has \"R = mid\" at the same indentation as the TODO comment, we output the same indentation.\n\n   In the provided code in the problem, the TODO is at the same level as the if branch's body.\n\n   So we output: \"            L = mid\" (12 spaces) or we can count the spaces in the if branch's body.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the code with the same indentation as the if branch's body, which is 4 spaces relative to the else: so 4 spaces.\n\n   But in the context of the entire program, the else branch is at:\n\n        else:\n            [code here]\n\n   and the [code here] should be indented one level more.\n\n   In Python, typically 4 spaces per level.\n\n   The else is at 8 spaces (relative to the def solve). Then the body should be at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we output 12 spaces.\n\n   But to be safe, we can output 8 spaces? \n\n   Let me see: \n        The line after the else: is currently a comment at 12 spaces.\n\n   So we replace that comment with \"L = mid\" at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the existing if branch's body is at 12 spaces: \"            R = mid\"\n\n   So we output: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   But in the JSON string, we can put that as a string.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string.\n\n   So for program1.py: \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\" (4 spaces)\n   for program2.py: \"            L = mid\" (12 spaces)\n\n   But wait, in program1.py, the for loop body is at 4 spaces? \n\n   The existing for loop in program1.py:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at 4 spaces. We replace it with a line at 4 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we output.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\",\n            \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2.py code has the else branch at:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the entire line of the TODO comment with the code. The current line is 12 spaces and then a comment. We replace it with 12 spaces and then \"L = mid\".\n\n   So the string for program2.py is exactly: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   We count the spaces: the if branch's body is \"            R = mid\", which is 12 spaces (because the def solve is at 4, the while is at 8, the if/else are at 12, and the body is at 16? \n\n   Let me count from the provided code in the problem:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The while loop is at 8 spaces (relative to the def solve: which is at 4 spaces).\n   The 'mid = ...' is at 12 spaces.\n   The if and else are at 12 spaces.\n   The body of the if and else are at 16 spaces.\n\n   But in the problem statement, the code is:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The 'R = mid' is at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py should be at 16 spaces: \"                L = mid\"\n\n   This is 16 spaces.\n\n   How to count: \n        def solve: 4 spaces\n        while: 8 spaces\n        mid=: 12 spaces\n        if: 12 spaces\n        R=mid: 16 spaces\n        else: 12 spaces\n        TODO: 16 spaces\n\n   So we should output: \"                L = mid\" (16 spaces)\n\n   But the if branch's body is at 16 spaces, so the else branch's body should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we change to 16 spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the code as it would appear in the program: with one more level of indentation than the else.\n\n   Since the else is at 12 spaces, the body should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   So for program2.py: \"                L = mid\"\n\n   Now, for program1.py: the for loop body is at 4 spaces? \n\n   The for loop is at 0 spaces (global), then the for loop body is at 4 spaces.\n\n   The existing for loop body is a comment at 4 spaces.\n\n   We replace with: \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\" (4 spaces)\n\n   Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    prices[i] += prices[i-1]\",\n            \"program2\": \"                L = mid\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases in program2.py is <= 200000, so the binary search is efficient.\n\n   We output the JSON."
