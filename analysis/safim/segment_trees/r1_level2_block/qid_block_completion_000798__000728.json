Therefore, we want the largest c such that bw[c] = a? But bisect_left returns the smallest index with bw[c] >= a. Then we can use bisect_right? Actually, we can do:\n\n   c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1 But then we would take c2?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right) and they do not overlap.\n\nThe idea in the provided code is:\n- Precompute prefix sums for Alice (aw) and suffix sums for Bob (bw). Note: bw is the prefix of the reversed array, so it's the suffix of the original array in reverse order.\n- We iterate over the prefix sums (aw) for Alice. For each prefix sum `a` (which is the total weight Alice has eaten from the left up to index i), we want to see if there is a suffix sum (in bw) that equals `a` and that the suffix does not overlap with the prefix.\n\nNote: The condition for non-overlap: if Alice has eaten the first i+1 candies (0-indexed, so indices 0..i), then Bob must eat from the right starting at an index j such that j > i. Since bw is the suffix array in reverse, the j-th element in bw corresponds to the last j+1 candies (i.e., indices n-1-j to n-1).\n\nIn the loop:\n   for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\nExplanation of the hi parameter: \n   We set hi = len(bw)-i-2 to avoid overlapping. Why -2? Because we are using 0-indexed and we need at least one candy in between? Actually, note that the total number of candies Bob can eat without overlapping is at most n - (i+1) (since Alice has eaten i+1 candies). So the index in the bw array for Bob's part must be at most n-i-2 (because the bw array has indices from 0 to n-1, and we want Bob's part to start at index i+1 at the earliest). \n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement: \n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\nThis condition checks that the suffix sum at index c (which is the sum of the last c+1 candies) equals the prefix sum a, and that the starting index of Bob's segment (which is n-1-c) is greater than i (so that they don't overlap). The condition i < (len(bw)-c-1) is equivalent to i+1 <= n-1-c-1? Actually, let's break it down:\n\n   len(bw) = n, so condition: i < n - c - 1\n   => i+1 <= n - c - 1? Actually, it's strict: i must be less than n-c-1, meaning that the last candy Bob eats is at index n-1-c, and the first candy Bob eats is at index n-1-c (if he eats one candy) and then going backwards. The condition for non-overlap is that the last candy Alice eats (at index i) must be strictly less than the first candy Bob eats (at index n-1-c). So we require i < n-1-c, which is the same as i+1 <= n-1-c-1? Actually, it's i < n-1-c.\n\nBut note: the condition in the code is: i < (len(bw)-c-1) -> i < n - c - 1.\n\nThis condition ensures that the segment of Alice (ending at i) and the segment of Bob (starting at n-1-c) do not overlap. Actually, the segment of Bob is the last c+1 candies, so the first candy of Bob (the leftmost in his segment) is at index n-1-c. We require that the last candy of Alice (at index i) is strictly less than n-1-c, i.e., i < n-1-c.\n\nIf we find such a match, then the total number of candies eaten is (i+1) + (c+1). We want to maximize that.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO part is:\n   if (i+1) + (c+1) > mx:\n        mx = (i+1) + (c+1)\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total number of candies they eat in total is the sum of the number of candies each ate. Alice ate i+1 candies, Bob ate c+1 candies.\n\nHowever, note that the condition in the if-statement already checks that a==bw[c] and that the segments do not overlap (i < n-c-1). So we can update mx accordingly.\n\nBut wait: the bisect_left returns the smallest index c such that bw[c] >= a. We are only interested in the case where bw[c] == a. So we check that.\n\nHowever, note: it is possible that there are multiple indices with the same suffix sum. But since we are iterating from the left and using bisect_left, we get the smallest index c (which corresponds to the largest segment for Bob) that is at least a. But we only take when it equals.\n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement: we check a==bw[c]. So we are safe.\n\nBut also note: the hi parameter in bisect_left limits the search to indices [0, hi). We set hi = len(bw)-i-2. Why -2? Actually, we want to avoid overlapping and we want to leave at least one candy? Or maybe the condition is that Bob can have at most n-i-1 candies? But then the index in bw for Bob's part can go from 0 to n-i-2? Because the array bw has indices 0 to n-1. The maximum index we can use for Bob without overlapping is n-i-2? Because if Bob takes k candies, then k must be at most n-i-1? Actually, the number of candies Bob can take is at most n-i-1 (so that the segments don't overlap). The index in bw for k candies is k-1? Actually, bw[0] is the last candy, bw[1] is the last two, ... bw[k-1] is the last k candies. So the maximum k we can take is n-i-1, so the index in bw for k = n-i-1 is (n-i-1)-1? Actually, no: the index for k candies is k-1? But note: the array bw is the prefix of the reversed array. So the element at index j in bw is the sum of the first j+1 elements of the reversed array, which is the sum of the last j+1 candies of the original array. Therefore, the index j corresponds to j+1 candies. So the maximum j we can have is n-i-2? Because then Bob eats j+1 = n-i-1 candies? Then the condition hi = len(bw)-i-2 means we are searching in indices [0, n-i-2). So the last index we consider is n-i-3? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, we might set hi = n - i - 1? But note: the condition for non-overlap is that the total number of candies Bob eats (c+1) must be at most n - (i+1). So the maximum index c we can have is n-i-2 (because c+1 <= n-i-1 -> c <= n-i-2). Therefore, we set hi = n-i-1 (so that the search is in [0, n-i-1)) meaning we consider indices 0 to n-i-2.\n\nBut the code currently has: hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> which is n-i-2. Then the search is in [0, n-i-2). So we are excluding the index n-i-2? That would be too restrictive because we are not allowing Bob to take n-i-1 candies (which would require index c = n-i-2). \n\nActually, the bisect_left function's hi parameter is the exclusive upper bound. So if we want to include index n-i-2, we must set hi = n-i-1.\n\nTherefore, we should change the bisect_left call to:\n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-1)\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we can do this.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we are safe.\n\nBut the provided code has hi=len(bw)-i-2. That might be a mistake. However, the note in the condition: \n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1)\n\nThe condition i < n-c-1 is the same as c < n-i-1. So the index c must be at most n-i-2 (because c is integer). So we are only considering c in [0, n-i-2]. Therefore, we should set hi = n-i-1 (so that we search in [0, n-i-1) which includes indices 0 to n-i-2).\n\nBut the original code has hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> n-i-2. Then we are only searching in [0, n-i-2) -> indices 0 to n-i-3. We are missing the index n-i-2.\n\nSo we must fix that. However, the problem says we are to complete the missing code. We are only allowed to fill in the TODO part? Or can we change the bisect line? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So if we see that the bisect line is incorrect, we are allowed to change it? But note the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\". The TODO is only in the if block. However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we might have to fix more than one place? But the example output format is a JSON with two completions. We are to complete both program1 and program2.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and the format is {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}. The \"completion\" for program1 should be the entire code that is missing? But the TODO is only one part. However, we see that the bisect line might be wrong. But the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". So we are allowed to fix the entire program? But the instruction says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the example only has a TODO.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\nSo we are to fill in the missing parts. The provided code for program1 has a TODO. But the bisect line might be intended to be that way? However, the condition in the if-statement uses \"len(bw)-c-1\", which is n-c-1. And the condition i < n-c-1 is the non-overlap condition. But the hi parameter in bisect_left is set to n-i-2, which might be to avoid the last index that would cause overlap? Actually, the condition in the if-statement already checks non-overlap, so we can set hi to the entire array? But that would be inefficient. We want to restrict the search to non-overlapping segments.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the bisect line to use hi = n-i-1. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are iterating for each i (which is n) and each bisect is O(log n), so total O(n log n) per test case? But the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so worst-case one test case with n=200000, then O(n log n) is acceptable (about 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6 operations).\n\nBut the problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So we can do:\n\n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=min(len(bw), n-i-1))\n\nBut actually, we can set hi = n-i-1 because n-i-1 might be negative? But i goes from 0 to n-1, so n-i-1 is at least 0? Actually, when i>=n-1, then n-i-1<=0. But i goes from 0 to n-1. When i = n-1, then n-i-1 = 0, so hi=0 -> we search in [0,0) -> no elements. That's okay because then we skip.\n\nBut the original code had hi=len(bw)-i-2. We are going to change it to hi=len(bw)-i-1? Actually, we are allowed to change the code? The problem says we are to fill in the missing lines. The TODO is the only missing line? But the bisect line might be part of the provided code that we cannot change? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\". So the bisect line is provided? Then we must not change it? But then the code might not work.\n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement: i < (len(bw)-c-1) -> i < n-c-1. This condition ensures non-overlap. And the bisect is done with hi=len(bw)-i-2, which is n-i-2. So we are only searching in the indices [0, n-i-2). Then the condition i < n-c-1 becomes: i < n - c - 1. Since c is at most n-i-3 (because we set hi=n-i-2, exclusive), then n-c-1 >= n - (n-i-3) - 1 = i+2, which is > i. So the condition i < n-c-1 is automatically satisfied? Then we don't need to check it? But wait, what if there is a match at index c = n-i-2? Then we would miss it. And also, the condition i < n-c-1 would be: i < n - (n-i-2) - 1 = i+1, which is true. So we are missing that candidate.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we should change the bisect line to hi = n-i-1. But the problem says we are only to output the missing code. How can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, we can leave the bisect line as is and then in the if-statement we check the non-overlap condition. But then we are missing the candidate at c = n-i-2.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do without the hi parameter? But that would be inefficient. We must use the hi to avoid searching in indices that would cause overlap? Actually, we can set hi = n-i-1.\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is only the TODO part? Then we cannot change the bisect line. \n\nSo we must work with the provided bisect line. Then the condition i < n-c-1 is redundant? Because with hi=n-i-2, we have c in [0, n-i-2), so n-c-1 > n - (n-i-2) + 1? Actually, n-c-1 >= n - (n-i-3) - 1 = i+2, which is always > i. So the condition i < n-c-1 is always true for any c found by bisect_left in the range [0, n-i-2). Therefore, we can omit that condition? But the code has it. \n\nBut wait: what if the entire array is allowed? Then we set hi to the entire array? But we set hi=n-i-2, which is less than the entire array. So we are restricting the search to avoid overlap? Then the condition i < n-c-1 is automatically satisfied? Then we can remove it? But the code has it. \n\nAlternatively, we can leave the condition and then update mx. \n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are iterating for each i (which is n) and each bisect is O(log n). So worst-case total operations is 200000 * log2(200000) which is about 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut if we set hi = n-i-1, then the same holds. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says we are to complete the code so that the pipe runs correctly, we must fix the bisect line. But we are only allowed to output the missing code? \n\nAlternatively, we can do the following: in the TODO part, we can also check for the candidate at index c = n-i-2? But that would be messy.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the TODO block. So we cannot change the bisect line. Therefore, we must rely on the provided bisect line. Then the condition i < n-c-1 is always true? So we can ignore it? Then the only condition we need is a==bw[c]. Then we update mx.\n\nBut wait: what if the bisect_left returns an index c that is beyond the hi? Actually, the hi parameter restricts the search, so the returned c is in [0, n-i-2). Then the condition i < n-c-1 is automatically satisfied. So we can remove the condition? But the code has it. \n\nBut the problem says: we are to complete the code. We are only to write the TODO part. So we write:\n\n   if (i+1) + (c+1) > mx:\n        mx = (i+1) + (c+1)\n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement already checks a==bw[c] and the non-overlap (which is redundant in this setting). So we can update.\n\nHowever, what if there are multiple matches? The bisect_left returns the first index where bw[c] >= a. But we are checking for equality. It is possible that bw[c] > a? Then we skip. So we are safe.\n\nBut also note: the suffix array bw is non-decreasing? Yes, because it's the prefix sums of the reversed array (which is non-decreasing since weights are positive). So bw is non-decreasing. Therefore, if we find an index c such that bw[c] == a, then we have a candidate.\n\nBut what if there are multiple indices with the same value? We want the largest number of candies? Actually, no: we want the largest total candies (Alice's count + Bob's count). But note: if we have the same a, then we want the smallest c? Because the smallest c (meaning the fewest candies for Bob) would leave room for more candies for Alice? Actually, no: we are iterating Alice's part. We are trying to maximize the total. But if we have the same a, then we want the largest Bob's segment? Actually, no: we are matching the weight a. The number of candies Bob eats is c+1. We want to maximize (i+1)+(c+1). But if we have two indices c1 and c2 such that bw[c1] = bw[c2] = a, and c1 < c2, then Bob's segment for c2 is larger (c2+1 > c1+1) so the total candies is larger. Therefore, we want the largest c such that bw[c] = a? But bisect_left returns the smallest index with bw[c] >= a. Then we can use bisect_right? Actually, we can do:\n\n   c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n\nBut then we would take c2? But note: we are iterating and we want to update for every valid candidate? Actually, we are in a loop for i. We want the maximum total. So we can do:\n\n   if a == bw[c1]:\n        # then we have at least one candidate at c1\n        total = (i+1) + (c1+1)\n        if total > mx: mx = total\n\n   # But what if there is a larger c? Actually, we can check the next indices? But that would be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the suffix array is non-decreasing. So if we find one candidate, we can try to see if there is a candidate with a larger c? But that would be O(n) per i.\n\nBut note: the total n over test cases is 200000, but if we do a linear scan for each i, worst-case O(n^2) which is 200000^2 = 40e9, too slow.\n\nTherefore, we stick to the candidate found by bisect_left. But that candidate has the smallest c (so the smallest Bob segment) for the given a. That minimizes the total candies. We want the maximum total candies. So we want the largest c such that bw[c] = a? \n\nWe can do: \n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n   if a != bw[c]:\n        # then no candidate at this i\n        continue\n   # Now, we want the largest c' in the range [c, n-i-2) such that bw[c'] == a?\n   # But note: the array is non-decreasing, so we can do:\n   #   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   # Then use c2.\n\nBut then we update with c2.\n\nSo the TODO block could be:\n\n   # First, find the rightmost occurrence of a in the allowed range?\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   if c2 < c: \n        # This should not happen because we found at least one at c\n        c2 = c\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\n   if total > mx:\n        mx = total\n\nBut note: we already have c from bisect_left. We can do:\n\n   # We know a==bw[c], so we can find the last occurrence of a in the range [c, n-i-2] by:\n   #   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   # But note: bisect_right returns the first index > a, so the last index with value a is c2 = bisect_right(...)-1.\n\nBut the hi parameter is the same as in bisect_left: [0, hi) -> [0, n-i-2). So we do:\n\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   # But if there is no element at c2? Actually, we know there is at least one at c, so c2>=c.\n\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\n   if total > mx:\n        mx = total\n\nBut this doubles the binary search per i. And the total complexity is still O(n log n) per test case? But the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so worst-case one test case with n=200000, then 200000 * 2 * log2(200000) ~ 7.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement also has the non-overlap condition: i < n - c2 - 1? But we are using the same hi parameter, so c2 is in [0, n-i-2), so n-c2-1 > i, so it's satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the second binary search by noting that we are iterating i from 0 to n-1, and we are only interested in the maximum total. We could store the maximum c for each weight? But then we have multiple weights and the same weight might appear many times.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, we can do two binary searches per i.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but note that the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200000. Then we do 200000 * 2 * log2(200000) ~ 7.2e6, which is acceptable in Python? It might be borderline in Pyton but 7.2e6 operations is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code (the TODO block) is:\n\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\n   if total > mx:\n        mx = total\n\nBut note: we must import bisect_right? But the program already has \"from bisect import *\", so we have bisect_right.\n\nHowever, we are not allowed to change anything outside the TODO block? But the TODO block is only the block inside the if. We can add multiple lines.\n\nBut what if the candidate c2 is not valid? We know that the entire range [c, c2] has value a, and the hi parameter ensures that c2 is at most n-i-3? Actually, the hi is the same as in the bisect_left, so c2 is in [0, n-i-2). And we already know that the non-overlap condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nBut note: what if there is no candidate? But we have a==bw[c], so there is at least one candidate. And c2 is the last occurrence of a in the allowed range, so it's valid.\n\nBut what if the bisect_right returns 0? Then c2 = -1? Then we skip. But we know a==bw[c] and c is at least the index we found, so c2>=c>=0.\n\nTherefore, we can do that.\n\nBut wait: the original code had a condition on non-overlap: i < n-c-1. But we are not checking that for c2? But as argued, because c2 is in [0, n-i-2), then n-c2-1 >= n - (n-i-3) - 1 = i+2 > i, so it's satisfied.\n\nSo we can remove the non-overlap condition? But the code has it. We are inside the if that checks a==bw[c] and i < n-c-1. But we are about to use c2 which might be larger than c. The condition i < n-c-1 is for the original c, not for c2. But for c2, we have c2>=c, so n-c2-1 <= n-c-1, so i < n-c-1 does not imply i < n-c2-1. \n\nExample: n=10, i=5, c=2 -> then n-c-1=10-2-1=7, and 5<7 -> valid. But if c2=3, then n-c2-1=10-3-1=6, and 5<6 -> valid. If c2=4, then 10-4-1=5, and 5<5 is false. So we must check for c2: i < n-c2-1.\n\nBut wait, our hi parameter in the bisect functions is n-i-2, so c2 is at most n-i-3. Then n-c2-1 >= n - (n-i-3) - 1 = i+2, which is > i. So it's always valid. \n\nTherefore, we can remove the non-overlap condition? But the code has it. And we are inside that if. But that if used the original c, not c2. So we are not checking for c2.\n\nBut because c2 is at most n-i-3, then n-c2-1 >= i+2 > i, so it's valid. So we don't need to check again.\n\nTherefore, the TODO block is:\n\n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\n   if total > mx:\n        mx = total\n\nBut note: what if the entire block of Bob's part for weight a is beyond the hi? Then bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) will return the first index beyond the hi that is > a, so the last index within hi is hi-1? But we set hi = n-i-2, so the last index is n-i-3. Then c2 = n-i-3. Then total = (i+1) + (n-i-2) = n-1. But that might be valid? \n\nBut note: the condition for non-overlap: we require that the segments do not overlap. The number of candies Alice ate: i+1. The number of candies Bob ate: c2+1 = n-i-2. The total candies eaten: i+1 + n-i-2 = n-1. The candies left are one in the middle. So it's valid.\n\nBut what if the total candies eaten is n? Then we would have no candy left, which is also valid. But our hi parameter does not allow c2 = n-i-1? Because hi = n-i-2, so we don't consider c2 = n-i-1. But that would be the entire suffix. And then the condition i < n - (n-i-1) - 1 = i, which is false. So we don't want that.\n\nTherefore, we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the bisect line to use hi = n-i-1 and then use the non-overlap condition to filter. But we are not allowed to change that line.\n\nSo we go with the above.\n\nBut note: the problem also has the possibility that they eat zero candies. The variable mx is initialized to 0, which is the answer for the third test case.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\n   n=int(input())\n   while n:\n        num=int(input())\n        if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n        else:print(\"Division 4\")\n        n-=1\n\nThe TODO is in the elif num>=1400. According to the problem, Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599. So we should print \"Division 3\" for this branch. But note: the condition num>=1400 includes ratings that are 1400 and above, but we have already handled ratings>=1900 and ratings>=1600 in the previous conditions. So by the time we get to this branch, we have 1400<=num<=1599. So we can simply print \"Division 3\".\n\nBut what about ratings that are 1400? They are caught by the first condition? No, because 1400<1900 and 1400<1600, so they fall into this branch.\n\nSimilarly, 1599 falls here.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is: print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the next condition is else: Division 4. So we don't need to worry about ratings below 1400.\n\nSo the TODO block for program2.py is:\n\n   print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut we must be careful: the code has the colon and the comment, so we only need to replace the comment with the print statement.\n\nTherefore, the completions are:\n\nprogram1: \n   c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\n   if total > mx:\n        mx = total\n\nprogram2:\n   print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut note: in program1, we are using bisect_right, which is available because of \"from bisect import *\". \n\nNow, we output in JSON format:\n\n{\n   \"program1\": \"c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n   total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n   if total > mx:\\n        mx = total\",\n   \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has multiple lines. We must represent it as a string with newlines and proper indentation. The original indentation in the TODO part is one level (so 3 or 4 spaces). We'll use the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in one line? But that would be less readable. But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output a JSON string.\n\nWe must escape the quotes and newlines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code for program1 is a block of 3 lines? But the TODO is one line. We are replacing the entire TODO comment with 3 lines.\n\nSo the JSON string for program1 will have newlines. We can use \\n.\n\nBut note: the original code has the line after the TODO comment. We are replacing the TODO comment with three lines. The next line (print(mx)) is not part of the block.\n\nSo we output:\n\n   \"program1\": \"    c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n    total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n    if total > mx:\\n        mx = total\"\n\nBut the indentation: in the original, the block inside the for loop is indented by 4 spaces. The TODO line is indented by 4 spaces and then 4 more? Actually, the code:\n\n\tfor _ in range(t):\n\t\tn = int(input())\n\t\tw = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\t\taw = list(accumulate(w))\n\t\tbw = list(accumulate(w[::-1]))\n\t\tmx = 0\n\t\tfor i, a in enumerate(aw):\n\t\t\tc = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\t\t\tif a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\t\t\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with three lines. We should use the same indentation level as the surrounding code. The surrounding code uses one tab or 4 spaces? The if block is indented by 4 more spaces? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the TODO block should be indented by 8 spaces (two levels). But the code we write in the string should have the same.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. We can use:\n\n   Line1: 8 spaces\n   Line2: 8 spaces\n   Line3: 8 spaces\n   Line4: 12 spaces\n\nBut in the provided code, the if condition is followed by a block that is indented one more level. So we'll do:\n\n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n        [8 spaces] c2 = ...\n        [8 spaces] total = ...\n        [8 spaces] if ...:\n        [12 spaces] mx = ...\n\nSo we write:\n\n   \"program1\": \"    c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n    total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n    if total > mx:\\n        mx = total\"\n\nBut note: the original line after the TODO is the print(mx) which is outside the for loop. We are not changing that.\n\nFor program2, the missing code is one line. The current line is:\n\n   elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the comment with: print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the next line is \"else: ...\", so we must not break the structure.\n\nSo we write:\n\n   \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\nBut we must escape the quotes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes: print('Division 3') to avoid escaping. But the problem uses double quotes in the example output. But in Python, both are fine.\n\nBut the problem's example output for program2 uses double quotes: \"Division 1\", etc. So we use double quotes.\n\nTherefore, we escape the double quotes.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n   \"program1\": \"    c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n    total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n    if total > mx:\\n        mx = total\",\n   \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1, the line \"if total > mx: ...\" is at the same indentation as the previous lines? And then the assignment to mx is indented one more level? So we have:\n\n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n        c2 = ... \n        total = ...\n        if total > mx:\n            mx = total\n\nSo the last line has 12 spaces? But in the string we have written: \"    ...\\n        mx = total\". The last part has 8 spaces? Actually, we wrote:\n\n   \"    c2 = ...\\n    total = ...\\n    if ...:\\n        mx = total\"\n\nThis means:\n   Line1: 4 spaces (but we need 8? because the block is at 8 spaces)\n\nActually, the entire block inside the if is at 8 spaces. The original TODO line was at 8 spaces. So we should write:\n\n   \"        c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n        total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n        if total > mx:\\n            mx = total\"\n\nBut wait, the original code:\n\n\t\t\tif a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\t\t\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe next line after the if is indented by 8 spaces (two tabs? or 8 spaces). So we replace the TODO comment with:\n\n        c2 = ... (at 8 spaces)\n        total = ... (at 8 spaces)\n        if ...: (at 8 spaces)\n            mx = ... (at 12 spaces)\n\nSo the string should be:\n\n   \"        c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n        total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n        if total > mx:\\n            mx = total\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the code is:\n\n    while n:\n        num=int(input())\n        if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n        else:print(\"Division 4\")\n        n-=1\n\nThe TODO is at the same level as the print statements. So we replace the comment with:\n\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the line is an elif, so we can write:\n\n        elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut the code has the colon and then the comment. We are replacing the comment with the print statement. But we must not break the colon. The current line is:\n\n        elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe want to replace the comment with the print, so the entire line becomes:\n\n        elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut the problem says: missing lines or blocks. We are replacing one line with one line.\n\nSo for program2, the missing code is: print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut we output the string: \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the existing colon is already there. We are only replacing the comment. So we must not include the colon. The line is:\n\n        elif num>=1400: [we replace the comment with] print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut the colon is already present. So we only need to output the code that goes after the colon? \n\nActually, the TODO is in the line: \"elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\"\n\nWe are to replace the entire line? Or just the comment? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to complete the line. But the condition and colon are already there. So we only need to put the print statement.\n\nBut in Python, we can have:\n\n   elif condition: statement\n\nor\n\n   elif condition:\n        statement\n\nBut the code for the other branches are one-liners. So we do:\n\n   elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut the existing code has the colon and then the comment. We replace the comment with the print statement. So the entire line becomes:\n\n   elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut we must be cautious: the next line is \"else: ...\", so we must not break the structure.\n\nTherefore, the completion for program2 is: \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the existing colon is there, so we are not repeating the colon.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to output the entire line, then we would output: \"elif num>=1400:print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\", but that would duplicate the condition. The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is only the part after the colon.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"complete the code\", and the TODO is in the line after the colon, we output only the code that replaces the TODO comment.\n\nBut the example output for program2 in the problem's note is: \"Division 3\", so we are only to output the division.\n\nBut the code structure is: we are to output a line of code that goes in place of the TODO.\n\nSo we output: \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\nBut then the line becomes:\n\n   elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n\nWhich is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n   \"program1\": \"        c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n        total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n        if total > mx:\\n            mx = total\",\n   \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1, the first line of the block has 8 spaces, then the next lines also 8, and the last line 12. But in the string, we represent the 8 spaces as 8 spaces? But the original code might use tabs. We use spaces.\n\nWe'll use 8 spaces for the first three lines and 12 for the last? But the problem does not specify. We'll assume 4 spaces per indent, and the block is two indents (8 spaces) and the inner block is three indents (12 spaces).\n\nSo the string for program1 has:\n\n   Line1: 8 spaces + code\n   Line2: 8 spaces + code\n   Line3: 8 spaces + code\n   Line4: 12 spaces + code\n\nBut we write it as:\n\n   \"        c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2) - 1\\n        total = (i+1) + (c2+1)\\n        if total > mx:\\n            mx = total\"\n\nThis has 8 spaces at the beginning of each of the first three lines and 12 for the last? Actually, no: the last line is \"            mx = total\", which is 12 spaces? But we wrote \"\\n            mx = total\", which is 12 spaces? How many spaces are in the string?\n\n   \"        ...\\n        ...\\n        ...\\n            ...\"\n\nThe first three lines have 8 spaces, the last line has 12 spaces? But 8+4=12? Actually, we are adding 4 more spaces for the inner block.\n\nBut in the string, we have:\n\n   Line1: 8 spaces\n   Line2: 8 spaces\n   Line3: 8 spaces\n   Line4: 12 spaces\n\nBut the code we are replacing is at the same level as the outer block. So it's 8 spaces. And the inner if block is 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut note: the line \"if total > mx:\" is at 8 spaces, and the next line \"mx = total\" is at 12 spaces.\n\nThis matches.\n\nSo we are done."
