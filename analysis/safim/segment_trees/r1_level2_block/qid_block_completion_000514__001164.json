Then they iterate over divisors of half_perimeter? Then they check: w % a <= 2. What does that mean?\n\n                  Let me try with the example: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6.\n\n                  Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6 -> and they also consider 2?

But the example says a=1,2,3 are valid. Why 6? The total boundary T=2*6=12. 6 divides 12. Check for a=6: Condition: \n                         w=3: 3 mod 6 = 3 -> which is not <=2 -> so they wouldn't add 6? So how do they add 1? They started with {1,2}. Then they added 2 and 3? But they did not add 1? Actually, they start with {1,2}. Then they iterate and add 2 and 3. Then the set becomes {1,2,3}. Then they output: 3 and the sorted set: 1,2,3. How do they avoid duplicates?

So a must be a divisor of T. \n\n          Therefore, we can iterate over the divisors of T. However, T can be up to 4e9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(T)) which is about 10^5, and we have t up to 100 -> total divisors over all test cases might be 100 * 10^5 = 10^7, which is acceptable? But the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers. So we must not output too many divisors per test case? How to do:\n\n            For each test case:\n                T = 2*(w+l-2)\n                Find all divisors d of T such that d>=1 and d<=T?

But the code only checks w%a<=2. Why is that sufficient? Actually, it is not. We also need l%a<=2 and then 2*(w%a + l%a)=4 -> so w%a + l%a = 2. But the code does not check l%a. However, note: the total boundary T is divisible by a. \n\n                    The total boundary: \n                         T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2w+2l-4. And T mod a = 0.\n\n                    Then: 2w+2l-4 mod a = 0.\n\n                    => 2*(w+l) mod a = 4 mod a.\n\n                    But also: \n                         w mod a = r1, l mod a = r2. Then: 2*(w+l) mod a = 2*(r1+r2) mod a = 4 mod a. So: 2*(r1+r2) \u2261 4 (mod a). And we know 0<=r1<=2, 0<=r2<=2. Then 0<=r1+r2<=4. Then 2*(r1+r2) is in {0,2,4,6,8}. But we require 2*(r1+r2) mod a = 4 mod a.\n\n                    Since a divides T, and T=2*(w+l-2), and a divides half_perimeter? Actually, we are iterating a divisor of half_perimeter = w+l-2. Then: w+l-2 is divisible by a -> w+l \u2261 2 (mod a). Then: 2*(w+l) \u2261 4 (mod a) -> which is consistent with the condition. Therefore, the condition w%a<=2 and the fact that a divides half_perimeter (so w+l-2 \u22610 mod a) implies that l%a = (2 - w%a) mod a? \n\n                    But note: w+l-2 \u22610 mod a -> (w mod a + l mod a) mod a = 2 mod a.\n\n                    And since w mod a = r1 (in [0,2]) and l mod a = r2 (in [0,2]), then r1+r2 must be 2 or 2+a? But since r1+r2<=4 and a>=r1, a>=r2, and a>=3 (because if a<=2 we already have it in the set) then 2+a>=5, but r1+r2<=4 -> so r1+r2=2. Therefore, if w%a<=2 and a divides half_perimeter, then automatically l%a = 2 - w%a, which is in [0,2]. So the condition w%a<=2 is sufficient. Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Let half_perimeter = w+l-2. Start with solutions = {1, 2} [because a=1 and a=2 are always valid? We must check: for a=1: \n                    w%1=0<=2 -> valid. for a=2: \n                    w%2 is either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid. Then iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)): if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                    for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                        if w % a <= 2: \n                            then add a to solutions?

Then: 8 - 2*(x1+x2+x3+x4) = 4 -> 2*(x1+x2+x3+x4)=4 -> x1+x2+x3+x4=2. And the leaves per side:\n\n                  top: 2 - x1 - x2 = r1\n                  bottom: 2 - x3 - x4 = r2\n                  left: 2 - x1 - x3 = r3\n                  right: 2 - x2 - x4 = r4 And we have: r1 = w % a, r2 = w % a, r3 = l % a, r4 = l % a?

Therefore, it is possible. How to cover? Top side: covers the top-left corner (x1=1), does not cover the top-right corner (x2=0). Bottom side: covers the bottom-right corner (x4=1), does not cover the bottom-left corner (x3=0). Left side: covers the bottom-left corner (x3=0 means covered by left side) and does not cover the top-left corner (x1=1 means covered by top side) -> so the left side covers only the bottom-left corner? But wait: the left side has two corners: top-left and bottom-left.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: We have n items and q queries. We are given the prices of the items. For each query (x, y): \n   The promotion: if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest ones among the purchased items are free.\n   We need the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\n How to think:\n   The customer can choose any set of items as long as the set has at least x items. But note: to maximize the free value, \n   we want to maximize the sum of the y cheapest items in the chosen set. However, the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase.\n\n   Important: The customer is free to choose which items to buy (any set of at least x items). So the strategy is to choose a set \n   that has as large as possible y cheap items? Actually, note: we want the sum of the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible? \n   But wait: the free items are the cheapest ones. So we want the y cheapest in the set to be as expensive as possible? \n\n   However, observe: if we choose a set S, then the free items are the y smallest numbers in S. To maximize the free value, we want \n   the y smallest numbers in S to be as large as possible. How can we do that? \n\n   We can note that the entire set of items is fixed. We can sort the items. Let's sort the prices in increasing order: \n        p1 <= p2 <= ... <= pn.\n\n   But note: if we choose a set S, then the y smallest in S are at most the y-th smallest in the entire store? Actually, we can choose \n   the set S to be the most expensive x items? Why? Because then the y cheapest in S would be the (x - y + 1)-th to the x-th most expensive? \n   But wait: if we take the most expensive x items, then the cheapest in that set are the smallest ones in that set. \n\n   Actually, let the sorted array be in increasing order. Then the most expensive items are the last x items: \n        [p_{n-x}, p_{n-x+1}, ..., p_{n-1}]\n\n   The y cheapest in this set are the first y of these: p_{n-x}, p_{n-x+1}, ..., p_{n-x+y-1}. \n   The sum of these is: p_{n-x} + p_{n-x+1} + ... + p_{n-x+y-1}.\n\n   Why is this the maximum? \n   Consider: we want the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible. If we include any item cheaper than p_{n-x}, then that item \n   would be one of the free ones and would be at most p_{n-x} (and we could replace it with p_{n-x} and not harm the rest). \n\n   Therefore, the optimal set is the x most expensive items. Then the free items are the y cheapest in that set, which are the first y \n   of the x most expensive (which are the smallest in that set). \n\n   So we need to compute: \n        S = prefix sum array of the sorted price array.\n\n   Then for a query (x, y):\n        free_sum = (prefix[n-x+y] - prefix[n-x])\n\n   However, note the code provided:\n\n        n,q=R();p=[0]\n        for w in sorted(R()): \n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        for _ in \" \"*q: \n            x, y=R();\n            print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\n   The array p is built as a prefix sum array. But note: the prices are read and sorted. Then we are building a prefix sum array that starts with 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> sorted is [1,2,3,4,5]\n        We want p[0]=0, p[1]=1, p[2]=1+2=3, p[3]=6, p[4]=10, p[5]=15.\n\n   The code currently has:\n        p = [0]\n        for w in sorted(R()): \n            ... we are going to append to p?\n\n   But the current loop does nothing. We need to build the prefix sums.\n\n   So we should do:\n        p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n   Then the array p has length n+1: indices 0..n.\n\n   Then for a query: \n        We want the sum from index (n-x) to (n-x+y-1) in the sorted array? \n\n   But note: the sorted array is increasing. The x most expensive items are the last x: \n        indices: n-x to n-1 (0-indexed).\n\n   The y cheapest in that set: the first y of these: indices n-x, n-x+1, ..., n-x+y-1.\n\n   The prefix sum array p: \n        p[i] = p0 + p1 + ... + p_{i-1}   (if we consider the sorted array as arr[0..n-1])\n\n   Actually, our sorted array is stored in increasing order. We are building the prefix array for the entire sorted array.\n\n   Then the sum of the segment from index (n-x) to (n-x+y-1) is:\n        p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]\n\n   Why?\n        p[n-x] = sum of arr[0] to arr[n-x-1]\n        p[n-x+y] = sum of arr[0] to arr[n-x+y-1]\n\n        So the difference is the sum from arr[n-x] to arr[n-x+y-1] (which is exactly y elements).\n\n   Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is to build the prefix sum array.\n\n   We change the loop to:\n\n        for w in sorted(R()):\n            p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n   But note: the input says the second line contains n integers. We are reading with R() and then sorting.\n\n   However, the problem says: the store has n items. The example: \n        \"5 3\" -> [5,3,5] -> sorted: [3,5,5] -> then for x=3,y=2: \n            n=3, so we take the last 3: [3,5,5] -> the two cheapest: 3 and 5 -> sum=8.\n\n        How does our formula work?\n            p = [0, 3, 8, 13]   (if we do: 0, then 0+3=3, 3+5=8, 8+5=13)\n            n=3, x=3, y=2: \n                p[n-x+y] = p[3-3+2] = p[2] = 8\n                p[n-x] = p[0] = 0\n                then 8-0 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the indices? \n            Our sorted array: index0:3, index1:5, index2:5.\n            We want the segment from index (3-3)=0 to index (0+2-1)=1 -> that is [3,5] -> sum=8.\n\n        However, note: \n            p[0] = 0 -> covers the prefix before index0.\n            p[1] = 3 -> prefix for index0\n            p[2] = 8 -> prefix for index0 and index1\n            p[3] = 13 -> prefix for index0,1,2.\n\n        The segment from index0 to index1: p[2] - p[0] = 8.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, we complete the loop to build the prefix array.\n\nFor program2.py:\n   The problem: Bathroom of width w and length l. \n        Interior: (w-2)*(l-2) of 1x1 tiles.\n        Boundary: uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated, so they can be placed as ax1 or 1xa). \n\n   The boundary consists of the outer ring. The total number of 1x1 tiles used is (w-2)*(l-2). The rest of the tiles (the boundary) must be covered by the 1xa tiles.\n\n   The boundary has total area: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\n   We need to cover the boundary with tiles of size 1xa (which can be placed as 1xa or a x 1). Therefore, the area of the boundary must be divisible by a? \n        But note: the tiles can be rotated, so we are using 1xa tiles (which cover a squares each). Therefore, a must divide the total boundary area? \n        However, that is necessary but not sufficient.\n\n   Also note: the boundary has a specific shape. There are four corners? Actually, the problem does not require the corners to be covered by the same tile? \n        But note: the boundary is a ring. The problem does not specify that the entire boundary must be covered without breaking tiles? However, we can break tiles? \n        Actually, the problem does not say we can break tiles. So we must cover the entire boundary without breaking tiles? \n\n   However, the note says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\", meaning we can use them as 1xa or ax1. But we cannot break them.\n\n   Therefore, the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of length a (in one dimension) without gaps. \n\n   How to model the boundary? \n        The boundary has four sides: \n            top: from (0,0) to (w,0) -> length w\n            right: from (w,0) to (w,l) -> length l\n            bottom: from (0,l) to (w,l) -> length w\n            left: from (0,0) to (0,l) -> length l\n\n        But note: the corners are shared. Actually, the boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2) (because we subtract the four corners that are counted twice?).\n\n        Actually, the total length of the boundary (in terms of 1x1 squares) is: \n            top: w, right: l-2 (because the corners are already counted in top and bottom), bottom: w, left: l-2 -> total = w + (l-2) + w + (l-2) = 2*(w+l-2).\n\n        And the area is 2*(w+l-2) (since each square is 1x1).\n\n        Therefore, the total area is 2*(w+l-2). So we require that a divides 2*(w+l-2). \n\n        But is that sufficient? Not exactly: we must also be able to cover the four sides without gaps. \n\n        The problem: the corners? Actually, the corners are part of two sides. We can cover each side independently? \n\n        However, the sides have lengths: \n            top: w, bottom: w, left: l, right: l? \n        But wait: the top side has two corners, so the top side without corners is w-2? Actually, no: the entire top side is w units long. Similarly, the left side is l units long. \n\n        But when we break the ring, we have four segments: \n            top: from (1,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w-2? \n            Actually, no: the entire top row is from (0,0) to (w,0) -> that's w+1 points? But the problem is in centimeters and we are tiling 1x1 squares. \n\n        How many squares? \n            The top row: w squares (from (0,0) to (w-1,0))? Actually, the width w means the bathroom spans from 0 to w in the x-axis? Then the top row has w squares? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the bathroom has width w and length l. The total number of 1x1 tiles in the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). \n        So the entire grid is w by l? Then the boundary has:\n            top: w squares (from (0,0) to (w-1,0))\n            bottom: w squares (from (0,l-1) to (w-1,l-1))\n            left: l-2 squares (from (0,1) to (0,l-2)) \n            right: l-2 squares (from (w-1,1) to (w-1,l-2))\n\n        Total: w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*(w+l-2). \n\n        So we have four segments: two of length w and two of length l-2? \n\n        But note: the corners are not covered by the sides? Actually, the corners are covered by the top and bottom? \n\n        Now, we must cover each segment with tiles of length a (if placed horizontally) or a (if placed vertically). However, the tiles can be rotated. \n\n        The problem: we can cover a segment of length L if and only if L is divisible by a? Not exactly: because we can use multiple tiles. \n\n        Actually, we can cover a segment of length L if L mod a == 0? \n\n        But note: we can use the same tile to cover parts of two adjacent sides? No, because the tile is either horizontal or vertical. \n\n        Therefore, we must cover each side independently. \n\n        The four sides: \n            top: w -> must be divisible by a? \n            bottom: w -> divisible by a?\n            left: l-2 -> divisible by a?\n            right: l-2 -> divisible by a?\n\n        However, we can use both orientations. But note: the top and bottom are horizontal, so we must use horizontal tiles (1xa) for the top and bottom? \n        Actually, we can rotate the tile: so for the top we can use either horizontal (1xa) or vertical (ax1) tiles? \n\n        But if we use a vertical tile on the top row? Then it would stick out? The top row is only 1 unit high. So we must use horizontal tiles for the top and bottom? \n        Similarly, for the left and right sides, we must use vertical tiles? \n\n        Therefore, the top and bottom must be covered by horizontal tiles (1xa) and the left and right by vertical tiles (ax1). \n\n        Then the condition becomes:\n            a must divide w (for the top and bottom) and a must divide (l-2) (for the left and right)? \n\n        But wait: what if a=1? Then it divides everything. \n\n        Alternatively, we might cover the entire boundary without separating the sides? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require that the tiles are entirely on one side. However, the boundary is connected. \n\n        There is a known approach for this problem: \n\n        We note that the entire boundary must be covered by tiles of size a. The boundary is a cycle of length T = 2*(w+l-2). \n        Therefore, a must divide T. \n\n        But that is not sufficient: we must also be able to cover the corners. Specifically, at each corner, the tile must cover two adjacent sides? \n\n        Actually, the problem has been solved in known contests (e.g., Codeforces). The known solution is:\n\n          Let T = 2*(w+l-2). \n          We consider the divisors of T, but also we must consider the divisors of some other numbers? \n\n        Actually, the known solution factors:\n\n          The conditions are:\n\n          Condition 1: The entire boundary T must be divisible by a.\n\n          Condition 2: Additionally, we must be able to cover the corners. There are four corners. The issue is that at each corner, the tile that covers the corner must be placed such that it covers two adjacent sides? \n\n          However, note that the tile is 1xa (or ax1). A tile cannot cover two sides unless a>=2? \n\n          Actually, the corner is a single square. So one tile can cover the corner? But wait: the tile is 1xa, so if we place it horizontally, it covers the corner and then extends to the right. But then the left side of the corner must be covered by a vertical tile? \n\n          How to cover the corner? \n\n          There are two typical ways:\n\n          Option 1: Cover the corner by a horizontal tile that starts at the corner and goes to the right. Then the vertical side at the corner must be covered by a vertical tile that starts at the corner and goes downward? But wait, the corner is already covered. \n\n          Actually, the corner is the meeting point of two sides. We can cover the corner by a tile that is placed horizontally or vertically? \n\n          The problem: the tile that covers the corner must cover the corner and then extend along one of the sides. The remaining part of the two sides must then be covered. \n\n          Therefore, we have two possibilities for each corner? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n\n          Possibility 1: The entire boundary is covered without any tile covering two corners? Then we require that:\n                a divides w, and a divides l.   -> but then a must divide gcd(w,l)? \n\n          Possibility 2: Or we can have a tile that covers two corners? Actually, the boundary is a cycle. \n\n          Known solution (from Codeforces problems such as \"Bath Tile\"): \n\n          We consider the divisors of the following numbers:\n\n            g1 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n            g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n            g3 = gcd(w, l-2)\n            g4 = gcd(w-1, l-1)   # same as g1? \n\n          Actually, we can have:\n\n          The valid a must be divisors of 2*(w+l-2) and also satisfy one of the following:\n\n            (a) The top side (w) can be covered by horizontal tiles and the bottom side (w) by horizontal tiles, and the two vertical sides (l-2) by vertical tiles. \n                Then we require: a divides w and a divides (l-2). \n\n            (b) Or we cover the top and bottom by horizontal tiles, but note that the left and right sides are l, but we have already used the corners? \n\n          Actually, the known solution in the provided code snippet:\n\n            half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # note: T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * (w+l-2) -> but here they use w+l-2? \n\n            Then they iterate over factors of half_perimeter? \n\n            They start with solutions = {1,2}. Then they iterate i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter) and for each divisor i of half_perimeter, they consider a = i and a = half_perimeter // i.\n\n            Then they check:\n\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    ... \n\n          What is the idea?\n\n          Note: the total boundary length T = 2 * (w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n          The condition they are checking: w mod a <= 2. Why?\n\n          Consider: the top side has length w. We are going to cover it with horizontal tiles. But we can also use a tile that covers the corner and then extends along the top? \n\n          Actually, the tile that covers the corner might be shared with the left side. So the top side might be covered by:\n\n            - A tile that covers the top-left corner: this tile is placed vertically on the left side and covers the corner? Then the top side starts at the next square? \n\n          Therefore, the top side might be covered as:\n\n            [corner covered by vertical tile] then the remaining top side: w - 1, which must be divisible by a? \n\n          Or:\n\n            [corner covered by horizontal tile] then the top side: w, which must be divisible by a? \n\n          Similarly, the bottom side: same.\n\n          For the left side: \n\n            - If the top-left corner is covered by a horizontal tile, then the left side starts at the next square: so length l-1? \n            - If the top-left corner is covered by a vertical tile, then the left side has length l? \n\n          But wait, we have two corners on the left: top-left and bottom-left. \n\n          Therefore, the left side might be:\n\n            Option 1: both corners covered by vertical tiles -> then the entire left side is covered by vertical tiles: length l -> must be divisible by a? \n            Option 2: top corner covered by horizontal and bottom corner covered by horizontal -> then the left side is l-2 -> must be divisible by a?\n            Option 3: top corner covered by horizontal and bottom corner covered by vertical? -> then the left side is l-1? \n\n          Similarly for the right.\n\n          The problem: we have four corners and we must assign each corner to either the horizontal or the vertical tile? \n\n          However, the assignment must be consistent? \n\n          Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle. The known solution is to consider that the boundary can be covered if and only if at least one of the following holds:\n\n            (1) a divides w and a divides l\n            (2) a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n            (3) a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n            (4) a divides (w-2) and a divides (l-2)\n            (5) a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)   [this one is for when we use a tile that covers two corners?]\n\n          But note: the total boundary length T = 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of T. \n\n          Therefore, we can iterate over the divisors of T. However, T can be up to 4e9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(T)) which is about 10^5, and we have t up to 100 -> total divisors over all test cases might be 100 * 10^5 = 10^7, which is acceptable? \n\n          But the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers. So we must not output too many divisors per test case? \n\n          How to do:\n\n            For each test case:\n                T = 2*(w+l-2)\n                Find all divisors d of T such that d>=1 and d<=T? \n\n                Then check which of the following conditions hold:\n\n                  (a) w % d == 0 and l % d == 0\n                  (b) w % d == 0 and (l-2) % d == 0\n                  (c) (w-2) % d == 0 and l % d == 0\n                  (d) (w-2) % d == 0 and (l-2) % d == 0\n                  (e) (w-1) % d == 0 and (l-1) % d == 0\n\n                But wait: what about the corner assignments? \n\n                Actually, the known solution in the provided code snippet does:\n\n                  solutions = {1,2}\n                  for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                      if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                      for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                          mod_a = w % a\n                          if mod_a <= 2:\n                              # then check the other side? \n\n                  But note: half_perimeter = w+l-2, and T = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n                  Why are they only iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n                  Actually, they are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? Then a is a divisor of half_perimeter? \n\n                  But note: the total boundary T = 2 * half_perimeter, so the divisors of T include divisors of half_perimeter and also 2 times divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n                  However, they start with {1,2}. Then they iterate over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n                  Then they check: w % a <= 2. What does that mean?\n\n                  Let me try with the example: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter = 3+5-2 = 6.\n\n                  Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6 -> and they also consider 2? They start with {1,2}. Then they iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(6)) which is 2: \n                      i=2: 6%2==0 -> then a in [2, 6//2=3]\n                      Then for a=2: \n                          mod_a = 3 % 2 = 1 -> which is <=2 -> then what? \n                      Then for a=3: \n                          mod_a = 3 % 3 = 0 -> <=2 -> then what?\n\n                  Then they also consider i=3: floor(sqrt(6)) is 2, so they skip? \n\n                  Then they have solutions = {1,2,3,6}? \n\n                  But the example says a=1,2,3 are valid. \n\n                  Why 6? \n                      The total boundary T=2*6=12. 6 divides 12. \n                  Check for a=6: \n                      Condition: \n                         w=3: 3 mod 6 = 3 -> which is not <=2 -> so they wouldn't add 6? \n\n                  So how do they add 1? They started with {1,2}. Then they added 2 and 3? \n\n                  But they did not add 1? \n\n                  Actually, they start with {1,2}. Then they iterate and add 2 and 3. Then the set becomes {1,2,3}. \n\n                  Then they output: 3 and the sorted set: 1,2,3.\n\n                  How do they avoid duplicates? They use a set.\n\n                  Now, what about the condition? \n\n                  They check: w % a <= 2. \n\n                  Why is that condition sufficient? \n\n                  Explanation:\n\n                  The boundary can be covered if the remainder of w modulo a is 0, 1, or 2. \n\n                  Why? \n\n                  Consider the top side: \n                    We can cover the top side with horizontal tiles. However, the two corners might be covered by vertical tiles. \n\n                    The top side then has two possibilities:\n\n                      - If both corners are covered by vertical tiles: then the top side is w, and we require w mod a == 0? \n                      - If one corner is covered by a vertical tile and the other by a horizontal tile? Then the top side has w-1 squares to cover? \n                      - If both corners are covered by horizontal tiles? Then the top side has w-2 squares? \n\n                  Similarly, the bottom side: same.\n\n                  For the left side: \n                    The left side has two corners: \n                      - If both corners are covered by horizontal tiles: then the left side is l-2 -> must be divisible by a? \n                      - If one corner is covered by horizontal and the other by vertical: then l-1? \n                      - If both by vertical: then l? \n\n                  But note: the assignment for the top and bottom corners must be consistent? \n\n                  Actually, the entire boundary is connected. The condition w % a <= 2 might be checking the top side? \n\n                  However, the code then does:\n\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # then what? \n\n                  But they don't check the left side? \n\n                  Actually, the total boundary is T = 2*(w+l-2). Since a divides half_perimeter? Then 2*a divides T? \n\n                  But note: half_perimeter = w+l-2, and we are iterating a divisor of half_perimeter. Then a divides half_perimeter, so 2*a divides T? \n\n                  Actually, T = 2 * half_perimeter, so if a divides half_perimeter, then 2*a divides T? Not necessarily: because half_perimeter = a * k, then T = 2*a*k, so yes, 2*a divides T? \n\n                  But wait: we are using tiles of size a. The total area is T, so we need T divisible by a. But if a divides half_perimeter, then T = 2 * (a * k) = 2a * k, so T is divisible by a? \n\n                  Therefore, the condition that a divides half_perimeter ensures that a divides T. \n\n                  Now, the condition w % a <= 2: \n\n                    Let r = w % a. Then w = k*a + r, where 0<=r<a. \n\n                    We require r<=2. \n\n                    What does that mean? \n\n                    The top side: we can cover the top side by:\n\n                      - If we use a horizontal tile for the left corner: then the top side from the left corner to the right: we can cover the entire top side? \n\n                    Actually, the top side has w squares. We can break the top side into segments of length a. But we have two corners: \n\n                      The left corner: we can assign to the left side (vertical) or to the top (horizontal). Similarly, the right corner: to the top or to the right side.\n\n                    The condition r<=2 means that the top side can be covered if we leave at most 2 squares to be covered by the adjacent sides? \n\n                    Specifically, we can cover the top side with horizontal tiles if we leave the two corners to the adjacent sides? \n\n                    How? \n\n                      If r=0: then we can cover the entire top side (including both corners) by horizontal tiles? \n                      If r=1: then we can cover the top side from the left corner to the next a-1 squares? Then the last square of the top side must be covered by the right side? \n                      If r=2: then we leave the two corners to the adjacent sides? \n\n                    Similarly, the bottom side: same.\n\n                    Now, what about the left and right sides? \n\n                    The left side: the entire left side is l. But we have already covered the top and bottom corners? \n\n                    The left side then has: \n\n                      - If we left the top corner to the top side (so we didn't cover it by the left side) and the bottom corner to the bottom side, then the left side has l-2 squares? \n                      - If we covered the top corner by the left side, then the left side has l-1 squares? \n\n                    But note: the condition we are checking only for the top side? \n\n                    Actually, the total boundary is covered if the top side leaves at most 2 squares (the corners) and then the remaining sides can be covered? \n\n                    However, the condition on the left side: \n\n                      The left side must be covered by vertical tiles. The length of the left side is l. But we have two corners: \n\n                         top corner: if we covered it by the top side, then the left side starts at the next square -> so length l-1? \n                         bottom corner: similarly.\n\n                    But note: the condition w % a <= 2 does not check the left side. \n\n                    How do we know the left side can be covered? \n\n                    The total boundary is T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2a * k (since a divides half_perimeter). \n\n                    The top side: we cover w - r1, where r1 is the remainder (which we are leaving for the adjacent sides) and similarly the bottom side: w - r2? \n\n                    Actually, the top side: we are leaving r squares? \n\n                    Then the two vertical sides must cover: \n                         left: l - (r1? ) and right: l - (r2? ) \n\n                    But note: the top side has two ends: left and right. The left end of the top side is the top-left corner. The right end is the top-right corner. \n\n                    The left side: we have the top-left corner and the bottom-left corner. \n\n                    The top-left corner: if we did not cover it by the top side, then we must cover it by the left side. Similarly, the bottom-left corner: if we did not cover it by the bottom side, then we must cover it by the left side. \n\n                    Therefore, the left side must cover:\n\n                         l - (if the top-left corner was covered by the top side? then 0, else 1) - (if the bottom-left corner was covered by the bottom side? then 0, else 1)\n\n                    But we left the top side with r = w % a. How does that relate to the left side? \n\n                    Actually, the condition w % a = r means that we left r squares on the top side to be covered by the adjacent sides? \n\n                    But note: the top side has two adjacent sides: left and right. The r squares are distributed? \n\n                    Actually, the known solution does not check the left side. Why? \n\n                    There is symmetry: the total boundary is symmetric. The condition w % a <= 2 might be sufficient? \n\n                    Alternatively, note that the total boundary is T = 2*(w+l-2). We have:\n\n                         top: w - r1 (if we leave r1 squares for the adjacent sides) \n                         bottom: w - r2\n                         left: l - r3\n                         right: l - r4\n\n                    But the adjacent sides: the top-left corner: if we leave it, then it is covered by the left side? So the left side then has an extra square? \n\n                    Actually, the entire boundary must be covered. The condition is that the total covered by the horizontal sides (top and bottom) is (w - r1) + (w - r2) and by the vertical sides (left and right) is (l - r3) + (l - r4). \n\n                    And the total is: 2w + 2l - (r1+r2+r3+r4) = 2*(w+l) - (r1+r2+r3+r4) = T + 4 - (r1+r2+r3+r4)   [because T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2w+2l-4]\n\n                    So we require: 2w+2l - (r1+r2+r3+r4) = T? \n                         => 2w+2l - (r1+r2+r3+r4) = 2w+2l-4\n                         => r1+r2+r3+r4 = 4.\n\n                    Therefore, the total of the remainders must be 4. \n\n                    Now, the top side: we left r1 squares? But the top side has two corners: so r1 must be 0,1, or 2? \n\n                    Similarly, the bottom: r2 in {0,1,2}, and the left and right: r3 and r4 in {0,1,2}? \n\n                    And we require r1+r2+r3+r4=4.\n\n                    How can we assign? \n\n                    The top side: we leave r1 = min(2, w % a) ? \n\n                    Actually, the condition w % a <= 2 means that we can leave at most 2 squares on the top side. \n\n                    Similarly, the bottom side: we can leave at most 2 squares? \n\n                    But note: the bottom side: w % a? \n\n                    Actually, the condition in the code only checks w % a. \n\n                    What about the left side? \n\n                    The left side: we would need to check l % a? \n\n                    But the code does not. \n\n                    However, note the symmetry: the total condition is that the remainders must add to 4. \n\n                    And we have:\n\n                         r1 = w % a? \n                         r2 = w % a?   -> no, the bottom side is also w, so w % a is the same? \n\n                    Actually, the top and bottom are both w. So the remainder for the bottom is the same as the top? \n\n                    Similarly, the left and right: the left side is l, the right side is l? \n\n                    Then:\n\n                         r1 = w % a, r2 = w % a, r3 = l % a, r4 = l % a.\n\n                    Then the total remainder = 2*(w%a) + 2*(l%a) = 4.\n\n                    So: (w%a) + (l%a) = 2.\n\n                    But the code only checks w%a<=2. \n\n                    Why is that sufficient? \n\n                    Actually, it is not. We also need l%a<=2 and then 2*(w%a + l%a)=4 -> so w%a + l%a = 2.\n\n                    But the code does not check l%a. \n\n                    However, note: the total boundary T is divisible by a. \n\n                    The total boundary: \n                         T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2w+2l-4.\n\n                    And T mod a = 0.\n\n                    Then: 2w+2l-4 mod a = 0.\n\n                    => 2*(w+l) mod a = 4 mod a.\n\n                    But also: \n                         w mod a = r1, l mod a = r2.\n\n                    Then: 2*(w+l) mod a = 2*(r1+r2) mod a = 4 mod a.\n\n                    So: 2*(r1+r2) \u2261 4 (mod a).\n\n                    And we know 0<=r1<=2, 0<=r2<=2. Then 0<=r1+r2<=4.\n\n                    Then 2*(r1+r2) is in {0,2,4,6,8}. But we require 2*(r1+r2) mod a = 4 mod a.\n\n                    Since a divides T, and T=2*(w+l-2), and a divides half_perimeter? \n\n                    Actually, we are iterating a divisor of half_perimeter = w+l-2. \n\n                    Then: w+l-2 is divisible by a -> w+l \u2261 2 (mod a).\n\n                    Then: 2*(w+l) \u2261 4 (mod a) -> which is consistent with the condition.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition w%a<=2 and the fact that a divides half_perimeter (so w+l-2 \u22610 mod a) implies that l%a = (2 - w%a) mod a? \n\n                    But note: w+l-2 \u22610 mod a -> (w mod a + l mod a) mod a = 2 mod a.\n\n                    And since w mod a = r1 (in [0,2]) and l mod a = r2 (in [0,2]), then r1+r2 must be 2 or 2+a? But since r1+r2<=4 and a>=r1, a>=r2, and a>=3 (because if a<=2 we already have it in the set) then 2+a>=5, but r1+r2<=4 -> so r1+r2=2.\n\n                    Therefore, if w%a<=2 and a divides half_perimeter, then automatically l%a = 2 - w%a, which is in [0,2]. \n\n                    So the condition w%a<=2 is sufficient.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Let half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n            Start with solutions = {1, 2}   [because a=1 and a=2 are always valid? We must check: for a=1: \n                    w%1=0<=2 -> valid. \n                for a=2: \n                    w%2 is either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid.\n\n            Then iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)):\n                if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                    for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                        if w % a <= 2: \n                            then add a to solutions? \n\n            But note: we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter. However, the divisor a must be at least 1. \n\n            However, we already have 1 and 2. \n\n            But what about a= half_perimeter? We are including half_perimeter//i, which when i is a divisor, then half_perimeter//i is the complementary divisor.\n\n            Then we also need to consider the divisor 1? We already have it.\n\n            But note: what if half_perimeter is 0? Then w+l=2, but w>=3 and l>=3 -> so half_perimeter>=4.\n\n            Also, we must consider that a might be greater than half_perimeter? But we are iterating divisors of half_perimeter, so a is at most half_perimeter.\n\n            However, the total boundary T = 2 * half_perimeter, so divisors of T include divisors of half_perimeter and 2 times divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            But the code does not consider divisors of T that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            Why? \n\n            Because the condition we rely on is that a divides half_perimeter? \n\n            But note: the condition that a divides T is necessary. And if a divides T, then a must be of the form:\n\n                a = d, where d divides T.\n\n            But T = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of T are:\n\n                divisors of half_perimeter and 2 * divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            However, the code only considers divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            Why is that sufficient? \n\n            Because if a is a divisor of T, then we can write a = d * k, but we are iterating the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            Actually, we are missing the divisors that are even? \n\n            Example: w=3, l=5 -> T=12. Divisors of T: 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n                half_perimeter=6 -> divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n            But 4 and 12 are divisors of T but not of half_perimeter? \n\n            Then why the example output is 1,2,3? \n\n            Check a=4: \n                Condition: w=3 -> 3%4=3 -> which is not <=2 -> so invalid.\n\n            a=12: 3%12=3 -> invalid.\n\n            a=6: 3%6=3 -> invalid.\n\n            So the valid a are 1,2,3.\n\n            Therefore, we don't need to consider divisors of T that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            Why? \n\n            Because the condition w%a<=2 must hold. And if a is a divisor of T but not of half_perimeter, then we have:\n\n                half_perimeter = w+l-2 = a * k? -> no, because a does not divide half_perimeter. \n\n            But wait: we require that a divides T=2*half_perimeter. Then 2*half_perimeter is divisible by a. \n\n            Then the condition w%a<=2 is still necessary? \n\n            However, the derivation that l%a = 2 - w%a (mod a) relied on w+l-2 being divisible by a? \n\n            But if a does not divide half_perimeter, then w+l-2 is not divisible by a. \n\n            Then the condition w%a<=2 is not sufficient? \n\n            Therefore, the code only considers divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            But note: the total boundary T is divisible by a, so 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a. \n\n            Then: 2*(w+l-2) = 0 (mod a) -> 2*(w+l) = 4 (mod a).\n\n            And we have: \n                w mod a = r1, l mod a = r2.\n\n            Then: 2*(r1+r2) \u2261 4 (mod a).\n\n            And we require r1<=2 and r2<=2? \n\n            Then 2*(r1+r2) is in {0,2,4,6,8}. We require 2*(r1+r2) - 4 is divisible by a. \n\n            But a can be large. \n\n            How to check without iterating? \n\n            The known solution in the provided code does not consider divisors of T that are not divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n            And the example shows that a=4 and a=12 are invalid. \n\n            Therefore, we stick to divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n            But what about a=4 in another example? \n\n            Example: w=4, l=4 -> half_perimeter=4+4-2=6, T=12.\n\n            Divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n\n            Check a=4: \n                Condition: w%a = 4%4=0<=2 -> valid? \n                But is it valid? \n\n                Boundary: 2*(4+4-2)=12, divisible by 4? 12/4=3 -> yes.\n\n                Now, can we cover?\n                  Top: 4 -> divisible by 4? yes.\n                  Bottom: 4 -> divisible by 4? yes.\n                  Left: 4-2=2 -> divisible by 4? no -> 2 mod 4 = 2 -> but we can cover 2 squares with a tile of length 4? no.\n\n                How? \n\n                The left side: we have two squares. We can cover them with one tile of length 2? but we have tiles of length 4. \n\n                Alternatively, we can use a tile that covers two sides? \n\n                Actually, we can use a tile of length 4 vertically: but the left side is only 2 squares high? \n\n                So we cannot cover the left side. \n\n                Therefore, a=4 is not valid.\n\n                Why did the condition w%a<=2 pass? \n\n                The condition only checks the top side. But the left side: l=4, then the left side has l-2=2? \n\n                We need to check the left side: 2 mod 4 = 2, which is <=2? \n\n                But the condition in the code only checks w%a. \n\n                Therefore, we must also check the left side? \n\n                However, by symmetry, we could check l%a<=2? \n\n                But note: the condition w%a<=2 and the fact that a divides half_perimeter implies that l%a = (2 - w%a) mod a? \n\n                In this example: w%a=0, then l%a should be 2 mod a? \n                    l=4, 4 mod 4 = 0, not 2.\n\n                Why? \n\n                We have: w+l-2 = 4+4-2=6, and 6 mod 4 = 2, not 0. But wait: we assumed a divides half_perimeter? 4 does not divide 6. \n\n                Therefore, we only consider divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n                In this example, 4 is not a divisor of 6, so we skip.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                solutions = {1,2}\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                    for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                        if w % a <= 2:\n                            solutions.add(a)\n                        # and also we should check the same condition for l? \n                        # But note: by symmetry, we could also check l % a? \n                        # However, the condition w%a<=2 is sufficient? \n                        # But wait: what if we cover the left side first? \n                        # The condition is symmetric? \n\n                Actually, the condition should be: either w % a <=2 OR l % a <=2? \n\n                But note: the condition we derived: w%a<=2 implies l%a = 2 - w%a (which is in [0,2])? \n\n                But that is only if a divides half_perimeter. \n\n                Therefore, we don't need to check l%a? \n\n            However, the example: w=3, l=5, a=3: \n                w%3=0<=2 -> valid -> then we add 3.\n                l%3=2, which is also <=2 -> but we don't need to check.\n\n            But what if we have a divisor a that does not satisfy w%a<=2 but satisfies l%a<=2? \n\n            Example: w=5, l=3, then half_perimeter=5+3-2=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n                a=3: \n                    w%a = 5%3=2 -> valid -> so we add 3.\n\n            So it's symmetric. \n\n            But what if we have a divisor a that satisfies neither? \n\n            Example: w=4, l=4, half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6. \n                a=3: \n                    w%3=1<=2 -> valid -> so we add 3? \n                But is a=3 valid for w=4, l=4? \n                    Boundary: 2*(4+4-2)=12, divisible by 3 -> yes.\n                    w%3=1 -> so we leave 1 square on the top and bottom? \n                    Then the left side: 4 - 2 (because we left the two corners? but we left 1 square on the top and 1 on the bottom? but the top and bottom each have two corners) -> actually, the top side: we leave one corner? \n\n                How to cover? \n                    Top side: 4 squares. We leave one corner (say the left corner) to be covered by the left side. Then the top side has 3 squares? divisible by 3 -> one tile.\n                    Bottom side: similarly, leave one corner (say the left corner) -> then bottom side has 3 squares -> one tile.\n                    Left side: we have the top-left corner and the bottom-left corner. And the entire left side is 4-2=2 squares? But we have two corners? \n                    Actually, the left side: from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner: 4 squares? \n                    But we have already covered the top-left corner by the top side? and the bottom-left corner by the bottom side? Then the left side has 4-2=2 squares? \n                    But 2 is not divisible by 3? \n\n                Alternatively, we can cover the top-left corner by the left side? Then the top side has 4-1=3 squares -> divisible by 3. \n                    The left side: then has 4 squares? (including the top and bottom corners) -> 4 mod 3 = 1 -> not divisible by 3? \n\n                How about: \n                    Top side: cover the entire top side? 4 mod 3 = 1 -> we leave one square? \n                    Then we cover the top side with one tile of 3 and leave one square at the right end? \n                    Then the right side: must cover the entire right side? 4 squares? 4 mod 3=1 -> not divisible.\n\n                Therefore, a=3 is not valid for (4,4). \n\n                Why did we add it? \n\n                The condition w%a<=2 is necessary but not sufficient? \n\n                But we also require that the total remainder condition holds: 2*(w%a + l%a) = 4 mod a? \n                    w%a=1, l%a=1 -> 2*(1+1)=4 mod a -> 4 mod 3 = 1, not 0? \n\n                Actually, we require 2*(w%a + l%a) \u2261 4 (mod a) -> 2*(1+1)=4 \u2261 1 mod 3? -> not 0? \n\n                But the total boundary T=12 is divisible by 3 -> 12 mod 3=0. \n\n                How does that relate? \n\n                We have: \n                    T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(4+4-2)=12.\n                    Then 12 mod 3 = 0.\n\n                But the condition 2*(w%a + l%a) \u2261 4 (mod a) is derived from T=0 mod a? \n                    T = 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n                    Then 2*(w+l) - 4 \u2261 0 mod a -> 2*(w+l) \u2261 4 mod a.\n\n                And 2*(w%a + l%a) mod a = 2*(w+l) mod a? \n                    Not exactly: because w = k1*a + r1, l = k2*a + r2, then w+l = (k1+k2)*a + (r1+r2)\n                    Then 2*(w+l) = 2*(k1+k2)*a + 2*(r1+r2) -> so mod a: 2*(r1+r2) mod a.\n\n                Therefore, we require 2*(r1+r2) \u2261 4 (mod a).\n\n                For a=3, r1=1, r2=1: 2*(1+1)=4 \u2261 1 mod 3? -> not 4 mod 3? \n\n                Actually, 4 mod 3 is 1. So 1 \u2261 1 mod 3 -> true.\n\n                So the condition holds. \n\n                Then why can't we cover? \n\n                The issue is that the remainders are distributed on the sides. \n\n                We have:\n                    Top: leaves r1=1 square -> which one? \n                    Bottom: leaves r2=1 square -> which one? \n                    Left: leaves r3 = l%a = 4%3=1? \n                    Right: leaves r4=1? \n\n                Total = 1+1+1+1=4 -> which matches.\n\n                How to cover? \n                    Top: has 4 squares. We leave one square: say the leftmost square? Then we cover the other 3 with one tile.\n                    Bottom: similarly, leave the leftmost square? \n                    Left: has 4 squares. We leave one square: the topmost square? But the topmost square is the top-left corner, which we already left? \n                    Then the left side has 3 squares? -> covered by one tile.\n                    Right: similarly, leave the topmost square? then cover the rest 3.\n\n                But wait: the top side: we left the leftmost square -> that is the top-left corner. Then the left side: we left the topmost square -> that is the same top-left corner? \n\n                We cannot leave the same square twice. \n\n                Therefore, the remainders must be assigned to distinct corners. \n\n                The four corners: \n                    top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\n\n                The top side: we can leave either the left corner or the right corner or both? \n                Similarly, the bottom side: either the left or right or both.\n\n                The left side: we can leave either the top or bottom or both? \n                The right side: either the top or bottom or both.\n\n                And the total number of left squares is 4. \n\n                How to assign? \n\n                We have four corners. Each corner is shared by two sides. \n\n                We must assign each corner to one of the two sides that meet there. \n\n                Then the condition: the top side leaves r1 corners, the bottom side leaves r2 corners, the left side leaves r3 corners, the right side leaves r4 corners, and the total is r1+r2+r3+r4=4.\n\n                But note: each corner is assigned to one side. \n\n                How many corners are there? 4. \n\n                Therefore, we need to assign each corner to one of the two sides. \n\n                The top side: can only leave the corners that are on the top: top-left and top-right. \n                Similarly, the bottom side: bottom-left and bottom-right.\n                The left side: top-left and bottom-left.\n                The right side: top-right and bottom-right.\n\n                Then the total number of corners assigned is 4. \n\n                The condition: the top side leaves r1 corners -> so it must be that r1 is the number of corners on the top that are assigned to the top side? \n\n                But wait: if the top side leaves a corner, that means it does not cover that corner, so the corner must be covered by the adjacent side. \n\n                Therefore, the top side leaves r1 corners -> then the adjacent sides (left and right) must cover those corners. \n\n                Similarly, the left side leaves r3 corners -> then the adjacent sides (top and bottom) must cover those corners? \n\n                This is circular. \n\n                Actually, the assignment is: \n\n                  For the top-left corner: it can be covered by the top side or the left side. \n\n                We have a system: \n\n                  Let x1 = 1 if the top-left corner is covered by the top side, 0 if by the left side.\n                  x2 = 1 if the top-right corner is covered by the top side, 0 if by the right side.\n                  x3 = 1 if the bottom-left corner is covered by the bottom side, 0 if by the left side.\n                  x4 = 1 if the bottom-right corner is covered by the bottom side, 0 if by the right side.\n\n                Then the top side leaves (2 - x1 - x2) corners? \n                    Because the top side has two corners, and if it covers a corner then it doesn't leave it.\n                Similarly, the bottom side leaves (2 - x3 - x4) corners.\n                The left side leaves (2 - x1 - x3) corners? \n                The right side leaves (2 - x2 - x4) corners.\n\n                The total leaves = (2-x1-x2) + (2-x3-x4) + (2-x1-x3) + (2-x2-x4) = 8 - 2*(x1+x2+x3+x4) = 8 - 2* (number of corners covered by the horizontal sides) \n\n                But we require total leaves = 4.\n\n                Then: 8 - 2*(x1+x2+x3+x4) = 4 -> 2*(x1+x2+x3+x4)=4 -> x1+x2+x3+x4=2.\n\n                And the leaves per side:\n\n                  top: 2 - x1 - x2 = r1\n                  bottom: 2 - x3 - x4 = r2\n                  left: 2 - x1 - x3 = r3\n                  right: 2 - x2 - x4 = r4\n\n                And we have: r1 = w % a, r2 = w % a, r3 = l % a, r4 = l % a? \n\n                In our example: w=4, l=4, a=3: \n                    r1 = 4%3=1, r2=1, r3=1, r4=1.\n\n                Then we require:\n\n                  2 - x1 - x2 = 1 -> x1+x2=1.\n                  2 - x3 - x4 = 1 -> x3+x4=1.\n                  2 - x1 - x3 = 1 -> x1+x3=1.\n                  2 - x2 - x4 = 1 -> x2+x4=1.\n\n                And x1+x2+x3+x4=2.\n\n                This is solvable: \n                    x1=1, x2=0, x3=0, x4=1 -> then x1+x2+x3+x4=2.\n                    Check: \n                      top: 2-1-0=1, bottom: 2-0-1=1, left: 2-1-0=1, right:2-0-1=1.\n\n                Therefore, it is possible.\n\n                How to cover? \n                  Top side: covers the top-left corner (x1=1), does not cover the top-right corner (x2=0). \n                  Bottom side: covers the bottom-right corner (x4=1), does not cover the bottom-left corner (x3=0).\n                  Left side: covers the bottom-left corner (x3=0 means covered by left side) and does not cover the top-left corner (x1=1 means covered by top side) -> so the left side covers only the bottom-left corner? \n                    But wait: the left side has two corners: top-left and bottom-left. \n                    We said the top-left corner is covered by the top side, so the left side only covers the bottom-left corner? \n                    Then the left side has the bottom-left corner and the squares in between? \n                    The left side has 4 squares: \n                         (0,0) [top-left] -> covered by top\n                         (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) [interior]\n                         (0,4) [bottom-left] -> covered by left side.\n                    But then the left side has 3 interior squares? -> 3 is divisible by 3.\n\n                  Similarly, the right side: \n                    top-right: covered by the right side? -> no, because x2=0 means the top side does not cover it, so the right side must cover it? \n                    bottom-right: covered by the bottom side -> so the right side covers the top-right corner and then the interior: (w-1,1) to (w-1,3) -> 3 squares.\n\n                  Top side: covers the top-left corner and then from (1,0) to (3,0): 3 squares? -> divisible by 3.\n                  Bottom side: covers the bottom-right corner and then from (0,4) to (2,4): wait, no, the bottom side is from (0,4) to (3,4). \n                         It covers the bottom-right corner (3,4) and then we leave the bottom-left corner (0,4) -> then it covers (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) -> 3 squares.\n\n                Therefore, it works.\n\n            So the condition is: \n                a must be a divisor of half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then we only require that w%a<=2 (which by symmetry and the modular condition implies the rest) and then we can find an assignment.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                solutions = {1,2}\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                    for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                        if w % a <= 2 or l % a <= 2:   # wait, note: we have two widths: w and l. \n                        # But the top and bottom are w, the left and right are l. \n                        # However, the condition for the top is w%a<=2, and for the left is l%a<=2? \n                        # But the condition we derived was for the top and bottom: they are both w, so we only need to check w%a<=2.\n                        # And for the left and right: they are both l, so we only need to check l%a<=2.\n                        # But the example above: we checked w%a<=2 and that was enough. \n                        # However, consider: \n                        #   w=5, l=3, a=3: \n                        #       w%a=2<=2 -> valid.\n                        #   w=3, l=5, a=3: \n                        #       w%a=0<=2 -> valid.\n                        #   w=3, l=3, a=2: \n                        #       w%2=1<=2 -> valid.\n                        #   w=3, l=3, a=3: \n                        #       w%3=0<=2 -> valid.\n\n                        # But what if we have a divisor a that satisfies l%a<=2 but not w%a<=2? \n                        #   Example: w=5, l=3, a= something that divides 6: \n                        #       a=6: \n                        #           w%6=5 -> not <=2, but l%6=3 -> not <=2? \n                        #       a=3: we already did.\n                        #       a=2: w%2=1<=2 -> valid.\n                        #       a=1: valid.\n\n                        #   Example: w=4, l=3, half_perimeter=5 -> divisors: 1,5.\n                        #       a=5: \n                        #           w%5=4 -> not<=2, l%5=3 -> not<=2 -> skip.\n                        #       a=1: valid.\n\n                        #   But is there an example where a divisor a satisfies l%a<=2 but not w%a<=2, and it is valid? \n                        #   By symmetry, we can swap w and l? \n\n                        #   However, the condition is symmetric in w and l? \n\n                        #   But the code currently only checks w%a. \n\n                        #   We must check both? \n\n                        #   Let me try: w=3, l=5, a=3: we already did -> valid and w%a=0<=2.\n\n                        #   What if we try a divisor that is more naturally related to l? \n\n                        #   Example: w=5, l=3, a=3: valid by checking w%a=2<=2.\n\n                        #   Therefore, it seems sufficient to check w%a<=2.\n\n            But wait: the condition for the vertical sides is l%a<=2? \n\n            In the derivation, we had for the top and bottom: w%a<=2, and for the left and right: we get l%a = (2 - w%a) mod a, which is in [0,2]? \n\n            But that relied on a dividing half_perimeter. \n\n            Therefore, we only need to check one of them? \n\n            However, the condition in the provided code only checks w%a. \n\n            But the problem says: the bathroom has width w and length l. The top and bottom are the widths (w), and the left and right are the lengths (l). \n\n            In the code, the variable w is the first dimension (width) and l is the second (length). \n\n            Therefore, we only need to check w%a<=2. \n\n            But note: the example in the note: \n                \"In the first test case, the bathroom is 3 centimeters wide and 5 centimeters long\"\n\n            So w=3, l=5. \n\n            Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is to add the divisor a to the set solutions if w % a <= 2.\n\n            However, the provided code snippet already has:\n\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            What should we do in the TODO? \n\n            We should add a to the set solutions? \n\n            But note: the set solutions is being built. \n\n            So we do:\n\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n            But also, we might have the same a from a different divisor? The set will handle duplicates.\n\n            Also, we are iterating a in [i, half_perimeter//i] and we start with 1 and 2.\n\n            But what about a= half_perimeter? We are including it.\n\n            However, we must also consider the divisor 1 and 2 at the beginning. \n\n            But note: the divisor 1: \n                w % 1 = 0 <=2 -> valid, so we have 1.\n            divisor 2: \n                w % 2 is either 0 or 1, both <=2 -> valid.\n\n            And then we iterate and add other divisors.\n\n            But what if half_perimeter is 1? then the loop does not run? \n                But w>=3, l>=3 -> half_perimeter>=4.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n            However, the code also has:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:   # note: div = half_perimeter // i\n\n            And then they check w % a.\n\n            But note: a might be 1 or 2 again? \n\n            For example, if half_perimeter=4, then i=2: divisors: 2 and 4//2=2 -> duplicate. \n\n            But the set will remove duplicates.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is complete except for the TODO: we add a to the set.\n\n            But wait: the example in the note: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6. \n                We start with {1,2}. \n                Then i=2: 6%2==0 -> a in [2,3]: \n                    a=2: already in the set? \n                    a=3: 3%3=0<=2 -> add 3.\n                Then i=3: floor(sqrt(6)) is 2, so we break? \n                Then solutions = {1,2,3}. \n\n            But we missed 6? \n                For i=3: we don't go because floor(sqrt(6)) is 2. \n                But note: when i=2, we also got a=3 and a=6? \n                    Actually, no: \n                        for i=2: \n                            div = 6//2 = 3 -> so a in [2,3]. \n                We did not get 6? \n\n            How to get 6? \n                We need to iterate i up to sqrt(half_perimeter). For i=2, we get divisors 2 and 3. \n                But 6 = half_perimeter, and we get it when i=1? but we start i from 2. \n\n            How to capture 6? \n                We can iterate i from 1 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))? \n\n            But the current code starts at i=2. \n\n            Why did they start at 2? \n\n            And they initially put {1,2}. \n\n            So they have 1 and 2 already. \n\n            Then for i>=2, they avoid 1. \n\n            But 6: we would get when i=3? but 3>sqrt(6) (which is about 2.4) -> no. \n\n            How to capture divisors greater than sqrt(half_perimeter)? \n\n            The typical divisor iteration: \n                for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n))+1):\n                    if n % i == 0:\n                        divisors.add(i)\n                        divisors.add(n//i)\n\n            But here, they start with 1 and 2, then iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)).\n\n            They are missing the divisor 6? \n\n            To capture 6, we would need to iterate i=1? \n\n            But they start at 2. \n\n            And they have already added 1 and 2. \n\n            Then for i=1: skip because we start at 2. \n\n            But 6 is half_perimeter, and we have not added it. \n\n            How to add it? \n\n            We can add half_perimeter itself? \n\n            But note: in the loop, when i is a divisor, we add i and n//i. When i=1, we would add 1 and 6. But we start at 2. \n\n            Therefore, we should iterate from 1? \n\n            But then we would get 1 and 6, and we already have 1. \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate from 1 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then add the divisors. \n\n            But the provided code starts with {1,2} and then iterates from 2. \n\n            Why 2? \n\n            They might be avoiding 1 because they already have it. \n\n            But then they miss half_perimeter itself? \n\n            We can add an extra condition: after the loop, add half_perimeter? \n\n            But only if half_perimeter>=2? \n\n            And then check w % half_perimeter <=2? \n\n            Example: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, then check 3%6=3 -> not <=2 -> skip.\n\n            So we don't add 6.\n\n            Therefore, the set is {1,2,3} -> which matches.\n\n            But what if there is a divisor that is half_perimeter itself and it is valid? \n\n            Example: w=4, l=4: half_perimeter=6, and 6 is not valid (as we saw).\n\n            Example: w=2, l=2: not allowed because w>=3.\n\n            Example: w=3, l=3: half_perimeter=4, divisors: 1,2,4. \n                a=4: 3%4=3 -> not valid.\n\n            Example: w=6, l=6: half_perimeter=10, then a=10: 6%10=6 -> not<=2.\n\n            Therefore, we don't need to add half_perimeter.\n\n            But what about a divisor that is greater than sqrt(half_perimeter) and not half_perimeter? \n\n            The loop: \n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                        for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]: ...\n\n            This captures all divisors: because if i is a divisor, then half_perimeter//i is also a divisor, and one of them is <= sqrt(half_perimeter) and the other >= sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\n            Therefore, we capture all divisors that are >=2 and <= half_perimeter, except 1 and half_perimeter? \n\n            But we already have 1 and 2. \n\n            And we capture half_perimeter//i which might be half_perimeter when i=1, but we skip i=1. \n\n            But we don't capture half_perimeter itself? \n\n            However, if half_perimeter is a perfect square, then when i = sqrt(half_perimeter), we get a = [i, half_perimeter//i] = [i,i] -> so we add i.\n\n            And if half_perimeter is not a square, then we capture all divisors in pairs.\n\n            But note: we start with 1 and 2. \n\n            The divisor 1 is already there. \n            The divisor 2 is already there. \n\n            Then we iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)): \n                This captures every divisor d in the range [2, sqrt(half_perimeter)] and also the complementary divisor (half_perimeter//d) which is in the range [sqrt(half_perimeter), half_perimeter//2] (if d>=2, then half_perimeter//d <= half_perimeter//2). \n\n            But what about a divisor that is greater than half_perimeter//2? \n                For example, half_perimeter=6: divisors are 1,2,3,6. \n                We have 1 and 2 initially. \n                Then i=2: 6%2==0 -> then a in [2,3] -> we add 3 (and 2 is already there). \n                We miss 6? \n\n            But 6 is half_perimeter, and we don't want it because 6 is not valid (as w%6=3 or more).\n\n            Therefore, the code is as intended.\n\n            But note: the divisor 1 and 2 are always added initially.\n\n            However, what if half_perimeter=1? \n                Then the loop does not run (since sqrt(1)=1, and range(2,2) is empty). \n                But w>=3, l>=3 -> half_perimeter>=4.\n\n            Therefore, the only TODO in program2.py is to add the divisor a to the set solutions.\n\n            So we do: solutions.add(a)\n\n            But note: the divisor a might be 1 or 2? Then we are adding duplicates, but the set handles that.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n                solutions.add(a)\n\n            However, the code snippet has:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We do: solutions.add(a)\n\n            But what if the condition fails? we skip.\n\n            That's correct.\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1.py: \n      We need to build the prefix sum array. \n      Change the loop to: \n          for w in sorted(R()):\n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n  program2.py:\n      In the inner loop, we do:\n          solutions.add(a)\n\n  But note: the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n            if mod_i != 0:\n                continue\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We do: solutions.add(a)\n\n  However, note: the variable name in the for-loop is \"div\", but in the list we have [i, div]. \n\n  But the code uses \"div\" as the quotient. \n\n  Also, note: the divmod returns (quotient, remainder). We already checked mod_i==0, so div = half_perimeter // i.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n\n  And then we check w%a and add a.\n\n  But note: what if a is 1? We already have 1 in the set. Similarly for 2.\n\n  But adding duplicates to a set is harmless.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the divisor might be 1 even when half_perimeter is large? \n\n  But we start the loop at i=2, so i>=2, and then a in [i, div] -> both i and div are at least 2? \n\n  Actually, if i=2, then div = half_perimeter//2, which might be 1 if half_perimeter=2? but half_perimeter>=4, so div>=2.\n\n  Therefore, we won't get 1 in the loop.\n\n  So we don't add 1 again.\n\n  Similarly, 2: we might get when i=2, then a in [2, half_perimeter//2]. If half_perimeter//2 is 2, then we get two 2's? but the set will have one.\n\n  Therefore, the code is safe.\n\n  Output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n  Note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the completion for the TODO parts.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is the body of the for-loop that currently has \"pass\" or nothing? \n\n  The original code:\n\n        for w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing that line and the next with:\n\n        for w in sorted(R()): \n            p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n  But note: the original code has a colon and then a comment. We must complete the body.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the if statement.\n\n  We write:\n\n        solutions.add(a)\n\n  But note: the code in program2.py has:\n\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with: solutions.add(a)\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n  And the output format: \n        {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  The completion for program1.py: the entire for-loop body? \n\n  But the for-loop body is one line: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\n  The completion for program2.py: the one line: \"solutions.add(a)\".\n\n  But note: the program1.py has an empty for-loop. We are adding one line.\n\n  However, the program1.py also has the next line: \"for _ in \" \"*q: ...\", so we only complete the for-loop body.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\"\n      program2: \"solutions.add(a)\"\n\n  But wait: in program1.py, the for-loop is over the sorted prices. We are building the prefix sum. \n\n  And in program2.py, we are adding the divisor a to the set.\n\n  However, note: the program2.py code has a typo? \n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n\n  This is: floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1 -> that is an integer. \n\n  But the range is: range(2, N) -> goes from 2 to N-1. \n\n  We want to include the integer part of sqrt(half_perimeter). \n\n  Actually, we want to iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) inclusive? \n\n        range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1) -> the last value is floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)).\n\n  That is correct.\n\n  But note: the variable \"half_perimeter\" is an integer. \n\n  Therefore, we output the completions as described.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output only the missing code.\n\n  But note: the missing code for program1.py is the body of the for-loop. \n\n  And for program2.py, the missing code is the body of the if.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n        \"program2\": \"solutions.add(a)\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1.py has a for-loop that is currently incomplete. We are providing the line that goes inside.\n\n  And program2.py has an if block that is incomplete. We are providing the line that goes inside.\n\n  However, in program2.py, the TODO is inside a for-loop and an if. We are only providing the one line.\n\n  But what if we need multiple lines? \n\n  In this case, only one line.\n\n  Let me write the corrected program1.py:\n\n        f=open(0)\n        R=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\n        n,q=R();p=[0]\n        for w in sorted(R()): \n            p.append(p[-1] + w)\n        for _ in \" \"*q: x, y=R();print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\n  And program2.py:\n\n        from math import sqrt, floor\n        from sys import stdin\n\n        data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n        res = []\n        for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n            half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n            solutions = {1, 2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n                if mod_i != 0:\n                    continue\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n            res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\")\n        print('\\n'.join(res))\n\n  But note: the program2.py code in the problem has:\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n\n  But the correct range should be: range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1) -> but that is what we have.\n\n  However, the expression: floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) is an integer. \n\n  But what if half_perimeter is 0? -> but w,l>=3 -> half_perimeter>=4.\n\n  Therefore, we output the completions as above."
