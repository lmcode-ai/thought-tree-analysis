But note: we can change a_2 to 0 by subtracting a_1 multiple times, but then we can change a_3 by subtracting a_2 (which is 0) any number of times? That doesn't change a_3. So we must change a_3 before we zero out a_2? Then we subtract a_2 from a_3, so we can subtract a_2 (which is the original a_2) as many times as we want? Then we can make a_3 become a_3 mod a_2? Then we can change a_2: subtract a_1 from a_2 until it becomes 0. Then we change a_3: we can subtract a_2 (0) from a_3? So we cannot change a_3 anymore.",

So it works. But what if there is only one test case? Input: \"1\\n2\\n5 10\"\n      input_arr = [1,2,5,10]\n      n=1\n      pos=1\n          n_val = input_arr[1]=2 -> then arr_val = input_arr[2:4] = [5,10] -> pos=4 -> then 4<=3? false. So it works.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe provided code has a dijkstra function that is incomplete. Specifically, in the dijkstra function, there is a TODO that we must fill.\n\nLooking at the dijkstra function:\n    while hp:\n        cv = heappop(hp)\n        c, v = cv//B, cv%B\n        if dist[v] < c:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nIn a standard dijkstra, if we pop a node that has a distance greater than the current known distance, we skip it. So we should continue to the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, we can fill the TODO with:\n            continue\n\nAdditionally, note that the dijkstra function is being called multiple times in the main loop (for each k from 0 to k-1). The main loop does:\n    for iii in range(k):\n        newdp = ...   (using convex hull trick for flights)\n        dp = newdp[:]\n        dp = dijkstra(root, dp)\n\nSo the dijkstra function must be correct.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about determining if we can make all elements from index 2 to n (0-indexed from 1) become 0 by repeatedly choosing an index i (>=2) and subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i.\n\nThe provided function `diff_ops(arr)` checks for each i (from 1 to len(arr)-1) that arr[i] is divisible by arr[0]. However, this is not sufficient.\n\nWe note that the operations are reversible? Actually, we are allowed to subtract a_{i-1} from a_i any number of times. This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm for gcd.\n\nIn fact, we can think of the process: we are allowed to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. Therefore, the condition for the entire array is that the first element must divide every element in the array? But note: we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on indices < i.\n\nActually, we can process from right to left? However, note the operations: we can choose any index i (>=2) arbitrarily many times. This means that for each position i (starting from the last one), we can reduce a_i to the remainder when divided by a_{i-1}. But then we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on indices j<=i-1.\n\nHowever, note the constraints: n<=100. We can simulate backwards? But the numbers are large.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire array can be made zero if and only if the gcd of the entire array is the same as the first element? Actually, we want to make a_i=0 for all i>=2. Then the first element must remain unchanged? Actually, the first element is never changed because we can only operate on indices from 2 to n. So a_1 remains fixed.\n\nNow, consider the second element: we can subtract a_1 any number of times. So we can make a_2 become a_2 mod a_1 (if we do it optimally). But note: we can also change a_2 by operations that come after? Actually, no: because when we operate on index i, we subtract a_{i-1} from a_i. So if we want to change a_2, we must use an operation on index 2 (which subtracts a_1 from a_2). But note: we can also change a_3, then a_2, then a_3 again, etc.\n\nHowever, observe that the operations on an index i only affect a_i. And we can do as many as we want. Therefore, for the second element, we can make it 0 if and only if a_2 is a multiple of a_1? But wait: what if we change a_2 first and then use the new a_2 to change a_3? Actually, we can also change a_3 first? The problem allows any order.\n\nBut note: the operation on index i (say i=3) uses a_2. If we change a_2 first, then the operation on a_3 uses the new a_2. So the operations are interdependent.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming? Or note that the entire process is equivalent to: we want to represent every element (from a_2 to a_n) as a linear combination of a_1 with nonnegative coefficients? Actually, no: because we are subtracting, so the coefficients would be integers? But note: we can subtract multiple times.\n\nActually, we can use the following idea:\n\nWe want to make a_i = 0 for all i>=2. We can do:\n\n  a_2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting multiples of a_1. So a_2 must be divisible by a_1? But wait: what if we change a_2 after changing a_3? Actually, we can change a_3 first: subtract a_2 from a_3 multiple times. Then we change a_2: subtract a_1 from a_2 until it becomes 0. Then we change a_3: subtract a_2 (which is 0) from a_3? But that doesn't change a_3. So we must change a_3 before we zero out a_2? But then we subtract the original a_2 from a_3.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the set of numbers that can appear at position i is the set of numbers that are congruent to the original a_i modulo the gcd of the numbers to the left? Actually, we can use the following:\n\nLet g_i = gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_i). Then we can make the array from 1 to i such that the only nonzero element is the first one and it becomes g_i? But we want to make a_i=0 for i>=2.\n\nActually, we can use the following solution:\n\n  We can make the entire array (from index 2 to n) zero if and only if for every i from 1 to n, a_i is divisible by the gcd of the entire array? But note: the first element must remain? Actually, we can change the other elements arbitrarily as long as we leave the first element fixed? And the operations are linear.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known solution for this problem (which is known from Codeforces problems):\n\n  We can make the array such that all elements from 2 to n become 0 if and only if the first element divides every element in the array? But the sample: [1,2,3] -> [1,1,1] -> ... -> [1,0,0] -> [0,0,0]? Actually, the problem does not require the first element to become 0. Only from index 2 to n.\n\nBut in the sample [1,2,3] we end up with [1,0,0]. So the first element remains 1.\n\nSo the condition: for each i>=2, we must be able to express a_i as a multiple of a_1? But note: we can change a_2 to 0 by subtracting a_1 multiple times, but then we can change a_3 by subtracting a_2 (which is 0) any number of times? That doesn't change a_3. So we must change a_3 before we zero out a_2? Then we subtract a_2 from a_3, so we can subtract a_2 (which is the original a_2) as many times as we want? Then we can make a_3 become a_3 mod a_2? Then we can change a_2: subtract a_1 from a_2 until it becomes 0. Then we change a_3: we can subtract a_2 (0) from a_3? So we cannot change a_3 anymore. Therefore, we must have that the gcd of the entire array must be the same as the gcd of the first element? Actually, the gcd of the entire array must be a divisor of the first element? But note: the first element is fixed.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  We can make the array [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] such that for i>=2, a_i=0 if and only if for every i, a_i is divisible by the gcd of the entire array? But wait, the first element must be the gcd? Actually, we can change the array arbitrarily as long as the gcd of the entire array remains the same? And we want to leave the first element as the gcd? Then we can set the others to 0.\n\nBut note: the operations are reversible? Actually, the set of linear combinations that we can form is the ideal generated by the numbers. However, we are not forming linear combinations arbitrarily: we are subtracting multiples of the previous element.\n\nWe can use the following known solution:\n\n  Let g = gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Then the answer is \"YES\" if and only if a_1 % g == 0? Actually, a_1 is fixed and we want to make the others 0. The key is that the entire array must be divisible by g, and then we can use the Euclidean algorithm backwards? \n\nBut note: we can also change the values arbitrarily? Actually, the operations are:\n\n  Operation on i: subtract a_{i-1} from a_i.\n\nThis is equivalent to: we can add any multiple of the vector (0,...,0,1,-1,0,...,0) (with the 1 at position i-1 and -1 at position i) to the array. The set of achievable vectors is the set of vectors that are congruent to the original vector modulo the lattice generated by these vectors. The lattice is the set of vectors with entries that sum to 0? Actually, the generators have sum 0. Moreover, the differences between consecutive elements can be adjusted arbitrarily? \n\nActually, the invariant: the value of a_1 remains fixed? And the entire array must be such that the gcd of the entire array must divide a_1? But also, we can change the array arbitrarily as long as the linear combination of the entire array (with coefficients 1 for the first element and 0 for the others) remains fixed? Actually, the operation does not change the sum of the entire array? \n\nWait: \n  Operation: subtract a_{i-1} from a_i. Then the total sum becomes: \n      a_1 + ... + a_{i-1} + (a_i - a_{i-1}) + ... = (a_1 + ... + a_n) - a_{i-1}\n  So the total sum is not invariant.\n\nBut note: the operation subtracts a_{i-1} from a_i, so the total sum decreases by a_{i-1}. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the operation is linear and the generators are the vectors e_i - e_{i-1} for i from 2 to n? Actually, the operation subtracts the previous element from the current, so the vector is: at position i-1: -1, at position i: +1? Actually, no: we subtract a_{i-1} from a_i, so the change is: \n   a_{i-1} remains the same? \n   a_i becomes a_i - a_{i-1}\n\nSo the vector of changes: \n   at position i-1: 0? \n   at position i: -a_{i-1}? \n\nThat is not linear in the vector of a's? It is linear? Actually, the operation is linear: \n   We are subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i, so the change vector is: \n        v = (0,0,...,0, -1 at position i-1, 1 at position i) ? \n   But wait: we are subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i, so we are adding -a_{i-1} to a_i and leaving a_{i-1} unchanged? \n\nActually, the operation is: \n   (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{i-1}, a_i, ...) -> (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}, ...)\n\nSo the change vector: \n   at position i: -a_{i-1} \n   and the other positions are unchanged? \n\nBut note: a_{i-1} is not changed. So the operation is linear? Actually, it is affine? \n\nBut we can do it any number of times. So the set of achievable vectors is the set of vectors that can be obtained by the original vector by subtracting multiples of the vectors: \n   For each i from 2 to n, we have a vector that subtracts 1 from a_i and adds 1 to ...? Actually, no: the operation does not add to any other element. \n\nAlternatively, we can write the operation as: \n   We are allowed to add any multiple of the vector that has -1 at position i-1 and 0 elsewhere? No, because we subtract a_{i-1} from a_i, and a_{i-1} is the current value at i-1. \n\nThis is nonlinear because the amount we subtract depends on the current value at i-1. \n\nTherefore, we must use a different approach.\n\nKnown solution from Codeforces for the same problem (problem B of Codeforces Round 713 (Div. 3)): \n\n  We can simulate backwards? \n\n  We note that the last element a_n can be reduced to 0 only if a_{n-1} divides a_n? But then we set a_n = 0, and then a_{n-1} must be reduced to 0 by a_{n-2}? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      We can make the entire array zero from right to left. \n\n      For i from n down to 2:\n          a_i must be >= a_{i-1}? Actually, we can subtract multiple times, so we can reduce a_i to a_i mod a_{i-1}. But then we have to use the new value for a_{i-1} to reduce the next? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n      We can make the array [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] such that a_i=0 for i>=2 if and only if the gcd of the entire array is the same as the gcd of the first element? \n\n  Actually, the known solution is:\n\n      Let g = a_1\n      for i in range(2, n+1):\n          g = gcd(g, a_i)\n          if g != a_1:\n              break\n\n      Then if g == a_1, then YES, else NO? \n\n  But wait: in the sample [5,10]: \n        g = gcd(5,10)=5, which equals a_1 -> YES.\n\n  In the sample [1,2,3]:\n        g = gcd(1,2)=1, then gcd(1,3)=1 -> YES.\n\n  But what about [2,3]? \n        g = gcd(2,3)=1, but a_1=2 -> 1 != 2 -> NO.\n\n  However, [2,3] can be reduced? \n        Operation on index2: [2,3] -> [2, 3-2] = [2,1]\n        Then operation on index2: [2,1] -> [2, 1-2] = [2,-1] -> negative? \n        Then we can do: [2, -1] -> [2, -1-2] = [2,-3] ... we never get 0? \n\n  Actually, we can only subtract a positive number? The problem says: the array consists of positive integers. And the operation: we subtract a_{i-1} from a_i. But if a_i < a_{i-1}, then we get negative? \n\n  The problem does not say we cannot have negative numbers. But the input is positive integers and the operation might produce negative? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"choose an index i (2<=i<=n), and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\". So we are replacing a_i by a_i - a_{i-1}. \n\n  We can do repeatedly: we can subtract a_{i-1} multiple times? Actually, we can do one operation at a time. \n\n  For [2,3]:\n        Step1: [2, 3-2] = [2,1] -> positive.\n        Step2: [2, 1] -> we can subtract a_1 (which is 2) from a_2: [2, 1-2] = [2,-1] -> negative.\n\n  But then we can do: \n        Step3: subtract a_1 (which is 2) from a_2 again: [2, -1-2] = [2,-3] -> more negative.\n\n  We never get 0? \n\n  However, note: we can also do operations on other indices? But there is no other index in [2,3]. \n\n  So [2,3] cannot be reduced to [2,0]? \n\n  Therefore, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n      We can make the array such that a_i=0 for all i>=2 if and only if the first element divides every element in the array? \n\n  But wait: [1,2,3] works because 1 divides 2 and 3? \n\n  However, in [1,2,3] we did not require that 2 and 3 are divisible by 1? They are. \n\n  But [2,3] fails because 2 does not divide 3? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      [2,3] -> [2,1] (by subtracting 2 from 3 once) -> then we can subtract 1 from 2? But we cannot because the operation is only on index i>=2. So we can only change a_2 by subtracting a_1 (which is 2) from a_2. We cannot change a_1. \n\n  So to make a_2=0, we must subtract a_1 (which is 2) from a_2 until it becomes 0. But 1 is not divisible by 2? \n\n  Therefore, the condition is: for each i from 2 to n, a_i must be divisible by a_1? \n\n  But what about [3, 6, 10]? \n        a_1=3, a_2=6 -> divisible by 3 -> we can make a_2=0 by subtracting 3 twice.\n        Then we have [3,0,10]. Now we can change a_3: subtract a_2 (which is 0) from a_3? That doesn't change a_3. So we cannot make a_3=0? \n\n  Therefore, we must change a_3 before we zero out a_2? \n\n        Step1: change a_3: subtract a_2 (6) from a_3: [3,6,10-6]=[3,6,4]\n        Step2: change a_2: subtract a_1 (3) from a_2: [3,3,4]\n        Step3: change a_3: subtract a_2 (3) from a_3: [3,3,1]\n        Step4: change a_2: subtract a_1 (3) from a_2: [3,0,1]\n        Then we are stuck.\n\n  So [3,6,10] should be \"NO\". \n\n  How do we check [3,6,10]? \n\n  The condition: we require that every element is divisible by the first element? Then 10 is not divisible by 3 -> NO.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is: \n        For each test case, we check that for every element a_i (i>=1) we have a_i % a_1 == 0? \n        But note: the first element a_1 is fixed. We can change the other elements arbitrarily? But we cannot change the first element.\n\n  However, we can change the other elements arbitrarily as long as we leave the first element fixed? And we can change the other elements by subtracting multiples of the first element? But also we can change the third element by subtracting multiples of the second element (which might have been changed by subtracting multiples of the first element). \n\n  But note: if we change the second element to 0, then the third element becomes fixed? \n\n  Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the first element must divide every element in the array? \n\n  Why? \n      For the second element: we can subtract a_1 any number of times -> so we can make a_2 become a_2 mod a_1? But we want 0, so we require that a_2 mod a_1 must be 0? i.e., a_1 divides a_2.\n\n      For the third element: we can subtract a_2 (which we can change arbitrarily as long as it is a multiple of a_1) any number of times. So we can make a_3 become a_3 mod (multiple of a_1) -> which is equivalent to a_3 mod a_1? Then we require that a_3 mod a_1 must be 0? \n\n  Therefore, the condition is that a_1 must divide every element in the array.\n\n  But what about [1,2,3]? \n        2 % 1 == 0? (because 1 divides 2) -> but 2 % 1 is 0? Actually, any number mod 1 is 0? \n        Similarly, 3 % 1 == 0.\n\n  And [2,3]: \n        3 % 2 = 1 != 0 -> NO.\n\n  And [3,6,10]:\n        6 % 3 = 0 -> okay, but 10 % 3 = 1 != 0 -> NO.\n\n  Therefore, the function `diff_ops` is correct? \n\n  However, note: the function `diff_ops` only checks for i from 1 to len(arr)-1: \n        result = result and (arr[i] % arr[0] == 0)\n\n  But what if the first element changes? Actually, the first element never changes. \n\n  But wait: what if we have [4, 6]? \n        Step1: subtract 4 from 6: [4,2]\n        Step2: subtract 4 from 2: [4, -2] -> negative? \n        Then we can subtract -2 from 4? But we cannot because we can only subtract from indices>=2? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            [4,6] -> [4,2] (by subtracting 4 once from 6)\n            Then we can subtract 2 from 4? But we cannot because the operation is only on indices>=2? We can only change a_2 by subtracting a_1 (which is 4) from a_2? \n            Then [4,2] -> [4, 2-4] = [4,-2] -> negative.\n\n        But note: we can also do:\n            [4,6] -> [4,2] -> then we can change a_2 again: subtract 4 from 2: [4, -2] -> then we can change a_2 again: subtract 4 from -2: [4,-6] -> ... we never get 0.\n\n        However, we can do:\n            [4,6] -> [4,2] -> then we can change a_1? No, we cannot.\n\n        So [4,6] should be NO? \n        But 6 % 4 = 2 != 0 -> NO.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is to check that every element is divisible by the first element.\n\n  However, consider [4, 8, 10]:\n        a_1=4, a_2=8 -> divisible by 4 -> we can make a_2=0 by subtracting 4 twice.\n        Then we have [4,0,10]. Then we cannot change a_3? because we subtract a_2 (0) from a_3 -> no change. So we cannot make a_3=0? \n        But 10 % 4 = 2 != 0 -> NO.\n\n  So the condition holds.\n\n  But what about [4, 8, 12]? \n        a_1=4, a_2=8 -> divisible by 4 -> set to 0.\n        a_3=12 -> divisible by 4 -> set to 0? \n        How? \n          Step1: set a_3: subtract a_2 (8) from a_3: [4,8,4] \n          Step2: set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2: [4,4,4] \n          Step3: set a_3: subtract a_2 (4) from a_3: [4,4,0]\n          Step4: set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2: [4,0,0]\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Condition: 8%4==0, 12%4==0 -> YES.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is to check that every element is divisible by the first element.\n\n  However, note: what if the first element is not the smallest? \n        [3, 1] -> \n            We cannot change a_2 by subtracting a_1 (3) from a_2 (1) because that would make -2? \n            But we can change a_2 first? We have to: we can only change a_2 by subtracting a_1? \n            So we get [3,1-3] = [3,-2] -> then we can subtract -2 from 3? No, we can only change indices>=2.\n\n        So [3,1] should be NO? \n        Condition: 1 % 3 != 0 -> NO.\n\n  Therefore, the function `diff_ops` is correct.\n\n  But note: the problem says the array consists of positive integers. The operations might produce negative? But the condition for divisibility: \n        We require that for each i, a_i is divisible by a_1? \n        But if a_i < a_1, then a_i % a_1 = a_i != 0 -> NO.\n\n  So the solution is: \n        For each test case, we read n and the array of n integers.\n        Then we check for i from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed: index1 to last) that arr[i] % arr[0] == 0.\n\n  However, note: the array might change? But the condition is on the initial array? \n\n  But the problem: we are allowed to perform the operations any number of times. The condition we deduced is that the first element must divide every element in the array (at the beginning) because the first element remains fixed and the others must become 0 by subtracting multiples of the first element? \n\n  Actually, we can change the other elements arbitrarily? But the operations are: \n        a_i = a_i - k * a_{i-1}   (for any positive integer k) \n        and we can do in any order? \n\n  But note: the value of a_{i-1} might change? So the condition is not only on the initial array? \n\n  However, we have shown that the necessary condition is that the first element must divide every element. And it is also sufficient? \n        Because if every element is divisible by a_1, then we can set the second element to 0 by subtracting a_1 (which is a divisor) the appropriate number of times. Then the third element: we can subtract a_2 (which is 0) any number of times? That doesn't change it. But wait: we must set the third element to 0 before we set the second element to 0? \n\n        Actually, we can set the elements from left to right? \n            We cannot set the second element to 0 until we are done using it for the third? \n\n        So we must set the third element first? \n\n        How? \n            We can subtract a_2 from a_3 arbitrarily many times? But a_2 is divisible by a_1, so we can set a_3 to a_3 mod a_2? But we want a_3 to be divisible by a_1? \n\n        Actually, we can set the array from right to left? \n\n        Step1: for the last element a_n: we can subtract a_{n-1} any number of times? So we can set a_n to the remainder when divided by a_{n-1}. But we want a_n to become 0? So we require that a_{n-1} divides a_n? \n\n        But note: a_{n-1} is divisible by a_1? and a_n is divisible by a_1? but that does not imply that a_{n-1} divides a_n? \n\n        Example: [4,8,12] -> we set a_3: subtract a_2 (8) from a_3 (12) until we get 4? Then we have [4,8,4]. Then we set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2 (8) until we get 0? Then we have [4,0,4]. Then we set a_3: subtract a_2 (0) from a_3 (4) -> no change. \n\n        But wait: we can set a_3 to 0? \n            We can set a_3 to 0 only if we subtract 4 from a_3? But we cannot subtract a_2 (which is 0) from a_3? \n\n        How did we do it in the example above? \n            We did: \n                [4,8,12] -> subtract a_2 (8) from a_3: [4,8,4] \n                then subtract a_2 (8) again? But we already did? \n            Actually, we then set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2: [4,4,4] \n            then set a_3: subtract a_2 (4) from a_3: [4,4,0] \n            then set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2: [4,0,0]\n\n        So we did not set the last element first? \n\n        Therefore, the condition that every element is divisible by the first element is sufficient? \n\n        Why? \n            We can set the entire array to multiples of a_1? \n            Then we can set the array from the last element to the first? \n                We want to set a_n to 0: we can subtract a_{n-1} (which is a multiple of a_1) from a_n (which is a multiple of a_1) until a_n becomes 0? \n                But we require that a_{n-1} divides a_n? \n\n            However, we don't require that: we can do multiple subtractions? \n\n            Actually, we can use the Euclidean algorithm: \n                We can reduce a_n to gcd(a_{n-1}, a_n) by repeated subtractions? \n                But we want 0, not the gcd? \n\n            We can do: \n                while a_n >= a_{n-1}:\n                    a_n -= a_{n-1}\n                then we get a_n mod a_{n-1}\n\n            Then we swap the roles? \n\n        But note: we can also change a_{n-1}? \n\n        Actually, we can do the operations in any order? \n\n        We can use a strategy: \n            Step1: set a_2 to 0? \n            Then we cannot use a_2 to change a_3? \n\n        Therefore, we must set the elements from right to left? \n\n        Algorithm: \n            for i from n down to 2:\n                subtract a_{i-1} from a_i until a_i becomes 0? \n                But we require that a_{i-1} divides a_i? \n\n            Then the condition is: for i from n down to 2, a_{i-1} divides a_i? \n\n        But the first element remains? \n\n        Example [4,8,12]:\n            i=3: we require that a_2 (8) divides a_3 (12)? -> 12 % 8 != 0 -> fails.\n\n        But we made it work? \n\n        How? \n            We did not set a_3 to 0 in one step? We set it to 4 first? \n\n        Actually, we can do: \n            a_3 = 12 - 8 = 4 (so we did one subtraction)\n            Then we set a_2: subtract a_1 (4) from a_2: 8-4=4 -> then a_2=4\n            Then we set a_3: subtract a_2 (4) from a_3: 4-4=0.\n\n        So we did not require that 8 divides 12? \n\n        Therefore, the condition that the first element divides every element is sufficient? \n\n        Why? \n            We can reduce any element that is divisible by a_1 to 0 by a sequence of subtractions? \n\n        How? \n            We can reduce the entire array to an array where every element is a multiple of a_1 and nonnegative? \n            Then we can reduce the array from the last element to the first? \n                We reduce a_n to 0 by subtracting a_{n-1} repeatedly? But we require that a_{n-1} divides a_n? \n\n            But note: we can also reduce a_{n-1} to 0 first? \n\n        Actually, we can use a recursive procedure? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the entire array is in the ideal generated by a_1? And since a_1 divides every element, then we can represent every element as a multiple of a_1. Then we can set the second element to 0 by subtracting a_1 the appropriate number of times? Then the third element: we can subtract a_2 (which is 0) any number of times? That doesn't work. \n\n        But we can set the third element to 0 by subtracting a_1 the appropriate number of times? \n            However, the operation for the third element is: subtract a_2 from a_3. But a_2 is 0, so we cannot change a_3. \n\n        Therefore, we must set the third element to 0 before we set the second element to 0? \n\n        How? \n            We can subtract a_2 (which is initially a multiple of a_1) from a_3 (which is a multiple of a_1) arbitrarily many times? \n            But we can only subtract multiples of a_1? \n            Then we can reduce a_3 to a_3 mod a_2? But we want 0? \n\n        We can use the Euclidean algorithm: \n            We can reduce a_3 to gcd(a_2, a_3) by repeated subtractions? \n            But we want 0, not the gcd? \n\n        Actually, we can reduce a_3 to 0 if and only if a_2 divides a_3? \n\n        But in [4,8,12]: \n            Initially, a_2=8, a_3=12 -> 8 does not divide 12? \n            But we reduced a_3 to 4 (by subtracting 8 once) and then reduced a_2 to 4 (by subtracting 4 once) and then reduced a_3 to 0 (by subtracting 4 once). \n\n        How did we reduce a_3 to 4? \n            We did one operation: a_3 = 12 - 8 = 4.\n\n        How did we reduce a_2 to 4? \n            We did one operation: a_2 = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\n        How did we reduce a_3 to 0? \n            We did one operation: a_3 = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\n        So we did not use the Euclidean algorithm in the traditional sense? \n\n        Therefore, the condition that the first element divides every element is not sufficient? \n\n        But note: we can change the values arbitrarily? \n\n        We can use a greedy algorithm from right to left: \n            For i from n down to 2:\n                We want to reduce a_i to 0 by subtracting a_{i-1} repeatedly? \n                But we can also change a_{i-1} by operations on index i-1? \n\n        Actually, we can change a_{i-1} arbitrarily before we start on a_i? \n\n        So the algorithm: \n            We can set the array from right to left? \n            For i from n down to 2:\n                We reduce a_i to the remainder when divided by a_{i-1}? \n                But then we have to reduce a_{i-1} to something? \n\n        This is the Euclidean algorithm for the entire array? \n\n        The Euclidean algorithm for gcd: \n            gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = g \n        and then we can reduce every element to a multiple of g? \n\n        But we want to reduce the elements to 0? \n\n        The known solution from Codeforces for this problem is: \n            We can make the array such that a_i=0 for i>=2 if and only if the first element is the gcd of the entire array? \n\n        Why? \n            Because the operations allow us to do the Euclidean algorithm? \n            And the gcd remains invariant? \n\n        Let's check: \n            Operation: (a_{i-1}, a_i) -> (a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}) \n            The gcd of the entire array: \n                gcd(..., a_{i-1}, a_i, ...) = gcd(..., a_{i-1}, a_i - a_{i-1}, ...) \n            So the gcd is invariant.\n\n            At the end, we have a_1 = g, and a_i=0 for i>=2. \n            The gcd of the final array is g. \n            Therefore, the gcd of the initial array must be g = a_1.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is: \n            For each test case, compute g = gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)\n            Then check if g == a_1.\n\n        Why is this sufficient? \n            Because we can use the Euclidean algorithm in reverse order? \n            We can reduce the array to [g,0,0,...,0]? \n\n        How? \n            We can reduce the array to an array where the first element is g and the others are 0? \n\n        Steps: \n            We can reduce the entire array to an array where every element is a multiple of g? \n            Then we can reduce the elements from right to left: \n                For i from n down to 2:\n                    We reduce a_i to 0 by repeatedly subtracting g? \n                    But how? \n                        We can set a_i to 0 by doing: \n                            while a_i > 0:\n                                a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}\n                        But this might not be efficient? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the fact that the gcd is g and the first element is g, then we can reduce the second element to 0 by subtracting g repeatedly? \n            Then the third element: we can reduce it to 0 by subtracting g repeatedly? \n\n            But the operation for the third element is: subtract a_2 (which is 0) from a_3? That doesn't work. \n\n        Therefore, we must reduce the array from the last element to the second element? \n\n        We can do: \n            For i from n down to 2:\n                We reduce a_i to 0 by repeatedly subtracting a_{i-1} (which at the time of reduction should be g) until a_i becomes 0? \n                But then we require that g divides a_i? \n\n            And since the gcd is g, then g divides every element? \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            g = a_1   (because the first element remains a_1, and at the end the first element must be g)\n\n        But wait: the first element never changes? \n            The operations are only on indices>=2, so a_1 never changes. \n            Therefore, we require that a_1 = g.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is: \n            For each test case, \n                read n, then the array a of n integers.\n                compute g = gcd(a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1])\n                if a[0] == g:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let's test with the samples:\n\n          Sample1: [5,10] -> g = gcd(5,10)=5, a[0]=5 -> YES.\n          Sample2: [1,2,3] -> g = gcd(1,2,3)=1, a[0]=1 -> YES.\n          Sample3: [2,3] -> g = gcd(2,3)=1, a[0]=2 -> 2!=1 -> NO.\n\n        But what about [4,8,12]? \n            g = gcd(4,8,12)=4, a[0]=4 -> YES.\n\n        And [3,6,10]? \n            g = gcd(3,6,10)=1, a[0]=3 -> 3!=1 -> NO.\n\n        And [4,6]? \n            g = gcd(4,6)=2, a[0]=4 -> 4!=2 -> NO.\n\n        And [4,8,10]? \n            g = gcd(4,8,10)=2, a[0]=4 -> 4!=2 -> NO.\n\n        And [4,8,12] works.\n\n        But what about [6, 9]? \n            g = gcd(6,9)=3, a[0]=6 -> 6!=3 -> NO.\n\n        How can we reduce [6,9]? \n            Step1: subtract 6 from 9: [6,3]\n            Step2: subtract 6 from 3: [6,-3] -> negative? \n            Then we can continue: [6,-3-6]=[6,-9] -> ...\n\n        Or: \n            [6,9] -> [6,3] (by one subtraction)\n            Then we can change the first element? No.\n            Then we can change the second element: subtract 6 from 3: [6,-3] -> then we are stuck.\n\n        So [6,9] cannot be reduced to [6,0]? \n\n        Therefore, the solution is to check that the first element equals the gcd of the entire array.\n\n  However, note the sample [1,2,3] has gcd=1 and a_0=1 -> YES.\n\n  But what if the array is [2,4,6]? \n        g = gcd(2,4,6)=2, a_0=2 -> YES.\n\n        How to reduce:\n            Step1: reduce a_3: subtract a_2 (4) from a_3 (6): [2,4,2]\n            Step2: reduce a_2: subtract a_1 (2) from a_2 (4): [2,2,2]\n            Step3: reduce a_3: subtract a_2 (2) from a_3 (2): [2,2,0]\n            Step4: reduce a_2: subtract a_1 (2) from a_2 (2): [2,0,0]\n\n  Therefore, we change the function `diff_ops` to:\n\n        def diff_ops(arr):\n            import math\n            from functools import reduce\n            g = reduce(math.gcd, arr)\n            return g == arr[0]\n\n  But wait: what if the array is [4, 8, 12]? \n        g = 4, and arr[0]=4 -> YES.\n\n  But what if the array is [12, 4, 8]? \n        We want to reduce a_2 and a_3 to 0? \n        g = gcd(12,4,8)=4, but arr[0]=12 -> 12!=4 -> NO.\n\n        How to reduce [12,4,8]? \n            We can change a_2: subtract a_1 (12) from a_2 (4): [12,4-12,8] = [12,-8,8]\n            Then change a_3: subtract a_2 (-8) from a_3 (8): [12,-8,8-(-8)]=[12,-8,16]\n            Then change a_3: subtract a_2 (-8) from a_3 (16): [12,-8,24] -> ... \n\n        Or change a_3 first: \n            [12,4,8] -> [12,4,8-4]=[12,4,4]\n            then change a_2: [12,4-12,4]=[12,-8,4]\n            then change a_3: [12,-8,4-(-8)]=[12,-8,12] -> ...\n\n        Or: \n            [12,4,8] -> [12,4,4] (by subtracting 4 from 8 once)\n            then [12,4,4] -> [12,4,0] (by subtracting 4 from 4 once) -> then we have [12,4,0]\n            then change a_2: [12,4-12,0]=[12,-8,0] -> then we are stuck.\n\n        So we cannot make a_2=0? \n\n        Therefore, [12,4,8] should be NO.\n\n  So the solution is: \n        For each test case, compute g = gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)\n        and then check if a_1 == g.\n\n  But note: the first element is fixed, and the gcd of the entire array must be the first element.\n\n  Therefore, we change the code in program2.py:\n\n        We replace the function `diff_ops` with one that computes the gcd of the entire array and checks if it equals the first element.\n\n  However, the problem says: the array consists of positive integers.\n\n  Code for program2.py:\n\n        import sys\n        import math\n        from functools import reduce\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            t = int(data[0])\n            index = 1\n            results = []\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n                arr = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n                index += n\n                g = reduce(math.gcd, arr)\n                if arr[0] == g:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n\n  But the provided code structure is:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def diff_ops(arr):\n            result = True\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n            return result\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n            len_input = len(input_arr)\n            n = input_arr[0]\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            for case in test_cases:\n                print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n  We are to complete the TODO.\n\n  The TODO: we are reading multiple test cases.\n\n        The first integer is t (the number of test cases), but in the provided code, the first integer is read as `n = input_arr[0]` (which is t) and then we are in a while loop.\n\n        We should read t test cases.\n\n        Each test case: \n            first integer: n (the length of the array)\n            then n integers: the array\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr_i = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                pos += n_i\n                test_cases.append(arr_i)\n\n  But note: the variable `n` is already used for the number of test cases? Actually, the first integer is stored in `n` (which is the number of test cases). Then we are in the while loop.\n\n  However, the variable `n` is set to input_arr[0] (which is t). Then we are reading the next integers.\n\n  So the code for the TODO:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr_val)\n\n  But then we use the function `diff_ops` on each test case? \n\n  However, we have changed the condition to use the gcd method? \n\n  We have two options:\n      Option1: change the function `diff_ops` to use the gcd condition.\n      Option2: leave the function `diff_ops` as is and hope that the condition (every element divisible by the first) is equivalent to the gcd condition? \n\n  But they are not equivalent: \n      In the gcd condition: [4,8,12] -> YES, and in the divisibility condition: \n          8 % 4==0, 12 % 4==0 -> YES.\n      In [1,2,3]: 2%1==0, 3%1==0 -> YES.\n      In [2,3]: 3%2 !=0 -> NO.\n\n      But in [12,4,8]: \n          divisibility: 4 % 12 = 4 !=0 -> NO -> matches the gcd condition (which also says NO because 12 != gcd(12,4,8)=4).\n\n      In [6,9]: \n          9 % 6 = 3 !=0 -> NO -> matches.\n\n      In [3,6,10]:\n          6%3=0, 10%3=1 !=0 -> NO -> matches.\n\n      In [4,6]:\n          6%4=2 !=0 -> NO -> matches.\n\n      In [2,4,6]: \n          4%2=0, 6%2=0 -> YES -> and gcd=2, a0=2 -> YES.\n\n      In [4,8,12]: \n          8%4=0, 12%4=0 -> YES -> and gcd=4, a0=4 -> YES.\n\n      In [1,1,1]: \n          1%1=0, 1%1=0 -> YES -> and gcd=1, a0=1 -> YES.\n\n      In [1,2]: \n          2%1=0 -> YES -> and gcd=1, a0=1 -> YES.\n\n      In [2,4]: \n          4%2=0 -> YES -> and gcd=2, a0=2 -> YES.\n\n      In [3,6,9]: \n          6%3=0, 9%3=0 -> YES -> and gcd=3, a0=3 -> YES.\n\n      In [3,6,9,12]: \n          same.\n\n      In [3,6,8]: \n          6%3=0, 8%3=2 -> NO -> and gcd: gcd(3,6,8)=1, a0=3 -> 3!=1 -> NO.\n\n      Therefore, the two conditions are equivalent? \n\n      Why? \n          If the first element a0 divides every element, then the gcd of the array is gcd(a0, a1, ..., an) = gcd(a0, 0,0,...,0) = a0? \n          But wait: gcd(a0, a1, a2) = gcd(a0, gcd(a1,a2)) and if a0 divides a1 and a2, then gcd(a1,a2) is a divisor of a0? and then gcd(a0, gcd(a1,a2)) = gcd(a1,a2)? \n\n          Example: a0=4, a1=8, a2=12: \n              gcd(4,8,12)=4, which equals a0.\n\n          Example: a0=3, a1=6, a2=9: gcd=3.\n\n          Example: a0=1, a1=2, a2=3: gcd=1.\n\n          Example: a0=2, a1=4, a2=6: gcd=2.\n\n          Example: a0=12, a1=4, a2=8: \n              Condition: 4%12=4 !=0 -> fails, so we don't even compute the gcd? \n\n          But if the condition holds (every element divisible by a0), then the gcd is a0? \n              Because the gcd must be a divisor of a0, and a0 is in the array? so the gcd is at least gcd(a0, a0) = a0? and since it divides a0, it is a0.\n\n          Conversely, if the gcd is a0, then a0 divides every element? \n              Because the gcd divides every element, and the gcd is a0.\n\n          Therefore, the two conditions are equivalent.\n\n      So we can keep the function `diff_ops` as is.\n\n  Therefore, we only need to complete the TODO in the main function of program2.py.\n\n  Summary:\n\n  For program1.py: \n      In the dijkstra function, we fill the TODO with:\n          continue\n\n  For program2.py:\n      In the while loop, we do:\n          n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n          arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n          pos += n_val\n          test_cases.append(arr_val)\n\n  But note: the variable `n` is already used for the number of test cases (which is the first integer). \n\n  The code:\n\n      input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n      len_input = len(input_arr)\n      n = input_arr[0]   # n is the number of test cases\n      test_cases = []\n      pos = 1\n      while pos <= len_input - 1:\n          n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n          arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n          pos += n_val\n          test_cases.append(arr_val)\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the while condition: while pos <= len_input - 1\n\n  Example: \n      Input: \"2\\n2\\n5 10\\n3\\n1 2 3\"\n      input_arr = [2, 2, 5, 10, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n      n = 2\n      pos=1\n          n_val = input_arr[1]=2 -> then arr_val = input_arr[2:4] = [5,10] -> pos becomes 4\n          then n_val = input_arr[4]=3 -> arr_val = input_arr[5:8] = [1,2,3] -> pos becomes 8 -> then pos=8, len_input=8 -> condition: 8<=7? false.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  But what if there is only one test case? \n      Input: \"1\\n2\\n5 10\"\n      input_arr = [1,2,5,10]\n      n=1\n      pos=1\n          n_val = input_arr[1]=2 -> then arr_val = input_arr[2:4] = [5,10] -> pos=4 -> then 4<=3? false.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      For program1.py: the missing code is \"continue\" (without quotes) for the TODO in the dijkstra function.\n\n      For program2.py: the missing code is the while loop body.\n\n  However, note the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n  We output in JSON format: \n      {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is only the line \"continue\", but note the indentation? \n\n  The TODO is inside an if block:\n\n        if dist[v] < c:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO comment with \"continue\", so the two lines become:\n\n        if dist[v] < c:\n            continue\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the exact code that is missing? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only missing one line.\n\n  But note: the provided code for program1.py has a dijkstra function that is partially implemented. We are only missing one line.\n\n  For program2.py, we are missing the body of the while loop.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"            continue\"\n        (with 12 spaces at the beginning to match the indentation? But the original code uses 4 spaces per level? \n         The code has:\n            if dist[v] < c:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n         The TODO is indented by 8 spaces? Then we replace the TODO comment with \"continue\", which should be at the same indentation level? \n         Actually, the TODO comment is at the same level as the next line? \n\n         The code:\n\n            if dist[v] < c:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n         We replace the comment with \"continue\", so the two lines become:\n\n            if dist[v] < c:\n                continue\n\n         So the missing code is the line \"continue\", and we must output it with the same indentation as the comment? \n\n         The original code has 8 spaces for the inner block? \n\n         We output: \"        continue\" (with 8 spaces) or \"            continue\" (with 12 spaces)? \n\n         Looking at the provided code: \n\n            while hp:\n                cv=heappop(hp)\n                c, v = cv//B,cv%B\n                if dist[v] < c:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n         The while loop is indented by 4, the if is indented by 8, and the TODO is indented by 12? \n\n         Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level. \n\n         So the if block is at 8 spaces, and the TODO comment is at 12 spaces.\n\n         We output: \"            continue\" (with 12 spaces: 3 levels * 4 spaces = 12) \n\n      program2: the missing code is:\n\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr_val)\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is already there. We are only missing the body.\n\n        The indentation: the while loop is at the same level as the previous lines? \n\n        The code:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO comment with the three lines? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the three lines of code (with the same indentation as the TODO comment).\n\n        The TODO comment is at 8 spaces? (because the while is at 4, and the body is at 8)\n\n        So we output:\n\n            \"        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\\n        arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n        pos += n_val\\n        test_cases.append(arr_val)\"\n\n        But note: the original code has a while loop and we are replacing the TODO with 4 lines? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block.\n\n  But wait: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in JSON.\n\n  We must be careful with newlines and quotes.\n\n  We can use:\n\n      \"program1\": \"            continue\",\n      \"program2\": \"        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\\n        arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n        pos += n_val\\n        test_cases.append(arr_val)\"\n\n  However, in JSON, we must escape the newline as \"\\\\n\" and the quotes? \n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact escaping. Since we are writing a string in JSON, we can use \\n and it will be escaped by the JSON serializer? \n\n  But we are writing a string that will be parsed as JSON. \n\n  Alternatively, we can write the program2 part as a single string with embedded newlines? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing, not the entire program.\n\n  We output in JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"            continue\",\n        \"program2\": \"        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\\n        arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n        pos += n_val\\n        test_cases.append(arr_val)\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 part has 4 lines. We use \\n to separate them.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output only the JSON.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", but then we are to output in JSON with two keys.\n\n  Therefore, we output the JSON as described.\n\n  Let me write the exact strings:\n\n      program1: the missing line is \"            continue\" (with 12 spaces)\n\n      program2: the missing block is:\n\n        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n        pos += n_val\n        test_cases.append(arr_val)\n\n        and we represent it as a string with newlines: \"        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\\n        arr_val = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n        pos += n_val\\n        test_cases.append(arr_val)\"\n\n  But note: the original code in program2.py has the while loop:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with the four lines? \n\n  However, the TODO is one line? We are replacing it with four lines.\n\n  Therefore, we output the four lines as the completion for program2.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so a block is acceptable.\n\n  We are done."
