    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe current code sets up a 11x11 grid (since letters from 'a' to 'k' are 11 letters) to count the frequency of each two-letter string.\nThen, it iterates over the grid and for each cell (j,k) it does two loops: one over l (for the first letter) and one over l (for the second letter) but the current code has two separate if conditions and only one of them is filled.\n\nThe problem: We are to count pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. That means either:\n  1. The first letter is the same and the second letter is different, OR\n  2. The second letter is the same and the first letter is different.\n\nBut note: the current code already has a loop that does:\n   for j in range(11):\n      for k in range(11):\n          for l in range(11):\n              if j != l:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              if k != l:\n                  answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nThis is incorrect because:\n  - The first condition (if j != l) is not used to add anything (currently just a TODO).\n  - The second condition (if k != l) adds pairs that have the same first letter (j) and different second letters (k and l). This is one of the two cases.\n\nWe are missing the other case: same second letter and different first letter.\n\nSo we should have:\n  For the same first letter (j fixed) and different second letters (k and l): we are already doing that in the second if (with k != l) and we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] for each l != k.\n\n  For the same second letter (k fixed) and different first letters (j and m): we need to do a similar loop but over m (for the first letter) and then add data[j][k] * data[m][k] for each m != j.\n\nHowever, note that the current nested loops are three levels: j, k, l. We are iterating l from 0 to 10 for each (j,k). We can use the same loop to do both cases? But the current structure is:\n\n  for j in range(11):\n    for k in range(11):\n      for l in range(11):\n        if j != l:   # This condition is on j and l? But l is being used as an index for the first letter? Actually, wait: the inner loops are using l as a loop variable for both the first and second letter? That is confusing.\n\nActually, the current code uses l for two different purposes? Let me clarify:\n\nThe grid: data[first][second] = count.\n\nIn the inner loop, we have:\n   for l in range(11):\n      if j != l:   # here j and l are both indices for the first letter? Then we are considering two different first letters? But then we are not using k? \n\nBut then the next if:\n   if k != l:   # here k and l are indices for the second letter? Then we are considering same first letter j and different second letters.\n\nSo the variable l is being reused for two different meanings in the same loop? That is not right.\n\nWe should separate the two cases:\n\nCase 1: same first letter, different second letter.\n   For a fixed j (first letter) and fixed k (second letter), we want to count all pairs that have first letter j and second letter k with all other strings that have first letter j and second letter != k. So for each (j,k), we can do:\n        for l in range(11):\n            if l != k:\n                answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: this counts each pair twice? Because when we are at (j,k) and then at (j,l) we will count the pair ( (j,k) and (j,l) ) when we are at (j,k) and then again when we are at (j,l) and l'=k? Actually, no: because for a fixed j, we are iterating k and then l. The pair ( (j,k) and (j,l) ) is counted once: when we are at (j,k) and l (which is the other second letter) and then we multiply data[j][k] * data[j][l]. But then when we are at (j,l) and k'=k, we will do the same? So we are counting each pair twice? \n\nBut note: the problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j. So if we count each pair twice (once for the first string being at (j,k) and the second at (j,l) and once for the first string at (j,l) and the second at (j,k)), that would be overcounting. However, the problem requires that i<j. But our counting does not enforce i<j? We are just multiplying counts. Actually, the product data[j][k] * data[j][l] for k != l counts every unordered pair of two distinct strings in the group (j,*) that have different second letters? But note: if we have three strings: s1, s2, s3 all with first letter j and second letters a, b, a. Then for (s1, s2): \n   when k = a (for s1) and l = b: we add 1 (because s1 and s2) -> but also when k = a (for s3) and l = b: we add 1 (for s3 and s2). \n   Also, for (s1, s3): they have the same second letter? so they are not counted? \n\nBut wait: the same first letter and same second letter? they are not counted because we skip when k==l. \n\nHowever, the problem: the product data[j][k] * data[j][l] for k != l counts every pair of a string with second letter k and a string with second letter l? And that is an unordered pair? Actually, it counts the pair (x,y) where x is in (j,k) and y is in (j,l) and that is one unordered pair? But note: the problem requires i<j. And we are not distinguishing the order? Actually, we are counting every pair (x,y) with x having (j,k) and y having (j,l) regardless of the order? But the condition i<j is taken care of by the fact that we are iterating over the entire set? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require the pairs to be in a particular order? The product data[j][k] * data[j][l] for k != l counts every pair of one string from bin (j,k) and one from bin (j,l). And that is exactly one unordered pair? Actually, no: because if we have two bins: bin1 and bin2, then the number of pairs with one from bin1 and one from bin2 is |bin1| * |bin2|. And that counts each pair once? \n\nBut then why is the answer printed as answer//2? \n\nLooking at the current code: it has an extra factor of 2? \n\nWait, the current code does:\n\n   for j in range(11):\n      for k in range(11):\n          for l in range(11):\n              if k != l:\n                  answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nThis counts for each j, and for each pair of distinct second letters (k,l), the product of the counts. But note: for a fixed j, the total pairs that have the same first letter and different second letters is the sum over k and l (with k < l) of (data[j][k] * data[j][l] + data[j][l] * data[j][k])? Actually, no: because when k and l are distinct, we are adding data[j][k]*data[j][l] and then when we swap k and l? we do the same? Actually, in the inner loop, for a fixed j and k, we iterate l from 0 to 10. For each l != k, we add data[j][k]*data[j][l]. Then when we move to the same j and l (with l now being the k in the outer loop) and then k'=k (the original k) we will add again? \n\nBut note: the outer loops are j and k. For a fixed j, and two distinct second letters k and l, the pair (k,l) is encountered twice: \n   once when k_outer = k and l_inner = l -> add data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n   once when k_outer = l and l_inner = k -> add data[j][l] * data[j][k]\n\nSo we are adding twice the same product? Therefore, the total for the same first letter j is 2 * (sum_{k<l} data[j][k]*data[j][l]). \n\nBut the actual number of pairs for the same first letter j is: \n   total = (sum_{k} data[j][k])\n   and then the number of pairs that have the same first letter and same second letter? we don't want those. We want pairs that have the same first letter and different second letters? \n   = total*(total-1)//2? but that is not the same as the above.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for a fixed j:\n   total = sum_{k} data[j][k]\n   Then the number of pairs that have the same first letter and same second letter? we don't want those. We want pairs that have the same first letter and different second letters? \n   = total*(total-1)//2 - (sum_{k} data[j][k]*(data[j][k]-1)//2) \n   = (total^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2) // 2.\n\nBut note: our current method for the same first letter j: \n   We are adding: for each k: for each l != k: data[j][k]*data[j][l] \n   = for each k: data[j][k] * (total_j - data[j][k])\n   Then the entire sum for j is: sum_{k} [ data[j][k]*(total_j - data[j][k]) ] \n        = total_j * total_j - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2 \n        = total_j^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2.\n\nBut note: this counts every unordered pair (x,y) with x and y having the same first letter j and different second letters? Actually, it counts each pair twice? Because the pair (x,y) is counted once when k is the second letter of x and l is the second letter of y, and then again when k is the second letter of y and l is the second letter of x? \n\nBut wait: no, because in the inner loops we are iterating over k (the second letter of the outer string) and then l (the second letter of the inner string). For a fixed j, and two distinct strings: one with second letter a and one with second letter b, we will count:\n   when k=a and l=b: we add 1 for the pair (a-string, b-string)\n   when k=b and l=a: we add 1 for the pair (b-string, a-string)\n\nBut the problem requires unordered pairs (i<j) so we want each pair only once. Therefore, the current method for the same first letter is overcounting by a factor of 2? \n\nThat is why the program prints answer//2.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case: same second letter and different first letter, we would do the same? and then divide by 2 at the end.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nWe have two cases:\n\nCase 1: same first letter, different second letter. \n   We are currently doing:\n        for j in range(11):\n            for k in range(11):\n                for l in range(11):\n                    if k != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nCase 2: same second letter, different first letter.\n   We need to do:\n        for j in range(11):\n            for k in range(11):\n                for m in range(11):   # m for the first letter\n                    if j != m:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[m][k]\n\nBut note: the current loop variable for the first letter in the outer loops is j. We are already iterating j and k. Then we can use the same inner loop variable l for the first letter? But the current inner loop uses l for the second letter? We have to change the variable? \n\nActually, the current code has a loop for l from 0 to 10. We can use the same loop for both? But we cannot because the two conditions are different.\n\nAlternatively, we can restructure the loops? But the problem says: we must fill in the missing code. The missing code is only in the TODO part.\n\nLooking at the current code:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nWe see that the TODO is inside the inner loop and condition \"if j != l\". We can use that condition to do the second case? \n\nBut note: in the inner loop, l is iterating from 0 to 10. We can interpret l as an index for the first letter? Then we can do:\n\n   if j != l:   # meaning we are considering two different first letters: j and l, and we want to count the pairs that have the same second letter? \n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut wait: in the inner loop, k is fixed? So for a fixed k (second letter) and fixed j (first letter) and then we iterate l over first letters? Then we add data[j][k] * data[l][k] for each l != j? \n\nThat is exactly the second case: same second letter k, and different first letters j and l.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: this will also overcount? Because for two distinct first letters j and l, we will add:\n   when j is fixed and k is fixed and l runs: we add data[j][k] * data[l][k] for each l != j.\n   Then when we come to l (as the outer j) and same k, and then j'=j (the original j) we will add again? \n\nActually, the outer loops are j and k. For a fixed k (second letter) and two distinct first letters j and m, the pair (j,k) and (m,k) is counted:\n   once when j_outer = j, k_outer = k, and l = m -> add data[j][k] * data[m][k]\n   once when j_outer = m, k_outer = k, and l = j -> add data[m][k] * data[j][k]\n\nSo again, we are adding twice. Then at the end we do answer//2.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n   answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nSo the entire inner loop becomes:\n\n   for l in range(11):\n        if j != l:\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n        if k != l:\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the two if conditions are independent. We are doing both cases in the same inner loop.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is just one line: \n   answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the variable l is being used for two different purposes? In the first if, l is an index for the first letter? and in the second if, l is an index for the second letter? \n\nWait, that is a problem. The variable l is the same. In the first if, we are using l as a first letter index? and in the second if, we are using l as a second letter index? \n\nBut the grid is 11x11. The indices for the first letter and second letter are both in [0,10]. So we can use the same l? \n\nBut the meaning: \n   In the first if: we are comparing j (first letter) and l (which we are now interpreting as a first letter) -> that makes sense: we want different first letters? \n   In the second if: we are comparing k (second letter) and l (which we are now interpreting as a second letter) -> that also makes sense.\n\nBut note: the inner loop variable l runs from 0 to 10. We are using it for two different purposes? Actually, we are using it for two different cases. In the first case, we are using l as a first letter index? and in the second case, we are using l as a second letter index? That is acceptable? \n\nYes, because the two cases are independent. However, we must note that the same l value is used for both. But that is okay? \n\nExample: \n   j=0, k=0, l=1: \n        first if: j (0) != l (1) -> true: so we add data[0][0] * data[1][0] -> which is the count for the string (first letter 'a', second letter 'a') and the string (first letter 'b', second letter 'a')? -> same second letter? that's the second case? \n        second if: k (0) != l (1) -> true: so we add data[0][0] * data[0][1] -> which is the count for the string (first letter 'a', second letter 'a') and the string (first letter 'a', second letter 'b')? -> same first letter? that's the first case.\n\nSo both cases are covered.\n\nBut note: the variable l is being used for two different meanings in the same iteration? That is acceptable because the two conditions are independent and we are using the same index for two different dimensions? \n\nActually, the grid is two-dimensional: first letter and second letter. The index l is just a number from 0 to 10. We are using it for:\n   - In the first if: as an index for the first letter (to compare with j, which is a first letter index) and then to index the first letter dimension in data[l][k]? \n   - In the second if: as an index for the second letter (to compare with k, which is a second letter index) and then to index the second letter dimension in data[j][l]? \n\nSo the two uses of l are independent: one in the first dimension and one in the second dimension? \n\nBut wait: in the first if, we are using l in the first dimension: data[l][k] -> so l is the first letter index? \n   and in the second if, we are using l in the second dimension: data[j][l] -> so l is the second letter index? \n\nThat is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n   answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and 11*11*11 = 1331 per test case? and the number of test cases t <= 100, but the total n <= 10^5? but the grid is 11x11 and the triple loop is 11*11*11 = 1331 per test case? and the total test cases t is at most 100? then 100*1331 = 133100 which is acceptable.\n\nSo we write for program1.py: \n   \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nBut note: the existing code already has the second if: \n   if k != l: \n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nSo we are adding two things in the inner loop.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given a code that has a function modmul that is not implemented. We are to complete modmul.\n\nThe function modmul is defined as:\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\nLooking at the rest of the code, we see that modmul is used in several places, for example:\n   fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n   invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1])\n   and in comb: modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\nSo modmul should multiply x and y modulo MOD? and then add c? \n\nBut the function has a third parameter c with default 0. How is it used? \n\nIn the code, we see:\n   out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n   and then: modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nBut also: modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n\nSo sometimes it is called with two arguments, sometimes with three? \n\nIn the comb function: \n   return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\nThat is: modmul is called with two arguments? \n\nBut then we see: \n   out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nSo we have to handle two and three arguments? \n\nThe function signature: modmul(x, y, c=0)\n\nWe can interpret: \n   modmul(x, y, c) = (x * y + c) % MOD   ?\n\nBut look at the usage in the factorial loop:\n   fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\nThat should be: fact[i] = (i * fact[i-1]) % MOD.\n\nBut then in the comb function: \n   modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y])) \n   = fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD) % MOD\n\nSo if we have three arguments: \n   modmul(x, y, c) = (x * y + c) % MOD? \n\nBut then how is it used in the line:\n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nThat would be: rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i) % MOD)) % MOD? \n\nBut wait, the function is called with two arguments: modmul(out[i], invs(i)) -> then c=0, so it returns (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD.\n\nBut then we have:\n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nThat is: rem = rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD? \n\nBut that is not the same as: (rem + out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD? \n\nWe must do modulo arithmetic properly. \n\nActually, the function modmul should be defined to do:\n\n   If two arguments: (x * y) % MOD\n   If three arguments: (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut the default for c is 0, so when called with two arguments, it is (x*y+0) % MOD = (x*y) % MOD.\n\nBut then the line:\n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nis equivalent to:\n   rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD) % MOD? \n\nBut that is not the same as (rem + out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD? \n\nBecause: (a + (b mod MOD)) mod MOD is the same as (a+b) mod MOD? \n\nBut note: rem is an integer that might be large? and we are doing modulo MOD? \n\nActually, the entire program uses modulo MOD. So we should do:\n\n   modmul(x, y, c) = (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut then when we do:\n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nit becomes: \n   rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD) % MOD\n\nBut that is not the same as (rem + out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD? \n\nBecause: (a + (b mod MOD)) mod MOD = (a+b) mod MOD? \n   But note: (b mod MOD) is in the range [0, MOD-1]. Then a + (b mod MOD) might be large? and then we mod again? \n   However, (a + (b mod MOD)) mod MOD = (a+b) mod MOD? \n\nBut wait: \n   Let b = k*MOD + r, then b mod MOD = r.\n   Then a + r = a + (b - k*MOD) = (a+b) - k*MOD.\n   Then (a + r) mod MOD = (a+b - k*MOD) mod MOD = (a+b) mod MOD? \n\nSo yes, they are the same.\n\nBut the problem: the function modmul is called in the comb function with two arguments? and we want (x*y) % MOD? \n\nSo we can define:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: the comb function does:\n   modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\nThat would be: \n   inner = (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] + 0) % MOD\n   then (fact[x] * inner + 0) % MOD\n\nWhich is (fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD)) % MOD -> correct.\n\nBut then in the line:\n   out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nThat is: (base * frac) % MOD.\n\nAnd then:\n   rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD) % MOD   [which is the same as (rem + out[i]*invs(i)) % MOD]\n\nBut note: the function invs(x) is defined as:\n   def invs(x):\n        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\nThat is: (fact[x-1] * invfact[x]) % MOD -> which is the modular inverse of x? \n\nBut note: fact[x] = fact[x-1] * x mod MOD, so invfact[x] = inv(fact[x]) = ... \n   Then fact[x-1] * invfact[x] mod MOD = (fact[x-1] * inv(fact[x])) mod MOD = (fact[x-1] * inv(fact[x-1] * x)) mod MOD = inv(x) mod MOD? \n\nBut we have a function inv(x) that does pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). So invs(x) is the same as inv(x)? \n\nBut then why define it? \n\nAnyway, we don't need to change that.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code for modmul is:\n\n   return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the parameters x, y, c might be large? and we are in Python, so we can do:\n\n   return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut the modulus is MOD = 998244353.\n\nHowever, the numbers can be as large as (10^6)! which is huge? but we are doing modulo 998244353? \n\nBut the multiplication: x and y are modulo MOD? Actually, no: they are integers that might be larger than MOD? \n\nBut we can do:\n\n   return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut to avoid overflow in intermediate multiplication? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but the modulus operation will reduce the size. However, the multiplication of two numbers modulo MOD might be done more efficiently by doing:\n\n   (x % MOD) * (y % MOD) % MOD\n\nBut the parameters x, y, c might be already reduced? because they are computed modulo MOD? \n\nLooking at the code: \n   fact is built by modmul: so the numbers are kept modulo MOD? \n   Similarly, invfact is built modulo MOD.\n\nSo x and y are in the range [0, MOD-1]. Then x*y might be as large as (MOD-1)^2, which is about 10^12? which is acceptable in Python? \n\nBut then adding c? which is also modulo MOD? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments: then c=0. With three arguments: then we add c.\n\nSo the code for modmul:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: the function is called in the comb function with two arguments? and then in the line with three? Actually, we never see a call with three arguments? \n\nLooking at the code: \n   We have:\n        base = fact[n-1]\n        frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n        out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n   Then later:\n        rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n   And in the definition of invs:\n        return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n   And in comb:\n        return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\n   And in invcomb: \n        return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))\n\nSo all calls are with two arguments? \n\nBut the function signature has c=0. So we can ignore c? \n\nBut the problem: the code has a line:\n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nBut that is two arguments? \n\nAnd then we have:\n   out[i] -= oldrem\n\nBut that is not using modmul.\n\nSo we don't have a call with three arguments? \n\nBut the function is defined with a default c=0. So we can do:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the line \n   rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nis equivalent to:\n   rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD) % MOD\n\nBut that is the same as (rem + out[i]*invs(i)) % MOD? \n\nBut we can also do:\n\n   rem = (rem + out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD\n\nBut the function modmul is not used for that. \n\nSo the function modmul is only used for two-argument multiplication modulo MOD? \n\nBut the function signature allows three arguments. \n\nLooking at the problem: we are to complete the function as given. The function is defined with c=0. \n\nWe can write:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nThis will work for two and three arguments? \n\nFor two arguments: c=0 -> (x*y) % MOD.\nFor three arguments: (x*y+c) % MOD.\n\nBut we don't see a call with three arguments? \n\nHowever, the problem says: complete the code. We are to fill the TODO. \n\nSo we write that.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n   return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". For program1.py, we are to output the line that goes in the TODO. For program2.py, we are to output the body of modmul.\n\nBut the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo:\n\n   program1: \"            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n   program2: \"        return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut note: the indentation? \n\nIn program1.py, the TODO is inside the if block? and we are at the same indentation level as the existing line? \n\nThe existing code:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nSo the line we are adding is: \"                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nBut note: the existing line for the second if is already there. We are only adding one line.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the function modmul is:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with: \"        return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut the function body must be indented. The current code has 8 spaces for the function body? Actually, the next line in the function is empty? \n\nBut the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The function body should be indented one level (4 spaces). \n\nIn the given code, the TODO is at the same indentation level as the function body? \n\nSo we write for program2.py: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\" with 4 spaces? \n\nBut the existing code after the function definition uses 4 spaces? \n\nLooking at the code:\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO line is indented by 8 spaces? Actually, in the problem statement, the code is given with 4 spaces per indent? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output the exact line that should replace the TODO in program1.py and the exact line that should replace the TODO in program2.py.\n\nTherefore:\n\n   program1: \"            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n   program2: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut wait: in the given program1.py, the TODO is inside a triple loop and inside an if. The existing code has:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThe TODO is at the same indentation level as the two if statements? So we need 12 spaces? \n\nBut the existing line in the second if is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\"\n\nThat is 20 spaces? \n\nActually, let me count:\n\nThe outer loop: for j: 4 spaces\n   for k: 8 spaces\n      for l: 12 spaces\n         if j != l: 16 spaces\n             [TODO] -> 20 spaces? \n         if k != l: 16 spaces\n             existing line: 20 spaces\n\nSo the line we add should be at 20 spaces: \"                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the function body is indented by 4 spaces? \n\nThe function definition: at 0 spaces, then the body: 4 spaces. \n\nBut the TODO is written as: \"        # TODO: Your code here\" -> that is 8 spaces? \n\nActually, the problem statement code for program2.py:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\r\n    # TODO: Your code here\r\n\r\ndef inv(x):\r\n    ...\n\nThe function body for modmul is indented by 4 spaces? But the TODO comment is at 4 spaces? \n\nBut the problem statement uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\nSo we write for program2.py: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\" with 4 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n   program2: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer may be large and we should use 64-bit integers? In program1.py, we are using integers? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision? so we are safe? \n\nBut the existing code uses integer arithmetic? and then prints answer//2? \n\nWe are adding two cases? and then dividing by 2? \n\nBut the overcounting factor is 2? so we divide by 2? \n\nSo the entire program1.py should be correct.\n\nFor program2.py, we are returning the value modulo MOD? \n\nSo we output the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n  \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the JSON string."
