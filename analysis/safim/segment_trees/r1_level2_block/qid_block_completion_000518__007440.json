    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the prices in descending order and compute a prefix sum array s.\nFor each query (x, y): \n  The customer must purchase at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase), \n  the customer would choose exactly x items (because adding more expensive items might push some cheaper ones to be free, but note: the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase).\n  However, note that the free items are the y cheapest. So we want to maximize the sum of the y cheapest in a set of x items.\n\n  How? We can choose the x items arbitrarily. The best strategy is to take the x items that are as expensive as possible? \n  But note: the free items are the cheapest ones. So if we take the most expensive x items, then the cheapest y among them will be the last y in our sorted descending list? \n  Actually, in descending order, the cheapest y in the set of x would be the last y in the set (which are the smallest ones in the set). \n\n  Since we have sorted in descending order: \n      p[0] >= p[1] >= ... >= p[n-1]\n\n  If we take the top x items: indices 0 to x-1, then the cheapest y items in this set are the last y of these, i.e., from index x-y to x-1? \n  But note: in descending order, the last y in the segment [0, x-1] are the smallest in that segment. \n\n  However, we can also consider: what if we skip some expensive items? But note: if we skip an expensive item, we have to take a cheaper one. Then the set of purchased items would have a cheaper set of items, and the free ones would be even cheaper? \n  But observe: we want the sum of the free items to be as large as possible. The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So we want the y cheapest to be as expensive as possible.\n\n  The optimal strategy is to take the most expensive x items. Why?\n    - The free items are the y cheapest. In the set of the top x items, the y cheapest are the last y of these. \n    - If we replace one of the expensive items with a cheaper one that is not in the top x, then the set of purchased items will have a cheaper item. This cheaper item will be one of the free ones (because it is cheaper than the rest). Then the free set would include this cheaper item and we lose the opportunity to have a more expensive item in the free set.\n\n  Therefore, for a query (x, y):\n      We take the top x items: indices 0 to x-1 in the sorted descending list.\n      The free items are the last y of these, which in the descending order are the ones from index x-y to x-1? \n      Actually, in the segment [0, x-1] (which is the top x), the smallest y are the last y in the segment? \n        But note: the segment [0, x-1] is sorted descending, so the last y are the smallest.\n\n  How to compute the sum of the free items? \n      We have the prefix sum array s for the entire sorted descending array. \n      The prefix sum s[i] is the sum of the first i items (i.e., indices 0 to i-1) in the descending order.\n\n      The entire set of x items: indices 0 to x-1 -> sum = s[x] (because s[0]=0, s[1]=p[0], s[2]=p[0]+p[1], ... s[x]=p[0]+...+p[x-1])\n      The free items are the last y of these: which are the items from index x-y to x-1. \n      The sum of these free items = s[x] - s[x-y]   ??? \n\n      But note: \n          s[x] = p[0] + p[1] + ... + p[x-1]\n          s[x-y] = p[0] + ... + p[x-y-1]\n          Then s[x] - s[x-y] = p[x-y] + ... + p[x-1] -> which are the last y items in the segment [0, x-1]? \n\n      However, in the descending order, the last y items are the smallest. But we want the sum of the smallest y in the set? That is exactly the last y in the descending order? \n\n      Example: \n          n=5, p = [5,5,3,2,1] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n          Query: x=3, y=2 -> we take the top 3: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest are 5 and 3? -> but wait, 5 and 5 are the two most expensive? \n          Actually, the two cheapest in the set {5,5,3} are 5 and 3? -> no, the two cheapest are 3 and 5? -> but 5 is not cheaper than 5? \n\n          Actually, the set {5,5,3} has the two smallest as 3 and 5? -> but note: the two smallest are 3 and the smallest 5? \n          How do we break ties? It doesn't matter because we are summing. \n\n          The two smallest are the two with the smallest values: 3 and 5? -> but 3 is the smallest, then the next smallest is 5? \n\n          So the free items are 3 and 5? -> sum=8.\n\n          How do we get that from the prefix array?\n          s = [0,5,10,13,15,16] \n          x=3 -> we look at s[3]=13, then we want the last 2 in the segment of 3? \n          We have: \n              s[3] - s[1] = 13 - 5 = 8 -> which is correct.\n\n          How? \n              The segment of 3: [5,5,3] -> the last two: 5 (at index 1) and 3 (at index 2) -> but note: \n              s[3] = 5+5+3 = 13\n              s[1] = 5 -> then 13-5 = 8.\n\n          Why s[1]? because we are removing the first (3-2)=1 items? \n\n          Actually, the free items are the last y in the segment of x, which are the last y in the descending order. \n          The entire segment of x items: we have the first (x-y) items that are not free, and the last y that are free.\n\n          Therefore, the free sum = s[x] - s[x-y] \n\n      But wait: in the example above, x=3, y=2 -> x-y=1 -> s[3]-s[1]=8.\n\n      Another example: \n          Query: x=2, y=1 -> we take the top 2: [5,5]. The cheapest one is 5. \n          s[2]=10, s[2-1]=s[1]=5 -> 10-5=5 -> correct.\n\n      And the third query: x=5, y=3 -> we take all: [5,5,3,2,1]. The three cheapest: 1,2,3 -> sum=6.\n          s[5]=16, s[5-3]=s[2]=10 -> 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, for each query (x, y), we output: s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n  However, note: our array p is sorted in descending order, and we built the prefix sum s for that.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"for the given values of x and y\", and we have to output the maximum total value of free items.\n\n  So the missing code in program1.py is:\n      for each query, we read x and y, then we compute s[x] - s[x-y] and append that to O.\n\n  But note: the constraints say that x and y are such that 1<=y<=x<=n. So x-y is nonnegative and at most n-1.\n\n  However, what if x-y is 0? then s[0]=0, so it's safe.\n\n  So in the loop for the queries:\n\n      for _ in [0]*q:\n          x, y = Y()\n          # Then we compute: free_sum = s[x] - s[x-y]\n          O.append(str(s[x] - s[x-y]))\n\n  But wait: the example in the note: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n      However, our sorted descending p: [5,5,3,2,1] -> so for x=3, we take [5,5,3] -> then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? -> but 3+5=8.\n\n  But note: the example input: \n      n=5, q=3, p = [5,3,5,1,2] -> then sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n\n  So the code for program1.py is:\n\n      for _ in [0]*q:\n          x, y = Y()\n          O.append(str(s[x] - s[x-y]))\n\n  However, note: the prefix array s has length n+1 (from 0 to n). And x is at most n, and x-y is at least 0, so it's safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given an integer n and a list a of n+1 integers (a0, a1, ..., an) which is non-increasing, and for i>n, a_i=0.\n\n  The problem is about an infinite grid. The cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise.\n\n  Initially, there is one doll at (0,0). We can do operations: remove a doll at (x,y) and place two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). The goal is to have 0 dolls on every white cell.\n\n  We are to compute the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\n  The note gives an example: \n      n=1, a0=2, a1=2 -> then the white cells are (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1). \n      The example operations: 5 operations.\n\n  The provided code already sets up:\n      - Precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials up to N=400005 (which is 4*10^5+5) for combinations.\n      - Then reads n and the list a of n+1 integers.\n\n  Then it does:\n      ans = sum(C(v+i, i+1) for i, v in enumerate(a)) % MOD\n\n  But there is a missing part in the function C(m, n): \n      The function is defined as:\n          def C(m, n):\n              if n < 0 or m < n:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n  We must complete the TODO: what to return when the conditions n<0 or m<n hold? \n      In combinatorics, if n<0 or m<n, then the binomial coefficient is 0.\n\n  So we should return 0.\n\n  However, the problem says: \n      \"Print one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem, modulo 10^9+7.\"\n\n  And the example: \n      n=1, a=[2,2] -> \n          i=0: v=2 -> term = C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1) = 2\n          i=1: v=2 -> term = C(2+1, 1+1) = C(3,2) = 3\n          ans = (2+3) % MOD = 5 -> which matches the example.\n\n  But what is the reasoning? \n\n  The problem is known and the solution is known to be: \n      ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i + i, i+1)\n\n  Why? \n      The key idea is to use the combinatorial interpretation of the moves. The operation is similar to a branching process. \n      We start at (0,0). Each operation at (x,y) produces two dolls at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). \n\n      We note that the goal is to have no doll on any white cell. The white cells are defined by the condition y < a_x. \n      Therefore, we must remove all dolls that end up in white cells? Actually, we are allowed to do operations until there are no dolls in white cells.\n\n      The known solution for this problem (from CodeForces problems) is to use the formula:\n          ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i + i, i+1)\n\n      So the provided code is already set up to compute that.\n\n  Therefore, the missing part in program2.py is to return 0 in the C function when the binomial coefficient is not defined (i.e., when n<0 or m<n).\n\n  So we write:\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  But note: the parameters in the function are m and n. The function is called with m = v+i and n = i+1.\n\n  We must be cautious: the variable names in the function: \n      The function C(m, n) computes C(m, n) = m choose n.\n\n  So the condition: if n < 0 or m < n -> then return 0.\n\n  However, note: the function parameters are named m and n, but the outer n (the input n) is different. This is local.\n\n  So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n      def C(m, n):\n          if n < 0 or m < n:\n              return 0\n          return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n  But note: the problem says that the sequence a is non-increasing and a_i>=0, and n up to 200000, and a_i up to 200000, so m = v+i can be at most 200000+200000=400000, which is within our precomputation range (N=400005). \n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the for-loop body for the queries.\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the return 0 in the C function.\n\nBut note: the entire program1.py is:\n\n  Y=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n  O=[];n,q=Y();p=sorted(Y())[::-1];s=[0]\n  for i in p:s+=[s[-1]+i]\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n  print('\\n'.join(O))\n\nWe are to replace the TODO line with the code for the loop body.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, we are to replace the TODO with the return 0.\n\nHowever, note the structure: in program1.py, the for loop is written as:\n\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must write the body of the loop. We can write:\n\n  for _ in[0]*q:\n      x, y = Y()\n      O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\nBut note: the existing code has a colon and then a comment. We can write the body with proper indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n      x, y = Y()\n      O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\nBut note: the existing code has the for loop header. We are only to complete the body.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing line is:\n\n      return 0\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO line with \"return 0\".\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the output format is JSON: \n    {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nWe must put the missing code for program1 as a string, and for program2 as a string.\n\nBut note: the missing code for program1 is two lines (with proper indentation). We can write:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n\nFor program2, it is one line:\n\n  \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n\nBut note the existing indentation in program2: the function C is defined and the if statement is indented by 4, then the TODO is indented by 8? Actually, the existing code:\n\n  def C(m, n):\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\nSo the TODO is at the same level as the return statement? Actually, the if block is 4 spaces, then the TODO is 8? \n\nBut in the provided code, the TODO is in the if block. So we should write:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program2, we are only replacing the TODO line. We can write the two lines? \n\nBut note: the existing code already has the condition. We are only to replace the TODO line with \"return 0\". \n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire block? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and in this case, the missing part is the body of the if statement.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\nWe are to output only the missing part. For program2, the missing part is the line \"return 0\" that goes inside the if block.\n\nBut note: the existing code has the condition and the comment. We are replacing the comment with the return. So the missing code for program2 is the line \"return 0\", and we must indent it appropriately.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nIn the function C, the if statement is indented by 4, and the body of the if should be indented by 8. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nSo for program2, we output:\n\n        return 0\n\nwith 8 spaces? But note: the existing code in the example uses 4 and 8. However, the problem does not specify. But we can assume the standard.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without specifying the exact number of spaces? But the problem says the code must run.\n\nBut the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n  def C(m, n):\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      return ...\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line. So we can write:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\nBut note: the return 0 must be at the same indentation level as the TODO comment. \n\nIn the provided code, the TODO is at 8 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n  def C(m, n):\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      return ...\n\nSo the TODO is at 8 spaces (if we assume 4 for the function body and 4 for the if body). \n\nTherefore, we write for program2: \"        return 0\" (with 8 spaces) or we can use a tab? But the problem says the code is in Python, and we should use spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we know that the existing code uses 4 spaces per level. \n\nAlternatively, we can write the minimal code that would work. Since the problem says \"output the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the if, we can write:\n\n  return 0\n\nand the user would replace the TODO line with that, and the existing indentation (which is 8 spaces) would be preserved.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the code with the same level of indentation as the TODO. Since the TODO is at 8 spaces (if the function body is 4 and the if body is 4 more), we output 8 spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nIn program2, the missing block is the body of the if, which is one line: \"return 0\". \n\nSo we write for program2: \"        return 0\" (with 8 spaces).\n\nBut wait: what if the existing code uses tabs? The problem says the code is given as:\n\n  def C(m, n):\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      return ...\n\nWe don't know if it's spaces or tabs. But the problem says \"Code:\" and then the code. The code uses spaces? \n\nLooking at the provided code: it uses 4 spaces for the first indent and 4 more for the second? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\nTo be safe, we output the same indentation as the surrounding code. Since the TODO is at the same level as the comment, we output the same number of spaces as the comment has. But the problem does not show the exact spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the problem says: the code is given as above. In the above, the TODO is indented by 8 spaces relative to the function definition? \n\nBut actually, the function definition is at column 0, then the body of the function is indented by 4, and the body of the if is indented by 8? \n\nIn the provided code for program2, the lines:\n\n  def C(m, n):\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      return ...\n\nWe see that the if statement is indented by 4 (relative to def) and the TODO is indented by 8 (relative to def). \n\nSo we output 8 spaces for the return 0? \n\nBut note: the problem says the code is given as above. We can assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n        return 0\n\nwith 8 spaces.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only outputting the line that replaces the TODO.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n    \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n  }\n\nBut note: in program1, the for loop is:\n\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to write the body. The body should be indented. The existing for loop is at the same level as the previous lines. The previous lines are at 0 indentation? \n\nActually, the code:\n\n  Y=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n  O=[];n,q=Y();p=sorted(Y())[::-1];s=[0]\n  for i in p:s+=[s[-1]+i]\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n  print('\\n'.join(O))\n\nThe for loop for the queries is at the same level as the previous for loop (which is 0). But the previous for loop has a body: \"s+=[s[-1]+i]\" which is on the same line. \n\nWe are writing a multi-line body for the next for loop. So we must indent the body.\n\nThe standard is 4 spaces. But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says the code must run.\n\nWe assume 4 spaces for the body of the for loop.\n\nSo the body:\n\n      x, y = Y()\n      O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\nwith 4 spaces for each line.\n\nBut note: the existing for loop for the prefix sum is written in one line. We are writing a multi-line body for the next for loop.\n\nSo the missing block for program1 is two lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n\nThis has two lines, each with 4 spaces at the beginning.\n\nBut wait: the existing for loop in the prefix sum is written without a block because it's one line. The next for loop is written with a colon and then a comment. We are replacing the comment with a block of two lines, each indented.\n\nSo the final code for program1.py would be:\n\n  for _ in[0]*q:\n      x, y = Y()\n      O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\nTherefore, the missing block is the two lines with 4 spaces each.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n\nwith 8 spaces (because it is inside the function and then inside the if).\n\nBut note: the function C is defined with 4 spaces for the body, and the if body is 4 more, so 8.\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nImportant: the strings must be properly escaped? But the code we are outputting does not have double quotes or backslashes, so we can write as is.\n\nLet me write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n  \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output this JSON.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting JSON.\n\nBut the problem specifies the output format: a JSON object.\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\", \"program2\": \"        return 0\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Return json\", so we output a string that is the JSON.\n\nBut in the context, we are writing the answer as a JSON string.\n\nTherefore, we write the above."
