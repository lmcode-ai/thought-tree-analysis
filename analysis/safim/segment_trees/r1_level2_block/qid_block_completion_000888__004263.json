So the problem in the description has a mistake: the second test case has 7 strings, not 4. Therefore, the example in the problem statement for the second test case is for n=7? But the problem says: \n          \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\n          Then for the second test case: \n              n=4\n\n          and then 4 strings. This is a discrepancy. Given the official sample, we know that the second test case in the sample input has n=7 and answer=6. So the problem statement here has a typo: it says n=4 for the second test case, but it should be n=7.",

So we need 2. Therefore, the minimal total pipes is: \n              K = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\n          But note: we also have the condition that the total water must be at least V: \n              K * t >= V   (which is the condition for i=n: ceil(S_n/t) is defined to be the smallest integer >= S_n/t, so K>=ceil(S_n/t) ensures K*t>=S_n). And for i<n: \n              K >= ceil(S_i/t) => K*t >= S_i. So the condition is satisfied. But is it the minimal? We set K = max_i ceil(S_i/t). Then for every i, K>=ceil(S_i/t) -> so K*t>=S_i. And we cannot have a smaller K because if K' < K, then for the i that achieves the maximum, ceil(S_i/t)=K, then K'<K implies K'<ceil(S_i/t) -> then K'*t < S_i? Since ceil(S_i/t) is the smallest integer >= S_i/t, then K' < ceil(S_i/t) implies K' <= ceil(S_i/t)-1, so K'*t <= (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i? But note: ceil(S_i/t) is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to S_i/t, so:\n                  ceil(S_i/t) - 1 < S_i/t \n                  => (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i\n              So K'*t <= (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i -> fails.

But we already have t>=T_min, which ensures S_i/t<=i. And if S_i/t<=i, then ceil(S_i/t) is at most i? Since ceil(x) is the smallest integer >=x, and x<=i, then ceil(x)<=i? Example: i=3, x=2.1 -> ceil=3<=3 -> ok. Example: i=3, x=3.0 -> ceil=3<=3 -> ok. Example: i=3, x=3.1 -> but we have x<=i, so x<=3, so 3.1 is not allowed. Therefore, if t>=T_min, then for every i, S_i/t<=i, and then ceil(S_i/t) is an integer between floor(S_i/t) and i, and since floor(S_i/t)>= floor(0) and ceil(S_i/t) is at most i, then it is always <=i.\n\n          Why? Because if x = S_i/t <= i, then ceil(x) is at most i? The largest integer that is the ceiling of a number <=i is i? Example: x=i -> ceil(x)=i. Example: x=i-0.5 -> ceil(x)=i. Example: x=i-0.0001 -> ceil(x)=i. So if x<=i, then ceil(x)<=i? Not if i is not an integer? but i is an integer (it is the index, an integer). Therefore, if t>=T_min, then for every i, ceil(S_i/t)<=i. Then the minimal total pipes is M = max_i ceil(S_i/t), and we have M<=n? Because for i=n, ceil(S_n/t)<=n? But we have t>=T_min, and T_min>= S_n/n, so S_n/t<=n, so ceil(S_n/t)<=n. Therefore, the condition for possibility is only t>=T_min. And then the answer is M = max_i ceil(S_i/t). But note: the problem says the total water must be at least V: \n              M * t >= V? Since M>=ceil(S_n/t), then M*t>=S_n. So it is sufficient. Therefore, for a query t:\n              T_min = max_i (S_i / i) [for i from 1 to n]\n              if t < T_min:\n                  print -1\n              else:\n                  M = 0\n                  for i in range(1, n+1):\n                      # S_i = prefix sum up to i\n                      # compute r = ceil(S_i / t)\n                      # But note: if t is 0? but t>=1 per input. r = (S_i + t - 1) // t   # if we use integer arithmetic? but S_i and t are integers, but S_i/t might not be integer. # Actually, ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b for positive integers. if r > M:\n                          M = r\n                  print(M) However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000, but the number of queries q can be up to 200000, and n up to 200000, so we cannot iterate over i for each query (which would be 200000*200000 = 40e9, too slow). We need to precompute T_min = max_i (S_i / i) for the entire system. And for the queries, we want to compute M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) quickly. How to compute M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) without iterating over i for each query?

But we want the maximum over i.\n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute an array A where A_i = S_i, and then for a fixed t, we want:\n              M = max_{i} ceil(A_i/t)",

No: because if we have two i: \n                  i1: A_i1 = 10, i2: A_i2=20, t=10: \n                      ceil(10/10)=1, ceil(20/10)=2 -> max=2. ceil( max_i A_i / t ) = ceil(20/10)=2 -> matches.

But what if we have i1: A_i1=10, i2: A_i2=11, t=10: \n                  ceil(10/10)=1, ceil(11/10)=2 -> max=2. ceil(11/10)=2. So it seems M(t) = ceil( max_i A_i / t )? But wait: the maximum of ceil(A_i/t) is not necessarily ceil( max_i A_i / t )? Example: \n                      A = [1, 3] and t=2:\n                          ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> max=2. ceil(max_A/t)=ceil(3/2)=2.\n                  Example: A = [3, 1] -> same.

So it is always: \n              M(t) = ceil( max_i A_i / t )   ? But wait: \n              We have A_i = S_i, and the maximum prefix sum is S_n = V? But not necessarily: the prefix sums are non-decreasing? \n                  S_i = v1+...+vi, so S_1<=S_2<=...<=S_n.",

And in the first test case: \n              S1=1, S2=3 -> max_i ceil(S_i/t)=max(ceil(1/1),ceil(3/1))=max(1,3)=3. And ceil(S_n/t)=3. But consider: \n              n=2, v1=3, v2=1, then S1=3, S2=4. For t=2: \n                  ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, so M=2.\n              ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(4/2)=2. And if we have:\n              n=3, v1=1, v2=1, v3=1, then S1=1, S2=2, S3=3. For t=2: \n                  ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, so M=2.\n              ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(3/2)=2. Therefore, because the prefix sums are non-decreasing, we have:\n              S_n = max_i S_i. And then ceil(S_n/t) = max_i ceil(S_i/t) because for any i, S_i<=S_n, so ceil(S_i/t)<=ceil(S_n/t) (since the ceil function is non-decreasing). Therefore, M(t) = ceil(S_n/t). But wait: is the ceil function non-decreasing? If a<=b, then ceil(a)<=ceil(b)? Example: a=1.5, b=1.6: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2 -> 2<=2.\n                  a=1.1, b=1.9: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2. a=1.9, b=2.0: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2. a=1.9, b=2.1: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=3 -> 2<=3. So yes, ceil is non-decreasing. Therefore, for non-decreasing S_i, we have:\n              M(t) = ceil(S_n/t) But then why did we care about the other prefixes?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe current approach is O(n^2) which is too slow for n up to 10^5 (and total n over test cases up to 10^5, but note that the worst-case one test case can have 10^5 strings). We need a more efficient solution.\n\nIdea for program1:\nWe are counting pairs (i, j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\nNote: Each string has two characters. The condition is that either:\n  Case 1: The first character is different and the second is the same.\n  Case 2: The first character is the same and the second is different.\n\nWe cannot have both different because then it would be two differences.\n\nWe can use frequency dictionaries to avoid O(n^2).\n\nLet:\n  freq1: frequency of strings (so that we can handle duplicates? but note: if two strings are identical, they don't form a pair that differs in exactly one position? Actually, they don't because they are the same in both positions. However, note that the problem says: \"differ in exactly one position\". So identical strings do not contribute.\n\nBut also note: the example: (\"ab\", \"ab\") -> same in both -> not counted.\n\nHowever, the example: (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> first character same? Actually: \n  \"ab\" and \"aa\": first character same? 'a' vs 'a' -> same, second character 'b' vs 'a' -> different -> so that is one difference.\n\nBut also note: the example: (\"ab\", \"cb\"): first character different, second same.\n\nSo we can break the strings by the two characters.\n\nWe can do:\n  Let f be a dictionary that counts the frequency of each string? But note: the problem has two independent dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, we can have:\n  Let count1[c] = frequency of strings that have first character c.\n  Let count2[c] = frequency of strings that have second character c.\n  But then we also need to account for the entire string? Because if we have two strings that share the same first character but different second, we can count them? However, note that if two strings are (c1, c2) and (c1, c3) then they form a pair? But what if they are the same? Then we don't want to count.\n\nBut wait: if we have two strings: (c1, c2) and (c1, c2) then they are identical -> not counted.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTotal pairs that have the same first character (so second character different) = \n  For each first character c, consider all strings with first character c. Let the frequencies of the second characters in this group be f1, f2, ... fk. Then the number of pairs in this group that have the same first character (so they are in the same group) and different second character is: \n      total = sum_{i} f_i\n      pairs = total*(total-1)//2 - sum_{i} [f_i*(f_i-1)//2] \n  But note: actually, we don't want to subtract the pairs that are identical? Actually, the pairs that are identical are not included in the condition because they have 0 differences. But also, the condition for same first character and different second: we want to count every pair of two different second characters? Actually, no: we want to count every pair that has the same first character and different second character. And that is: for two strings in the same first character group, if they have different second characters, then they form one pair. How to count? \n      We can do: for a fixed first character c, the number of pairs that have the same first character and different second character is: \n          total_pairs = (number of strings in group) choose 2, minus the pairs that have the same second character? \n      Actually: \n          total_pairs = (freq_group * (freq_group-1))//2\n          Then subtract the pairs that have the same second character: for each second character d in the group, we have f_d pairs that are same? So subtract: for each d, f_d*(f_d-1)//2.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire group? Actually, we are only counting pairs that have the same first character and different second character? That is exactly: \n      total_pairs = (freq_group choose 2) - (sum_{d} [f_d choose 2])\n\nSimilarly, for the same second character and different first character: we can group by the second character.\n\nBut wait: what if a pair is counted in both? Actually, no: a pair either has the same first character and different second, OR same second and different first. They are disjoint.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Let group_by_first = defaultdict(dict)   # key: first char, then within that, key: second char -> count\n  Alternatively, we can have:\n      group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n      group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))   # but we don't need both? Actually, we can do:\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Count the frequency of each string? But note: the problem says the strings are of two letters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      total_count = 0\n\n      # For pairs that have same first character and different second:\n      #   Group by first character.\n      freq_first = defaultdict(list)   # or we can use a Counter for the entire string? but we need to break by first and second.\n\n      # Actually, we can do:\n      from collections import defaultdict\n      first_char_group = defaultdict(list)   # we don't need list, we need counts per second char per first char.\n\n      # Instead, we can have:\n      #   group1: keyed by first char, then we have a Counter for the second char.\n\n      # But note: we are going to iterate over the strings.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n  Plan:\n\n      Let's create:\n          d1 = defaultdict(int)   # for entire string? Actually, we need to avoid counting duplicates? But we are going to break by groups.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          # For same first char and different second:\n          group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n          # For same second char and different first? Actually, we can do similarly for the second group.\n\n      But note: we can also do:\n\n          # We can have:\n          #   group_by_first: for each first char, we have a frequency distribution of the second char.\n\n          # Then, for each first char, let total = sum( freq for each second char in that group )\n          # Then, the number of pairs in this group that have the same first char and different second char is:\n          #   total*(total-1)//2 - sum( [f*(f-1)//2 for f in freq.values()] )\n\n          # Similarly, for same second char and different first: we group by second char, and then for each second char, we have a frequency distribution of the first char? Actually, but note: if we do that, we are going to count every pair that has the same second char and different first char. However, note that a pair that has the same second char and different first char is not the same as the same first char and different second? They are disjoint.\n\n          # But wait: what about a pair that has both characters different? We are not counting that. So that's good.\n\n          # However, note: the entire set of pairs that we are counting is the union of two disjoint sets.\n\n      But there is a catch: if we do both groupings, we are not double counting? Because a pair that has the same first char and different second char is not in the same second char group? Actually, in the same second char group, we require the second char to be the same and the first char to be different. So they are disjoint.\n\n      However, note: the entire set of pairs that we are counting is the union of:\n          A: same first, different second\n          B: same second, different first\n\n      And that is exactly the condition: exactly one position different.\n\n      So total pairs = |A| + |B|\n\n      But note: the example: \n          First test case: \n              strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"cc\", \"db\", \"aa\"]\n          We are told the answer is 5.\n\n          Let's compute:\n            Group by first char:\n                'a': ['ab', 'aa'] -> total=2, then for second char: 'b':1, 'a':1 -> pairs = (2*1//2) - ( (1*0//2) + (1*0//2) ) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n                'c': ['cb','cc'] -> total=2, second char: 'b':1, 'c':1 -> pairs = 1.\n                'd': ['db'] -> total=1 -> 0.\n            So A = 1+1 = 2.\n\n            Group by second char:\n                'b': ['ab','cb','db'] -> total=3, first char: 'a':1, 'c':1, 'd':1 -> pairs = (3*2//2) - (1+1+1) [but wait: for each first char, we have frequency 1, so the same first char pairs in the same second char group? Actually, no: in the same second char group, we are grouping by second char, and then we break by first char? \n                    pairs = 3*2//2 = 3, then subtract the pairs that have the same first char? But wait, in the same second char group, we are counting pairs that have the same second char and different first char? Actually, we don't subtract? We do the same: \n                    total_pairs = 3 choose 2 = 3, then subtract the pairs that have the same first char? But in this group, each first char is unique? So we subtract 0? \n                    Actually, the formula: \n                        total_pairs = 3 choose 2 = 3\n                        then subtract: for each first char in this group, we have frequency f_i: then subtract f_i*(f_i-1)//2 -> 1*0//2 for each -> 0.\n                    so pairs = 3.\n                'c': ['cc'] -> 0\n                'a': ['aa'] -> 0\n                'c' in the second char? we have 'cc' -> second char 'c' -> group: ['cc'] -> 0.\n                Also, note: the string \"aa\" has second char 'a', so group 'a': ['aa'] -> 0.\n            So B = 3.\n\n            Total = 2+3 = 5 -> matches.\n\n          Second test case: \n              strings: [\"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\"]\n          We are told the answer is 6.\n\n          Group by first char:\n            'a': ['aa','ac'] -> total=2, second char: 'a':1, 'c':1 -> pairs = 1.\n            'c': ['ca','cc'] -> total=2, second char: 'a':1, 'c':1 -> pairs = 1.\n            A = 2.\n\n          Group by second char:\n            'a': ['aa','ca'] -> total=2, first char: 'a':1, 'c':1 -> pairs = 1.\n            'c': ['ac','cc'] -> total=2, first char: 'a':1, 'c':1 -> pairs = 1.\n            B = 2.\n\n          Total = 4 -> but expected 6.\n\n      What's wrong? \n\n      Actually, the example in the note: \n          \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\"\n\n      But note: the pairs are unordered and i<j. So:\n\n          (0,1): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> same first? yes, different second -> counted in A.\n          (0,2): \"aa\" and \"ca\" -> different first? and same second? \n                  first: 'a' vs 'c' -> different; second: 'a' vs 'a' -> same -> so counted in B.\n          (0,3): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> both different -> skip.\n          (1,2): \"ac\" and \"ca\" -> both different -> skip.\n          (1,3): \"ac\" and \"cc\" -> same second? no: 'c' vs 'c'? actually, second char of \"ac\" is 'c', and second char of \"cc\" is 'c' -> same second? Then we look at first: 'a' vs 'c' -> different -> so counted in B.\n          (2,3): \"ca\" and \"cc\" -> same first? 'c' vs 'c' -> same, second: 'a' vs 'c' -> different -> counted in A.\n\n      So we have:\n          A: (0,1), (2,3) -> 2\n          B: (0,2), (1,3) -> 2\n          and also (0,3) and (1,2) are not counted? But wait, the example says 6 pairs? \n\n      Actually, the example lists 6 pairs? But the example lists:\n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      But note: the problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j. So the same pair in reverse should not be counted? And indeed, the example has:\n          (\"aa\", \"ac\") -> (0,1)\n          (\"aa\", \"ca\") -> (0,2)\n          (\"cc\", \"ac\") -> (3,1) -> but that is (1,3) in 0-indexed? and (1,3) is valid i<j? yes.\n          (\"cc\", \"ca\") -> (3,2) -> but that is (2,3) -> which we have as (2,3) in our list? but note: the example lists (3,2) as (2,3) because i<j? Actually, the example lists the pair as (i,j) with i<j? Then they should have listed (2,3) as \"ca\" and \"cc\", but they wrote \"cc\" and \"ca\" which would be (3,2) -> which is not i<j? \n\n      Actually, the example output: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\") -> (0,1)\n          (\"aa\", \"ca\") -> (0,2)\n          (\"cc\", \"ac\") -> (3,1) -> but 3>1 -> that is not i<j? \n          (\"cc\", \"ca\") -> (3,2) -> 3>2 -> not i<j.\n\n      And then they have (\"ac\", \"aa\") -> (1,0) -> not i<j? and (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> (2,0) -> not i<j.\n\n      This is confusing.\n\n      Actually, the example says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\". It lists 6 pairs? But the problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j. So there should be 6? \n\n      Let me list the indices for the second test case:\n\n          s0 = \"aa\"\n          s1 = \"ac\"\n          s2 = \"ca\"\n          s3 = \"cc\"\n\n      Then the pairs (i<j) that satisfy:\n\n          (0,1): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> one difference (second char: 'a' vs 'c') -> valid.\n          (0,2): \"aa\" and \"ca\" -> one difference (first char: 'a' vs 'c') -> valid.\n          (0,3): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> two differences -> invalid.\n          (1,2): \"ac\" and \"ca\" -> two differences -> invalid.\n          (1,3): \"ac\" and \"cc\" -> one difference (first char: 'a' vs 'c') -> valid.\n          (2,3): \"ca\" and \"cc\" -> one difference (second char: 'a' vs 'c') -> valid.\n\n      So we have 4 pairs? But the example says 6? \n\n      Wait, the example says: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      This is 6, but note that (\"aa\",\"ac\") and (\"ac\",\"aa\") are the same pair? and the problem requires i<j. So only the first one is valid.\n\n      The example output in the problem says: \n          \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" and lists 6? \n\n      Actually, the problem statement might have a typo? \n\n      But the sample input for the second test case: \n          n=4\n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n\n      And the expected answer is 6? \n\n      However, the problem says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" and lists 6? \n\n      But then the example output for the third test case is 0.\n\n      And the first test case: \n          n=5\n          ab\n          cb\n          cc\n          db\n          aa\n\n      The answer is 5.\n\n      So the second test case must be 6? \n\n      How can we get 6? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\" and the example lists:\n\n          (\"aa\", \"ac\") -> (0,1)\n          (\"aa\", \"ca\") -> (0,2)\n          (\"cc\", \"ac\") -> (3,1) -> but 3>1 -> not i<j? \n          (\"cc\", \"ca\") -> (3,2) -> not i<j.\n          (\"ac\", \"aa\") -> (1,0) -> not i<j.\n          (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> (2,0) -> not i<j.\n\n      This is 6 pairs but only 4 of them have i<j.\n\n      I think the example output in the problem statement is listing the pairs without regard to order? But the problem says: \"pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j\".\n\n      So the correct count for the second test case is 4.\n\n      But the problem says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" and lists 6? \n\n      Alternatively, the problem might have intended to list the unordered pairs? But then it would be 6 unordered pairs? But note: the problem says: \"count the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j)\".\n\n      So the example output for the second test case should be 4.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" and then lists 6? \n\n      I see the problem: the example output for the second test case in the problem statement is:\n\n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      But note: (\"aa\", \"ac\") and (\"ac\", \"aa\") are the same unordered pair? So that would be 3 unordered pairs? \n\n      Actually, the problem statement is confusing.\n\n      Let me check the sample input and expected output from the problem:\n\n          First test case: 5\n          Second test case: 6\n          Third test case: 0\n\n      And the sample input for the second test case: \n          n=4\n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n\n      And the expected output is 6? \n\n      How can we get 6? \n\n      Another possibility: the problem is counting ordered pairs? But the problem says: \"pairs (i, j) such that i < j\", so unordered with i<j.\n\n      But 4 is the correct count for the second test case? \n\n      However, the problem says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" and lists 6? \n\n      I see: the problem lists:\n\n          (\"aa\", \"ac\")\n          (\"aa\", \"ca\")\n          (\"cc\", \"ac\")\n          (\"cc\", \"ca\")\n          (\"ac\", \"aa\")\n          (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      This is 6, but note that (\"aa\", \"ac\") and (\"ac\", \"aa\") are the same pair? and the problem requires i<j? So they should not both be counted.\n\n      But wait, the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\" and the example lists:\n\n          i=0, j=1: \"aa\" and \"ac\"\n          i=0, j=2: \"aa\" and \"ca\"\n          i=3, j=1: \"cc\" and \"ac\" -> but 3>1 -> not allowed? \n          i=3, j=2: \"cc\" and \"ca\" -> 3>2 -> not allowed?\n          i=1, j=0: \"ac\" and \"aa\" -> 1>0 -> not allowed? \n          i=2, j=0: \"ca\" and \"aa\" -> 2>0 -> not allowed.\n\n      So only two pairs: (0,1) and (0,2) and (1,3) and (2,3) -> 4.\n\n      But the problem says the answer is 6? \n\n      I think there is a misunderstanding: the problem says the second test case has 4 strings: \n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n\n      But the example output in the problem says: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      This is 6 pairs? \n\n      Actually, the problem might be listing the pairs without regard to order? But then it would be 6? \n\n      But note: the problem says: \"count the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j\". So we only count the pairs with i<j.\n\n      How can the answer be 6? \n\n      Another possibility: the problem has a different set of strings? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\"\n\n      But note: the strings are: \n          \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\"\n\n      And the pairs:\n\n          (0,1): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> one difference -> count=1\n          (0,2): \"aa\" and \"ca\" -> one difference -> count=2\n          (0,3): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> two differences -> skip\n          (1,2): \"ac\" and \"ca\" -> two differences -> skip\n          (1,3): \"ac\" and \"cc\" -> one difference -> count=3\n          (2,3): \"ca\" and \"cc\" -> one difference -> count=4\n\n      So 4.\n\n      But the problem says 6? \n\n      I see: the problem might have intended to say that the second test case has 6 pairs? but then the input must be different? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \n          \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\"\n\n      and then lists 6 pairs? \n\n      And then says: \n          \"For the third test case, the are no pairs satisfying the conditions.\"\n\n      So the second test case must be 6.\n\n      What if the second test case is:\n\n          n=4\n          aa\n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n\n      But that would be 5 strings? \n\n      Or maybe the second test case is:\n\n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n          aa   [duplicate]\n\n      Then we have 5 strings? \n\n      But the problem says: the first line of the test case is 4.\n\n      So I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n      However, the sample input for the second test case is 4 strings.\n\n      And the sample output for the second test case is 6? \n\n      How can we get 6? \n\n      Another possibility: the problem is counting ordered pairs (i,j) and (j,i) separately?

Each pipe pours 1 liter per second into its lock.\n          If a lock i overflows, the excess water flows to lock i+1, and so on.\n\n          We are given q queries. For each query with time t_j, we want the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, every lock is full.\n\n      How to approach?\n\n      Note: The water from a pipe at lock i will eventually fill lock i and then overflow to lock i+1, etc. But if there are multiple pipes, the water from a pipe at an earlier lock might help fill later locks.\n\n      Observation: \n          The total water needed is V = v1+v2+...+vn.\n\n          However, the time to fill the system is not just V divided by the number of pipes, because the water might overflow and be wasted.\n\n      Another observation: \n          The lock i can only be filled if the water from the pipes at locks 1 to i has had time to fill the entire prefix up to i.\n\n          Specifically, let S_i = v1+v2+...+vi.\n\n          The water from the first i pipes (if we open k_i pipes in the first i locks) will pour water at rate k_i liters per second. But note: the water from a pipe at lock j (j<=i) will eventually contribute to lock i only after filling the locks from j to i-1.\n\n          However, the water from a pipe at lock j (j<=i) will definitely contribute to lock i, but the time for the water to reach lock i might be an issue? \n\n          Actually, the system works as follows: \n            At each second, 1 liter is added to each lock that has an open pipe. Then, if a lock i has more than v_i liters, the excess is immediately passed to lock i+1.\n\n          But note: the water from a pipe at lock j will only start contributing to lock i after the locks j, j+1, ..., i-1 are full.\n\n          Therefore, the time to fill lock i is at least the time to fill the entire prefix i, but also the water that ends up in lock i might come from any pipe at lock j (j<=i) and also from pipes at locks after i? -> no, because water flows only forward.\n\n          However, pipes after lock i do not contribute to lock i.\n\n          So the water in lock i comes only from pipes at locks 1 to i.\n\n          Let k = total number of pipes opened in locks 1 to i.\n\n          Then, the total water that has been poured into the system from the first i locks by time t is k * t.\n\n          But this water must be enough to fill the first i locks: S_i, and also any water that overflows from lock i to lock i+1 is not available for lock i.\n\n          However, lock i will be full at time t if and only if the total water that has been poured into the first i locks is at least S_i, and also the water that has been poured into lock i specifically (or the water that remains in lock i after filling the previous locks) is at least v_i? \n\n          Actually, the entire prefix i must be full. The water from the first i locks will first fill lock 1, then lock 2, and so on. \n\n          The condition for the prefix i to be full by time t is: \n              k * t >= S_i\n\n          But also, we must ensure that the water for lock i has arrived. However, the water from a pipe at lock j (j<=i) will eventually reach lock i, but it might take time for the water to propagate. However, the problem says: \"immediately transfer\", so we assume propagation is instantaneous.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for the prefix i to be full by time t is: \n              k * t >= S_i\n\n          But note: the water from pipes after lock i does not help for prefix i.\n\n          However, there is a catch: the water from a pipe at lock j (j<=i) might not have had time to fill the entire prefix i if the rate is not enough? \n\n          Actually, the condition k * t >= S_i is necessary and sufficient for the prefix i to be full? \n\n          Why? \n            At time t, the total water that has been poured into the first i locks is k * t.\n            This water will fill the first i locks (which require S_i) and any excess will go to lock i+1.\n            So if k*t >= S_i, then the first i locks are full.\n\n          But also, we must ensure that the last lock n is full, which requires that the total water from all pipes (say K) is at least V = S_n, and also the condition for each prefix i: the water that has been allocated to the first i locks (which is at least the water from the first i pipes) must be at least S_i.\n\n          However, water from a pipe at lock j (j>i) does not contribute to prefix i.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for the entire system to be full at time t is:\n              For every i from 1 to n: \n                  (number of pipes in locks 1..i) * t >= S_i\n\n          And also, the total water from all pipes must be at least V: \n              K * t >= V\n\n          But note: the condition for i=n is K * t >= S_n, which is the same as the total condition.\n\n          So the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n              For every i in [1, n]: k_i * t >= S_i, \n              where k_i = number of pipes opened in locks 1..i.\n\n          And we want to minimize K = k_n.\n\n      How to minimize K?\n\n          We are free to choose which locks to open pipes, as long as the condition holds for every i.\n\n          We want to minimize the total number of pipes.\n\n          Note: opening a pipe at a later lock does not help the earlier prefixes. So we would prefer to open pipes as early as possible to help more prefixes.\n\n          However, we are constrained by the condition for each prefix.\n\n          We can try to open as few pipes as possible by placing them strategically.\n\n          But note: the condition for prefix i is: k_i >= ceil(S_i / t)\n\n          And k_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks.\n\n          Also, k_i is non-decreasing.\n\n          We want to minimize k_n.\n\n          How? \n            We can open pipes in the later locks to avoid having to open too many? But opening a pipe in a later lock only helps the prefixes from that lock onward.\n\n          Specifically, the condition for prefix i: k_i >= ceil(S_i / t)\n\n          And we have k_1 <= k_2 <= ... <= k_n.\n\n          We want to minimize k_n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let r_i = ceil(S_i / t)   -> but note: k_i must be an integer.\n\n          Then the constraints are:\n            k_1 >= r_1\n            k_2 >= r_2\n            ...\n            k_n >= r_n\n\n          and k_1 <= k_2 <= ... <= k_n.\n\n          We wish to minimize k_n.\n\n          How to assign the k_i? \n            We can set k_i = max( r_i, k_{i-1] )? \n            But note: we are allowed to open pipes in lock i to increase k_i without affecting k_{i-1}. \n\n          Actually, k_i = k_{i-1} + (number of pipes we open in lock i).\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            k_1 = max( r_1, 0 )   -> but we can open at least ceil(S_1/t) pipes in the first lock? \n            then k_2 = max( r_2, k_1 ) + (additional pipes we open in lock2) ?\n\n          But we want to minimize the total pipes = k_n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            k_1 = r_1\n            k_2 = max(r_2, k_1)   -> but then we don't open any pipe in lock2? \n            then k_3 = max(r_3, k_2) \n\n          However, this might not be valid because we can only open pipes in lock i to increase k_i, and we cannot decrease k_i.\n\n          Actually, we can set:\n            k_i = max( r_i, k_{i-1} )\n\n          Then the total pipes opened = k_n.\n\n          Why is this valid? \n            We are not opening any pipe in lock i if k_i = k_{i-1} (which is >= r_i), and if r_i > k_{i-1], then we open (r_i - k_{i-1}) pipes in lock i.\n\n          And this minimizes k_n? \n\n          Because if we open fewer in an early lock, we might have to open more in a later lock? But note the constraint for a later lock might be more demanding.\n\n          However, we cannot reduce the number of pipes in an early lock below r_1, and then for lock2, we need at least max(r_2, k_1) = max(r_2, r_1). But if r_2 > r_1, then we open (r_2 - r_1) pipes in lock2, and then for lock3, we need max(r_3, r_2), and so on.\n\n          This is the minimal because we cannot have k_i < r_i for any i, and the sequence k_i must be non-decreasing.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal total pipes is:\n              k_n = max( r_1, r_2, ..., r_n )\n\n          But wait: is that true? \n\n          Example: \n              n=2, v1=1, v2=2, t=1.\n              S1 = 1, r1 = ceil(1/1)=1.\n              S2 = 3, r2 = ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n              Then by our method: \n                  k1 = 1\n                  k2 = max(r2, k1) = 3 -> so we open 3 pipes: 1 in lock1 and 2 in lock2? \n                  total pipes=3.\n\n          But is there a better way? \n              We must have at least 1 pipe in the first lock to fill lock1 by time1.\n              For lock2: we need 3 liters by time1. We can open 3 pipes anywhere? \n                  If we open 3 pipes in lock1: then at time1, lock1 gets 3 liters -> it fills lock1 (1 liter) and then 2 liters overflow to lock2 -> so lock2 gets 2 liters, which is not enough (needs 2 liters? wait, v2=2) -> so it is full.\n                  So we can open 3 pipes in lock1: then k1=3, k2=3 -> satisfies: \n                      k1=3>=1, k2=3>=3.\n                  total pipes=3.\n\n              Alternatively, we open 1 pipe in lock1 and 2 in lock2: \n                  At time1: \n                      lock1: 1 liter -> full, and then the pipe at lock1 stops? no, the pipe continues to pour, so lock1 gets 1 liter per pipe? \n                  Actually, the problem says: \"When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second.\" -> so if we have 3 pipes in lock1, then lock1 gets 3 liters in the first second: 1 liter to fill lock1 and 2 liters overflow to lock2.\n\n                  If we have 1 pipe in lock1 and 2 in lock2:\n                      In the first second:\n                         lock1: gets 1 liter (from its pipe) -> becomes full? then the pipe at lock1 continues to pour: the excess (1 liter) goes to lock2.\n                         lock2: gets 1 liter from the overflow of lock1 and 2 liters from its own pipes -> total 3 liters? but lock2 only has volume 2 -> so it becomes full and then 1 liter overflows to the river.\n                  So it works.\n\n                  But note: the condition for prefix1: \n                         k1 = 1 (pipes in lock1) -> 1*1 = 1 >= S1=1 -> ok.\n                  for prefix2: \n                         k2 = 1 (lock1) + 2 (lock2) = 3 -> 3*1=3>=3 -> ok.\n\n              So total pipes=3.\n\n          But note: we can also open 2 pipes in lock1 and 1 in lock2? \n              k1=2, k2=3.\n              At time1: \n                  lock1: 2 liters -> fills lock1 (1 liter) and overflows 1 liter to lock2.\n                  lock2: gets 1 liter from lock1 and 1 liter from its own pipe -> total 2 liters -> full.\n              So it works.\n\n          In all cases, we need 3 pipes.\n\n          And our formula: k_n = max(r1, r2, ..., rn) = max(1,3)=3.\n\n          But wait, what if we do:\n              k1 = 1, then k2 = max(ceil(3/1), 1) = 3 -> so we open 2 more in lock2 -> total=3.\n\n          So the formula is: \n              k_n = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\n          However, note: ceil(S_i/t) might not be an integer? but k_i must be an integer. And we defined r_i = ceil(S_i/t).\n\n          But is that sufficient? \n\n          Consider: \n              n=1, v1=3, t=2.\n              S1=3, r1 = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2.\n\n          Then we need 2 pipes.\n\n          How: \n              Open 2 pipes in lock1: then at time2, we have 4 liters? but lock1 only needs 3. \n              At time1: 2 liters -> lock1 gets 2 liters (not full, because 2<3) -> then at time2: 2 more liters -> total 4, which fills lock1 and 1 liter overflows.\n\n          But at time2, lock1 is full.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          However, what if we open only 1 pipe? \n              Then at time2: 2 liters -> not enough.\n\n          So we need 2.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal total pipes is: \n              K = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\n          But note: we also have the condition that the total water must be at least V: \n              K * t >= V   (which is the condition for i=n: ceil(S_n/t) is defined to be the smallest integer >= S_n/t, so K>=ceil(S_n/t) ensures K*t>=S_n).\n\n          And for i<n: \n              K >= ceil(S_i/t)  => K*t >= S_i.\n\n          So the condition is satisfied.\n\n          But is it the minimal? \n              We set K = max_i ceil(S_i/t). \n              Then for every i, K>=ceil(S_i/t) -> so K*t>=S_i.\n\n          And we cannot have a smaller K because if K' < K, then for the i that achieves the maximum, ceil(S_i/t)=K, then K'<K implies K'<ceil(S_i/t) -> then K'*t < S_i? \n              Since ceil(S_i/t) is the smallest integer >= S_i/t, then K' < ceil(S_i/t) implies K' <= ceil(S_i/t)-1, so K'*t <= (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i? \n              But note: ceil(S_i/t) is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to S_i/t, so:\n                  ceil(S_i/t) - 1 < S_i/t \n                  => (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i\n              So K'*t <= (ceil(S_i/t)-1)*t < S_i -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal total pipes is M = max_i ceil(S_i/t).\n\n          However, note: the problem says if it is impossible, print -1.\n\n          When is it impossible? \n              The minimal total pipes M must be at least ceil(S_n/t) (which is the condition for the entire system) and also we must have that the time t is at least the time to fill the lock that is the bottleneck for the prefixes.\n\n          But note: we have a more fundamental bottleneck: \n              The lock i cannot be filled until the entire prefix i is full. And the water for prefix i must come from the pipes in the first i locks. The minimal time to fill prefix i is at least S_i / (number of pipes in the first i locks). But we are given a fixed time t.\n\n          However, we have already incorporated that by requiring the number of pipes in the first i locks to be at least ceil(S_i/t).\n\n          But there is another constraint: the time must be at least the time to fill the first lock even if we open all pipes? \n\n          Actually, consider: \n              The first lock: we can only pour at most the number of pipes in the first lock per second. But if we open many pipes in the first lock, we can fill it faster. \n\n          However, our condition ceil(S_i/t) for i=1 is ceil(v1/t). This requires that the number of pipes in the first lock is at least ceil(v1/t). \n\n          But if t is less than v1, then ceil(v1/t) might be very large? \n\n          But note: we are allowed to open as many pipes as we want? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the minimum number of pipes to open\", and we are computing M = max_i ceil(S_i/t). \n\n          But if t is too small, then M might be very large? \n\n          But the problem says: if it is impossible, print -1.\n\n          When is it impossible? \n              It is impossible if even if we open all n pipes, we cannot fill the system in time t? \n                  But if we open all n pipes, then the total water per second is n, and at time t we have n*t liters. \n                  We need V = S_n liters. \n                  So if n*t < V, then it is impossible.\n\n          But note: our M might be greater than n? \n              Then we cannot open M pipes because there are only n locks.\n\n          Therefore, it is impossible if M > n.\n\n          However, also note: we cannot open more than n pipes.\n\n          So the condition for possibility is: \n              M <= n   (because we can open at most n pipes)\n\n          But also, we must have that the time t is at least the minimal time required to fill the entire system with n pipes? \n              The minimal time is at least ceil(V/n)? \n              But our condition for the entire system is: M >= ceil(V/t). \n              And if M>n, then we cannot achieve it.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            For a query t:\n              If t < min_time, then print -1, where min_time = max( max_{i} (S_i / i) , ceil(V/n) )? \n\n          Actually, from the condition: \n              We require that for each i: ceil(S_i/t) <= n, but also we require that the minimal total pipes M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) must be <= n.\n\n          But note: if M>n, then it is impossible.\n\n          However, there is a more fundamental lower bound on t: \n              The time t must be at least the minimal time required to fill the system, which is the maximum over i of (S_i / i) [because if we use i pipes for the first i locks, then the rate is i, so time must be at least S_i / i]. \n\n          Actually, the minimal time to fill the entire system is T_min = max_{i=1}^{n} (S_i / i). \n\n          Why? \n              Consider the prefix i: the total water required is S_i, and the number of pipes that can contribute to prefix i is at most i (if we open a pipe in each of the first i locks). So the rate for prefix i is at most i, so the time must be at least S_i / i.\n\n          Therefore, if t < T_min, then it is impossible.\n\n          But note: our condition M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) might be infinite if t is 0? \n\n          How to compute T_min? \n              T_min = max_i (S_i / i)\n\n          Then for a query t:\n              if t < T_min: \n                  print -1\n              else:\n                  M = max_i ceil(S_i / t)\n                  if M > n:\n                      print -1\n                  else:\n                      print M\n\n          But note: if t>=T_min, then for every i: \n              S_i / i <= T_min <= t   -> so S_i <= i * t  -> then ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n              because S_i/t <= i -> ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n              Example: S_i=3, t=2, i=2: ceil(3/2)=2, which is <=2 -> yes.\n              But what if i=1, S_i=3, t=2: ceil(3/2)=2, and 2<=1? no.\n\n          So we cannot guarantee M<=n by T_min? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n              For a fixed i: ceil(S_i/t) might be greater than i? \n                  Example: i=1, S_1=3, t=2: ceil(3/2)=2, which is greater than 1.\n\n          But we can open 2 pipes in the first lock? yes, because there is one lock, so we can open up to 1 pipe? no, we can open as many as we want in any lock? the problem does not say we can open only one pipe per lock? \n\n          The problem: \"For the j-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open\"\n\n          And we can open multiple pipes in the same lock? \n\n          The problem does not say we cannot. \n\n          Example: \"open pipes at locks 1, 3, and 4\" -> it doesn't say one pipe per lock? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"some pipes are opened simultaneously\" and \"the pipe attached to it\", so it seems each lock has one pipe? \n\n          But then we cannot open more than one pipe per lock.\n\n          Therefore, the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most i.\n\n          So the condition for prefix i: \n              k_i (which is at most i) * t >= S_i   -> so we require t >= S_i / i.\n\n          And if t < S_i / i for some i, then it is impossible.\n\n          But if t >= S_i / i for all i, then we can set k_i = ceil(S_i/t) and we have k_i <= i? \n              Why? \n                  Since t >= S_i / i, then S_i/t <= i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n                  Example: S_i=3, t=2, i=2: ceil(3/2)=2 <=2 -> yes.\n                  Example: S_i=3, t=1.5, i=2: 3/1.5=2 -> ceil(2)=2<=2 -> yes.\n                  Example: S_i=3, t=1, i=2: 3/1=3, ceil(3)=3, but 3>2 -> so we cannot open 3 pipes in the first 2 locks? because we can only open at most 2 pipes (one per lock) in the first 2 locks.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for possibility is:\n              (1) t >= T_min = max_i (S_i / i)\n              (2) For every i, ceil(S_i/t) <= i   (which is automatically satisfied if t>=T_min? because then S_i/t <= i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n                      but note: ceil(x) is the smallest integer >=x, and if x<=i, then ceil(x)<=i? \n                      Example: i=2, x=2.0 -> ceil(2.0)=2<=2 -> ok.\n                      Example: i=2, x=2.1 -> ceil(2.1)=3, but 3>2 -> not satisfied.\n\n          But if t>=T_min, then for every i: t>= S_i/i -> so S_i/t <= i, so x = S_i/t <= i, then ceil(x) is at most i? \n              Only if x is not greater than i? but it is <= i, but ceil(x) can be greater than i? \n              Example: i=2, x=2.1 -> ceil(2.1)=3, which is greater than 2.\n\n          Therefore, we must require that for every i: S_i/t <= i, and also ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n              But if S_i/t <= i, then ceil(S_i/t) might be greater than i? only if S_i/t is not an integer and the fractional part pushes it to the next integer that is greater than i? \n              But if i is an integer and S_i/t <= i, then ceil(S_i/t) is at most i? \n                  Example: i=2, S_i/t=2.0001 -> ceil=3? no, ceil(2.0001)=3? no, ceil(2.0001)=3 is not: ceil(2.0001)=3? \n                  Actually, ceil(2.0001)=3? no, ceil(2.0001)=3 is false: ceil(2.0001)=3? \n                  ceil(2.0001) is the smallest integer >=2.0001 -> which is 3? no, it is 3 only if 2.0001>3? \n\n          Let me compute: \n              ceil(2.0001) = 3? -> no, ceil(2.0001)=3 is not true. The next integer above 2.0001 is 3? no, the next integer is 3 only if we jump from 2 to 3? but 2.0001 is between 2 and 3, so ceil(2.0001)=3? -> no, ceil(2.0001)=3 is not correct: ceil(2.0001)=3 is false. \n              Actually, ceil(2.0001) = 3? -> no, ceil(2.0001) is 3? I think I'm confused.\n\n          The ceiling of x is the smallest integer not less than x.\n          For x=2.0001, the smallest integer not less than 2.0001 is 3? no, 2 is less than 2.0001? 2<2.0001, so 2 is less, then 3 is the next? but 3 is greater. But 2 is not >=2.0001? so the smallest integer that is >=2.0001 is 3? no, 3 is not the smallest. The integer 3 is greater than 2.0001, but 2 is less than 2.0001, so the smallest integer >=2.0001 is 3? that is not true: 3 is not the smallest, because 2.0001 is greater than 2 and less than 3, so the next integer is 3, but is there an integer between 2 and 3? no. So ceil(2.0001)=3? -> no, that is not: ceil(2.0001) should be 3? \n\n          Actually, no: \n              ceil(2.0)=2\n              ceil(2.0001)=3? -> no, that is not: ceil(2.0001) is 3? I think I have a mistake.\n\n          Let me check: \n              The integers: ... 1, 2, 3, ...\n              2.0001 is greater than 2 and less than 3. The smallest integer that is not less than 2.0001 is 3? no, 2 is less than 2.0001? yes, so 2 is not eligible. The next integer is 3, which is greater than 2.0001. So ceil(2.0001)=3.\n\n          But that is not correct: \n              Actually, the ceiling of 2.0001 is 3? -> no, that is not: the ceiling of 2.0001 is 3? \n              I think I have a confusion: \n                  ceil(2.0)=2\n                  ceil(2.1)=3? -> no, ceil(2.1) is 3? \n                  But 2.1 is between 2 and 3, and the smallest integer >=2.1 is 3? -> no, 3 is not the smallest, because 2 is not >=2.1, and 3 is the next integer. But 3 is the smallest integer that is >=2.1? yes.\n\n          However, that is not true: the integer 3 is not the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.1? because there is no integer between 2 and 3. So 3 is the ceiling.\n\n          But then for i=2, we have ceil(2.1)=3, and 3>2 -> so we cannot open 3 pipes in the first 2 locks because there are only 2 locks? \n\n          But note: we can open more than one pipe per lock? \n\n          The problem does not explicitly say we can open only one pipe per lock. \n          The problem says: \"For the j-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open\"\n\n          And in the example: \n              \"open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4\"\n\n          This suggests that we open one pipe per lock.\n\n          Therefore, we can open at most one pipe per lock.\n\n          So the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most i.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for possibility is:\n              (1) t >= T_min = max_i (S_i / i)\n              (2) For every i, ceil(S_i/t) <= i   [because we can have at most i pipes in the first i locks]\n\n          But if t>=T_min, then S_i/t <= i, but ceil(S_i/t) might be > i? as in the example i=2, S_i=2.1, t=1 -> then S_i/t=2.1, ceil=3>2.\n\n          So we must check ceil(S_i/t) <= i for every i.\n\n          And if for some i, ceil(S_i/t) > i, then it is impossible.\n\n          But note: if t>=T_min, then S_i/t <= i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i? \n              Not necessarily: ceil(2.1)=3>2.\n\n          Therefore, we must require: \n              For every i: S_i/t <= i   (which is t>= S_i/i) and also ceil(S_i/t) <= i.\n\n          But ceil(S_i/t) <= i  <=> S_i/t <= i   (because if S_i/t <= i, then ceil(S_i/t) is at most i only if S_i/t is not in (i-1, i] such that ceil(S_i/t)=i? \n          Actually, if S_i/t <= i, then ceil(S_i/t) is at most i if and only if S_i/t <= i? \n              Because if S_i/t is in (i-1, i], then ceil(S_i/t)=i, which is <=i -> ok.\n              If S_i/t > i, then ceil(S_i/t) > i -> not allowed.\n\n          But we already have t>=T_min, which ensures S_i/t<=i.\n\n          And if S_i/t<=i, then ceil(S_i/t) is at most i? \n              Since ceil(x) is the smallest integer >=x, and x<=i, then ceil(x)<=i? \n                  Example: i=3, x=2.1 -> ceil=3<=3 -> ok.\n                  Example: i=3, x=3.0 -> ceil=3<=3 -> ok.\n                  Example: i=3, x=3.1 -> but we have x<=i, so x<=3, so 3.1 is not allowed.\n\n          Therefore, if t>=T_min, then for every i, S_i/t<=i, and then ceil(S_i/t) is an integer between floor(S_i/t) and i, and since floor(S_i/t)>= floor(0) and ceil(S_i/t) is at most i, then it is always <=i.\n\n          Why? \n              Because if x = S_i/t <= i, then ceil(x) is at most i? \n                  The largest integer that is the ceiling of a number <=i is i? \n                  Example: x=i -> ceil(x)=i.\n                  Example: x=i-0.5 -> ceil(x)=i.\n                  Example: x=i-0.0001 -> ceil(x)=i.\n\n          So if x<=i, then ceil(x)<=i? \n              Not if i is not an integer? but i is an integer (it is the index, an integer).\n\n          Therefore, if t>=T_min, then for every i, ceil(S_i/t)<=i.\n\n          Then the minimal total pipes is M = max_i ceil(S_i/t), and we have M<=n? \n              Because for i=n, ceil(S_n/t)<=n? \n                  But we have t>=T_min, and T_min>= S_n/n, so S_n/t<=n, so ceil(S_n/t)<=n.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for possibility is only t>=T_min.\n\n          And then the answer is M = max_i ceil(S_i/t).\n\n          But note: the problem says the total water must be at least V: \n              M * t >= V? \n              Since M>=ceil(S_n/t), then M*t>=S_n.\n\n          So it is sufficient.\n\n          Therefore, for a query t:\n              T_min = max_i (S_i / i)   [for i from 1 to n]\n              if t < T_min:\n                  print -1\n              else:\n                  M = 0\n                  for i in range(1, n+1):\n                      # S_i = prefix sum up to i\n                      # compute r = ceil(S_i / t)\n                      # But note: if t is 0? but t>=1 per input.\n                      r = (S_i + t - 1) // t   # if we use integer arithmetic? but S_i and t are integers, but S_i/t might not be integer.\n                      # Actually, ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b for positive integers.\n                      if r > M:\n                          M = r\n                  print(M)\n\n          However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000, but the number of queries q can be up to 200000, and n up to 200000, so we cannot iterate over i for each query (which would be 200000*200000 = 40e9, too slow).\n\n          We need to precompute T_min = max_i (S_i / i) for the entire system.\n\n          And for the queries, we want to compute M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) quickly.\n\n          How to compute M = max_i ceil(S_i/t) without iterating over i for each query?\n\n          Note: S_i is the prefix sum, and i goes from 1 to n.\n\n          We have: \n              ceil(S_i/t) = floor((S_i-1)/t) + 1.\n\n          But we want the maximum over i.\n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute an array A where A_i = S_i, and then for a fixed t, we want:\n              M = max_{i} ceil(A_i/t)\n\n          And we have up to 200000 queries and n up to 200000.\n\n          We can precompute the array A = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_n] for the entire system.\n\n          Then for each query, we iterate i from 1 to n? -> O(n) per query, total O(q*n) = 200000*200000 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\n          We need a better way.\n\n          Observation: \n              The function f_i(t) = ceil(A_i/t) is a non-increasing function in t.\n\n          And we want M(t) = max_i f_i(t).\n\n          We can try to precompute for all t? but t up to 10^9.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the maximum over i of ceil(A_i/t) is also ceil( max_i (A_i) / t )? \n              No: because if we have two i: \n                  i1: A_i1 = 10, i2: A_i2=20, t=10: \n                      ceil(10/10)=1, ceil(20/10)=2 -> max=2.\n                  ceil( max_i A_i / t ) = ceil(20/10)=2 -> matches.\n\n              But consider: \n                  i1: A_i1=10, i2: A_i2=15, t=10: \n                      ceil(10/10)=1, ceil(15/10)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> max=2.\n                  ceil(15/10)=2.\n\n              But what if we have i1: A_i1=10, i2: A_i2=11, t=10: \n                  ceil(10/10)=1, ceil(11/10)=2 -> max=2.\n                  ceil(11/10)=2.\n\n          So it seems M(t) = ceil( max_i A_i / t )? \n              But wait: the maximum of ceil(A_i/t) is not necessarily ceil( max_i A_i / t )? \n                  Example: \n                      A = [1, 3] and t=2:\n                          ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> max=2.\n                          ceil(max_A/t)=ceil(3/2)=2.\n                  Example: \n                      A = [3, 1] -> same.\n\n          But consider: \n              A = [100, 1] and t=10: \n                  ceil(100/10)=10, ceil(1/10)=1 -> max=10.\n                  ceil(max_A/t)=ceil(100/10)=10.\n\n          So it is always: \n              M(t) = ceil( max_i A_i / t )   ?\n\n          But wait: \n              We have A_i = S_i, and the maximum prefix sum is S_n = V? \n                  But not necessarily: the prefix sums are non-decreasing? \n                  S_i = v1+...+vi, so S_1<=S_2<=...<=S_n.\n\n          Therefore, the maximum prefix sum is S_n.\n\n          So then M(t) = ceil(S_n / t) ?\n\n          But that is not true: \n              Example: n=2, v1=1, v2=2, then S1=1, S2=3.\n              For t=1: \n                  ceil(1/1)=1, ceil(3/1)=3, so M=3.\n              But ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n          But then what about the other prefixes? \n              We have to take the max over i, and the maximum of the ceil values is 3, which is ceil(S_n/t).\n\n          And in the first test case: \n              S1=1, S2=3 -> max_i ceil(S_i/t)=max(ceil(1/1),ceil(3/1))=max(1,3)=3.\n\n          And ceil(S_n/t)=3.\n\n          But consider: \n              n=2, v1=3, v2=1, then S1=3, S2=4.\n              For t=2: \n                  ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, so M=2.\n              ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(4/2)=2.\n\n          And if we have:\n              n=3, v1=1, v2=1, v3=1, then S1=1, S2=2, S3=3.\n              For t=2: \n                  ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, so M=2.\n              ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n          Therefore, because the prefix sums are non-decreasing, we have:\n              S_n = max_i S_i.\n\n          And then ceil(S_n/t) = max_i ceil(S_i/t) because for any i, S_i<=S_n, so ceil(S_i/t)<=ceil(S_n/t) (since the ceil function is non-decreasing).\n\n          Therefore, M(t) = ceil(S_n/t).\n\n          But wait: is the ceil function non-decreasing? \n              If a<=b, then ceil(a)<=ceil(b)? \n                  Example: a=1.5, b=1.6: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2 -> 2<=2.\n                  a=1.1, b=1.9: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2.\n                  a=1.9, b=2.0: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2.\n                  a=1.9, b=2.1: ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=3 -> 2<=3.\n\n          So yes, ceil is non-decreasing.\n\n          Therefore, for non-decreasing S_i, we have:\n              M(t) = ceil(S_n/t)\n\n          But then why did we care about the other prefixes? \n\n          Let me test with the first example of the problem: \n              n=5 locks: \n                  v = [2,5, 1, 3, 3] -> from the example note.\n\n          But the example note says: \n              \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. ... In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n          The sample input for the first example is not provided in the problem statement.\n\n          But if we have n=5, and volumes [2,5,1,3,3]? \n              S1=2, S2=7, S3=8, S4=11, S5=14.\n\n          T_min = max_i (S_i/i) = max(2/1, 7/2, 8/3, 11/4, 14/5) = max(2, 3.5, 2.666..., 2.75, 2.8) = 3.5.\n\n          For the sixth query: t=5.\n              M = ceil(14/5)=ceil(2.8)=3.\n\n          And the example says we open 3 pipes.\n\n          For the second query: t=5 -> answer=3.\n\n          For the first query: t=1 -> \n              T_min=3.5, and t=1<3.5 -> -1.\n\n          For the third query: t=3 -> \n              T_min=3.5, t=3<3.5 -> -1.\n\n          For the fourth query: t=4 -> \n              T_min=3.5, t=4>=3.5 -> then M=ceil(14/4)=ceil(3.5)=4.\n\n          But the example says for queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1.\n\n          Why is the fourth query -1? \n              The example says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\"\n\n          But we computed for t=4: M=4, and 4<=n=5, so we would output 4.\n\n          This contradicts.\n\n          I see: the example says: \n              \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n          How is that? \n              The first lock has volume=2. \n              If we open a pipe in lock1, then after 2 seconds, lock1 is full.\n              But if we open a pipe in lock2,3,4,5, then the water for lock1 only comes from the pipe in lock1? \n                  No, if we open a pipe in lock2, then the water for lock2 will first go to lock1? \n\n          The system: \n              \"When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second. The locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock i to the lock i+1.\"\n\n          This means: \n              The water from a pipe at lock2 goes directly to lock2? and if lock2 is not full, it stays in lock2. Only when lock2 is full, the excess goes to lock3.\n\n          But lock2 cannot be filled until lock1 is full? \n\n          Actually, no: the water from lock2's pipe goes into lock2, and lock2 can be filled independently? \n\n          However, the problem says: \n              \"water will be transferred further. Water exceeding the volume of the last lock pours out to the river.\"\n\n          And the picture: \n              \"Because locks 1, 3, and 4 are already filled, effectively the water goes to locks 2 and 5.\"\n\n          This suggests that the water from a pipe at lock1 goes to lock1, and if lock1 is full, then it overflows to lock2.\n          The water from a pipe at lock2 goes to lock2, and if lock2 is full, then it overflows to lock3.\n\n          But lock1 and lock2 are not in series for the water from lock2's pipe? \n\n          The water from lock2's pipe does not go through lock1. \n\n          Therefore, the system is: \n              Each lock has its own pipe that pours water directly into that lock.\n\n          So the water from lock2's pipe does not go to lock1.\n\n          Therefore, the first lock can only be filled by its own pipe.\n\n          So the time to fill lock1 is at least ceil(v1 / k1), where k1 is the number of pipes we open in lock1.\n\n          And we can open at most one pipe in lock1.\n\n          Therefore, the time to fill lock1 is at least v1.\n\n          In the example: v1=2, so we need at least 2 seconds.\n\n          Therefore, for a query t, we require t>=v1, and similarly for locki, the water can only come from the pipes in lock1 to locki, but specifically, the water for locki from a pipe at lockj (j>i) doesn't help for locki.\n\n          And the water for locki from a pipe at lockj (j<=i) will only be available after the locks between j and i-1 are full.\n\n          This is complex.\n\n          After reading a known solution for the problem (since it's from a contest): \n              We must compute:\n                  T_min = max( v1, ceil(v1+v2/2), ceil((v1+v2+v3)/3), ... )\n\n          But note: the water for lock1: only from pipe1 -> so time>=v1.\n          for lock2: we can get water from pipe1 (overflow) and pipe2. \n              The water from pipe1: after lock1 is full, the overflow from pipe1 goes to lock2. But lock1 is full at time at least v1 (if we open pipe1). \n              Then the water for lock2: \n                  from pipe1: starting at time v1, we get 1 liter per second from pipe1 (if we opened it) and from pipe2: 1 liter per second from time0.\n              So the total rate for lock2 after time v1 is (if we opened both pipes) 2 liters per second.\n              But before time v1, lock2 only gets water from pipe2.\n\n          Let x be the number of pipes we open in lock1 to i.\n\n          The water in lock2 at time t is:\n              min(v1, k1 * t)   -> this is the water that stays in lock1, so the overflow from lock1 is: max(0, k1*t - v1)\n              plus the water from lock2's pipe: min(v2, k2 * t)   -> but wait, the water from lock2's pipe might also overflow if lock2 is full? \n\n          Actually, the water in lock2 is: \n              = min(v2, (overflow from lock1) + (water from lock2's pipe))\n\n          But note: the overflow from lock1 can only be used for lock2, and the water from lock2's pipe is added to lock2.\n\n          So the total water available for lock2 by time t is: \n              overflow1 = max(0, k1*t - v1)\n              from lock2 = k2 * t   [but this water might also overflow if lock2 is full? and then go to lock3, but for lock2 we only care about up to v2]\n\n          Then the water in lock2 is: min(v2, overflow1 + k2*t)\n\n          We require this to be at least v2.\n\n          So: overflow1 + k2*t >= v2\n          => max(0, k1*t - v1) + k2*t >= v2\n\n          This is a complex condition.\n\n          Given the complexity, known solutions for the problem \"River Locks\" use:\n\n              T_min = max( S_i / i for i in [1,n] )\n\n          and then for a query t:\n              if t < T_min: \n                  print -1\n              else:\n                  print (S_n + t - 1) // t   # which is ceil(S_n/t)\n\n          But note: the sample provided in the problem: \n              Query1: t=1 -> -1\n              Query2: t=5 -> 3\n              Query3: t=3 -> -1\n              Query4: t=4 -> -1   (but our calculation using T_min=3.5 and then for t=4: ceil(14/4)=4, but the example says -1)\n\n          Why is query4 (t=4) -1 in the example? \n              The example says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\"\n\n          And our T_min=3.5, and t=4>=3.5, so we would output 4.\n\n          But the example says -1.\n\n          I see: the example says: \n              \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n          This suggests that the first lock requires 4 seconds? \n              But if we open a pipe in the first lock, it takes 2 seconds to fill the first lock.\n\n          Unless we are not allowed to open a pipe in the first lock? \n\n          The problem: we can open pipes arbitrarily, but note the condition for the first lock: \n              The water for the first lock can only come from a pipe in the first lock.\n\n          And we can open at most one pipe in the first lock.\n\n          Therefore, the first lock will receive at most 1 liter per second from its pipe, so it takes at least v1 seconds.\n\n          In this example, v1=2, so we need at least 2 seconds.\n\n          For t=4, 4>=2, so it should be possible"
