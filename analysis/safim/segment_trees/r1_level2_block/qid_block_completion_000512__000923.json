Known solution (from Codeforces) for the problem \"Stamp Coloring\" (problem D in Div4 round) is:\n\n              t = int(input().strip())\n              for _ in range(t):\n                  n = int(input().strip())\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  if s == 'W' * n:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n                      continue\n                  if n == 1 and s ! = 'W':\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      continue\n                  # Split by W\n                  parts = s.split('W')\n                  valid = True\n                  for part in parts: if part == '':\n                          continue\n                      if len(part) == 1:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                      # Check if the part has both R and B?\n                      if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But note: the problem statement example: \n              Example 5: \"BRB\" -> YES? In the example: \"WWW\" -> \"WRB\" (by stamping the last two) -> then \"BRB\" by stamping the first two? How: \n                  Start: WWW\n                  Step1: stamp on positions 2-3: so we set them to RB -> then we have W, R, B -> W R B.\n                  Step2: stamp on positions 1-2: we set them to BR: then position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R -> then we have B, R, B -> BRB. So \"BRB\" is possible. Now, split by 'W': the string is \"BRB\", which has no W -> the entire string is one segment. The segment has length 3 -> not 1, and it has at least one R and one B? -> yes. So it returns YES. Example 6: \"RBB\" -> YES? How: \n                  Start: WWW\n                  Step1: stamp on 2-3: set to RB -> W R B\n                  Step2: stamp on 1-2: set to RB? -> then position1: W becomes R? and position2: R becomes B? -> R B B -> RBB. So \"RBB\" is possible. The segment is \"RBB\": has both R and B? -> yes. Example: \"RR\" -> \n                Split: the segment is \"RR\". It has no 'B' -> so the condition fails -> NO. But is \"RR\" possible?",

So we write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          n = len(s)\n          if s == 'W'*n:\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts:\n                  if not part: \n                      continue\n                  if len(part)==1 or ('R' not in part) or ('B' not in part):\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO') However, note: the condition can be written as:\n\n          if len(part)==1:\n              valid = False\n              break\n          if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n              valid = False\n              break\n\n        But we can combine. Alternatively, we can write: if part and (len(part)==1 or set(part)=={'R'} or set(part)=={'B'}):\n              valid = False\n              break\n\n        But the above condition is the same. We'll use the condition: \n          if part and (len(part)==1 or ('R' not in part) or ('B' not in part)): \n            -> but wait: if the part is non-empty, then we check: if the length is 1 -> invalid. Also, if the part does not contain both R and B -> invalid. Actually, we can break it down:\n\n          if part:   # non-empty\n              if len(part)==1:\n                  valid = False; break\n              elif 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                  valid = False; break But the problem says: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B. So if either is missing, it's invalid. We can write:\n\n          if part != '':\n              if len(part)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if not ('R' in part and 'B' in part):\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n        But the condition \"if not ('R' in part and 'B' in part)\" is the same as \"if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part\". So we'll use:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          n = len(s)\n          if s == 'W'*n:\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts: if part == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(part) == 1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO') However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe. But note: the example of a segment of length 2: \n          \"RR\": invalid -> because 'B' not in part -> condition fails -> we break and print \"NO\". This matches.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: We have n items and q queries. We are given the prices of the items. For each query (x, y), we need to compute the maximum total value of free items when the promotion is: if you buy at least x items, then the y cheapest ones are free.\n\n Important note: The customer can choose which items to purchase (any subset). Therefore, to maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest in the purchase), the customer would want to have as many expensive items as possible, but note that the free items are the cheapest ones in the purchase. So the strategy is to buy x items that include as many expensive items as possible, but then the free ones are the cheapest in that set. Therefore, we want to choose the set of x items that has the largest sum of the y smallest items? Actually, note: we are allowed to choose any x items. We want to maximize the free part, which is the sum of the y cheapest in the chosen set.\n\n However, observe: the free part is the sum of the y cheapest. To maximize that, we want the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible. But note: we can only choose x items. How to do that? We can choose the top (x) items that are the most expensive, but then the y cheapest in that set are the last y of these x. Actually, we cannot do better: because if we include a cheaper item, then that cheaper item would be included in the free part and might lower the sum? Or if we skip an expensive item and include a cheaper one, then the free part would include that cheaper one and possibly others that are even cheaper? \n\n Actually, the optimal strategy is to take the x most expensive items. Why?\n - The free part is the y cheapest in the set. In the set of the x most expensive items, the y cheapest are the last y of these (which are the smallest among the top x). If we replace one of the top (x-y) items (which are the most expensive) with an even more expensive item, that doesn't help because we are already taking the most expensive. But if we replace one of the top x with a cheaper item, then the set of the y cheapest might become even cheaper? So we want to avoid that.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n   Sort the prices in descending order (so the most expensive first).\n   Precompute a prefix sum array for the sorted array.\n\n Then for a query (x, y):\n   We are going to take the top x items: [0, 1, ..., x-1] in the descending sorted array.\n   The y cheapest in this set are the last y of these, which in the descending order are the ones from index (x-y) to (x-1). But note: in the descending order, the last y are the smallest in the set.\n\n However, note the code provided already has:\n   n,q=map(int,input().split())\n   a=[0]\n   for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]: \n        ... # we are building an array 'a'\n\n   Then for each query: \n        x,y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n How is the array 'a' built?\n   The input is sorted and then reversed. So the array we are iterating over is the prices sorted in descending order.\n\n   The code currently: \n        a = [0]\n        for x in sorted(...)[::-1]:\n            ... # we are going to append something to a?\n\n   Then we use a[x] and a[x-y]. This suggests that 'a' is a prefix sum array of the descending sorted array.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 5] (from the note: first query: x=3, y=2 -> free sum=8)\n        Descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n\n        We want for x=3: the set is [5,5,3]. The two cheapest are 5 and 3? But wait: the two cheapest in the set are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But note: the set is [5,5,3] -> sorted ascending: [3,5,5] -> the two smallest are 3 and 5 -> sum=8.\n\n        How do we get 8? \n          We need the prefix sum for the descending array? \n          Let the descending array be: [5,5,3,2,1]\n          We want the last two of the first three: which are the elements at indices 1 and 2? -> 5 and 3? But that would be 8.\n\n        How to compute with prefix sums?\n          Let prefix[i] = sum of the first i elements (i.e., indices 0 to i-1) in the descending array.\n\n          Then the set of the first x: prefix[x] = 5+5+3 = 13.\n          The free part is the last y of these? But note: the last y in the set (which is the smallest in the set) are the last y in the descending array? Actually, in the descending array, the set we take is the first x, and the smallest in that set are the last y of the first x? \n\n          We can also think: the entire set of x items: prefix[x] = 13.\n          The non-free part is the top (x-y) items: prefix[x-y] = prefix[1] = 5.\n          Then the free part = total of the set - non-free part = 13 - 5 = 8.\n\n        So the formula: free part = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]?\n\n        But wait: the non-free part is the top (x-y) items? Yes, because we are taking the top x items, and the free part is the remaining y items. However, the non-free part is the most expensive (x-y) items? Then the free part is the rest.\n\n        Therefore, we need a prefix sum array for the descending array.\n\n        Steps:\n          a = [0]\n          for price in sorted_list_descending:\n              a.append(a[-1] + price)\n\n        Then for a query (x, y): \n            total = a[x]   # the entire set of x items\n            non_free = a[x-y]   # the top (x-y) items (the most expensive ones)\n            free = total - non_free = a[x] - a[x-y]\n\n        This matches the provided print statement.\n\n        So what is missing? The building of the array 'a'. Currently, the loop is:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:\n              # we need to append to a: the cumulative sum\n\n        We can do:\n\n          a = [0]\n          arr = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)   # but note: the code uses sorted(...)[::-1] which is the same as reverse=True.\n\n        However, the code already has:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:\n\n        We can complete the loop by:\n\n          a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\n        But note: the array 'a' should have n+1 elements (from 0 to n). The current a starts with [0]. Then we iterate over n items, so we will have a[0..n] (n+1 elements).\n\n        Then the query: we use a[x] and a[x-y]. Since x and x-y are at most n, and we have n+1 elements, it's safe.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the prices are given as p1, p2, ... pn. We are sorting and then reversing.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is the body of the for-loop that appends the cumulative sum.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n          n,q=map(int,input().split())\n          a=[0]\n          prices = sorted(map(int, input().split()))   # ascending\n          # then we reverse to get descending\n          for x in prices[::-1]:\n              a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\n        But note: the code already has the sorted and reversed in the for-loop. So we just need to complete the for-loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()), reverse=True):\n              a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\n        But the code uses [::-1] on the sorted list. So we can do:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int, input().split()))[::-1]:\n              a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\n        However, the current code has:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:\n              a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\n        But note: the array 'a' is built and then we have to process q queries. The current code for the queries is:\n\n          for _ in[0]*q:\n              x,y=map(int,input().split())\n              print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\n        However, we must note: the array 'a' now has indices 0..n. The element a[i] is the prefix sum of the first i items in the descending array.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: [1,2,3,5,5] -> sorted ascending: [1,2,3,5,5] -> reversed: [5,5,3,2,1]\n          a[0]=0\n          a[1]=5\n          a[2]=5+5=10\n          a[3]=10+3=13\n          a[4]=13+2=15\n          a[5]=15+1=16\n\n        Query: (3,2): \n          a[3]=13, a[3-2]=a[1]=5 -> 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n        But note: the query uses x and x-y. What if x-y is 0? then a[0]=0, which is safe.\n\n        However, what if x is greater than the length of a? But note x<=n (from input: x<=n). And we built a with n+1 elements.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the body of the for-loop: we append a new element to a which is the last element of a plus the current x.\n\n        So we write: \n          program1: \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n\n        But note: the code already has the for-loop header. We just need to write the body.\n\n        However, the code has a for-loop without a body? We must complete the body.\n\n        Also note: the code after the for-loop is the queries. We must not change that.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is the body of the for-loop: one line.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  Problem: Given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B'), determine if it is possible to obtain s by starting from all 'W' and applying the stamp (which colors two adjacent cells as either RB or BR) any number of times (with the stamp always covering two adjacent cells, and can be applied multiple times to the same cell).\n\n  Important constraints: \n    - The stamp must cover two adjacent cells and cannot be partially outside.\n    - The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n\n  Observations:\n    - The operations are reversible? Actually, we can think in terms of invariants.\n\n  Known approach for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems like \"Stamp Coloring\"):\n\n    We note:\n      - The entire process can be seen as operations that assign colors to adjacent pairs. Moreover, note that the stamp always assigns one red and one blue to two adjacent cells. \n\n    However, note that the same cell can be stamped multiple times. Each stamping flips the color of the two cells? Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells\". So if a cell is stamped multiple times, its color might change multiple times.\n\n    How does the color change?\n      The stamp has two forms: BR and RB. But note that the stamp always sets the two cells to one red and one blue. However, the order matters.\n\n      Consider a cell that is stamped multiple times. Each stamping operation that covers the cell will set it to either R or B, but the operation also depends on the neighbor.\n\n      Alternate approach: \n        We can use a known solution for this problem (which is a common problem). The known solution is:\n\n          We split the string by the white cells. Then, for each contiguous segment of non-white cells (only R and B), we check:\n            - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible (because the stamp covers two adjacent cells, so we cannot color a single cell without affecting a neighbor; and if the neighbor is white, we cannot use the stamp? because the stamp must cover two adjacent non-white? Actually, we can stamp over a white and then later stamp again? But note: we start with all white. How to get a single non-white? We cannot: because the stamp always colors two adjacent cells. So a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n            - Also, we note that the entire string might be non-white. Then we need to check the parity? \n\n        Actually, known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem D) is:\n\n          Step 1: If the entire string is white, then we don't need any operation -> YES.\n\n          Step 2: Split the string by 'W'. Then for each contiguous segment (substring) of non-white (which we call seg):\n\n            - If the segment has length 1: then it's impossible -> return NO.\n\n            - Additionally, we require that the segment must have at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? Actually, no: because we can have a segment of all 'B'? But how?\n\n          However, note: the stamp always produces one R and one B. So if we have a segment of all the same color, how can we get it?\n\n          Example: \n            \"BB\": \n              We can do: \n                WW -> stamp: BR (if we use BR on the first two) -> then we have BR. \n                Then we stamp again on the same two: now the stamp would set them to the opposite? But note the stamp can be applied as either BR or RB. \n                If we apply BR again: \n                  First cell: was B -> becomes R? \n                  Second cell: was R -> becomes B? \n                Actually, the operation is not additive? The stamp sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So if we apply the same stamp again, we get BR again? \n\n          How to get \"BB\"? \n            We can do:\n              Start: WW\n              Apply stamp as RB on the two: then we get RB.\n              Then apply stamp as BR on the same two: then we get BR? -> no, because the stamp sets the two cells: \n                First cell: R -> becomes B? \n                Second cell: B -> becomes R? \n              So we get BR again? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use two stamps on overlapping areas? \n\n          Example for \"BB\" on two cells? \n            Actually, we cannot get \"BB\" on two adjacent cells? \n            Why? \n              The stamp always sets one to R and one to B. So we cannot have two B's? \n\n          But wait: the problem says the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. \n\n          How about three cells? \n            We want \"BBB\" (but note: the problem says the stamp must cover two adjacent cells, so we can do:\n\n              Step1: stamp on cells 1-2: then we get RBW\n              Step2: stamp on cells 2-3: then we get R (from cell1), then for cell2: originally B, now we stamp with (say) BR: so cell2 becomes R? and cell3 becomes B? -> R R B? \n\n          How to get \"BB\" in a segment of two? \n\n          Actually, known solution from Codeforces problems (like \"Stamp Coloring\"):\n\n            We note:\n              - The operation is linear? in terms of counts? \n              - Let R=1 and B=0? or use modulo arithmetic?\n\n          Insight: \n            The stamp flips the colors? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to specific colors. But note: we can consider the relative counts.\n\n          Known solution (from accepted codes in Codeforces for the same problem) is:\n\n            We split the string by 'W'. For each segment in the split:\n              if segment == \"\": skip.\n              else:\n                 if the segment has length 1 -> return \"NO\"\n                 else: \n                    # Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n                    if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment:\n                         return \"NO\"\n\n            Then after all segments, return \"YES\".\n\n          Why is that?\n            Explanation: \n              - A segment of length 1 is impossible (as we cannot color a single non-white without coloring an adjacent one, and if we try to color the adjacent one, then we have two non-white, but then we cannot leave one as non-white and the other as white? Actually, we can only color two at a time. So a single non-white cell is impossible).\n\n              - Why must the segment have both 'R' and 'B'? \n                  Because the stamp always produces one R and one B. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and one B? \n\n            But consider: \n              Example: \"RR\" -> is that possible?\n                We can do: \n                  Start: WW\n                  Apply stamp as RB: then we get RB? -> not RR.\n\n                How to get \"RR\"?\n                  We can do:\n                    Step1: stamp on the two as BR: then we get BR (B at first, R at second).\n                    Step2: then stamp again on the same two as RB: then the first becomes R and the second becomes B? -> RB again? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use two stamps on overlapping three cells to get two R's? \n\n                Example for three cells: \n                  We want \"RRW\": \n                    Step1: stamp on cells 1-2: BR W -> BRW\n                    Step2: stamp on cells 1-2 again: now we use RB: then cell1 becomes R, cell2 becomes B? -> RBW -> not RRW.\n\n                How about:\n                  Step1: stamp on cells 1-2: BR W\n                  Step2: stamp on cells 2-3: then we have cell2 (R) and cell3 (W) -> we stamp as RB: then cell2 becomes R? and cell3 becomes B? -> then we have B (cell1), R (cell2), B (cell3) -> BRB.\n\n                Then step3: stamp on cells 1-2: then cell1 (B) becomes R, cell2 (R) becomes B -> R and B -> RB and then cell3 is B -> RBB.\n\n                It seems difficult to get two adjacent R's.\n\n            Actually, the known solution is: each contiguous segment (without white) must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n            Why? \n              Because the stamp always sets one R and one B. Therefore, the entire segment must have an even number of R and B? Not exactly. \n\n            Alternate invariant: \n              Consider the entire segment. Let f(i) be the number of times the stamp has been applied to cell i (mod 2). Then the color of cell i is determined by the parity of the stamping operations that cover it? \n\n            Actually, we can model the coloring as:\n\n              Let the stamping operation on [i, i+1] add 1 to both cells. Then the color of a cell is determined by the parity of the total stamps that covered it. But then how do we assign R and B?\n\n            However, note the stamp has two forms: \n              Form1: [R, B] \n              Form2: [B, R]\n\n            So if we let:\n              For form1: at position i: R, at position i+1: B.\n              For form2: at position i: B, at position i+1: R.\n\n            We can assign:\n              Let a_i be the number of times the stamp has been applied to the segment [i, i+1] (for the left stamp) and also to [i-1, i] (for the right stamp). But it's complicated.\n\n            Known solution (from Codeforces) for the problem \"Stamp Coloring\" (problem D in Div4 round) is:\n\n              t = int(input().strip())\n              for _ in range(t):\n                  n = int(input().strip())\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  if s == 'W' * n:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n                      continue\n                  if n == 1 and s != 'W':\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      continue\n                  # Split by W\n                  parts = s.split('W')\n                  valid = True\n                  for part in parts:\n                      if part == '':\n                          continue\n                      if len(part) == 1:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                      # Check if the part has both R and B?\n                      if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But note: the problem statement example: \n              Example 5: \"BRB\" -> YES? \n                In the example: \"WWW\" -> \"WRB\" (by stamping the last two) -> then \"BRB\" by stamping the first two? \n                How: \n                  Start: WWW\n                  Step1: stamp on positions 2-3: so we set them to RB -> then we have W, R, B -> W R B.\n                  Step2: stamp on positions 1-2: we set them to BR: then position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R -> then we have B, R, B -> BRB.\n\n                So \"BRB\" is possible. Now, split by 'W': the string is \"BRB\", which has no W -> the entire string is one segment. \n                The segment has length 3 -> not 1, and it has at least one R and one B? -> yes. So it returns YES.\n\n            Example 6: \"RBB\" -> YES? \n                How: \n                  Start: WWW\n                  Step1: stamp on 2-3: set to RB -> W R B\n                  Step2: stamp on 1-2: set to RB? -> then position1: W becomes R? and position2: R becomes B? -> R B B -> RBB.\n\n                So \"RBB\" is possible. The segment is \"RBB\": has both R and B? -> yes.\n\n            Example: \"RR\" -> \n                Split: the segment is \"RR\". \n                It has no 'B' -> so the condition fails -> NO.\n\n            But is \"RR\" possible? \n                We have two cells: \n                  We can only stamp on them. The first stamp: we set to either BR or RB. \n                  Then if we stamp again: \n                    If we use the same form: \n                      First stamp: BR -> then stamp again with BR: sets to BR again? \n                    If we use the opposite form: \n                      First stamp: BR -> then stamp with RB: sets to RB -> which is the same as BR? \n                  So we cannot get RR.\n\n            Therefore, the solution for program2.py:\n\n              We are given: \n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n                  # This reads every second line starting from the second line (so the test case strings). \n                  # The first line is t, then the next lines are: [n, string, n, string, ...]\n\n              We can do:\n\n                t = ... (but the loop is already set to iterate over the strings of the test cases)\n\n                For each string s (which is the picture, and note it has a newline? we should strip?):\n\n                Steps for one test case:\n                  n = ... (but we don't have n in the loop? actually, the loop variable s is the string of the picture)\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == 'W' * len(s):\n                         print(\"YES\")\n                         continue   # but we are in the loop, so we need to output for each test case.\n\n                    # But note: the problem says the total length of all test cases <= 10^5, so we can split.\n\n                    # Split the string by 'W'\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                         if part == '':\n                             continue\n                         if len(part) == 1:\n                             valid = False\n                             break\n                         if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                             valid = False\n                             break\n\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n              However, note: what if the string starts or ends with 'W'? The split will create empty parts, which we skip.\n\n            But what about the example: \"WRB\" -> \n                Split: ['', 'RB', '']? Actually, no: \n                  s = \"WRB\" -> split by 'W' -> ['', 'RB'] -> then we check:\n                    part1: '' -> skip.\n                    part2: 'RB' -> length>=2 and has both R and B -> valid.\n\n            Example: \"RWR\" -> \n                Split: ['R', '', 'R'] -> \n                part1: 'R' -> invalid.\n\n            But is \"RWR\" possible? \n                We have three cells: \n                  We want: R at cell1, W at cell2, R at cell3.\n\n                How to get the first R? \n                  We must stamp on cell1 and cell2: then we set cell1 to R and cell2 to B? (if we use RB) -> then we have R and B at the first two. Then we want cell2 to become W? But we cannot change B to W? because the stamp only sets to R or B. And we cannot stamp a single cell. \n\n                How about: \n                  Step1: stamp on cell1-2: RB -> then we have R, B, W.\n                  Step2: stamp on cell2-3: then we set cell2 (B) to R? and cell3 (W) to B? -> then we have R, R, B.\n\n                Then we have \"RRB\", not \"RWR\".\n\n                How to get W in the middle? \n                  We cannot because the stamp always colors two adjacent cells. So if we have a W in the middle, then we must never stamp over it? But then how do we get the R on the left and the R on the right? \n\n                Actually, the middle cell must be stamped an even number of times? because if it is stamped an odd number of times, it becomes non-white. But we want it to be white. So the only way is to have the middle cell never stamped? \n\n                Then how to get the left R? We must stamp the left and the middle. But then the middle becomes non-white. Contradiction.\n\n                Therefore, \"RWR\" is impossible. And our condition: \n                  Split: ['R','','R'] -> the first part 'R' (length=1) -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            Therefore, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n              for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                  s = s.strip()\n                  n = len(s)   # though we don't use n separately\n                  if s == 'W'*n:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n                  else:\n                      parts = s.split('W')\n                      valid = True\n                      for part in parts:\n                          if part == '': \n                              continue\n                          if len(part)==1:\n                              valid = False\n                              break\n                          if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                              valid = False\n                              break\n                      print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 10^5, so this is efficient.\n\n        But note: the code provided is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must write the code for the body of the for-loop.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the input might have multiple test cases. The variable s in the loop is the string of the picture for one test case (with newline). We strip it.\n\n        But note: the first line of the test case is the integer n, and the second line is the string. The loop [*open(0)][2::2] takes every second line starting from index 2 (which is the second line of the first test case, then the second line of the second test case, etc.). So we have the string for each test case.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if s == 'W'*len(s):\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              flag = True\n              for p in parts:\n                  if p == '': continue\n                  if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                      flag = False\n                      break\n              print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the condition for the part: \n          if len(p)==1 -> invalid.\n          if the part does not contain at least one 'R' OR at least one 'B' -> invalid.\n\n        We can write: \n          if len(p)==1 or (not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)) -> but the condition above is equivalent.\n\n        But note: if the part has length>=2, but only one color? then we break and say invalid.\n\n        So we write the above.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition \"if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p\" is equivalent to \"if not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)\".\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above block.\n\n        But note: the problem says to output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        We are only to output the missing code for the TODO part.\n\n        The TODO part is the body of the for-loop that iterates over the test case strings.\n\n        So we write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          n = len(s)\n          if s == 'W'*n:\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts:\n                  if not part: \n                      continue\n                  if len(part)==1 or ('R' not in part) or ('B' not in part):\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        However, note: the condition can be written as:\n\n          if len(part)==1:\n              valid = False\n              break\n          if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n              valid = False\n              break\n\n        But we can combine.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          if part and (len(part)==1 or set(part)=={'R'} or set(part)=={'B'}):\n              valid = False\n              break\n\n        But the above condition is the same.\n\n        We'll use the condition: \n          if part and (len(part)==1 or ('R' not in part) or ('B' not in part)): \n            -> but wait: if the part is non-empty, then we check: if the length is 1 -> invalid. Also, if the part does not contain both R and B -> invalid.\n\n        Actually, we can break it down:\n\n          if part:   # non-empty\n              if len(part)==1:\n                  valid = False; break\n              elif 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                  valid = False; break\n\n        But the problem says: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B. So if either is missing, it's invalid.\n\n        We can write:\n\n          if part != '':\n              if len(part)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if not ('R' in part and 'B' in part):\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n        But the condition \"if not ('R' in part and 'B' in part)\" is the same as \"if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part\".\n\n        So we'll use:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          n = len(s)\n          if s == 'W'*n:\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts:\n                  if part == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(part) == 1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n        But note: the example of a segment of length 2: \n          \"RR\": invalid -> because 'B' not in part -> condition fails -> we break and print \"NO\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we have the two completions.\n\n        Now, output in the required JSON format.\n\n        Example:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"s = s.strip()\\nn = len(s)\\nif s == 'W'*n:\\n    print('YES')\\nelse:\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for part in parts:\\n        if part == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(part) == 1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"}\n\n        But note: the program2 code must be exactly the body of the for-loop? Actually, the for-loop in the provided code is:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the above block. However, the above block is multiple lines.\n\n        We must be careful: the code for program2.py is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to write the body of the for-loop. The body is the entire block above.\n\n        But note: the for-loop variable s is one of the lines. We are going to process that s.\n\n        Therefore, the entire block we wrote is the body.\n\n        However, we must note: the body must be indented. The provided code has no indentation? But we are writing the code as a string.\n\n        We write the code as a string with newlines and proper indentation.\n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. So we write the code as a string.\n\n        We use:\n\n          \"program1\": \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n\n          \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    n = len(s)\\n    if s == 'W'*n:\\n        print('YES')\\n    else:\\n        parts = s.split('W')\\n        valid = True\\n        for part in parts:\\n            if part == '':\\n                continue\\n            if len(part) == 1:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the initial indentation level for the body of the for-loop in program2 is one level. So we add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must be consistent. Since the original for-loop is at the top level, the body should be indented by 4 spaces. But the provided code in the example for program1 was not indented? Actually, we are only to output the missing code, and the missing code for program1 is one line that goes inside the for-loop. Similarly, for program2, the missing code is the entire body of the for-loop (which is multiple lines) and must be indented appropriately.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        For program1: the missing line is one line, and it should be indented inside the for-loop. But the for-loop is already there. So we output the line without extra indentation? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the line \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\", and we must indent it. But the problem says \"output the missing code\", so we output the line as it would appear in the program: with an indentation.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. But in Python, we typically use 4 spaces. The existing code uses 4 spaces? \n\n        Looking at the provided code for program1:\n\n          n,q=map(int,input().split())\n          a=[0]\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n          for _ in[0]*q:x,y=map(int,input().split());print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\n        The for-loop is at the same level as the previous lines. The body of the for-loop is missing. We must output the body with one level of indentation (4 spaces).\n\n        Similarly, for program2, the for-loop is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must output the body with one level of indentation.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, we output:\n\n          \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\"   (with 4 spaces at the beginning)\n\n        For program2, we output the entire block with each line indented by 4 more spaces? Actually, the entire block is the body of the for-loop, so each line should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop. But the for-loop is at the top level, so the body should be 4 spaces.\n\n        However, the block we wrote for program2 has multiple levels. The inner if-else and the inner for-loop must be indented appropriately.\n\n        We can write the program2 code as:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          n = len(s)\n          if s == 'W'*n:\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts:\n                  if part == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(part) == 1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        But when we put this as the body of the for-loop, we must indent the entire block by 4 spaces.\n\n        So:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              n = len(s)\n              if s == 'W'*n:\n                  print('YES')\n              else:\n                  parts = s.split('W')\n                  valid = True\n                  for part in parts:\n                      if part == '':\n                          continue\n                      if len(part) == 1:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                      if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the above block without the for-loop header, and with the same indentation as above? Actually, we output the block as a string that is the body of the for-loop, so we output:\n\n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    n = len(s)\\n    if s == 'W'*n:\\n        print('YES')\\n    else:\\n        parts = s.split('W')\\n        valid = True\\n        for part in parts:\\n            if part == '':\\n                continue\\n            if len(part) == 1:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the inner for-loop and if statements have more indentation. We use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the variable n? because we can use len(s) in the condition.\n\n        We can write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if s == 'W'*len(s):\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              ... \n\n        This is equivalent.\n\n        We'll use that to save one line.\n\n        Final for program2:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if s == 'W'*len(s):\n              print('YES')\n          else:\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for part in parts:\n                  if part == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(part) == 1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        Then the string for program2 is:\n\n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if s == 'W'*len(s):\\n        print('YES')\\n    else:\\n        parts = s.split('W')\\n        valid = True\\n        for part in parts:\\n            if part == '':\\n                continue\\n            if len(part) == 1:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the condition for the free part: we break as soon as we find an invalid segment.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n        Note: We must escape the quotes? The problem says to output the code as a string. We are in a JSON string, so we must escape the double quotes? But the problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And we are returning a JSON object.\n\n        The structure: \n          {\"program1\": \"completion1\", \"program2\": \"completion2\"}\n\n        We must escape the double quotes inside the string? Actually, the JSON standard requires that. But the problem does not specify. However, to be safe, we can use single quotes for the code? But the JSON standard requires double quotes for keys and values.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says to output the JSON.\n\n        We'll use double quotes and escape the inner double quotes? But the code we are outputting does not have double quotes? It has single quotes in the condition and print.\n\n        The code we output for program2 has: \n          s == 'W'*len(s)   -> single quotes\n          print('YES') -> single quotes\n\n        So we don't need to escape.\n\n        But what about the backslashes? We have newlines as \\n.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if s == 'W'*len(s):\\n        print('YES')\\n    else:\\n        parts = s.split('W')\\n        valid = True\\n        for part in parts:\\n            if part == '':\\n                continue\\n            if len(part) == 1:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the program1 line: we have 4 spaces at the beginning? because it is the body of the for-loop.\n\n        However, the existing for-loop in program1 is:\n\n          for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the line \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\"? Actually, the entire line we output for program1 is the body, so it should be indented. We output \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\".\n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code for program1 is one line: the body of the for-loop.\n\n        Similarly, for program2, the missing code is the entire block.\n\n        We are done."
