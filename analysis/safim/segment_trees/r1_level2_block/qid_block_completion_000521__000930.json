    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given:\n  r=open(0)\n  g=lambda:map(int,next(r).split())\n  n,q=g()\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nWe note that the problem requires us to compute for each query (x, y) the maximum total value of the y cheapest items that can be made free when buying at least x items.\n\nThe idea:\n1. Sort the prices in descending order? Actually, note: we want the maximum total value of free items. The free items are the y cheapest among the x items we choose. To maximize the free items, we want the y cheapest in the chosen set to be as expensive as possible. Therefore, we should choose a set of x items that has the largest possible y smallest items.\n\nBut note: the entire set of items is fixed. The best we can do is to take the x most expensive items. Why? Because then the y cheapest in that set (which are the last y of these sorted in increasing order) will be as expensive as possible.\n\nHowever, the array is being sorted in descending order? Let's see:\n\nWe have:\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: \n\nThis sorts the prices and then reverses, so we have the prices in descending order.\n\nBut then we are building an array `a`. We start with a[0]=0.\n\nWe need to build a prefix sum array? But note: the free items are the y cheapest in the set of x items. If we take the x largest items, then the y cheapest in that set are the last y of the x largest. But when sorted in descending order, the set of x largest is the first x in the descending list. The cheapest in that set would be the last ones in the descending list? Actually, the set of x largest items, when sorted in ascending order, would be the last x in the ascending order. But we have the descending order.\n\nAlternatively, we can build a prefix sum array for the ascending order and then use that.\n\nBut note the current code: \n  We are iterating over the sorted prices in descending order (from largest to smallest).\n\nWe are building an array `a` such that:\n  a[0] = 0\n  then we are going to add each x? \n\nActually, we want to be able to quickly compute the sum of the y smallest in the set of x largest. \n\nLet the sorted array in ascending order be: \n  p[0] <= p[1] <= ... <= p[n-1]\n\nThen the x largest items are p[n-x] to p[n-1]. The y smallest in these are p[n-x] to p[n-x+y-1]. The sum of these y items is the sum of the segment p[n-x] to p[n-x+y-1].\n\nBut note: we are building an array `a` that is a prefix sum of the descending array? \n\nAlternatively, we can build a prefix sum array for the ascending array. However, the code currently sorts and then reverses, so we have the array in descending order. Let that descending array be `d`, so:\n  d[0] = max, d[1] = next, ... d[n-1] = min.\n\nThen the set of x largest is d[0:x]. The y smallest in that set are the last y of that segment, i.e., d[x-y] to d[x-1] (because in the descending array, the smallest in the set are at the end). \n\nBut note: the entire set of x largest is d[0:x]. The smallest in that set is d[x-1] and the next smallest is d[x-2], etc. Actually, the y smallest in the set are d[x-y] to d[x-1]? \n\nExample: \n  Original: [1,2,3,4,5] (ascending) -> descending: [5,4,3,2,1]\n  x=3, y=2: the set of 3 largest: [5,4,3]. The two smallest in this set are 3 and 4? But wait, 3 and 4? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 4? But note: 3 is smaller than 4? So the two smallest are 3 and 4? Then the sum is 7.\n\nBut in the descending array, the segment [5,4,3] -> the last two are 4 and 3? But that is not contiguous? Actually, we can take the last two in the segment: from index 1 to 2: 4 and 3? That gives 7.\n\nAlternatively, we can build a prefix sum array for the descending array. Let `a[i]` be the sum of the first i items in the descending array (i.e., the i largest items). Then the sum of the y smallest in the set of x largest is the sum of the last y in the segment of the first x. That is: \n  total = (sum of the first x) - (sum of the first (x-y))\n\nBut wait: \n  The entire set of x largest: [d0, d1, ..., d_{x-1}]\n  The y smallest in this set are the last y: [d_{x-y}, d_{x-y+1}, ..., d_{x-1}]\n  The sum of the entire set is a[x] (if a[0]=0, a[1]=d0, a[2]=d0+d1, ...)\n  The sum of the first (x-y) is a[x-y]\n  Then the sum of the last y is a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nSo the code for the query (x,y) is: a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: the array `a` is built for the descending array. We are iterating over the descending array and building the prefix sums.\n\nSo the missing code in the for loop should be:\n  We have a list `a` that we are building. We start with a[0]=0.\n  Then for each element `x` in the descending array, we want to add it to the last element of `a` and append that.\n\nBut note: we are going to need a[1], a[2], ... a[n]. So we need to build an array of length n+1.\n\nSo the loop should be:\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: the initial a = [0]. Then we iterate over the descending array. For the first element (largest) we do a.append(0 + largest) -> a becomes [0, largest]. Then next: a.append(largest + next) -> [0, largest, largest+next], etc.\n\nThen for a query (x,y): we want a[x] - a[x-y]. But note: our array `a` has indices 0..n.\n\nBut note: the descending array has n elements. So we are building a with n+1 elements: indices 0 to n.\n\nHowever, the code after the loop does:\n  for b in[0]*q: \n      x,y = g()\n      print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nBut wait: if we built the prefix sum for the entire descending array, then a[i] is the sum of the first i elements (the i largest). Then the set of x largest is the first x, and the y smallest in that set are the last y of the first x, which is the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending array. The sum of that segment is a[x] - a[x-y] (because a[x] is the sum of the first x, and a[x-y] is the sum of the first (x-y)).\n\nBut note: the array `a` we built has:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = d0\n  a[2] = d0+d1\n  ...\n  a[i] = d0+...+d_{i-1}\n\nSo to get the sum of the first x elements, we use a[x] (which is the prefix sum for the first x elements). Then the last y of the first x are the elements from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the array? Actually, the prefix sum a[x] is the sum of indices 0 to x-1. Similarly, a[x-y] is the sum of indices 0 to x-y-1. Then the segment we want is from index x-y to x-1, which is a[x] - a[x-y].\n\nBut note: the indices in the prefix array: \n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = d0\n  a[2] = d0+d1\n  a[3] = d0+d1+d2\n\nFor x=3, y=2: \n  We want the last two of the first three: d1 and d2? \n  Then the sum = a[3] - a[1] = (d0+d1+d2) - d0 = d1+d2.\n\nBut in the set of the three largest, the two smallest are the second and third largest? That is correct.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to build the prefix sum array.\n\nTherefore, we replace the TODO with:\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: the loop is written as:\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: \n      ... \n\nWe are iterating over each element in the descending array. We start with a=[0]. Then we want to append the cumulative sum.\n\nSo the code for program1.py missing part is:\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: the next line is a for loop that runs q times. We must be careful: the indentation. The current code has:\n\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nWe must indent the second for loop? Actually, no: the first for loop is building the array `a`. Then the second for loop runs the queries.\n\nBut the current code has the second for loop at the same indentation as the first for loop. That would be an error because the first for loop has no body. We must have the body of the first for loop.\n\nSo the corrected program1.py should be:\n\n  r=open(0)\n  g=lambda:map(int,next(r).split())\n  n,q=g()\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      a.append(a[-1] + x)   # This is the missing line\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nBut wait: the variable `x` in the query loop is overwriting the `x` from the for-loop? Actually, the for-loop variable `x` is the last element of the descending array when the loop ends. Then in the query loop, we do `x,y = g()`, which reads the next query and sets `x` to the query x. So that is okay.\n\nHowever, note: the array `a` we built has n+1 elements (from 0 to n). The query parameters: x and y, with 1<=y<=x<=n. So we are accessing a[x] and a[x-y]. Since x<=n, and x-y>=0, and x-y<=x<=n, we are safe.\n\nBut note: the array `a` has indices 0..n. So a[x] is the prefix sum of the first x elements (the x largest). And a[x-y] is the prefix sum of the first (x-y) elements. Then the difference is the sum of the next y elements? Actually, the last y of the first x? Yes.\n\nBut wait: the prefix sum a[i] is the sum of the first i elements (i elements, from the largest to the i-th largest). Then the segment from the (x-y+1)-th largest to the x-th largest? Actually, the y smallest in the set of x largest are the ones that are the smallest in that set, which are the ones that are the last in the set of x largest. In the descending array, they are the last y in the segment of the first x. That is, the elements from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the array? But note: the prefix sum a[i] includes indices 0 to i-1. So the segment we want is from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the array? Actually, the prefix sum a[x] is the sum of indices 0 to x-1, and a[x-y] is the sum of indices 0 to x-y-1. Then the difference is the sum of indices (x-y) to (x-1) -> that is exactly the last y elements in the segment of the first x.\n\nSo it is correct.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given:\n  for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n      b = 0\n      for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe problem: determine if a string s (of length n) consisting of 'R','B','W' can be formed by stamping.\n\nKey idea from known problems (similar to Codeforces problems, e.g., Round #742 (Div. 2), problem C): \n  The stamping operation always stamps two adjacent cells with one red and one blue. Note that the stamp can be either \"RB\" or \"BR\". Also, the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n\nObservation:\n  The entire process must satisfy:\n    - The first operation on a white cell must color it either red or blue. But note that the stamp always colors two adjacent cells: one red and one blue.\n\n  We can think in terms of segments separated by white cells. Why? Because the stamping operation is applied on two adjacent cells, and if there is a white cell in between, then the two segments are independent? Actually, the stamping operation must cover two adjacent cells. Therefore, if we have a contiguous segment of non-white cells, then we can consider it independently.\n\n  Steps:\n    Split the string by 'W'. Then we get a list of contiguous non-white segments.\n\n  For each contiguous segment (which has only 'R' and 'B'), we must check if it can be formed.\n\n  Conditions for a contiguous segment:\n    - The segment must have at least one cell? Actually, if the segment is empty (which happens when there are consecutive W's) then we skip.\n    - What are the constraints?\n        * It is impossible to have a segment of length 1: because the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So a single non-white cell cannot be achieved? \n          However, note: we can stamp multiple times on the same cell? But the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So if we have a segment of length 1, then we must have covered that cell by a stamp that also covered an adjacent cell. But that adjacent cell is white? Then we cannot because the stamp must be completely on the non-white cells? Actually, the stamp must be completely on the n cells. But if we have a segment of length 1, then we cannot apply a stamp that covers that one cell and a white cell? Because the white cell is not to be changed? Actually, the stamping operation can be applied multiple times to the same cell. However, the problem states that the stamp must completely fit on the given n cells. So if we have a segment of length 1, then we cannot use the stamp on that segment? \n\n      Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n    - What about a segment of length 2? \n        Possibilities: \"RR\", \"RB\", \"BR\", \"BB\".\n        The stamp can produce \"RB\" or \"BR\". So \"RR\" and \"BB\" are impossible? \n        But note: we can apply the stamp multiple times. \n        Example: \n          To get \"RR\": \n            Start: WW -> apply stamp: RB (on the two) -> then apply the same stamp again? But if we apply the same stamp again on the same two, we get: \n              First: RB -> then apply the same stamp: if we use BR on the same two, we get: \n                First cell: R -> becomes B? then second cell: B becomes R? -> then we get BR? \n              Or if we use RB again: then first cell: R becomes R? (because R and then we stamp with R again? but the stamp sets the first to R and the second to B? so if we do it again: first becomes R (if we use RB) and second becomes B? so it remains RB? \n\n        Actually, the operation is not additive. The stamp sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. So if we apply the stamp as \"RB\" on a segment that is currently \"RB\", then it becomes \"RB\" again. \n\n        How to form \"RR\"? \n          We cannot? because the stamp always sets one to R and the other to B. \n\n        Similarly, \"BB\" is impossible.\n\n        So for a segment of length 2, we must have either \"RB\" or \"BR\". \n\n    - For longer segments: \n        We can use dynamic programming? But note the constraints: the total n over test cases is 10^5.\n\n      Alternate insight: \n        The stamping operation is reversible? Actually, we can think of the reverse: starting from the final picture and then removing stamps. Removing a stamp would mean turning two adjacent cells that are one red and one blue into white? But note: the stamping operation can be applied multiple times. So the reverse operation is: if we have two adjacent cells that are one red and one blue, we can turn them into white? But wait, that might not be the only operation: because a cell might have been stamped multiple times. \n\n      Known solution for similar problems (e.g., \"Stamp Painting\" or \"Stamp Colony\")? \n\n      Actually, a known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n        - The entire picture must be splitted by white cells. Each contiguous segment of non-white must have at least two characters and must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n      But consider: \n        Example: \"R\" -> invalid (length 1) -> NO.\n        \"RR\" -> invalid? because we cannot have two reds? \n        \"RBR\" -> valid? \n\n      How to form \"RBR\":\n        Step1: stamp the middle and the right: making the middle R and the right B? -> but then we have W R B -> then stamp the left two: making the left R and the middle B? -> but then we have R B B -> not RBR.\n\n        Alternatively:\n          Start: WWW\n          Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> R B W\n          Step2: stamp the last two: but the last two are B and W? we cannot stamp partially? the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So we can only stamp the middle and the last: then we get R and then stamp the middle and last: set to RB? then we get R R B? -> then we have \"RRB\", which is not RBR.\n\n        Another way:\n          Step1: stamp the middle and the last: making the middle R and the last B -> WW becomes W R B -> then stamp the first and the middle: making the first B and the middle R? -> then we get B R B -> but we want R B R.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n          Step1: stamp the first two: BR? -> then we have B R W\n          Step2: stamp the last two: but the last two are R and W -> we can stamp? but the stamp must cover two adjacent non-white? Actually, we can stamp over a white and a non-white? The problem says: the stamp must completely fit on the given n cells. So we can stamp on the last two? Then we set the second to R and the third to B? -> then we have B R B -> but we want R B R.\n\n        How about:\n          Step1: stamp the last two: making the second R and the last B -> then we have W R B\n          Step2: stamp the first two: making the first R and the second B -> then we have R B B -> not RBR.\n\n        It seems difficult. \n\n      Known solution from Codeforces for the same problem (problem name: \"Stamps\")? \n\n      Insight: \n        The stamping operation always flips the color of a cell? Actually, no: the stamp sets the two cells to specific colors. \n\n      Alternate known solution: \n        We note that the entire process must preserve the following:\n          - The number of red and blue in a contiguous segment must have the same parity? \n\n      Actually, we can use the following known solution (from a Codeforces contest):\n        For each contiguous segment (without W), we check:\n          - If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n          - Otherwise, we check if the segment has both colors? Actually, no: because we can have a segment of all the same color? But we just saw that we cannot have two adjacent same colors? \n\n        But wait: what if we have a segment of length 3: \"RRR\" -> is that possible?\n          We can try:\n            Start: WWW\n            Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> R B W\n            Step2: stamp the first two again: if we use BR, then we get B R W -> then stamp the last two: R and W -> we can set to RB? then we get B R B -> not RRR.\n\n        How about:\n          Step1: stamp the middle and last: set to RB -> W R B\n          Step2: stamp the first two: set to RB -> R B B -> then we have R B B -> then stamp the last two: set to BR? -> then we get R B R -> not RRR.\n\n        It seems impossible to get three R's.\n\n        Therefore, we must have at least one blue? \n\n        Actually, the known solution is: \n          For each contiguous segment (without W) we must have at least one red and at least one blue? \n\n        Why? \n          Because the stamp always adds one red and one blue. So the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n        But note: we can stamp multiple times. However, each stamp adds one red and one blue. So the entire segment must have the same number of reds and blues? \n\n        Let's count: \n          Initially: all white -> 0 red, 0 blue.\n          Each stamp: adds one red and one blue? \n          But note: if we stamp a cell that is already non-white, then we are changing the color. \n\n        Actually, the net effect on the entire segment: \n          The stamping operation on two adjacent cells: \n            If both were white: then we add one red and one blue -> net: one red, one blue.\n            If one was red and the other blue: then we can change them to blue and red? or red and blue? -> but then the net change: \n              Before: one red, one blue -> after: one blue and one red -> same.\n\n          But if we stamp a pair that has one white and one red: \n            We set the white to (if we use the stamp as BR: then the first becomes B, the second becomes R) -> so the white becomes B and the red becomes R? \n            Then the net: we lose one red and gain one blue? \n\n        This becomes complex.\n\n      Known solution from Codeforces (from the problem \"Stamps\"): \n        We split the string by 'W'. For each segment:\n          - If the segment is empty, skip.\n          - Else, if the segment has length 1: then it's impossible.\n          - Else, we check: \n              if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n          But wait: what if the segment is \"RRB\"? \n            It has at least one 'R' and one 'B'. \n\n        Why is that condition sufficient?\n          Explanation: \n            We can form the segment if and only if the segment is not unicolor? \n          Why? \n            Because if the segment is unicolor (all 'R' or all 'B'), then we cannot form it. \n            Why not? \n              Consider: \n                To form a contiguous segment of all 'R': \n                  The stamp always sets two adjacent cells to one red and one blue. So if we have a segment of all red, then every time we stamp we must set one blue? \n\n          Therefore, the condition is: each contiguous segment of non-white must have at least one red and at least one blue.\n\n        But note: the example in the note: \n          \"RR\" -> unicolor -> invalid -> so we output \"NO\", which matches the sample: \n            The second, third, and fourth test cases: \n              \"R\", \"B\", \"RR\" -> all unicolor -> NO.\n\n        The fifth test case: \"BRBB\" -> but wait, the sample output is \"YES\". \n          However, the fifth test case in the note: \n            n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> but the example says: \n              \"WWW\" -> \"W RB\" -> \"BRB\" (actually the example says: \n                \"WWW\" -> \"W RB\" -> then \"BRB\" by stamping the first two as BR? \n                But then we have: \n                  Step1: stamp the last two: making the second R and the last B -> \"W R B\"\n                  Step2: stamp the first two: making the first B and the second R -> \"B R B\" -> but we want \"B R B\" for the fifth? \n                The fifth test case: \"B R B\" -> but the example says: \n                  \"WWW\" -> \"W RB\" -> \"BRB\" (meaning the last two become RB, then the first two become BR? then we have B and then the second becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> \"B R B\")\n\n          Now, \"B R B\" is a contiguous segment? It has at least one R and one B? Actually, it has one R and two B's -> so it has both colors -> valid.\n\n        The sixth test case: \"R B B\" -> has one R and two B's -> valid.\n\n        The seventh test case: \"\" (empty) -> skip -> valid? Actually, the entire string is white? Then we split by W and get empty segments? Then we skip -> so we set b=0? and then output \"YES\".\n\n        How do we code?\n          We set a flag `b` initially to 0 (which we will set to 1 if we find an invalid segment).\n\n          Then we split the string by 'W'. The string s might have trailing newline? We do s[:-1] to remove the newline? Then split by 'W'.\n\n          For each segment `i` in the split result:\n            If the segment is non-empty:\n                If the length of the segment is 1: invalid -> set b=1 and break.\n                Else: check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n                    How? We can do: \n                      if set(i) == {'R'} or set(i) == {'B'}: then invalid.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is \"RBRB\", then set(i) = {'R','B'} -> valid.\n\n          However, what if the segment is \"RRB\"? set(i) = {'R','B'} -> valid.\n\n          But what if the segment is \"R\"? -> we already check length==1 -> invalid.\n\n          What if the segment is \"RR\"? -> set(i) = {'R'} -> then we set b=1.\n\n          What if the segment is \"RB\"? -> set(i) = {'R','B'} -> valid.\n\n          So the condition for a non-empty segment of length>=2: \n            if the set of the segment is not {'R','B'}? Actually, it must be either {'R'}, {'B'}, or {'R','B'}. So we check if it is not {'R','B'}? Actually, we want to check if it is unicolor? \n\n          We can do: \n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: \n                then invalid.\n\n          But note: if the segment is \"RR\", then 'B' not in i -> invalid.\n\n          Similarly, if the segment is \"BB\", then 'R' not in i -> invalid.\n\n          So the condition: \n            if the segment is non-empty and (the segment does not contain 'R' OR the segment does not contain 'B') -> then invalid.\n\n          However, if the segment is non-empty and has length>=2, then we require both colors.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the TODO:\n\n            if i != '':   # non-empty segment\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break   # but note: we are in a for-loop over segments. We can break out of the inner for-loop? Then we set b=1 and then break to the next segment? Actually, we can break because we already found an invalid segment.\n                else:\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5. The inner loop over segments: the total length of all segments is the total non-white characters, which is <= total n (<=10^5). So we can do.\n\n          However, the code after the inner loop: \n            print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          This is a trick: \n            If b=0 -> then we get 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> starting at index0, step2: 'YES'\n            If b=1 -> then we get 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> starting at index1, step2: 'NO'\n\n          But note: the string is 'YNEOS' -> \n            index0: 'Y'\n            index1: 'N'\n            index2: 'E'\n            index3: 'O'\n            index4: 'S'\n\n          Then [0::2] -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\"\n          [1::2] -> 'N','O' -> \"NO\"\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          However, what if we have multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment. But if we break, we skip the rest of the segments? That is okay because we only need one invalid segment to make the entire picture invalid.\n\n          But note: we set b=0 at the beginning of the test case. Then we iterate over segments. If we find an invalid segment, we set b=1 and break. Then we break the inner for-loop (over the segments of this test case). Then we output the answer.\n\n          But what if we don't break? Then we continue to the next segment. We must check all segments? \n\n          We can do without break? But if we break, we save time. However, we can also set b=1 and then break to avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But wait: if the segment is non-empty and has length>=2, but is unicolor (so either 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i) -> then invalid.\n\n          However, note: if the segment is unicolor, then one of the colors is missing. So the condition is: \n            if the segment is non-empty and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)) -> but wait: if the segment has length>=2 and is unicolor, then one of the colors is missing. \n\n          Actually, we can combine: \n            if the segment is non-empty and (len(i)==1 or set(i)=={'R'} or set(i)=={'B'}):\n                then invalid.\n\n          But the condition above: \n            if i != '' and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)) \n          is not correct: because if the segment has both colors, then both 'R' in i and 'B' in i are true -> then the condition is false. But if the segment is unicolor, then one of the colors is missing -> then the condition becomes true. Also, if the segment has length 1, then we set true.\n\n          However, if the segment has length 1, then it is automatically missing at least one color? But we don't care: we already know length1 is invalid. \n\n          But note: if the segment has length1, then it is missing one color? Actually, it has one character, so it is unicolor. But we don't need to check the colors: we already know it's invalid.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if i != '':\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                else:\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          But we can also write without break? Actually, we break to avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n          However, we can also do:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          Explanation: \n            if i is non-empty -> then we check: \n                if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n                or if the segment has length>=2 but is missing at least one color -> invalid.\n\n          But note: the condition \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is true if at least one color is missing. \n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, what if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors? then we skip.\n\n          So the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n            if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                if len(i)==1: \n                    b=1\n                    break\n                else:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But we can combine:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)): \n                # Actually, if len(i)==1, then we don't care about the colors? But note: if len(i)==1, then automatically 'R' not in i OR 'B' not in i? Actually, it has one character, so if it is 'R', then 'B' is not in it, and if it is 'B', then 'R' is not in it. So the condition ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i) is always true for a segment of length1. \n\n            Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But wait: the condition \"len(i)==1 or ...\" is true if either the segment has length1 OR (if the segment has length>=2 and one of the colors is missing). \n\n          However, note: if the segment has length>=2 and both colors are present, then the condition is false.\n\n          But if the segment has length1, then the condition is true.\n\n          Also, if the segment has length>=2 and one color is missing, then the condition is true.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition is equivalent to: \n            if i and ( (len(i)==1) or (if the segment has length>=2 and (one color is missing)) )\n\n          However, the condition \"A or B\" is true if A is true, regardless of B. So if the segment has length1, we set b=1 and break. If the segment has length>=2 and one color is missing, we set b=1 and break.\n\n          But what if the segment has length>=2 and both colors are present? then the condition is false.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i:   # non-empty\n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          However, note: the condition \"if i\" is equivalent to non-empty.\n\n          But the condition: \n            if len(i)==1 -> then we break.\n            if len(i)>=2 and ('R' not in i' or 'B' not in i) -> then we break.\n\n          But wait: the condition \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is true if at least one color is missing. \n\n          Example: \n            i = \"RR\" -> len(i)=2 -> condition: true because 'B' not in i -> break, set b=1 -> output \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          i = \"R\" -> condition: true -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          i = \"RB\" -> condition: \n            len(i)=2 -> then we check: 'R' in i -> true, 'B' in i -> true -> so the condition \" 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is false -> so the entire condition is false -> skip.\n\n          i = \"RBR\" -> condition: \n            len(i)=3 -> then check: 'R' in i -> true, 'B' in i -> true -> condition false -> skip.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          But note: the condition is: \n            (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\n          This is equivalent to: \n            (len(i)==1) or (not ('R' in i and 'B' in i))\n\n          So we can also write:\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          This might be clearer.\n\n          However, the original condition is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary because we skip empty segments.\n\n          However, the split function might produce empty strings. We skip them.\n\n          So we put:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i:   # non-empty\n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is the same as \"if i != ''\".\n\n          We can write it as:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the condition is an OR of three conditions. The first condition (len(i)==1) is sufficient to trigger. The other two conditions are only evaluated if the first is false.\n\n          This is efficient.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          But note: the input has t test cases. The first line is t, then the next lines are test cases: first integer n, then string s. We are taking [2::2] meaning we skip the first two lines? Actually, the first line is t, then the next lines are the test cases. The structure:\n\n            Line0: t\n            Line1: n1\n            Line2: s1\n            Line3: n2\n            Line4: s2\n            ...\n\n          So we take every other line starting from index2: that is, we take the s1, s2, ... \n\n          Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n          However, note: the total length of all test cases is <=10^5, so we are safe.\n\n          But wait: the problem says the total n over test cases <=10^5. So the inner loop over segments for one test case: the total length of the string s is n, and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5. So the entire process is O(10^5).\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n            program2: \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the program2 code must be indented properly. The current for-loop in program2 is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But the existing code has the for-loop and then the print. We are inserting the if block inside the for-loop.\n\n          The entire program2.py:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          However, note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary to skip empty segments.\n\n          We are done.\n\n          But note: the problem says the string s might have a newline? We do s[:-1] to remove the last character? Then we split by 'W'. This is correct.\n\n          However, what if the last character is not a newline? Actually, the input is from stdin, and open(0) reads the entire input. The last line might not have a newline? But the problem says the first line of each test case contains n, then the second line contains s of length n. So the string s has exactly n characters. Then the next line is the next integer. So the string s is given without any trailing space? \n\n          But the example: \n            Input: \n              1\n              3\n              BRB\n\n          Then s is \"BRB\\n\" if the next test case starts? But if there is only one test case, then s is \"BRB\" without newline? Actually, the last line might not have a newline? \n\n          However, the code: s[:-1] will remove the last character. If the string s has a newline, then we remove it. If it doesn't, then we remove the last character of the string? \n\n          How to avoid? \n\n          We note that the input is read by open(0). The lines include the newline character. So the string s in the test case is read as \"BRB\\n\" (if there is a newline) or \"BRB\" (if it is the last line and there is no newline). \n\n          But the problem says: the length of s is n. So if the line has a newline, then the length is n+1? \n\n          Actually, the input: \n            The first line: t (with newline)\n            Then for each test case:\n              first line: n (with newline)\n              second line: a string of length n (with or without newline? the problem says the string of length n)\n\n          How is the input formatted? Typically, the string is given and then a newline. So the line for s has n+1 characters: the n characters of s and a newline.\n\n          Therefore, s[:-1] removes the newline, leaving the string of length n.\n\n          But if the last test case and the last line has no newline? Then s[:-1] would remove the last character of the string? \n\n          However, the problem says the string has length n. So we should take exactly n characters. \n\n          We can do: s.strip()? But the problem says the string only contains 'R','B','W'. So no space. But the problem says the string s of length n. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do: s = s.rstrip()? \n\n          But the code uses: s[:-1] -> this removes the last character regardless. If the last character is a newline, then we remove it. If not, we remove the last character of the string. \n\n          This is dangerous.\n\n          How about: \n            We can split the string without removing the last character? \n\n          Actually, the split by 'W' will work even if there is a newline? Because the newline is not 'W'. So the last segment might include the newline? \n\n          Example: \n            s = \"BRB\\n\" -> split by 'W' -> ['BRB\\n'] -> then we check: \n                i = 'BRB\\n' -> non-empty -> then we check: \n                    len(i) = 4 -> then we check: \n                        'R' in i -> True (because 'R' is in \"BRB\")\n                        'B' in i -> True -> condition false -> skip.\n\n          But wait: the newline is not 'R' or 'B', so it is not affecting the presence of 'R' and 'B'. However, the condition \"if i\" is true because the string is non-empty. Then we check the condition: \n            len(i)==4 -> so we check: 'R' not in i? -> false, 'B' not in i? -> false -> so the condition is false.\n\n          But what if the string has a newline and we have a segment that ends with newline? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do: \n            s = s.strip()   # but the problem says the string only has 'R','B','W', and the newline is the only extra.\n\n          But the problem says the length of s is n. So we can do:\n\n            n = int(previous_line)\n            s = next_line.rstrip('\\n')   # but we don't have the previous_line.\n\n          In our code, we are given the string s as one of the lines. We do:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]\n\n          Then s is a string that includes the newline. We do s[:-1] to remove the last character. This is safe if the last character is a newline. But if the last line of the entire input does not have a newline, then s[:-1] will remove the last character of the string.\n\n          To avoid, we can do:\n\n            s = s.rstrip('\\n')   # but we are not storing the string again.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i in s.rstrip().split(\"W\"):\n\n          But note: the problem says the string only contains 'R','B','W'. So we can safely remove the newline.\n\n          However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, so we can do:\n\n            s = s.strip()   # remove any surrounding whitespace, including newline.\n\n          But the code is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s_clean = s.strip()   # but note: we are using s[:-1] in the split? \n\n          We can change:\n\n            for i in s_clean.split(\"W\"):\n\n          But the problem says the string s has length n. And we are removing the newline? Then the length is n. \n\n          However, the problem does not say that the string has a newline. So we can do:\n\n            s_clean = s.strip()\n            for i in s_clean.split(\"W\"):\n\n          But then we don't need s[:-1]. \n\n          But the original code uses s[:-1]. We are allowed to change that? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\". We are only allowed to fill the TODO block? \n\n          Therefore, we must not change the existing code. We are only allowed to write inside the for-loop.\n\n          How about: we do nothing? Because the problem says the string only contains 'R','B','W'. So the newline is not in the set, and the split by 'W' will not split by newline. And the condition \"if i\" will skip the empty string. The newline is at the end, so the last segment will have the newline? \n\n          But the condition: \n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n          The newline is included in the segment? Then the segment string i will be \"segment\\n\". Then the condition: \n            'R' not in i: will check the entire string including the newline? \n            Similarly, 'B' not in i: same.\n\n          But the newline is not 'R' or 'B', so it doesn't add any color. So if the segment is \"BRB\\n\", then the set of characters is {'B','R','\\n'} -> then we have both 'R' and 'B'? \n\n          So the condition: \n            'R' in i -> True (because 'R' is in the string)\n            'B' in i -> True -> so condition false.\n\n          But what if the segment is \"R\\n\"? \n            Then the segment has two characters: 'R' and '\\n'. \n            Then the condition: \n                len(i)==2 -> then we check: 'R' in i -> True, 'B' in i -> False -> so condition true -> we set b=1.\n\n          But wait: the segment \"R\\n\" is not a valid segment? The problem says the string s has length n. The segment should be contiguous non-white. The newline is not part of the picture? \n\n          Actually, the newline is an artifact of the input. We should not consider it.\n\n          Therefore, we must remove the newline before splitting.\n\n          But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n          We are only allowed to fill the TODO block. \n\n          How about: we do nothing and hope that the input always has a newline? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and the input is from stdin. The sample input has newline.\n\n          Alternatively, we can adjust in the condition: \n\n            We can do: \n                segment = i.strip()   # remove the newline? but we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n          But we are in the TODO block. We can do:\n\n            i_clean = i.strip()\n            if i_clean and (len(i_clean)==1 or 'R' not in i_clean or 'B' not in i_clean):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the segment might have been split by 'W', and the newline is at the end of the entire string. So the newline will only appear in the last segment? \n\n          And we are allowed to do extra lines in the TODO block.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the exact code that goes in the TODO block.\n\n          But the TODO block is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          Then we are to write the body of this for-loop.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            i_clean = i.strip()   # remove any whitespace (like newline) at the ends? \n            if i_clean and (len(i_clean)==1 or 'R' not in i_clean or 'B' not in i_clean):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the segment might have been split by 'W', and the segment might have leading or trailing whitespace? The problem says the string only contains 'R','B','W'. So the only whitespace is the newline? \n\n          And the newline is only at the end of the entire string? \n\n          But the split by 'W' might produce a segment that has a newline in the middle? No, because the newline is only at the end.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do without cleaning: \n\n            We can check: if the segment has a newline, we remove it? \n\n          But we are not sure.\n\n          Given the constraints, and that the total length is 10^5, we can do:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n          and hope that the newline does not affect the presence of 'R' and 'B'. \n\n          But as we saw, if the segment is \"R\\n\", then the condition is true -> we output \"NO\", which is correct? \n\n          But wait: the segment \"R\\n\" should be considered as a segment of length1? because the newline is not part of the picture. \n\n          Actually, the picture does not include the newline. The newline is an artifact. \n\n          Therefore, we must not consider the newline as part of the segment.\n\n          How about: we remove the newline from the entire string s before splitting? But we are not allowed to change the existing code.\n\n          We decide to do:\n\n            # In the TODO block, we do:\n            #   We remove any non-printable characters? But the problem says only 'R','B','W'\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            i = i.replace('\\n','').replace('\\r','')   # remove newline and carriage return\n\n          But then we do:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: we are not changing the original i? we are just creating a new variable? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            i_clean = i.replace('\\n','').replace('\\r','')\n            if i_clean and (len(i_clean)==1 or 'R' not in i_clean or 'B' not in i_clean):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But the problem says the total n is 10^5, and we are doing this for each segment, so the total work is O(n) -> acceptable.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the exact code that goes in the TODO block. \n\n          And the TODO block is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          then the body.\n\n          We can write:\n\n            clean_i = i.strip()\n            if clean_i and (len(clean_i)==1 or 'R' not in clean_i or 'B' not in clean_i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the strip will remove any leading/trailing whitespace. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do without cleaning: \n\n          Given the note: the input is well-formatted, and the only extra character is a newline at the end of the string. And the newline only appears at the end of the entire string. Therefore, the only segment that might have a newline is the last segment. And in that segment, the newline is at the end. \n\n          And the condition: \n            'R' not in i: will be true only if there is no 'R' in the entire segment including the newline? \n            But the newline is not 'R', so it doesn't add an 'R'. Similarly for 'B'. \n\n          Therefore, the condition is not affected by the newline? \n\n          Example: \n            Segment: \"R\" -> with newline: \"R\\n\" -> then the condition: \n                len(i) = 2 -> then we check: 'R' in i -> True, 'B' in i -> False -> condition true -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          Segment: \"RB\" -> with newline: \"RB\\n\" -> \n                'R' in i: True, 'B' in i: True -> condition false -> skip.\n\n          Segment: \"R\" with newline: we get \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n          Segment: \"RR\" with newline: \"RR\\n\" -> \n                'R' in i: True, 'B' in i: False -> condition true -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to clean.\n\n          So the code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          We output this.\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary to skip empty segments.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n            program2: \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          However, the output format is JSON. We must output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"}\n\n          But note: the program2 code has multiple lines. We must represent it as a string with newline.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write the program2 code in one line? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1; break\n\n          But then it is one line. And the for-loop body is one line.\n\n          But the original for-loop body is:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing it with:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1; break\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          However, the problem does not require one line. But the output is a JSON string. We can use newline characters.\n\n          But to be safe, we output the code as a string with embedded newline and tab? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          We'll output the code as a string with newlines.\n\n          How about:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b=1\\n    break\"\n\n          But the existing code in program2.py has 4-space indentation? The for-loop body is indented. The TODO is at the same indentation level as the for-loop. Then the body of the if should be indented one level deeper.\n\n          The current program2.py:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          So the indentation: \n            The for-loop body is one level (4 spaces) in. Then the if statement is at the same level? \n\n          Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the for-loop body. We are writing the code at the same level.\n\n          Therefore, the code we insert is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          And the indentation level: \n            The for-loop body is already indented. The if should be indented one more level? \n\n          But the existing code has:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the TODO is at 8 spaces (if the first level is 4). Then the if should be at 8 spaces, and the break at 12.\n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, Python requires consistent indentation.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          where we use 8 spaces for the body (which is common to use 4 spaces per level, so two levels: 8 spaces).\n\n          But note: the existing code has the for-loop body at 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the code we are given:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          The for-loop body (the line with b=0 and the next for-loop) are at 4 spaces. The inner for-loop body (the TODO) is at 8 spaces.\n\n          So the code we insert should be at 8 spaces, and the body of the if at 12 spaces.\n\n          But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces, as long as it is consistent. We can use 4 spaces per level.\n\n          We'll write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          And in the JSON string, we represent the newline as \\n and the spaces as spaces.\n\n          But the total code for program2 is 3 lines. We can write:\n\n            \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n          This uses 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n          But the existing code in the for-loop body is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop). Then the if should be at 8 spaces, and the break at 12 spaces? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write in one line to avoid indentation issues? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1; break\n\n          This is one line and at the same level as the TODO.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program2: \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1; break\"\n\n          But note: the condition is long. It is acceptable.\n\n          We choose the one-line version for simplicity.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n              \"program2\": \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1; break\"\n            }\n\n          But wait: the condition in program2: we have to check if the segment is non-empty and (either length1 or missing one color). \n\n          We are confident.\n\n          Let's test with the sample: \n            Test case: \"RR\" (with newline) -> \n              s = \"RR\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"RR\" -> split by 'W' -> ['RR'] -> \n                i = 'RR' -> non-empty -> \n                  len(i)=2 -> then check: 'R' not in i? -> False, 'B' not in i? -> True -> so condition true -> b=1 -> output \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          Test case: \"R\" (with newline) -> \n              s = \"R\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"R\" -> split: ['R'] -> \n                i='R' -> non-empty -> \n                  len(i)=1 -> condition true -> b=1 -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          Test case: \"RBR\" -> \n              s = \"RBR\\n\" -> s[:-1]=\"RBR\" -> split: ['RBR'] -> \n                i='RBR' -> \n                  len=3 -> 'R' in i: True, 'B' in i: True -> condition false -> b remains 0 -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n          Test case: \"W\" -> \n              s = \"W\\n\" -> s[:-1]=\"W\" -> split: ['',''] -> \n                for i in ['','']: \n                  i='' -> skip -> then b=0 -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n          Test case: \"WWR\" -> \n              s = \"WWR\\n\" -> s[:-1]=\"WWR\" -> split: ['','','R'] -> \n                i='' -> skip\n                i='' -> skip\n                i='R' -> non-empty -> condition true -> b=1 -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n          Note: the program1 code: we are appending the cumulative sum.\n\n          We are done."
