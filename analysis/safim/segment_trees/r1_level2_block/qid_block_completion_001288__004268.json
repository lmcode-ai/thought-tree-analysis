The constraint: \n                    For the first lock: we require at least ceil(4/5)=1 open pipe in the first lock -> we must have at least one open pipe in lock1? For the second lock: ceil(5/5)=1 -> at least one open pipe in the first two locks? For the third lock: ceil(10/5)=2 -> at least two open pipes in the first three locks? For the fourth lock: ceil(14/5)=3 -> at least three open pipes in the first four locks? For the fifth lock: ceil(15/5)=3 -> at least three open pipes in the first five locks? We have only 3 open pipes. We can try: \n                    Option1: open at locks 1,2,3: \n                        Then for the fourth lock: we require at least 3 open pipes in the first four locks -> we have 3 (at locks1,2,3) -> satisfies. Now simulate:\n                        Lock1: pipe1: 5 seconds -> 5 liters -> but volume=4 -> so 4 liters stay, 1 liter overflows to lock2.\n                        Lock2: pipe2: 5 liters, plus 1 overflow -> 6 liters -> volume=1 -> so 1 liter stays, 5 overflows to lock3. Lock3: pipe3: 5 liters, plus 5 overflow -> 10 liters -> volume=5 -> 5 liters stay, 5 overflows to lock4.\n                        Lock4: 5 liters -> volume=4 -> 4 liters stay, 1 overflow to lock5. Lock5: 1 liter -> volume=1 -> full. So it works. Then why is the example output for t=5: 4? I see the example output: -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            So for t=5, the answer is 4, not 3. This is a contradiction. After reexamining the problem: \n                \"The mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open\"\n\n            We found a solution with 3 pipes for t=5, so the answer should be 3. But the example output says 4.",

Therefore, we require ceil(s_i/t) <= i. If for some i, ceil(s_i/t) > i, then it is impossible? But we already have the condition t>=t_min = max_i ceil(s_i/i) -> which ensures that ceil(s_i/t) <= i? Because: ceil(s_i/t) <= ceil(s_i/t_min) and since t_min>=ceil(s_i/i) -> then s_i/t_min <= s_i/(ceil(s_i/i)) <= i? so ceil(s_i/t) < = i.\n\n            Therefore, the formula k0 = max_i ceil(s_i/t) is valid.

Pipe1: lock1 gets 4 liters (full) -> then any additional water from pipe1 goes to lock2. Pipe3: lock3 gets 4 liters (not full, since volume=5) -> so no overflow. Pipe4: lock4 gets 4 liters (full) -> overflow goes to lock5. Then at time>4: \n                We need to fill lock3 and lock2 and lock5? Mayor's note: \"in the following 1 second\" -> so at time 5:\n                    Pipe1: produces 1 liter -> goes to lock2 (which has volume 1) -> fills it. Pipe3: produces 1 liter -> fills lock3 (now 5 liters). Pipe4: produces 1 liter -> goes to lock5 (volume=1) -> fills it. So by time 5, all are filled. For the query with t=6, we require that the locks are filled no later than after 6 seconds -> and they are filled by time 5, so it's okay. For the query with t=2, we require that the locks are filled by time 2. With 3 pipes open at 1,3,4: At time2: \n                        lock1: 2 liters (not full)\n                        lock3: 2 liters (not full)\n                        lock4: 2 liters (not full)\n                    lock2 and lock5: 0.\n                -> not filled. Therefore, it is impossible with 3 pipes for t=2. How can they then say the answer for t=2 is 3? Unless there is a different configuration with 3 pipes that works for t=2? We try: \n                  open at locks 1,2,3: \n                    lock1: 2 from pipe1 -> not full.\n                    lock2: 2 from pipe2 -> full (volume=1) -> overflow 1 to lock3. lock3: 2 from pipe3 + 1 overflow = 3 -> not full (volume=5).\n                  lock4 and lock5: 0.\n\n                not filled. open at locks 1,2,4: lock1: 2 -> not full.\n                    lock2: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock3. lock4: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock5. lock3: 1 from overflow from lock2 -> not full.\n                    lock5: 1 from overflow from lock4 -> full. lock3 is not filled. open at locks 1,2,5: \n                    lock1: 2 -> not full.\n                    lock2: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock3. lock5: 2 -> full. lock3: 1 -> not full.\n                    lock4: 0.\n                not filled. open at locks 1,3,5: \n                    lock1: 2 -> not full. lock3: 2 -> not full. lock5: 2 -> full.\n                    lock2:0, lock4:0. not filled. open at locks 2,3,4: \n                    lock2: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock3. lock3: 2+1=3 -> not full. lock4: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock5. lock5: 1 -> full.\n                    lock1:0. not filled.

We want to maximize the number of odd subarrays.\n\nKey idea: \n  We can only have a subarray of length 1 (which has 0 inversions, even) or length>=2.\n  However, we cannot have a subarray of length 1 as odd? So we must have at least length 2 to be odd.\n\nBut note: a subarray of length 2: if it is decreasing then it is odd.\n\nBut what about longer? \n  We can break a long segment into smaller ones arbitrarily. However, we cannot break a segment of length 1.\n\nImportant: the problem is known and the solution is known to be: \n  We traverse and whenever we see a descent (a[i] < a[i-1]) we can break? But note the provided code:\n\n    numoddseg = 0\n    prev = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        if a[i] < prev:\n            numoddseg += 1\n            prev = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        i += 1\n\nBut the provided code does not work as is because the variable `prev` is set to -1 at the beginning and then when we see a descent we increment the count and reset `prev` to -1. Otherwise, we do something else.\n\nHowever, the note in the problem: \n  In the fifth test case: [4,5,6,1,2,3] -> we break after [4,5] (which is even) and then [6,1,2,3] (which is odd). So we get one odd segment.\n\nBut the provided code would break at the descent: 6 and 1? Then it would set prev=-1 and then for the next elements: 1,2,3: \n  1 < -1? -> no, then we set ... \n\nWait, the code sets `prev = a[i]` in the else? But the provided code has a TODO.\n\nActually, the provided code has:\n\n    if a[i] < prev:\n        numoddseg += 1\n        prev = -1\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete the else block.\n\nBut note: the variable `prev` is used to track the last element of the current segment? \n\nHowever, the problem is more subtle. \n\nKnown solution for the problem: \n  We can have at most k odd segments, and we can always achieve k if we break at every descent? But note: \n      [4,3,2,1] -> we break at every descent: \n          [4,3] -> odd -> count=1, then we start at 2: then 2 and 1: break -> odd -> count=2.\n      [1,2,3,4] -> no descent -> so we cannot break? Then we have one segment which is even -> count=0.\n\nBut what if we break arbitrarily? \n  We are allowed to break arbitrarily. However, we cannot break a segment of length 1 arbitrarily? Actually we can break anywhere.\n\nBut note: a segment of length 1 is even. So we don't want to break arbitrarily because we want to maximize the number of odd segments.\n\nWe can use the following greedy: \n  We traverse and we try to form the smallest possible segments that are odd? But note: we can also have segments of length 1 that are even, and we can combine two even segments to get an even segment? \n\nActually, the known solution is:\n\n  We note that the entire permutation has a fixed inversion parity. Let I be the inversion count mod 2 of the entire permutation.\n\n  Now, if we break the permutation into k segments, then the total inversion parity is the sum (mod2) of the parities of the segments.\n\n  We want to maximize the number of odd segments. Let x be the number of odd segments. Then the total inversion parity is x mod 2.\n\n  Therefore, we must have x mod 2 = I mod 2.\n\n  Also, we cannot have more than n segments. But note: we can break arbitrarily. However, we cannot have a segment of length 1 that is odd (because it has 0 inversions). So the maximum number of odd segments we can have is at most floor(n/2) because each odd segment must have at least 2 elements.\n\n  But wait: what if we have a segment of length 3? It can be odd. So we can have a segment of length 3 as odd and then we use 3 elements for one odd segment. \n\n  Actually, the constraint is: we can have at most floor(n) segments? and each odd segment must have at least 2 elements. So the maximum number of odd segments is at most floor(n/2) if we use only segments of length 2? But we can have a segment of length 3 and then we use 3 elements for one odd segment, which is less efficient than two segments of length 2? \n\n  However, we are not constrained by the total number of segments? We are only constrained by the fact that the entire permutation must be partitioned. \n\n  Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n      We can have at most k odd segments, and k must satisfy:\n          k mod 2 = I mod 2, and k <= n - (number of segments that are at least of length 1) ... \n\n  But there is a known greedy: \n      We can always achieve a number of odd segments equal to the entire inversion parity mod2 plus the maximum we can? \n\n  Actually, the known solution is to use a greedy that breaks at every descent and then we get a candidate for the maximum. However, note that we can also break at non-descents? \n\n  After reading known solutions for Codeforces problem \"Array is not a heap?\" (or similar), the solution is:\n\n      We traverse the array and whenever we have a descent we break? But then we reset the segment.\n\n  However, the provided code does:\n\n      if a[i] < prev:\n          numoddseg += 1\n          prev = -1   # meaning we start a new segment? and we set prev to -1 so that the next element won't be compared with a valid previous? \n\n      else:\n          # we set prev to a[i]? \n\n  But then what about the next element? \n\n  Example: [4,3,2,1]:\n      i=0: a[0]=4, prev=-1 -> else: set prev=4.\n      i=1: a[1]=3, 3<4 -> then we do: numoddseg +=1 -> becomes 1, and set prev=-1.\n      i=2: a[2]=2, 2 < -1? -> no, so else: set prev=2.\n      i=3: a[3]=1, 1<2 -> then numoddseg becomes 2, and set prev=-1.\n\n  This gives 2.\n\n  Example: [1,2,3,4]:\n      i0: prev=-1 -> set prev=1.\n      i1: 2>1 -> else: set prev=2.\n      i2: 3>2 -> else: set prev=3.\n      i3: 4>3 -> else: set prev=4.\n      Then we get 0.\n\n  Example: [2,1]:\n      i0: set prev=2.\n      i1: 1<2 -> then numoddseg=1, set prev=-1.\n\n  Example: [4,5,6,1,2,3]:\n      i0: set prev=4.\n      i1: 5>4 -> set prev=5.\n      i2: 6>5 -> set prev=6.\n      i3: 1<6 -> then we break: numoddseg=1, set prev=-1.\n      i4: 2 > -1 -> set prev=2.\n      i5: 3>2 -> set prev=3.\n      Then we get 1.\n\n  This matches the examples.\n\n  But what about [1,3,2]?\n      Entire array: inversion count=1 (odd). We want to maximize the number of odd segments. \n        We can break as [1,3,2] -> one odd segment -> 1.\n        Or we can break as [1] and [3,2]: then [1] is even, [3,2] is odd -> 1 odd segment -> 1.\n        Or [1,3] and [2]: [1,3] is even, [2] even -> 0.\n        So maximum is 1.\n\n      With the algorithm:\n        i0: set prev=1.\n        i1: 3>1 -> set prev=3.\n        i2: 2<3 -> then we break: numoddseg=1, set prev=-1.\n        Then we get 1.\n\n  What about [3,2,1]? \n        Entire array: inversion count=3 -> odd. We can break into [3,2] and [1] -> 1 odd segment? \n        But we can also break into [3,2,1] -> one odd segment? \n        However, we can break into [3,2] and [1] -> 1 odd segment? \n        But note: we can break into [3], [2,1] -> then we have one odd segment? \n        Actually, we can break into [3,2] and [1] -> 1 odd segment, or [3] and [2,1] -> 1 odd segment, or [3,2,1] -> 1 odd segment. \n        The algorithm:\n          i0: set prev=3.\n          i1: 2<3 -> break: numoddseg=1, set prev=-1.\n          i2: 1>-1 -> set prev=1? \n          Then we finish: numoddseg=1.\n\n        But we could break at the end? Actually, we break at the first descent? \n\n        However, what if we break at the second descent? \n          We are traversing and we break at the first descent (i1) and then we start a new segment at i2. \n\n        But note: the segment [2,1] is also a descent? But we are processing one element at a time. \n\n        The algorithm breaks at every descent? Then we get two breaks? \n          Actually, after breaking at i1, we set prev=-1. Then at i2: we are at element 1, and we set prev=1. Then we finish. \n          We don't break at the end? \n\n        How do we get two breaks? \n          We break at the first descent (i1) and then at the next element (i2) we don't have a descent? \n          But then we don't break again? \n\n        However, we can break arbitrarily? The algorithm is greedy: whenever we see a descent in the current segment, we break and reset the segment.\n\n        But note: the segment we break at the first descent is [3,2] and then the next segment is [1] -> which is not a descent? \n\n        How to get two breaks? \n          We break at the first descent: [3,2] -> then we break again at the next element? But the next element is [1] and we cannot break after [1] because there is no next? \n\n        Actually, we can break at the end of the array? \n\n        But the algorithm does not break at the end? \n\n        However, the problem: [3,2,1] -> we can break into [3,2] and [1] -> one odd segment. \n        But we can also break into [3], [2,1] -> one odd segment? \n        Or we can break into [3,2,1] -> one odd segment? \n\n        How to get two odd segments? \n          We break into [3,2] and [1] -> only one odd segment? \n          Or [3] and [2,1] -> one odd segment? \n          We cannot break into three segments? Then we have two segments of length 1 and one of length 1? no odd segment? \n\n        Actually, we cannot have two odd segments because we only have two descents? \n          [3,2] -> odd, [2,1] -> but wait, if we break after 3 and after 2, then we have [3], [2], [1] -> no odd segment? \n          Or [3,2] and [1] -> one odd segment? \n          Or [3] and [2,1] -> one odd segment? \n          Or [3,2,1] -> one odd segment? \n\n        So the maximum is 1.\n\n        But the algorithm returns 1.\n\n        However, what about [4,3,2,1]? \n          We break at the first descent: [4,3] -> count=1, then we start at 2: then we see 2 and then 1: 1<2 -> break: count=2.\n\n        So the algorithm returns 2.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          numoddseg = 0\n          prev = -1   # meaning no current segment\n          for each element x in the array:\n              if x < prev:   # then we break at the previous element? meaning we form a segment ending at the previous element?\n                  numoddseg += 1\n                  prev = -1   # reset the current segment\n              else:\n                  prev = x   # we continue the current segment and set the last element to x\n\n          Then output numoddseg.\n\n        Why does this work?\n          We break at every descent? And then we reset the segment so that the next element starts a new segment? \n          But note: after resetting, we set prev=-1, so the next element (which is the one that caused the break) is not compared with anything? Actually, we then set prev to that element in the next iteration? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n          i = 0\n          while i < n:\n              if a[i] < prev:\n                  numoddseg += 1\n                  prev = -1\n              else:\n                  # TODO: set prev = a[i]?\n                  prev = a[i]   # we set the current element as the last element of the current segment\n              i += 1\n\n        This matches the examples.\n\n        But what about a segment of three that is odd? \n          Example: [1,3,2] -> \n            i0: prev=-1 -> else: set prev=1.\n            i1: 3>1 -> else: set prev=3.\n            i2: 2<3 -> then we break: numoddseg=1, and set prev=-1.\n\n          Then we are done. So we get one segment: [1,3,2] is broken into [1,3] and [2]? \n          But wait, the break happens at the descent at the last element? Then the segment is [1,3,2]? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm does not break the array at the point of the descent? It breaks the segment at the point of the descent? \n\n          How does the algorithm break? \n            The algorithm does not physically break the array, but it resets the current segment. \n            The break happens at the current element? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm is processing the array sequentially. When we see a descent (a[i] < prev), we count one odd segment and then reset the current segment (so that the next element starts a new segment). \n\n          But note: the element that caused the break (a[i]) is not included in the current segment? \n\n          How does the algorithm include the element that caused the break? \n            After resetting, we set prev=-1. Then in the next iteration, we start a new segment? But the element that caused the break is already processed? \n\n          Actually, the element that caused the break is processed in the same iteration: we check a[i] against prev (which was the last element of the current segment) and then we reset. Then we move to the next element? \n\n          But the element that caused the break is then lost? \n\n          Example: [1,3,2]:\n            i0: a[0]=1 -> else: set prev=1.\n            i1: a[1]=3 -> else: set prev=3.\n            i2: a[2]=2 -> 2<3 -> then we do: numoddseg=1, and set prev=-1. Then we are done.\n\n          Then the segment [1,3,2] is broken at the end? So we have one segment? But we broke at the last element? \n\n          Actually, the break does not remove the element? The element is included in the current segment? \n\n          How? \n            The segment we are forming is from the last reset (or the beginning) up to and including the element that caused the break? \n            Then we break after that element? \n\n          But the algorithm does not skip the element. It processes the element and then moves to the next. \n\n          The segment that is broken is the segment that ends at the element that caused the break? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm: \n            We are building a segment. We start at the beginning (or after a reset). We add elements until we see a descent? Then we break the segment at that descent? meaning the segment includes the element that caused the descent? \n\n          Then the segment [1,3,2] is broken at the end? So we have one segment: [1,3,2]? But then we count one odd segment? \n\n          But the segment [1,3,2] has one inversion? which is odd -> so it is odd. \n\n          Then we break and reset. Then we are done. \n\n          So the algorithm counts the entire segment as one odd segment? \n\n          But what if we break after the first two? \n            The algorithm does not do that? \n\n          How can we break after the first two? \n            We break at the first descent? The first descent is at the last element? \n\n          But note: we break at the first descent we encounter? \n\n          The algorithm does not look ahead? \n\n          However, the problem: we are allowed to break arbitrarily. The greedy: we break as soon as we see a descent? \n\n          Why is that optimal? \n            Because if we have a descent, we can break immediately and get one odd segment. Then we start a new segment. \n\n          But what if we don't break at the first descent? \n            Then we might be able to break later and get more segments? \n\n          However, note: if we don't break at the first descent, then we continue the segment. Then the segment becomes longer. The inversion parity of the segment might change? \n\n          But we are trying to maximize the count. We can always break at the first descent and get one odd segment, and then the rest we can break arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, the greedy is optimal: we break at every descent? \n\n          Why? \n            Because if we have a descent, we can break and get one odd segment. Then we reset and we can start again. \n\n          But what if we have two consecutive descents? \n            Example: [3,2,1]:\n              i0: set prev=3.\n              i1: 2<3 -> break: count=1, reset prev=-1.\n              i2: 1>-1 -> set prev=1.\n              Then we are done: count=1.\n\n          But we could break at the next descent? \n            If we don't break at the first descent, then we have:\n              i0: set prev=3.\n              i1: 2<3 -> we don't break? Then we set prev=2? (but the algorithm breaks, so we don't have that option)\n\n          The algorithm breaks at the first descent. \n\n          However, we can simulate: \n            If we don't break at the first descent, then we set prev=2? \n            Then at i2: 1<2 -> then we break: count=1, and reset. \n            Then we get one odd segment? \n\n          So we get the same count? \n\n          But what if we have [4,3,1,2]? \n            Entire array: inversions: \n                [4,3]: 1, [4,1]:1, [4,2]:1, [3,1]:1, [3,2]:1, [1,2]:0 -> total 5 -> odd.\n            We want to maximize the number of odd segments.\n\n            Possibilities:\n              Break at every descent: \n                [4,3] -> odd (count=1), then [1,2] -> even -> total 1.\n              Break after 4: [4], [3,1,2] -> [3,1,2]: inversions: [3,1]:1, [3,2]:1, [1,2]:0 -> total 2 -> even -> then total odd segments=0.\n              Break after 3: [4,3,1] and [2]: [4,3,1]: inversions: [4,3]:1, [4,1]:1, [3,1]:1 -> 3 -> odd; [2] even -> total 1.\n              Break after 1: [4,3,1] (odd) and [2] (even) -> 1.\n              Break at 4 and 1: [4], [3,1] (odd), [2] -> total 1.\n              Break at 3 and 1: [4,3] (odd), [1,2] (even) -> 1.\n\n            Maximum is 1.\n\n            With the algorithm:\n              i0: set prev=4.\n              i1: 3<4 -> break: count=1, reset prev=-1.\n              i2: 1>-1 -> set prev=1.\n              i3: 2>1 -> set prev=2 -> no break.\n              Then we get 1.\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          But what if we have [3,1,4,2]? \n            Entire array: inversions: [3,1]:1, [3,4]:0, [3,2]:1, [1,4]:0, [1,2]:0, [4,2]:1 -> total 3 -> odd.\n            We want to maximize the number of odd segments.\n\n            Possibilities:\n              Break at every descent: \n                [3,1] -> odd (count=1), then [4,2] -> odd (count=2) -> total 2.\n              How? \n                i0: set prev=3.\n                i1: 1<3 -> break: count=1, reset prev=-1.\n                i2: 4>-1 -> set prev=4.\n                i3: 2<4 -> break: count=2, reset prev=-1.\n\n            Then we output 2.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is: \n            We traverse the array. We maintain the last element of the current segment (prev). \n            Initially, prev = -1 (so the first element is always added without breaking).\n            For each element a[i]:\n                if a[i] < prev: \n                    then we break: we count one odd segment and reset the current segment (set prev=-1).\n                else:\n                    we set prev = a[i] (meaning we extend the current segment with a[i] and set it as the last element).\n\n          Then we output the count.\n\n          But note: what if the last segment is non-empty? \n            The last segment is not broken by a descent? Then it is even? So we don't count it? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3]: \n            We never break, so we have one segment which is even -> count=0.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else block is:\n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          But note: the variable `i` in the loop is being used as the index. However, the outer loop uses `i` as the test case index? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]\n                a = lines[i+1]\n\n                numoddseg = 0\n                prev = -1\n                i = 0   # this overwrites the outer i? \n                while i < n:\n                    if a[i] < prev:\n                        numoddseg += 1\n                        prev = -1\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    i += 1\n\n          The inner loop uses `i` as the index for the array, but the outer loop variable `i` is overwritten. \n\n          However, the outer loop variable `i` is not used after we set `n` and `a`. \n\n          But note: the outer loop is iterating over test cases. The inner loop uses `i` as the index for the current test case array. \n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          So the missing code for program1.py is: \n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          But note: the array is named `a` (as set by `a = lines[i+1]`).\n\n          Therefore, in the else block: we set `prev = a[i]`.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given:\n      n, then a list of n volumes, then q queries (each query is a time t_j).\n\n  We are to compute for each query: the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled.\n\n  We note:\n      The water system: \n          There are n locks. \n          Each pipe at lock i adds 1 liter per second to lock i. \n          If lock i overflows, the excess water goes to lock i+1 (and so on).\n\n      We need to fill all locks: that is, for lock i, we need at least v_i liters of water to have passed through it (but note: water can come from upstream pipes as well).\n\n      The total water that has entered the system is the total number of open pipes multiplied by t_j.\n\n      However, the water is distributed in a cascading manner.\n\n  Important: \n      The water that ends up in lock i is the sum of the water from the open pipes at locks 1 to i, but constrained by the volumes of the intermediate locks.\n\n      Specifically, the water that reaches lock i is:\n          w_i = min( v_i, (total water from pipes at locks 1 to i) - (water that filled the previous locks) )\n\n      But note: the water that filled the previous locks is the sum of the volumes of the previous locks? Not exactly: because the previous locks might have been filled by water that came from even further upstream? \n\n      Actually, we can compute the water in lock i as:\n\n          Let x_j be the amount of water produced by the pipe at lock j (which is t_j if the pipe is open, 0 otherwise). \n          Then the water in lock 1: min(v_1, x_1)\n          The water in lock 2: min(v_2, x_1 + x_2 - min(v_1, x_1)) \n          But wait: the overflow from lock 1 is x_1 - min(v_1, x_1) = max(0, x_1 - v_1). Then the water in lock 2: min(v_2, max(0, x_1 - v_1) + x_2)\n\n      However, we are free to choose which pipes to open? And we want to minimize the number of open pipes.\n\n  We are to answer q queries: for a fixed t_j, we want the minimum number of open pipes (say k) such that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled.\n\n  Note: if we open k pipes, then the total water that has entered the system is k * t_j.\n\n  But we must have at least the total volume of the locks: so k * t_j >= S, where S = v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_n.\n\n  However, that is not sufficient: because the water must traverse the locks in order. \n\n  We also have the constraint that the water that reaches lock i must be at least v_i. \n\n  How to compute the minimum time required for a fixed set of open pipes? \n      It is known that the time required to fill the system is at least the maximum over i of: \n          ceil( (v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_i) / (number of open pipes in the first i locks) )\n\n      Why? \n          The water that fills the first i locks must come from the open pipes in the first i locks. \n          The total water that the open pipes in the first i locks can provide in t seconds is: (number of open pipes in the first i locks) * t.\n          And we need: (number of open pipes in the first i locks) * t >= v_1 + ... + v_i.\n\n      Therefore, t >= ceil( (v_1+...+v_i) / (number of open pipes in the first i locks) ) for every i.\n\n      But note: we can choose which pipes to open arbitrarily? \n\n      Therefore, for a fixed k (number of open pipes) and fixed t, we can fill the system if and only if:\n          For every i from 1 to n: \n              the number of open pipes in the first i locks (let f(i) be that number) must satisfy: f(i) * t >= s_i, where s_i = v_1+...+v_i.\n\n      And we want to minimize k.\n\n      How to minimize k? \n          We note that k must be at least ceil(S / t) (for i=n: f(n)=k, and we require k*t>=S).\n\n      But also, for each i, we require f(i) >= ceil(s_i / t).\n\n      Therefore, the minimal k must be at least M = max( ceil(S/t), max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(s_i/t) )? \n\n      However, note: we can choose the open pipes arbitrarily. We want to minimize k. We can choose the open pipes to be as far to the right as possible? \n\n      But the constraint for the first i locks: we must have at least ceil(s_i/t) open pipes in the first i locks.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal k that satisfies:\n          k >= ceil(S/t)\n          and for every i: the number of open pipes in the first i locks >= ceil(s_i/t)\n\n      How to assign the open pipes to minimize k? \n          We can use a greedy: we want to minimize k, so we want to use as few open pipes as possible. But we must satisfy the constraints for every prefix.\n\n          The minimal k must be at least the maximum over i of ceil(s_i/t). Why?\n            For the prefix i, we require at least ceil(s_i/t) open pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, k (the total open pipes) must be at least ceil(s_i/t) for every i? \n            Actually, no: because the constraint for the prefix i only requires that the open pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(s_i/t). The total open pipes k might be larger, but we can put the extra open pipes after the first i locks.\n\n          However, the constraint for the last prefix (i=n) is k>=ceil(S/t). And for the other prefixes, we require that the open pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(s_i/t). \n\n          How to minimize k? \n            We can choose the open pipes arbitrarily. We want to minimize k. We can try to put the open pipes as far to the right as possible? \n            But note: if we put an open pipe at a lock j, it only helps the prefixes that include j.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal k is the maximum over i of ceil(s_i/t)? \n\n          But note: the constraint for the prefix i: the open pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(s_i/t). \n          We can choose the open pipes arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total k. \n\n          We can use a greedy: \n            We know that we must have at least ceil(s_i/t) open pipes in the first i locks. \n            We can define d_i = ceil(s_i/t). Then the constraints are: \n                f(1) >= d_1\n                f(2) >= d_2\n                ...\n                f(n) >= d_n\n\n            and f(n)=k.\n\n            We want to minimize k. \n\n            How? \n              We note that the sequence f(i) must be non-decreasing? and f(i) is the number of open pipes in the first i locks, so it is non-decreasing.\n\n            The minimal non-decreasing sequence f(i) that satisfies f(i)>=d_i for every i, and we want to minimize f(n).\n\n            The minimal f(n) is the maximum of the d_i? \n\n            Why? \n              We can set f(i) = max(d_1, d_2, ..., d_i). Then f(i) is non-decreasing? \n              But note: we require f(i)>=d_i, and we can set f(i)=max_{j<=i} d_j? \n              Then f(n)=max(d_1,...,d_n).\n\n            However, is that sufficient? \n              For the prefix i, we require f(i)>=d_i. And if we set f(i)=max_{j<=i} d_j, then certainly f(i)>=d_i.\n\n            But note: we are free to choose the open pipes arbitrarily? and the constraint is only on the prefix sums? \n\n            Therefore, the minimal k is k0 = max( d_1, d_2, ..., d_n ) = max_{i} ceil(s_i/t).\n\n          However, note: we also have the constraint for the entire system: k0 * t must be at least S? \n            But note: d_n = ceil(S/t) so k0>=ceil(S/t). Therefore, k0 is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t) for i=1..n, and it automatically satisfies k0>=ceil(S/t).\n\n          Therefore, for a fixed t, the minimal number of pipes k is k0 = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(s_i/t).\n\n          But wait: what if t is very small? \n            Example: t=1, and volumes [1,1]. Then s1=1 -> ceil(1/1)=1, s2=2 -> ceil(2/1)=2. Then k0=2. \n            We need 2 pipes: then total water=2, which is enough.\n\n          Example: t=2, volumes [1,1]. Then s1=ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, s2=ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. Then k0=1. \n            We open one pipe: \n                If we open at lock1: \n                    lock1: min(1, 2) = 1 -> then overflow 1 -> lock2: min(1,1)=1 -> filled.\n                If we open at lock2: \n                    lock1: 0 -> not filled? \n                So we must open at lock1? \n\n            But the constraint for the first lock: we require at least ceil(1/2)=1 open pipe in the first lock? \n                So we must have an open pipe in the first lock? \n\n            Then we cannot open only at lock2? \n\n            Therefore, the minimal k is 1, but we must open a pipe in the first lock? \n\n            How does the constraint k0=1 tell us that we must have an open pipe in the first lock? \n                The constraint for the first lock: d1=ceil(1/2)=1 -> so we require at least one open pipe in the first lock. \n                Therefore, the open pipe must be in the first lock? \n\n            Then we open at lock1: and it works.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal k is k0 = max_i ceil(s_i/t). \n\n          But note: what if t is not enough? \n            We have a condition: if t < t_min, then we output -1. \n            The code already computes:\n\n                s = 0\n                t_min = 0\n                for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n                    s += v\n                    div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n                    t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n            What is this t_min? \n                For the prefix i, we require that the time t must be at least ceil(s_i / i). Why i? \n                Because if we open at most i pipes (in the first i locks) then the total water we can get in the first i locks is at most i*t. \n                We require i*t >= s_i -> t>=ceil(s_i/i).\n\n            Therefore, t_min = max_i ceil(s_i/i) is the minimum time required to fill the system? \n\n            But note: we can open pipes arbitrarily? and we are not constrained to open pipes only in the first i locks? \n                Actually, the constraint for the prefix i: the open pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(s_i/t). \n                But we are computing t_min as the maximum over i of ceil(s_i/i). \n\n            Why is that the minimum time? \n                Consider: if we open k pipes, then the time t must satisfy: \n                    t >= ceil(s_i / f(i)) for every i, and f(i) is the number of open pipes in the first i locks, which is at most i? \n                But we can open pipes arbitrarily? so we can open more than i? \n\n            Actually, the constraint for the prefix i: we require that the open pipes in the first i locks (which we denote by f(i)) must be at least ceil(s_i/t). \n                Therefore, we require that there exists a non-decreasing sequence f(i) (with f(i)<=i, because there are only i locks in the prefix) such that f(i)>=ceil(s_i/t) and f(n)=k.\n\n            The minimal t for which there exists such a k is when we set f(i)=ceil(s_i/t) for every i? \n                But note: we require f(i) to be non-decreasing? and ceil(s_i/t) might not be non-decreasing? \n\n            Example: [1, 3] -> \n                s1=1 -> ceil(1/t) \n                s2=4 -> ceil(4/t)\n                If t=2: \n                    ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(4/2)=2 -> then we can set f(1)=1, f(2)=2 -> non-decreasing? \n                If t=1: \n                    ceil(1/1)=1, ceil(4/1)=4 -> but we cannot have f(2)=4 because we only have 2 locks? \n\n            Therefore, the constraint for the prefix i: we require that ceil(s_i/t) <= i? \n                And also, we require that the sequence ceil(s_i/t) is non-decreasing? \n\n            Actually, the sequence s_i is increasing, so ceil(s_i/t) is non-decreasing? \n\n            But note: if t is large, then ceil(s_i/t) might be 1 for all i? \n\n            However, the minimal time t_min is computed as the maximum over i of ceil(s_i/i). Why?\n\n            Explanation from known problems (like \"River Locks\"): \n                The minimal time required to fill the system is the maximum over i of ceil(s_i / i). \n                Why i? \n                  Because the total water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time t is at most i*t (since there are at most i pipes that can contribute to the first i locks, each producing at most t liters). \n                  Therefore, we require i*t >= s_i -> t>=ceil(s_i/i).\n\n            Therefore, the minimal time t_min0 = max_i ceil(s_i/i). \n\n            The code computes:\n\n                s = 0\n                t_min = 0\n                for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n                    s += v\n                    div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n                    t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n            This t_min is the minimal time required? \n\n            Then for a query t_j: \n                if t_j < t_min: output -1.\n                else: output k0 = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j)\n\n          But note: the example in the problem: \n            Input: \n                5\n                4 1 5 4 1\n                6\n                1\n                2\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n\n            The volumes: [4,1,5,4,1] -> n=5, s1=4, s2=5, s3=10, s4=14, s5=15.\n\n            Compute t_min = max( ceil(4/1), ceil(5/2), ceil(10/3), ceil(14/4), ceil(15/5) )\n                = max( ceil(4)=4, ceil(2.5)=3, ceil(3.333)=4, ceil(3.5)=4, ceil(3)=3 ) = 4.\n\n            Then for queries:\n                t=1,2,3: output -1.\n                t=4: k0 = max( ceil(4/4)=1, ceil(5/4)=2, ceil(10/4)=3, ceil(14/4)=4, ceil(15/4)=4 ) = 4.\n                t=5: k0 = max( ceil(4/5)=1, ceil(5/5)=1, ceil(10/5)=2, ceil(14/5)= ceil(2.8)=3, ceil(15/5)=3) = 3.\n                t=6: k0 = max( ceil(4/6)=1, ceil(5/6)=1, ceil(10/6)= ceil(1.666)=2, ceil(14/6)= ceil(2.333)=3, ceil(15/6)= ceil(2.5)=3) = 3.\n\n            The example output: \n                -1\n                3   # for t=2? but t=2<4 -> -1? \n                -1\n                -1\n                4   # for t=5: 3? \n                3   # for t=6: 3\n\n            But the example note says: \n                In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4. -> 3 pipes.\n\n            And the second query: one can open pipes in locks 1,3,4 -> 3 pipes.\n\n            The example input queries: \n                1\n                2\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n\n            The example output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            But our computation for t=2: \n                k0 = max( ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3, ceil(10/2)=5, ceil(14/2)=7, ceil(15/2)=8) = 8? \n\n            Why 3? \n\n            We must reexamine: \n                The constraint for the prefix i: we require that the number of open pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(s_i/t). \n                For t=2: \n                    prefix1: ceil(4/2)=2 -> we need at least 2 open pipes in the first lock? but there is only one lock? \n                    -> impossible? \n\n            But the example says the answer for t=2 is 3? \n\n            How can 3 pipes work in 2 seconds? \n                Total water = 3*2 = 6.\n                The total volume is 15? -> 6<15 -> impossible.\n\n            The example note: \n                \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n            And the first lock has volume 4. If we open all 5 pipes, then in 1 second we get 5 liters? but the first lock can only hold 4? then 1 liter overflows? \n                After 1 second: lock1 is full, and 1 liter goes to lock2? \n                Then lock2 (volume=1) gets 1 liter -> full? \n                Then lock3: gets the overflow from lock2? but lock2 didn't overflow? \n                Then lock3,4,5: not filled.\n\n            After 2 seconds: \n                lock1: 4 (full) -> overflow 4? (because 5 pipes * 2 seconds = 10 liters at lock1: 4 for lock1, 6 overflow)\n                lock2: gets 6 liters? but it only holds 1 -> so it becomes full and overflows 5.\n                lock3: gets 5 liters? but it holds 5 -> full? \n                lock4: 0? \n                lock5: 0? \n\n            So lock4 and lock5 are not filled.\n\n            Therefore, it is impossible to fill all locks in 2 seconds? \n\n            But the example says the second query (t=2) is 3? \n\n            Actually, the example input has 6 queries. The first query is t=1, the second is t=2, etc.\n\n            The example output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            This does not match our computation for t=2: we think it should be -1.\n\n            Let me read the example note again: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5. The lock 3 is filled by its own pipe.\"\n\n            And for the second query: \n                \"In the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n            But the second query has t=2 seconds? \n\n            How can they fill in 2 seconds? \n                They open pipes at locks 1,3,4 -> 3 pipes -> total water in 2 seconds: 6 liters.\n\n                The total volume is 15 -> 6<15 -> impossible.\n\n            Therefore, the example note must be referring to a different query? \n\n            The example note says: \n                \"Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n            And the example input: \n                n=5, volumes = [4,1,5,4,1]\n                queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n            The example output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            The second query is t=2 -> output 3? \n            The sixth query is t=6 -> output 3.\n\n            The example note says: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\" -> so that matches.\n\n            And for the second query: \"Similarly\" -> meaning also 3 pipes? but then how? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after t_j seconds.\"\n\n            Note: \"no later than\" -> so we can take more than t_j seconds? \n\n            But the problem: \n                \"after t_j seconds\" -> meaning at time t_j, the locks are filled? \n\n            The example: \n                After 4 seconds: lock1 and lock4 are full. Then in the following 1 second (so at second 5) the water from lock1 (which was produced in the first 4 seconds) and lock4 (produced in the first 4 seconds) overflows? \n\n            But the water from the pipe at lock1 in the first 4 seconds: 4 liters -> fills lock1. \n            The pipe at lock3: 4 seconds -> 4 liters -> but lock3 has volume 5 -> not full? \n            The pipe at lock4: 4 seconds -> 4 liters -> fills lock4.\n\n            Then at second 5: \n                The pipe at lock1: produces 1 more liter -> overflows to lock2 -> fills lock2 (volume=1) -> then the overflow from lock2 is 0? \n                The pipe at lock3: produces 1 more liter -> fills lock3 (now 5 liters) -> full.\n                The pipe at lock4: produces 1 more liter -> overflows to lock5 -> fills lock5 (volume=1).\n\n            So at time 5, all locks are filled.\n\n            But the query is for t_j=6 seconds? -> then we have 6 seconds? \n                Then we can do the same with 3 pipes? and it will be filled by time 5 which is <=6.\n\n            For the second query: t_j=2 seconds? \n                We open 3 pipes: \n                    We need to fill by time 2? \n                At time 2:\n                    lock1: 2 liters (from pipe1) -> not full.\n                    lock3: 2 liters -> not full.\n                    lock4: 2 liters -> not full.\n                Then lock2 and lock5: 0.\n\n                So not filled.\n\n            Therefore, the example output for t=2 should be -1? \n\n            But the example output says 3? \n\n            There is a known solution for this problem: \n                We compute t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i) = 4 (as above).\n                Then for a query t: \n                    if t < t_min: -1\n                    else: k = max_i ceil(s_i / t)\n\n                For t=2: 2<4 -> -1.\n\n            However, the example output for the second query is 3, not -1.\n\n            I see the example input has 6 queries, and the example output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            This matches the known solution only for t>=4? \n\n            For t=5: k = max(ceil(4/5)=1, ceil(5/5)=1, ceil(10/5)=2, ceil(14/5)= ceil(2.8)=3, ceil(15/5)=3) = 3? \n            But the example output for t=5 is 4.\n\n            And for t=6: k=3.\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            After reading the known problem (Codeforces Round #783 (Div. 1) A) and its solution:\n\n            The known solution is:\n\n                We compute:\n                    t_min = max( ceil(s_i / i) for i in [1, n] )\n\n                Then for a query t:\n                    if t < t_min: \n                        ans = -1\n                    else:\n                        # We compute ans = max( ceil(s_i / t) ) for i in [1, n] \n                        # BUT note: ceil(s_i/t) might be fractional? and we take the ceiling.\n\n                However, the example for t=5: \n                    s1=4 -> ceil(4/5)=1\n                    s2=5 -> ceil(5/5)=1\n                    s3=10 -> ceil(10/5)=2\n                    s4=14 -> ceil(14/5)= ceil(2.8)=3\n                    s5=15 -> ceil(15/5)=3\n                    then ans = 3.\n\n                But the example output for t=5 is 4.\n\n            Why 4? \n\n            Let me try with 3 pipes for t=5: \n                Total water = 15, which is exactly the total volume.\n\n                How to distribute? \n                  We need to assign 3 open pipes to 3 locks. \n                  The constraint: \n                    For the first lock: we require at least ceil(4/5)=1 open pipe in the first lock -> we must have at least one open pipe in lock1? \n                    For the second lock: ceil(5/5)=1 -> at least one open pipe in the first two locks? \n                    For the third lock: ceil(10/5)=2 -> at least two open pipes in the first three locks? \n                    For the fourth lock: ceil(14/5)=3 -> at least three open pipes in the first four locks? \n                    For the fifth lock: ceil(15/5)=3 -> at least three open pipes in the first five locks? \n\n                We have only 3 open pipes. \n                We can try: \n                    Option1: open at locks 1,2,3: \n                        Then for the fourth lock: we require at least 3 open pipes in the first four locks -> we have 3 (at locks1,2,3) -> satisfies.\n                    Now simulate:\n                        Lock1: pipe1: 5 seconds -> 5 liters -> but volume=4 -> so 4 liters stay, 1 liter overflows to lock2.\n                        Lock2: pipe2: 5 liters, plus 1 overflow -> 6 liters -> volume=1 -> so 1 liter stays, 5 overflows to lock3.\n                        Lock3: pipe3: 5 liters, plus 5 overflow -> 10 liters -> volume=5 -> 5 liters stay, 5 overflows to lock4.\n                        Lock4: 5 liters -> volume=4 -> 4 liters stay, 1 overflow to lock5.\n                        Lock5: 1 liter -> volume=1 -> full.\n\n                    So it works.\n\n                Then why is the example output for t=5: 4? \n\n            I see the example output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            So for t=5, the answer is 4, not 3.\n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n            After reexamining the problem: \n                \"The mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open\"\n\n            We found a solution with 3 pipes for t=5, so the answer should be 3.\n\n            But the example output says 4.\n\n            There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n            Let me read the example note: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\" -> for t=6, we open 3 pipes.\n\n                \"Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\" -> for t=2, we open 3 pipes? but we saw that for t=2, 3 pipes are not enough.\n\n            And for the fifth query: \n                \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\"\n\n            So for t=5, they open 4 pipes.\n\n            Why would we open 4 pipes when 3 works? \n\n            The problem asks for the minimum number of pipes.\n\n            Therefore, the example output for t=5 should be 3.\n\n            But it is 4.\n\n            This indicates the known solution might be different.\n\n            After checking a known submission for the problem (River Locks) from Codeforces:\n\n            We find that the solution is:\n\n                t_min = max( (s_i + i - 1) // i for i in range(1, n+1) )\n                Then for a query t:\n                    if t < t_min:\n                        print(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # The answer is (total_volume + t - 1) // t   ??? \n\n            But wait, that would be the total water needed: ceil(S/t) = ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n            But then for t=5, we get 3.\n\n            However, the example output for t=5 is 4.\n\n            Another idea: \n                The minimal number of pipes is the maximum over i of ceil(s_i / t), but also we cannot have more than i open pipes in the first i locks? \n                Therefore, we require ceil(s_i/t) <= i.\n                If for some i, ceil(s_i/t) > i, then it is impossible? \n\n            But we already have the condition t>=t_min = max_i ceil(s_i/i) -> which ensures that ceil(s_i/t) <= i? \n                Because: ceil(s_i/t) <= ceil(s_i/t_min) and since t_min>=ceil(s_i/i) -> then s_i/t_min <= s_i/(ceil(s_i/i)) <= i? \n                so ceil(s_i/t) <= i.\n\n            Therefore, the formula k0 = max_i ceil(s_i/t) is valid.\n\n            But then for t=5: k0=3.\n\n            The only possibility is that the example provided in the problem has different volumes? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"The first example test\"\n\n            The input example: \n                5\n                4 1 5 4 1\n                6\n                1\n                2\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n\n            Output: \n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            This is the example we are following.\n\n            How can the answer for t=5 be 4? \n                If we open 4 pipes, then total water=20, which is more than enough.\n\n            But the minimum number of pipes is 3, not 4.\n\n            Unless the simulation with 3 pipes does not work? \n                We did a simulation and it worked.\n\n            Therefore, the example output might be in error? \n\n            But the problem note says for the fifth query: \n                \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\"\n\n            This suggests that they are not claiming that 4 is the minimum, but they are giving an example that uses 4.\n\n            The problem asks for the minimum.\n\n            Given the known solution and the simulation, the minimum for t=5 is 3.\n\n            Therefore, the intended solution is: \n                if t < t_min: -1\n                else: k = max_i ceil(s_i/t)\n\n            Then for the example:\n                t=5: k = 3.\n\n            But the example output for t=5 is 4.\n\n            This is a discrepancy.\n\n            After checking the official editorial or known submissions, we find:\n\n            A known submission in C++ for this problem (from the contest) is:\n\n                #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                using namespace std;\n                typedef long long

n-1, so i+1 is the prefix length]\n                then for a query t: \n                    if t < mx: -1\n                    else: output ceil(sum/t)\n\n            In our example: \n                s0 = v0 = 4 -> ceil(4/1)=4\n                s1 = 4+1=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3\n                s2 = 10 -> ceil(10/3)=4\n                s3 = 14 -> ceil(14/4)=4\n                s4 = 15 -> ceil(15/5)=3\n

 Given the example output in the problem is:\n\n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            and the note says for the sixth query (t=6) the answer is 3, and for the second query (t=2) the answer is 3, \n\n            we must reconcile.\n\n            After re-read the problem: \n                \"water exceeding the volume of the lock i is transferred to the lock i+1\"\n\n            and\n\n                \"effectively the water goes to locks 2 and 5\"\n\n            in the example with open pipes at 1,3,4 after 4 seconds.\n\n            How does the water go to lock2 and lock5? \n                Pipe1: lock1 gets 4 liters (full) -> then any additional water from pipe1 goes to lock2.\n                Pipe3: lock3 gets 4 liters (not full, since volume=5) -> so no overflow.\n                Pipe4: lock4 gets 4 liters (full) -> overflow goes to lock5.\n\n            Then at time>4: \n                We need to fill lock3 and lock2 and lock5? \n                Mayor's note: \"in the following 1 second\" -> so at time 5:\n                    Pipe1: produces 1 liter -> goes to lock2 (which has volume 1) -> fills it.\n                    Pipe3: produces 1 liter -> fills lock3 (now 5 liters).\n                    Pipe4: produces 1 liter -> goes to lock5 (volume=1) -> fills it.\n\n            So by time 5, all are filled.\n\n            For the query with t=6, we require that the locks are filled no later than after 6 seconds -> and they are filled by time 5, so it's okay.\n\n            For the query with t=2, we require that the locks are filled by time 2. \n                With 3 pipes open at 1,3,4:\n                    At time2: \n                        lock1: 2 liters (not full)\n                        lock3: 2 liters (not full)\n                        lock4: 2 liters (not full)\n                    lock2 and lock5: 0.\n                -> not filled.\n\n            Therefore, it is impossible with 3 pipes for t=2.\n\n            How can they then say the answer for t=2 is 3? \n\n            Unless there is a different configuration with 3 pipes that works for t=2? \n                We try: \n                  open at locks 1,2,3: \n                    lock1: 2 from pipe1 -> not full.\n                    lock2: 2 from pipe2 -> full (volume=1) -> overflow 1

open all: \n                    lock1: 2 -> not full.\n                    lock2: 2 -> full -> overflow 1 to lock3.\n                    lock3: 2+1=3 -> not full.\n                    lock4: 2 -> full

Therefore, the answer for t=2 should be -1.\n\n            Given the above, the example output provided in the problem for the example test is:\n\n                -1\n                3   [ for t=2 ]\n                -1\n                -1\n                4   [ for t=5 ]\n                3   [ for t=6 ]\n\n            must be incorrect.\n\n            However, the problem might have a different example.\n\n            The first example test in the problem statement is: \n                Input: \n                    5\n                    4 1 5 4 1\n                    6\n                    1\n                    2\n                    3\n                    4\n                    5\n                    6\n\n                Output: \n                    -1\n                    3\n                    -1\n                    -1\n                    4\n                    3\n\n            And the note says: \n                In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. \n                In the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\n\n            This implies that the minimum number of pipes for the sixth query is 3, and for the second query is 3.\n\n            Given our simulation, for the sixth query (t=6) we can indeed use 3 pipes.\n\n            For the second query (t=2) we cannot.\n\n            Therefore, the example output for the second query should be -1, not 3.\n\n            This suggests that the example output in the problem statement has a mistake.\n\n            Given the known solution from the submissions, we will output for each query t:\n\n                if t < t_min: -1\n                else: ceil(total_volume / t)\n\n            where t_min = max_i ceil(s_i/i)\n\n            In the example: \n                t_min = 4.\n                For t=2: 2<4 -> -1.\n                For t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n                For t=6: ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n            Therefore, the example output should be:\n\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n\n            But the example output in the problem is:\n\n                -1\n                3\n                -1\n                -1\n                4\n                3\n\n            This means the provided example output in the problem is incorrect.\n\n            However, the problem might have intended a different example.\n\n            Another possibility: the volumes in the example are not [4,1,5,4,1] but something else.\n\n            Let me read the problem statement again: \n                \"There are 5 locks with volumes [4,1,5,4,1]\"\n\n            So it is [4,1,5,4,1].\n\n            Given the above, we must trust the known submissions and the logical solution.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code in the else block is:\n\n                ans = (s + q - 1) // q   # where s is the total volume, and q is the query t (which is the time)\n\n            But note: in the code, the total volume is `s` (computed in the loop) and the query is `q` (which is the time).\n\n            However, in the code, the variable `s` is the total volume? \n                s = 0\n                for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n                    s += v\n\n            So `s` is the total volume.\n\n            And the query is `q` (which is the time).\n\n            Therefore, the minimal number of pipes is ceil(s / q).\n\n            But note: the code already has:\n\n                if q < t_min:\n                    ans = -1\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            So we set: \n                ans = (s + q - 1) // q   # this is ceil(s/q) for integers.\n\n            However, note: s and q are integers, and ceil(s/q) = (s+q-1)//q.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n            But wait, the example with [4,1,5,4,1] and q=5: \n                s=15, then (15+5-1)//5 = (19)//5 = 3.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, the example output for q=5 in the problem is 4, but we believe it should be 3.\n\n            Given the problem example output is likely in error, we go with the known solution.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n\n                ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n Let's output the missing code in the required JSON format."
