How: 3 (n) - 1 (r) = 2, then +2 (l) = 4, then -1 = 3? But note: the uneaten part is from index l to r: which is from index2 to index1? That doesn't make sense. Let me reexamine the formula: The candies eaten by Alice: from index0 to index l-1 -> that's l candies. The candies eaten by Bob: from index r+1 to index n-1 -> that's n - r - 1 candies. Total = l + (n - r - 1) In the example: l=2, r=1 -> total = 2 + (3-1-1) = 2+1=3. But note: the candy at index1 (which is 2) was eaten by Alice?",

So we output:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n   However, note: the existing code in the if-block above has two lines at 12 spaces. We are doing the same. But wait: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 200000, and we are using two pointers so it's O(n) per test case. This is acceptable. Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", \n            \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n        }\n\n   However, note: in program1.py, the line we are adding is at the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at 16 spaces? Let me count:\n\n        for _ in range(t):\n            count = 0\n            d = defaultdict(int)\n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                s = input()\n                for c in ak: if c != s[0]:\n                        if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The indentation:\n\n        for _ in range(t): -> 0\n            count = 0 -> 4\n            d = ... -> 4\n            n = ... -> 4\n            for i in range(n): -> 4\n                s = input() -> 8\n                for c in ak: -> 8\n                    if c != s[0]: -> 12\n                        if d[c+s[1]]>0: -> 16\n                            # TODO ... -> 20\n\n   Actually, the TODO is at 20 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the entire TODO line with:\n\n        count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n   at the same indentation level (20 spaces). But the problem does not require us to output the spaces, it requires the code that goes in that line. The existing code in the same block (the second part) has:\n\n        if c != s[1]:\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n   The line `count += ...` is at 16 spaces? Actually, let me see:\n\n        for c in ak: -> 8\n            if c != s[1]: -> 12 if d[s[0]+c] > 0: -> 16\n                    count += d[s[0]+c] -> 20\n\n   So the existing count update is at 20 spaces. Therefore, we output the same: `count += d[c + s[1]]` without any leading space specification? But the problem says to output the code as it would appear. So we output the string \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", and it will be placed at the same indentation as the TODO.",

The algorithm:\n        while l<=r:\n            if a<=b: \n                then we add the next left candy to Alice (n[l]), and move l to the right.\n            elif b<a: \n                then we should add the next right candy to Bob? But the TODO is here. Then, if at any point a==b, we update f to be the total number of candies eaten (which is l + (n - r - 1) = n - r + l - 1, because the total candies is n, and the uneaten ones are from l to r (inclusive) so the eaten ones are l (from left) and n - r - 1 (from right)).",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Count the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) of strings (each of length 2) such that they differ in exactly one position.\n We are guaranteed that the strings are from 'a' to 'k' (so 11 letters).\n\n The provided code uses a defaultdict `d` to count the frequency of each string.\n For each string `s` (which is two characters), we are iterating over the list `ak` of 11 letters.\n   For each letter `c` that is not equal to the first character of `s`:\n        if there exists a string `c + s[1]` in the dictionary (with count > 0), then we want to add the count of that string to `count`.\n   Similarly, for each letter `c` that is not equal to the second character of `s`:\n        if there exists a string `s[0] + c` in the dictionary, then we add the count of that string to `count`.\n\n However, note that the current code has a TODO in the first if-block.\n\n Also note: the current code does not account for the fact that we are about to add the current string `s` to the dictionary (so we are only counting pairs with indices less than the current one).\n\n The idea is that for a string \"ab\", we want to count:\n   - All strings that are \"xb\" (for any x != 'a') that we have seen so far (which would give a difference in the first character).\n   - All strings that are \"ax\" (for any x != 'b') that we have seen so far (which would give a difference in the second character).\n\n But note: the current code in the second part (for the second character) is already implemented.\n\n So we need to complete the first part. We should add the count of the string `c + s[1]` to the total.\n\n However, note that the current code for the first part has an if condition and then a TODO. We should replace the TODO with the same as the second part.\n\n But wait: the second part does:\n        if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n            count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n So for the first part, we should do:\n        if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n However, note that the current code for the first part already has the if condition. So we just need to add the count.\n\n But the current code for the first part has:\n        if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n We can replace the TODO with: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n But note: the code is written in a way that we are iterating over the current string and updating the dictionary after processing the string.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: the same string might be counted multiple times? Actually, we are only counting pairs that differ in exactly one position. And note that if two strings are identical, they don't contribute (because they differ in zero positions). Also, if they differ in two positions, they are not counted.\n\n But note: the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\". So we are safe.\n\n However, let's test with two identical strings: \"ab\" and \"ab\". \n   For the first \"ab\": we haven't seen any string, so nothing is added. Then we add \"ab\": d[\"ab\"] becomes 1.\n   For the second \"ab\": \n        For the first character: for c != 'a', we look for \"cb\", \"db\", ... etc. (none present) and also for the second character: for c != 'b', we look for \"aa\", \"ac\", ... etc. (none present). Then we add the second \"ab\", so d[\"ab\"] becomes 2.\n   Then when we see the next string? But we don't have a third.\n\n So identical strings are not counted. That's correct.\n\n But what about two strings that are different in both positions? They are not counted.\n\n So the algorithm is: for each string, we count all the strings we have seen so far that have the same first character and a different second character? Actually, no: we are counting:\n\n   - For the first character: we are counting any string that has the same second character and a different first character (because we fix the second character and change the first to any other letter, and then count the frequency of that pattern).\n   - For the second character: we are counting any string that has the same first character and a different second character.\n\n This is exactly the pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\n However, note: a pair that differs in the first character and has the same second character is counted. Similarly, a pair that differs in the second character and has the same first character is counted. And these are the only possibilities for exactly one difference.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n But note: the code already has the if condition, so we just need to put that line.\n\n However, the code for the first part currently has:\n\n        if c != s[0]:\n            if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n We can write: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n But note: we are iterating over all letters that are not s[0]. We are adding the frequency of the string `c+s[1]` for each such letter. However, note that the dictionary `d` might have multiple counts for the same pattern? Actually, we are iterating over each distinct letter. But the pattern `c+s[1]` is fixed for a given `c`. So we are adding the count for each distinct `c`? That is not what we want.\n\n We want to add the total count of all strings that have the same second character and a first character that is not s[0] (but any letter). However, the dictionary key is the entire string. So for each `c` (that is not s[0]), we are checking a specific string. But note: the dictionary key is the entire string. So if we have a string \"cb\", then we are counting it when we see the string \"ab\" and when we iterate `c`='c'. But what if there are multiple strings that have the same second character and a first character that is not s[0]? We are iterating over every possible `c` and adding the count for that specific `c`. That is correct: because we are adding the count for every string that is of the form (any letter except s[0]) + s[1]. \n\n However, note: we are iterating over 10 letters (since there are 11 letters and we skip one). So we are doing 10 lookups per string for the first character and 10 for the second. The total number of operations per string is 20, and the total over all test cases is at most 10^5 * 20 = 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n But note: the code for the second part is already implemented similarly.\n\n However, the current code for the second part is:\n\n        if c != s[1]:\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n So we are doing the same.\n\n Therefore, the completion for program1.py is to replace the TODO with: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n Now for program2.py:\n\n The problem: Two players, Alice and Bob, eat from the ends. Alice from the left, Bob from the right. They want to have the same total weight and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code:\n\n   for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        n=[*map(int,n.split())]   # This reads the list of weights for the test case.\n        a,b,l,f=[0]*4; r=len(n)-1\n        while l<=r:\n            if a<=b:\n                a+=n[l]\n                l+=1\n            elif b<a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if a==b:\n                f=len(n)-r+l-1   # This is the total number of candies eaten? Let's see: \n                # The candies eaten by Alice: from index 0 to l-1 -> l candies.\n                # The candies eaten by Bob: from index r+1 to the end -> (len(n) - (r+1)) = len(n)-r-1.\n                # So total = l + (len(n)-r-1) = len(n) - r + l - 1.\n\n        print(f)\n\n The idea: \n   We have two pointers: l (left) and r (right). \n   a = total weight eaten by Alice (from the left)\n   b = total weight eaten by Bob (from the right)\n\n   We start with a=0, b=0, l=0, r=len(n)-1, and f=0 (which might be updated when we find a fair split).\n\n   The algorithm:\n        while l<=r:\n            if a<=b: \n                then we add the next left candy to Alice (n[l]), and move l to the right.\n            elif b<a: \n                then we should add the next right candy to Bob? But the TODO is here.\n\n            Then, if at any point a==b, we update f to be the total number of candies eaten (which is l + (n - r - 1) = n - r + l - 1, because the total candies is n, and the uneaten ones are from l to r (inclusive) so the eaten ones are l (from left) and n - r - 1 (from right)).\n\n   However, the TODO part is when b < a. We should do the symmetric: add the next right candy to Bob.\n\n   So we should do:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   But note: we are in the condition `b < a`. We want to increase Bob's total to try to catch up.\n\n   Also note: we update the total when a==b. We update f to be the current total eaten (l from left and n-r-1 from right). However, note that the condition a==b might occur after we add to Alice or after we add to Bob.\n\n   But note: the condition `a==b` is checked after every addition (because it's inside the loop and after the if-elif).\n\n   However, the problem: the variable `f` is updated every time we have a==b. We want the maximum total number of candies. Since we are traversing from the ends, and we are updating whenever we get an equality, the last equality we get might not be the maximum? Actually, we are traversing the entire array. And we are updating `f` every time we have an equality. The maximum total candies eaten when we have an equality might occur at any point. Since we are going to traverse until l>r, we will record every time we have an equality. And the last recorded equality might be the one with the most candies? \n\n   Why? Because as we move, we are increasing the total number of candies eaten. But note: when we have an equality, we record the total. Then we continue. We might have a later equality that has more candies? \n\n   However, consider: \n        We start with a=0, b=0 -> then we add one to Alice: a becomes the first candy, then if a<=b? (which is false because b=0 and a>0) then we add to Bob: b becomes the last candy. Then we check a==b? If they are equal, we record. Then we continue: we add the next left candy to Alice (if a<=b) or the next right to Bob (if b<a). \n\n   But note: the total number of candies eaten is increasing. However, when we have an equality, we record the current total. Then we continue and might break the equality? But then we might get another equality later? \n\n   However, the problem: we are allowed to choose any contiguous segment from the left for Alice and any contiguous segment from the right for Bob. But note: they cannot overlap. So we are essentially looking for a partition: \n        Alice takes [0, i-1] and Bob takes [j, n-1] such that the sum of [0, i-1] equals the sum of [j, n-1] and we want to maximize i + (n - j).\n\n   The algorithm uses two pointers and greedily adds the smaller side. This is a common technique for such two-pointer problems (like two-sum in a sorted array, but here we are building the two sums from the ends). \n\n   Why is this correct? \n        We are always moving the pointer that has the smaller current sum. This ensures that we are trying to balance the two sums. And we update the answer whenever the two sums are equal.\n\n   But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 200000, so the while loop runs at most n steps per test case.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   However, note: the condition is `elif b < a:`, so we do:\n\n        elif b < a:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n   But note: the variable `f` is initialized to 0. What if there is no non-zero fair partition? Then we output 0. However, the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". So that matches.\n\n   Also, note: the update for `f` is done after the if-elif, so after we add to either Alice or Bob, we check if a==b and update f. Then we continue until l>r.\n\n   However, we must note: the update for `f` is done every time we have an equality. And we want the maximum total candies. Since we are traversing the entire array, and we update `f` whenever we have an equality, the last update (the one with the largest total candies) will be stored? \n\n   But consider: the total candies eaten is l + (n - r - 1). As we move l to the right and r to the left, the total candies eaten increases. However, when we update `f` we are storing the current total. But note: we are moving the pointers until they cross. The total candies eaten at the end is the entire array? But we break when l>r. \n\n   However, the problem: we are allowed to stop at any point. We are not forced to eat the entire array. The algorithm: \n        We start with no candies, then we add one by one. We update `f` every time we have an equality. So we are considering every partition that can be achieved by this greedy addition? \n\n   Why is this optimal? \n        The greedy addition (always adding to the smaller side) ensures that we explore the possibility of having the same sum. And because the array is positive, we can use two pointers.\n\n   Example: [1,2,3,4,5] \n        Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we add left: a=1, l=1 -> then a=1, b=0 -> so we add to Bob: b=5, r=3 -> then a=1, b=5 -> so we add to Alice: a=1+2=3, l=2 -> then a=3, b=5 -> add to Alice: a=3+3=6, l=3 -> then a=6, b=5 -> add to Bob: b=5+4=9, r=2 -> now l=3, r=2 -> break.\n        We had:\n            Initially: a=0, b=0 -> f = 0? (but we didn't update because we didn't add any candy? Actually, we update after adding. The first update: after adding the first candy to Alice: a=1, b=0 -> then we check: 1==0? no. Then we add to Bob: a=1, b=5 -> then check: 1==5? no. Then we add to Alice: a=3, b=5 -> no. Then we add to Alice: a=6, b=5 -> no. Then we add to Bob: a=6, b=9 -> then check: no. Then break. So f remains 0? But we never had a==b.\n\n        However, consider [1,1]: \n            a=0, b=0 -> then a<=b -> add left: a=1, l=1 -> then check: a==b? 1==0 -> no. Then condition: b=0 < a=1 -> so add to Bob: b=1 (the last candy), r=0 -> then check: a==b -> 1==1 -> update f = len(n)-r+l-1 = 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2. Then l=1, r=0 -> l>r? no, l==r -> then condition: a<=b? 1<=1 -> true: then we add n[l] (which is the candy at index 1? but r=0, so the array is [1] at index0? Actually, the array was [1,1]. After the first step: l=1 (so we've taken index0) and then we take the last candy (index1) for Bob. Then we have l=1, r=0 -> then we break? because l>r? Actually, the condition is while l<=r: so we enter. Then a<=b: 1<=1 -> true, so we add n[l] -> but l=1, so we take the candy at index1? but that candy was already taken by Bob? \n\n        This points to an issue: the array is being traversed by two pointers that are moving towards each other. The candies are distinct: we have the entire array from index0 to index n-1. When we take a candy from the left, we move l to the next (so l is the next available left). Similarly, r is the next available right. But when we take the last candy (index1) for Bob, we set r = 0. Then l=1 and r=0: we break? Actually, we break when l>r. So we break. We don't enter the loop again.\n\n        But in the example [1,1] we did update f to 2. Then we break. So that's correct.\n\n        However, in the example [1,2,3,4,5] we never had an equality. But what if we try [1,2,3]? \n            n = [1,2,3]\n            a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add left: a=1, l=1 -> then a=1, b=0 -> so add to Bob: b=3, r=1 -> then check: a=1, b=3 -> not equal. Then a<=b? 1<=3 -> true: add left: a=1+2=3, l=2 -> then check: a=3, b=3 -> equal: update f = 3 (total candies: l=2, r=1 -> total eaten = l (which is 2) + (n - r - 1) = 3-1-1=1 -> total=3? but wait: \n                Alice ate [1,2] -> 2 candies.\n                Bob ate [3] -> 1 candy.\n                total = 3? but the array has 3 candies. Actually, we ate all? \n                The formula: len(n)=3, r=1, l=2 -> f = 3 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 3? \n                How: 3 (n) - 1 (r) = 2, then +2 (l) = 4, then -1 = 3? \n                But note: the uneaten part is from index l to r: which is from index2 to index1? That doesn't make sense. \n\n        Let me reexamine the formula:\n\n            The candies eaten by Alice: from index0 to index l-1 -> that's l candies.\n            The candies eaten by Bob: from index r+1 to index n-1 -> that's n - r - 1 candies.\n\n            Total = l + (n - r - 1)\n\n            In the example: l=2, r=1 -> total = 2 + (3-1-1) = 2+1=3.\n\n            But note: the candy at index1 (which is 2) was eaten by Alice? and the candy at index2 (which is 3) was eaten by Bob? Actually, no: \n                We started: \n                    Step1: Alice takes index0 (1) -> l becomes 1 (so next left is index1).\n                    Step2: Bob takes index2 (3) -> r becomes 1 (so next right is index1).\n                    Step3: Alice takes index1 (2) -> l becomes 2, and then we check: a=1+2=3, b=3 -> equal. Then we update f = 3.\n\n            The candies eaten: \n                Alice: [1,2] -> indices0 and 1 -> 2 candies.\n                Bob: [3] -> index2 -> 1 candy.\n                Total 3.\n\n            And the entire array is eaten? Yes. So the formula is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n   But note: the variable `f` is updated only when a==b. We start with f=0. If we never have a==b, then we output 0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"For the fourth test case, ... the answer is 7\". The fourth test case: \n        Weights: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10] \n        The example says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). Total candies eaten: 3+4=7.\n\n        How does the algorithm handle it?\n            We start: \n                a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add left: a=7, l=1.\n                a=7, b=0 -> b<a -> add to Bob: b=10, r=7 (because the last candy is 10, at index8? but the array is 0-indexed: \n                    index0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:15, index5:1, index6:11, index7:8, index8:10.\n\n                Then: a=7, b=10 -> a<=b -> add left: a=7+3=10, l=2 -> then a==b? 10==10 -> update f: \n                    total = l (which is 2) + (n - r - 1) = 2 + (9 - 7 - 1) = 2 + (1) = 3? \n                    But we have eaten 2 by Alice and 1 by Bob? total=3? but we want 7.\n\n            So we continue: \n                Then we have a=10, b=10 -> then condition: a<=b -> true: so we add next left: a=10+20=30, l=3 -> then a=30, b=10 -> then b<a -> so we add to Bob: b=10+8=18, r=6 -> then a=30, b=18 -> then b<a -> add to Bob: b=18+11=29, r=5 -> then a=30, b=29 -> then b<a -> add to Bob: b=29+1=30, r=4 -> then a=30, b=30 -> update f: \n                    total = l (3) + (n - r - 1) = 3 + (9-4-1)=3+4=7.\n\n            So we update f to 7. Then we break? \n                Now l=3, r=4 -> l<=r -> true.\n                Then condition: a<=b? 30<=30 -> true: then we add n[3] (which is 5) to Alice: a=35, l=4 -> then a=35, b=30 -> then condition: b<a -> add to Bob: but r=4, so we take n[4] (which is 15) -> b=30+15=45, r=3 -> then l=4, r=3 -> break.\n\n            So we output 7.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm works.\n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is: \n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   But note: the code already has the condition `elif b<a:`, so we just need to put the two lines.\n\n   However, the code is written in a compact way. We must be cautious of the indentation.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n   For program1.py: the missing code is: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n   For program2.py: the missing code is: \n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   But note: the problem says to output in JSON format: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n   We must output the exact code that is missing. For program1.py, the missing code is one line. For program2.py, the missing code is two lines.\n\n   However, note that in program1.py, the TODO is in the inner if-block. We are replacing the TODO with one line.\n\n   In program2.py, the TODO is in the elif-block. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n   But the existing code in program2.py has a comment `# TODO: Your code here` and then nothing. We are replacing that with two lines.\n\n   We must be careful: the code for program2.py is:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n   But note: the indentation. The two lines should be indented one level more than the elif.\n\n   Since the existing code uses 4 spaces for indentation, we output:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we output the string exactly as it would appear in the code.\n\n   But note: the existing code in program2.py uses 4 spaces per indent. The elif is already indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside the while loop which is inside the for loop). The TODO line is indented by 12 spaces. We are replacing the TODO line with two lines, each indented by 12 spaces.\n\n   However, the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n            a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n            while l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a+=n[l]\n                    l+=1\n                elif b<a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if a==b:\n                    f=len(n)-r+l-1\n            print(f)\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line with two lines that are at the same indentation level as the TODO line.\n\n   So we write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\",\n        \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n   But wait: in program1.py, the TODO is inside two ifs. The existing code:\n\n        for c in ak:\n            if c != s[0]:\n                if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n   The indentation: we are inside two ifs, so we need to indent appropriately. The existing TODO is at the same level as the inner if. We replace it with a line at the same indentation.\n\n   The current code for program1.py uses 4 spaces per indent. The TODO is at 16 spaces (if we count: 4 for the for, 4 for the first if, 4 for the inner if, then the TODO). We output the same indentation? Actually, we don't need to worry because the problem says \"output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that goes in that spot.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we are to output the code that replaces the TODO. So for program1.py, we output the line: `count += d[c + s[1]]` (without any extra indentation, because the TODO line is already at the correct indentation and we are replacing the entire line).\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output the string that would replace the TODO.\n\n   Therefore, the JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n        }\n\n   But note: in program2.py, the TODO is at an indentation level of 12 (if we count: 4 for the for, 4 for the while, 4 for the elif). We are replacing the TODO with two lines that are at the same indentation level. So each of the two lines should be indented by 12 spaces? However, the existing code in the if-block above has:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n   That is two lines, each indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the if-block is indented by 8 (because inside the while which is inside the for). The elif is at the same level as the if. The TODO is at 12 spaces? Actually, the code we are given for program2.py is:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n            a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n            while l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a+=n[l]\n                    l+=1\n                elif b<a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if a==b:\n                    f=len(n)-r+l-1\n            print(f)\n\n   The if-block for a<=b has two lines: \n        a+=n[l]\n        l+=1\n   These are indented by 4 more spaces than the if (so 8 in total from the left margin? because the while is 4, then the if is 8, then the two lines are 12? Actually, no: the code is written without explicit spaces, but the convention is 4 per indent.\n\n   Actually, the code we are given for program2.py uses 4 spaces per indent. The structure:\n\n        for ...:\n            ... (indent 4)\n            while ...:\n                if ...:   (indent 8)\n                    ...   (indent 12)\n                    ...   (indent 12)\n                elif ...: (indent 8)\n                    ...   (indent 12)   [the TODO is here]\n                ...       (indent 8) [the next if]\n\n   So the TODO is at an indent of 12. We are replacing it with two lines, each at 12.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program2.py: two lines, each starting with 12 spaces? But the problem says to output the code as it would appear. We can write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n   However, note: the existing TODO line is at 12 spaces? But the code we are given in the problem for program2.py has the TODO line with 8 spaces? Actually, let me count:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=[*map(int,n.split())]   # 4 spaces at the beginning of the line? no, this line is at 0? Actually, the entire code is:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n            a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n            while l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a+=n[l]\n                    l+=1\n                elif b<a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if a==b:\n                    f=len(n)-r+l-1\n            print(f)\n\n   The indentation:\n\n        Line1: for ...: -> 0\n        Line2: n=... -> 4\n        Line3: a,b,... -> 4\n        Line4: while ...: -> 4\n        Line5: if ...: -> 8\n        Line6: a+=... -> 12\n        Line7: l+=1 -> 12\n        Line8: elif ...: -> 8\n        Line9: # TODO ... -> 12\n        Line10: if ...: -> 8\n        Line11: f=... -> 12\n        Line12: print(f) -> 4\n\n   So the TODO line is at 12 spaces. Therefore, the two lines we add must be at 12 spaces.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"only the missing code\". So we output:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n   However, note: the existing code in the if-block above has two lines at 12 spaces. We are doing the same.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 200000, and we are using two pointers so it's O(n) per test case. This is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", \n            \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n        }\n\n   However, note: in program1.py, the line we are adding is at the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at 16 spaces? Let me count:\n\n        for _ in range(t):\n            count = 0\n            d = defaultdict(int)\n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                s = input()\n                for c in ak:\n                    if c != s[0]:\n                        if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The indentation:\n\n        for _ in range(t): -> 0\n            count = 0 -> 4\n            d = ... -> 4\n            n = ... -> 4\n            for i in range(n): -> 4\n                s = input() -> 8\n                for c in ak: -> 8\n                    if c != s[0]: -> 12\n                        if d[c+s[1]]>0: -> 16\n                            # TODO ... -> 20\n\n   Actually, the TODO is at 20 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the entire TODO line with:\n\n        count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n   at the same indentation level (20 spaces). But the problem does not require us to output the spaces, it requires the code that goes in that line. The existing code in the same block (the second part) has:\n\n        if c != s[1]:\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n   The line `count += ...` is at 16 spaces? Actually, let me see:\n\n        for c in ak: -> 8\n            if c != s[1]: -> 12\n                if d[s[0]+c] > 0: -> 16\n                    count += d[s[0]+c] -> 20\n\n   So the existing count update is at 20 spaces. Therefore, we output the same: `count += d[c + s[1]]` without any leading space specification? But the problem says to output the code as it would appear. So we output the string \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", and it will be placed at the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact string that replaces the TODO. The TODO is a line that currently is a comment. We are replacing that entire line with the string \"count += d[c + s[1]]\".\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n   But note: the existing code in the second part uses the same variable names and syntax.\n\n   We are done."
