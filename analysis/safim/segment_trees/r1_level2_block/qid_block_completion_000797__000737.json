    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py is:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n\nWe note that the code reads the test cases. The first line is t, then for each test case we have n and then a list of n integers. The code skips the first two lines (because [2::2] starts at index 2 and takes every second line) and then takes the next lines (which are the candy weights) for each test case.\n\nThe algorithm uses two pointers (l from left, r from right) and two sums (a for Alice, b for Bob). The variable f is used to record the maximum total candies eaten when the sums are equal.\n\nThe while loop runs while l <= r. The current code has:\n- If a <= b, then we add the left candy to Alice and move l to the right.\n- Else (if b < a), we need to add a candy to Bob from the right? But the code is missing.\n\nWe also note that whenever a == b, we update f to (len(n) - r + l - 1). Why?\n- The total candies eaten = (number of candies Alice has eaten) + (number of candies Bob has eaten).\n- Alice has eaten from index 0 to l-1 -> that's l candies.\n- Bob has eaten from index r+1 to the end -> that's (len(n) - 1 - r) candies.\n- So total = l + (len(n) - 1 - r) = len(n) - r + l - 1.\n\nBut note: the condition for updating f is only when a==b. We want the maximum total candies over all such equal sums.\n\nHowever, the current code does not update for the case when we add from the right. Also, the condition for the right side is missing.\n\nWe must complete the elif block for when b < a. In that case, we should add the right candy to Bob and move the right pointer to the left.\n\nSo we should do:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nAlso, note that after updating, we might have a==b, so we update f. But the update condition is already checked after every addition (because the if a==b is after the two if-elif blocks).\n\nBut there is a problem: the current code does not have an else for the right side. We are missing the code for the right side.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the condition is \"elif b<a\", so we do that when b is less than a.\n\nAlso, note that the variable f is initialized to 0 (because [0]*4 gives [0,0,0,0] and we assign to a,b,l,f). If there is no moment when a==b, then we print 0, which is correct (like the third test case).\n\nHowever, we must note that the condition for the right side is only when b < a? What if we have a==b? Actually, the first condition is a<=b, which includes a==b. But when a==b, we add from the left? That might be acceptable because we are trying to maximize the total candies. But note: we update f whenever a==b, so we record the state.\n\nBut the problem: we are updating f only when a==b? What if we have multiple equal sums? We want the maximum total candies, so we record every time we have an equal sum? And the last one might not be the maximum? Actually, as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten is increasing? Not exactly: when we add a candy to Alice, l increases and we are including more candies on the left, but Bob might have to give up some on the right? Actually, we are traversing from both ends and we are trying to balance the two sums. The total candies eaten is l + (n - 1 - r). We want to maximize that.\n\nBut note: the algorithm is greedy and we are moving the pointers until they meet. We update f every time we have an equal sum. Since we are moving from the ends, the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-r)) is increasing? Actually, no: because we are adding one candy at a time, and the total candies eaten is increasing by one each time we add a candy? But we are updating f only when the sums are equal. And we want the maximum total candies when the sums are equal. So we can update f every time we have an equal sum and then continue? That is acceptable because we are going to cover the entire array? But note: we are not stopping when we have an equal sum? We continue until the pointers cross.\n\nBut the problem: if we have an equal sum at a point, and then we continue, we might break the equality? But we are updating f at every equality, so we record the maximum total candies? Actually, the total candies at the moment of equality is l + (n-1-r). And as we add more candies, the total candies increases? But wait: when we add a candy to Alice, l increases by one, so the total candies (if we count the current state) is l (for Alice) and (n-1-r) for Bob. But note: we are updating the sums and then checking. So the total candies at the moment of equality is l (because Alice has eaten l candies) and Bob has eaten (n-1 - r) candies? Actually, the total is l + (n-1 - r). And that value is increasing? Actually, as we add more candies, l increases and r decreases? So the total candies eaten (l + (n-1 - r)) is increasing? Then we want the last time we have an equality? But note: we are updating f every time we have an equality, so we are taking the last (and hence the largest) total? Because we are going until the pointers cross, and the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is l + (n-1 - r). When we add a candy to Alice: l becomes l+1, so total becomes (l+1) + (n-1 - r) = (l + (n-1 - r)) + 1 -> increases by 1. Similarly, when we add to Bob: r becomes r-1, then total becomes l + (n-1 - (r-1)) = l + (n - r) = (l + (n-1 - r)) + 1 -> also increases by 1. So the total is increasing. Therefore, the last time we have an equality will be the maximum total. But note: we might have multiple equalities? And we update f every time, so the last one will be the maximum? But what if we have an equality at a total of 4 and then later at 6? Then we update f to 6. So it's okay.\n\nBut the problem: the condition for the right side is missing. We must complete the elif block.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is two lines: \n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code after the if-elif block checks for a==b. So we do that.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the condition for the right side is only when b < a? What if a==b? Then we go to the left. But that is acceptable because we update f when a==b? Then we add a candy to the left? Then a becomes a + n[l] and then we break the equality? But we have already recorded the state when a==b. Then we continue. And if we get a==b again, we update f again (with a larger total). So that is okay.\n\nBut what if we have a==b and we are at the middle? Then we add from the left? Then a becomes bigger? Then we might then add from the right? And then we might get a==b again? So we are covering.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so the two pointers is efficient.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is straightforward: given a rating, output the division.\n\nThe provided code:\n\nx=int(input(\"\"))\nfor i in range (x):\n    c=int(input(\"\"))\n    if c<=1399:\n        print(\" Division 4\")\n    elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n       print(\" Division 2\") \n    else :\n       print(\" Division 1\")\n\nWe see that we need to complete the elif block for the range [1400,1599]. According to the problem, that is Division 3.\n\nSo we should print \" Division 3\"\n\nBut note: the output format is \"Division X\", and the example outputs have a space at the beginning? Actually, the first example prints \" Division 4\", so we must match the format. The problem says: \"output a single line containing the correct division in the format 'Division X'\", but the example output has a space? Actually, the provided code for the first condition prints \" Division 4\", so we must be consistent.\n\nSo for the missing part, we should write:\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the rating can be from -5000 to 5000, and the conditions are:\n  Division 1: >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 to 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 to 1599\n  Division 4: <=1399\n\nThe else condition is for c>=1900? But note: the condition for the else is when none of the above are true. The above conditions are:\n  c<=1399 -> Division 4\n  1400<=c<=1599 -> Division 3\n  1600<=c<=1899 -> Division 2\n  else -> Division 1\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is two lines (with proper indentation). The existing code has:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with two lines (with the same indentation as the if block above). The if block above has two lines (a+=n[l] and l+=1). So we do:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the existing code after the if-elif block has:\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n\nSo the entire block for the elif is:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is one line:\n\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the existing code for the other conditions has a space at the beginning? So we do the same.\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nHowever, the program1.py missing code is two lines, and we must preserve the indentation. The current elif block is at an indentation level of 8 (inside the while loop, which is inside the for loop). The existing if block in the same level has two lines with 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the provided code for the if block is:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo the two lines inside are indented by 12 spaces? We must match that.\n\nBut the problem: the code we are given for program1.py has:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO line is indented by 12 spaces? Then we replace that one line with two lines, each with 12 spaces.\n\nSo the two lines are:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the existing code uses the variable r (which is defined as len(n)-1) and n is the list of candies.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing line is at the same indentation as the other print statements, which is 8 spaces? Actually, the provided code for the first condition is:\n\n    if c<=1399:\n        print(\" Division 4\")\n\nSo the print is indented by 8 spaces. The elif block we are to complete is:\n\n    elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace the TODO with a print statement at 8 spaces? Actually, the existing print statements in the if and elif blocks are at 8 spaces. So we write:\n\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the existing code for the first condition has 8 spaces for the print? Actually, the code is:\n\nx=int(input(\"\"))\nfor i in range (x):\n    c=int(input(\"\"))\n    if c<=1399:\n        print(\" Division 4\")\n    ...\n\nSo the print is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the for loop). The elif block we are completing is at the same level.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is one line: \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"\n\nBut note: we must escape the quotes in the JSON string.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON and then double quotes inside? But the problem says to output the code exactly.\n\nWe'll use double quotes for the JSON keys and values, and then escape the double quotes inside the string.\n\nSo the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 missing code is two lines, so we use a newline character \\n to separate.\n\nAlternatively, we could write the two lines as a single string with an embedded newline.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\nIn program1, we are replacing the entire TODO line with two lines. So the string should have two lines.\n\nSimilarly, in program2, we are replacing the TODO line with one line.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\", \"program2\": \"        print(\\\" Division 3\\\")\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Return json\".\n\nWe write the JSON without extra spaces? Or with? The problem does not specify. We can write without extra spaces to save bytes.\n\nBut the example format is: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe use double quotes for the JSON.\n\nLet me write the JSON string."
