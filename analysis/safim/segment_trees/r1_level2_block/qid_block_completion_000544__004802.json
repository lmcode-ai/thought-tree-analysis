    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe note that the current code has a TODO in the part where we are building the neighbor list for each point.\nSpecifically, in the loop that computes the minimum distance and the neighbors at that minimum distance, we have:\n\n        if dist[i][j] < mindist[i]:\n            mindist[i] = dist[i][j]\n            nbr[i] = [j]\n        elif dist[i][j] == mindist[i]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should append j to the current list of neighbors for i when the distance equals the current minimum.\n\nSo we can replace the TODO with:\n            nbr[i].append(j)\n\nHowever, note that the initial neighbor list is set to an empty list. Also, we skip when i==j.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"For each point, you have to choose a color\". The constraints are about same color and different color.\n\nThe approach in the code is:\n1. Precompute the Manhattan distance between every pair of points.\n2. For each point i, find the minimum distance to any other point and record all the points j (j != i) that achieve that minimum (these are the neighbors).\n3. Then we try to form groups. The group for a point i is set to 0 initially. Then we traverse each point.\n\nThe grouping logic is:\n- If the point i has more than 3 neighbors at the minimum distance, then it cannot be part of a group of size 2,3, or 4? Actually, the code sets grp[i] = 1 (meaning a singleton) and moves on.\n- Otherwise, we check if the neighbors form a clique? Specifically, we check:\n   a. For each neighbor j of i, the number of neighbors of j (at j's minimum distance) should be the same as the number of neighbors of i.\n   b. Also, every neighbor of j (that is at j's minimum distance) must be in the set {i} U nbr[i].\n\nIf the above check fails, then we set grp[i] = 1 (singleton). Otherwise, we set grp[i] to the size of the group (which is len(nbr[i])+1) and also set the same group for all the neighbors.\n\nBut note: the group size is either 2, 3, or 4? Because the neighbors of i are at least 1 and at most 3? Actually, the condition above says if len(nbr[i])>3 then we set to 1. So the group sizes we consider are 2,3,4.\n\nHowever, the grouping might be overcounting: for a group of size k (which is 2,3,4), we set the group index for all the points in the group. But note that the same group might be processed multiple times? The code uses `grp[j] = grp[i]` for each neighbor j. But if we have a group of size 4, then we set the group for 4 points. However, when we later encounter one of the neighbors, we skip because grp[j] is already set.\n\nBut there is a problem: what if the group is not symmetric? The problem requires that the group must be such that every point in the group has the same set of neighbors (at the minimum distance) and that the set is exactly the entire group without the point itself? Actually, the check is:\n\n   We form a set `checknbr` that includes i and all neighbors of i.\n\n   Then for each neighbor j:\n        - The number of neighbors of j (at j's minimum distance) must be the same as that of i.\n        - For each neighbor c of j (at j's minimum distance), we require that c is in the set `checknbr`.\n\n   This ensures that the neighbors of j are all within the set {i} U nbr[i]. Since the group is symmetric, we set the group for all.\n\nBut note: the group must be a clique? Actually, the constraints of the problem require that for same color points, the distances must be equal. And for a group of size k, the points must form a regular simplex? In Manhattan distance, a regular simplex of size k (with all pairwise distances equal) must satisfy that the set of points is such that the graph is complete and every edge has the same weight.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require that the entire group is connected by the minimum distance? Actually, the constraints say: if a, b, c have the same color then d(a,b)=d(a,c)=d(b,c). This forces that in a group of size at least 3, all pairwise distances must be equal. So the group must be a clique with all edges having the same weight.\n\nBut note: the minimum distance for a point i might not be the same as the minimum distance for a point j? Actually, the minimum distance for i is the smallest distance from i to any other point. In a group, for the constraints to hold, the distance between any two points in the group must be the same and must be the minimum for every point in the group? \n\nWhy? Consider two points a and b in the group. Then for a, the distance to b must be the minimum distance for a? Because if there were a point c (even outside the group) such that d(a,c) < d(a,b), then if we consider the triple (a,b,c): \n   - a and b have the same color, and c has a different color? But what if c is in the group? Then we have three same color and then we require d(a,b)=d(a,c)=d(b,c). But if d(a,c) < d(a,b) then that fails. \n   - Alternatively, if c is not in the group, then the constraint says d(a,b) < d(a,c) and d(a,b) < d(b,c). But if d(a,c) < d(a,b) then the constraint fails.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance for a must be d(a,b). So the group must form a clique with all edges equal to the minimum distance for each point.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n   - For each point, we find the minimum distance and the set of points at that distance (the neighbors at min distance).\n   - Then we try to form a group: a group of size k (>=2) must be such that the set of points is exactly the group and for every point in the group, the set of neighbors at the minimum distance is exactly the rest of the group.\n\nSo the code for the grouping is as above.\n\nBut the TODO is only about building the neighbor list. So we fix that.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is to check if a string s is perfectly balanced.\n\nThe current code does:\n   n = int(input())\n   for each test case:\n        s = input()[:-1]\n        a = len(s)\n        b = len(set(s))\n        if b==1 or a==b:\n            print('YES')\n        else:\n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                    w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                    if s == w:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    break\n\nWhat is the idea?\n   - If the string has only one distinct character, then it's balanced -> YES.\n   - If the string has all distinct characters (so a==b), then it's balanced? Actually, the example \"abc\" is balanced. So that's correct.\n\n   Otherwise, we look for the first repeated character? We break at the first i such that s[i] is in s[:i]. Then we form a string w by repeating the prefix s[:i] until we have length a, and then compare s to w.\n\n   Why? The example \"aba\" is balanced. Here, the first repeated character is at index 2: s[2]='a' which is in s[:2]=\"ab\". Then we form w = (s[:2] * a)[:a] = \"abab...\" but we take the first a=3: so \"aba\". Then s==\"aba\" -> YES.\n\n   But what about \"abb\"? \n        s = \"abb\", a=3, b=2.\n        i=0: skip (s[0] not in s[:0] -> empty)\n        i=1: s[1]='b' -> not in s[:1]=\"a\" -> skip.\n        i=2: s[2]='b' -> in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2] * 3)[:3] = \"ababab\"[:3] = \"aba\", but s=\"abb\" != \"aba\", so we go to the else.\n\n   Then what? We have to print \"NO\" for \"abb\".\n\n   So the TODO part: we break out of the loop at the first repeated character. And if the string is not periodic with period i (the prefix of length i) then we do something.\n\n   But note: the example \"abc\" is handled by the first condition (a==b) so we don't enter the else.\n\n   What about \"aab\"? \n        distinct: 2, so not 1 and not 3 (a=3, b=2) -> enter else.\n        i=0: skip.\n        i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> then w = (s[:1]*3)[:3] = \"aaa\", but s=\"aab\" != \"aaa\", so we go to the else.\n\n   Then we should print \"NO\".\n\n   However, is \"aab\" balanced? \n        Consider substring \"aa\": \n            frequency of 'a'=2, frequency of 'b'=0 -> difference=2 -> not balanced -> NO.\n\n   So the code in the else branch should print \"NO\" and break.\n\n   But wait: what if we have multiple repetitions? The problem says: the first repetition we break. But what if the string is \"abac\"? \n        distinct: 3, length=4 -> enter else.\n        i=0: skip.\n        i=1: skip (s[1]='b' not in \"a\")\n        i=2: s[2]='a' in \"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2]*4)[:4] = \"abab\", but s=\"abac\" != \"abab\", so we print \"NO\" and break.\n\n   But is \"abac\" balanced? \n        Consider the substring \"aba\": \n            frequency of 'a':2, 'b':1 -> difference between 'a' and 'b' is 1 -> okay.\n        But also consider the substring \"aba\" for 'a' and 'c': \n            frequency of 'a':2, 'c':0 -> difference=2 -> not balanced.\n\n   So \"abac\" is not balanced -> correct.\n\n   However, what about \"abab\"? \n        distinct: 2, length=4 -> enter else.\n        i=0: skip.\n        i=1: skip (s[1]='b' not in \"a\")\n        i=2: s[2]='a' in \"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2]*4)[:4] = \"abab\", and s==\"abab\" -> so we print \"YES\".\n\n   But is \"abab\" balanced?\n        The distinct characters are 'a' and 'b'. \n        Consider substring \"aba\": \n            a:2, b:1 -> difference=1 -> okay.\n        Consider substring \"ab\": \n            a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        Consider substring \"ba\": same.\n        Consider substring \"bab\": \n            a:1, b:2 -> difference=1 -> okay.\n        Consider substring \"abab\": \n            a:2, b:2 -> okay.\n\n        However, what about the substring \"aa\"? There is no substring \"aa\" in \"abab\". \n        But wait: the substring of length 2 starting at index0: \"ab\", index1: \"ba\", index2: \"ab\". \n        The substring of length 1: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\" -> each has one character.\n\n        So it seems balanced? \n\n        But note: the problem says: for every non-empty substring t and for every two characters u and v that are present in the entire string s (not necessarily in t). \n\n        The condition: the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t is at most 1.\n\n        In the substring \"a\" (which is of length 1): \n            u='a', v='b': \n                frequency of 'a' in \"a\" is 1, frequency of 'b' is 0 -> difference=1 -> okay.\n\n        In the substring \"aba\": \n            u='a', v='b': 2 vs 1 -> difference=1 -> okay.\n\n        So \"abab\" is balanced.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm in program2.py is:\n        - If the distinct count is 1 or the string has all distinct characters, then YES.\n        - Else, we look for the first index i (>=1) such that s[i] is in s[0:i]. Then we form a string w by repeating the prefix s[0:i] until we have the same length as s. If s equals w, then YES, else NO.\n\n   But wait: what if the repetition does not occur at the first occurrence? For example, \"abcda\": \n        distinct: 5? but length=5 -> so a==b -> YES. So we don't get to the else.\n\n   What about \"abcdb\": \n        distinct: 4, length=5 -> else.\n        i=0: skip.\n        i=1: skip (s[1]='b' not in \"a\")\n        i=2: skip (s[2]='c' not in \"ab\")\n        i=3: skip (s[3]='d' not in \"abc\")\n        i=4: s[4]='b' in \"abcd\" -> then w = (s[:4]*5)[:5] = \"abcdabcdabcd...\"[:5] = \"abcda\", but s=\"abcdb\" != \"abcda\", so we print \"NO\".\n\n   But is \"abcdb\" balanced?\n        Consider the substring \"bcdb\": \n            frequency of 'b':2, frequency of 'a':0 -> difference=2 -> not balanced -> NO. Correct.\n\n   However, what if the repetition is not the first one? The code breaks at the first repetition. But note: the condition of the problem requires that for every substring and every two characters. So if there is any repetition, then we must have a periodic pattern? Actually, the known solution for this problem is:\n\n        The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it is of one of the following forms:\n          - All characters are the same.\n          - All characters are distinct.\n          - The string is of the form (a set of distinct characters) repeated periodically, but the set of distinct characters must be exactly two? Actually, the example \"abc\" is distinct -> YES, and \"aba\" is periodic with period \"ab\".\n\n        But note: the example \"abc\" is distinct -> YES, and \"aba\" is periodic with period 2? But what about \"abcab\"? \n            distinct: 3, length=5 -> else.\n            The first repetition: at index 3: s[3]='a' which is in s[:3]=\"abc\". Then we form w = (s[:3]*5)[:5] = \"abcabcabc...\"[:5] = \"abcab\", which equals s -> YES.\n\n        But is \"abcab\" balanced?\n            Consider the substring \"abca\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> the difference between a and b is 1, a and c is 1, b and c is 0 -> okay.\n            Consider the substring \"ca\": \n                a:1, c:1 -> okay.\n            Consider the substring \"bcab\": \n                a:1, b:2, c:1 -> the difference between a and b is 1, a and c is 0, b and c is 1 -> okay.\n\n            However, what about the substring \"a\" and the characters 'a' and 'd'? But note: the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\". So we only consider the characters that appear in the entire string. In \"abcab\", the characters are 'a','b','c'. \n\n            Now consider the substring \"a\": \n                a:1, b:0, c:0 -> the difference between a and b is 1, a and c is 1 -> okay.\n\n            But consider the substring \"abca\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> the difference between a and b is 1, a and c is 1 -> okay.\n\n            However, what about the substring \"bca\": \n                a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n            But wait: what about the substring \"ab\"? \n                a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n\n            So it seems balanced.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is: \n            The string is balanced if:\n                (a) all characters are the same, OR\n                (b) all characters are distinct, OR\n                (c) the string is periodic with period p (the first p characters) and the entire string is the repetition of the first p distinct characters.\n\n        However, note that the period must be exactly the set of distinct characters? Actually, the first p characters must be distinct? Because if they are not distinct, then we would have found a repetition earlier.\n\n        How do we get p? We break at the first repetition. Then p is the index at which the repetition occurs? Actually, we take the prefix s[:i] and then form the string by repeating that prefix. \n\n        But note: the prefix s[:i] must be distinct? Because we break at the first repetition, so in s[:i] there are no repeated characters? Actually, at index i, we have s[i] in s[:i] (which is the first repetition in the entire string). Therefore, the prefix s[:i] is distinct.\n\n        So the condition (c) is: the entire string is the repetition of the distinct prefix of length i.\n\n        But what if the string is \"aabaac\"? \n            distinct: 3? but actually distinct: 'a','b','c' -> 3, length=6 -> else.\n            The first repetition: at index1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> then w = (s[:1]*6)[:6] = \"aaaaaa\", but s=\"aabaac\" != \"aaaaaa\", so we print \"NO\".\n\n        And indeed, the substring \"aa\" (the first two characters) has a:2, b:0 -> difference=2 -> not balanced.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO part in the else branch is: we break out of the loop and then we print \"NO\". But note: we break out of the for loop and then what? The code breaks out of the for loop and then the program moves to the next test case? \n\n        However, the current code structure:\n\n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                    ... \n                    break\n\n            and then after the break, we break out of the for loop and then the program continues? But we have already printed either \"YES\" or \"NO\" for the test case? \n\n        Actually, in the if branch (s==w) we print \"YES\", and in the else branch we must print \"NO\". And then we break out of the for loop. But what if we don't break? The for loop breaks because of the break statement.\n\n        However, what if we never find a repetition? Then the for loop runs to completion and we don't print anything? \n\n        Example: \"abcdef\" -> distinct:6, length=6 -> condition a==b -> YES. So we don't enter the else.\n\n        But what about a string that has repetitions but we didn't break? Actually, the else branch is entered only when the string is not unary and not all distinct. Then we are guaranteed to find a repetition? Because if there are repeated characters, then at the second occurrence of a character we will have s[i] in s[:i]. \n\n        However, what if the repetition is of a character that we haven't seen in the immediate prefix? For example, \"abcda\": \n            distinct:5, length=5 -> then we don't enter the else because a==b? Actually, distinct count is 5 and length is 5 -> so we print YES.\n\n        So the only strings that enter the else branch are those that have at least one repeated character and the length is greater than the distinct count. Then we are guaranteed to find at least one repetition? Yes, because the distinct count is less than the length, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least one character repeats. And we break at the first repetition.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the else branch in the for loop is:\n\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n        But note: we break out of the for loop and then the test case is done.\n\n        However, what if we have multiple test cases? The structure is:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input()[:-1]\n                ... \n                if ...:\n                    ...\n                else:\n                    for i in range(1, a):\n                        if ...:\n                            if ...:\n                                print(\"YES\")\n                            else:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                            break   # breaks the inner for loop\n\n        So after the break, we move to the next test case.\n\n        But what if we don't break in the inner for loop? Then we break out of the inner for loop and then what? We have not printed anything? \n\n        Actually, the condition: we enter the else branch only when the string is not unary and not all distinct. Then we are going to find a repetition? Because the distinct count is less than the length. So we will always break in the inner for loop? \n\n        Therefore, the code is complete if we replace the TODO with:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        and then break.\n\n        However, note: the break is already there? The code has:\n\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    break   # this break is already in the code? \n\n        Actually, the code as given:\n\n                    if s == w:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    break\n\n        So after the if-else, we break. So we break out of the for loop.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to put in the else branch: print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aab\" and we break at the first repetition (at i=1? actually, at i=1: s[1]='a' is in s[:1]=\"a\", so we enter. Then w = (s[:1]*3)[:3] = \"aaa\", and s=\"aab\" != \"aaa\", so we go to the else and we print \"NO\", then break.\n\n        So the TODO is replaced by: print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of all strings is at most 200000. And we break at the first repetition, so the inner loop runs at most min_i (i such that s[i] in s[:i]) which is at most the distinct count? So it's efficient.\n\n        But what if the string has no repetition? Then we don't enter the if condition in the for loop? Then we break out of the for loop without printing? \n\n        Actually, we said that if the string is not unary and not all distinct, then it must have a repetition. So we will always enter the if condition? \n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n\n        But note: the break in the for loop breaks only the inner for loop. And then we move to the next test case.\n\n        However, what if we don't break? The for loop runs until i=a? Then we don't print? \n\n        But we know that the string must have a repetition? So we will break. \n\n        But to be safe, we can add an else clause to the for loop? The problem says the total length is bounded and the sum of |s| is <=200000, but note: the condition says the sum of |s| over test cases is <=200000. So we can do:\n\n            else:\n                # This should not happen because the string has repeated characters? \n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, the problem states: the distinct count is less than the length, so there must be a repetition. Therefore, we don't need the else.\n\n        But the code as provided does not have an else for the for loop. So we assume that we always break.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is simply: \n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        in the else branch.\n\nSummary:\n\nFor program1.py: \n   In the part where we are building the neighbor list, we need to append j to nbr[i] when the distance equals the current minimum.\n\n   Replace the TODO with: nbr[i].append(j)\n\nFor program2.py:\n   In the else branch of the periodic check, we need to print \"NO\".\n\n   Replace the TODO with: print(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", and the value is the missing code as a string? However, the missing code might be multiple lines? \n\nIn program1.py, the missing code is one line: \"nbr[i].append(j)\".\n\nIn program2.py, the missing code is one line: \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\".\n\nBut note: the code in program2.py has an indentation. The TODO is in the else branch, which is inside the for loop and the if condition. So the code we put must be at the same indentation level.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". And we are to output a JSON string.\n\nSo:\n\n   program1: \"            nbr[i].append(j)\"\n\n   But note: the existing code has:\n\n        elif dist[i][j] == mindist[i]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO line with the code. So the missing code is the line: \"            nbr[i].append(j)\".\n\n   However, the leading spaces are important. The current indentation level is 12 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                if dist[i][j] < mindist[i]:\n                    mindist[i] = dist[i][j]\n                    nbr[i] = [j]\n                elif dist[i][j] == mindist[i]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at the same level as the if and elif. So we need 12 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                if dist[i][j] < mindist[i]:\n                    mindist[i] = dist[i][j]\n                    nbr[i] = [j]\n                elif dist[i][j] == mindist[i]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The inner for loop is indented by 4, then the if/elif is indented by 8, and the body of the if/elif is indented by 12.\n\n   So the code we put should be: 12 spaces and then \"nbr[i].append(j)\".\n\n   But the existing code in the if branch has 12 spaces for the two lines:\n\n                    mindist[i] = dist[i][j]\n                    nbr[i] = [j]\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n        if s == w:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at the same level as the print in the if branch. The if branch has 16 spaces? Actually:\n\n        for i in range(1, a):\n            if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                if s == w:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                break\n\n   The for loop: 4 spaces, then the if: 8 spaces, then the w=...: 12 spaces, then the if-else: 12 spaces, and the bodies of the if and else: 16 spaces.\n\n   So the missing code should be: 16 spaces and then \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\".\n\n   But note: the existing print(\"YES\") is at 16 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        program1: \"            nbr[i].append(j)\"\n        program2: \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But note: the existing code in program1.py has a comment at the TODO line. We are replacing that entire line. So we output the line that should be there.\n\n   Alternatively, we could output without the spaces? But the problem says the exact code that should be placed.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In this case, it's one line in each.\n\n   We output as a JSON string.\n\n   Example: \n        {\"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\", \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"}\n\n   But note: the string must be escaped. However, we are writing in JSON, so we use double quotes and escape the inner double quotes and backslashes? Actually, the program2 string has a double quote inside. We can escape with backslash.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON? But the specification says JSON.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        \"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\",\n        \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But wait: in program2, the code is: print(\"NO\") -> we have double quotes. So we escape the inner double quotes.\n\n   Actually, the string we are writing in JSON for program2 is:\n\n        \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But note: the existing code in the if branch is: \n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   So we want: \n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Therefore, we write: \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the print? But the existing code uses double quotes. So we use double.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the quote style. But the existing code uses double quotes.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\",\n            \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the JSON and nothing else.\n\n   We write the JSON as a string.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting a JSON string.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\", \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"}\n\n   But note: the program1 line has a trailing newline? The existing code does not have a newline in the middle of the line. We are replacing one line. So we output the line without a newline? Actually, the line is \"            nbr[i].append(j)\".\n\n   Similarly, program2: one line.\n\n   However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". In this case, it's one line each.\n\n   We output the JSON.\n\n   But note: the program1 code has a comment at the TODO. We are replacing that entire line.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1 is the string \"            nbr[i].append(j)\" and for program2 is the string \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\".\n\n   We output the JSON.\n\n   Important: the entire output must be a valid JSON.\n\n   Let me write:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\", \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"}\n\n   But note: the program2 string has a double quote. We escape it with a backslash.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a raw string? But in JSON, we escape double quotes with \\\".\n\n   So we do: \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, the program1 string does not have any special characters.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"            nbr[i].append(j)\", \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\"}\n\n   But wait: in program1, the existing code after the TODO is:\n\n        # print(mindist, nbr)\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line only.\n\n   And in program2, the existing code after the TODO is:\n\n                break\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line only.\n\n   So the above is correct."
