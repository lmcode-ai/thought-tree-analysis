So the last time we have an equality would be the maximum? But note: we might have an equality at total=10, then we move and break the equality, then we move again and get an equality at total=12? How? Example: [1, 2, 1, 2] Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0 (0 candies eaten) -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1==1, s2=0 -> so we move right? no, because s1>s2? Actually, we have condition: if s1<=s2: then we move left? But we did that. Now we have s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do: if s1>s2: then we move the right? s2 becomes 2 (from the last candy), p2=2. Now total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-2) = 1+1=2. Then we check: s1=1, s2=2 -> then we move left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2. Then we check: s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move right? but p2 is 2, so we move the right: we take the candy at index 2? but we already took the last candy? Actually, we are at p1=2, p2=2: we have one candy in the middle. Then we check: s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move the right? but p2 is 2, so we take the candy at index 2? then s2=2+1=3, p2=1. Now p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2 -> break? But we are in the loop condition: while p1<=p2 -> now 2<=1 is false -> break. We recorded total=0 and then we didn't record the total=2? So we need to record every time we have an equality. Therefore, we should change the condition to:\n\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n\n                But note: we are updating the pointers and then the condition is checked again.",

But the total candies eaten increases by one each time we move a pointer, so we might get an equality again? Example: [1, 1, 1]\n                  Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0 (0 candies eaten). Then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we have s1=1, s2=0 -> then we move right: s2=1, p2=1 -> now p1=1, p2=1 -> we check: s1==1, s2==1 -> record total = 1 (from left: index0) + (n-1 - p2) = 1 + (2-1) = 1+1=2. Then we do: if s1<=s2 -> we move left: s1=1+1=2, p1=2 -> then p1>p2 -> break. Then we output 2. But the expected answer for [1,1,1]? Alice can take the first two: [1,1] -> total=2. Bob can take the last one: [1] -> total=1 -> not equal. Or Alice takes the first one: total=1, Bob takes the last one: total=1 -> total candies=2. So answer=2. So the code works. However, note: the condition in the while loop: we changed to p1<=p2. But the original code had: while (p1-1<=p2). We change that to while p1<=p2.",

Then we do: s1<=s2 -> add l[0]=1 -> s1=1, p1=1 -> then p1=1, p2=1: Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do else: s2 += l[1]=1 -> s2=1, p2=0 -> then p1=1, p2=0 -> break. Then we print max_candies=0? but expected 2. What went wrong? We recorded at the beginning: when s1==s2=0, we set max_candies=0. Then we moved the left: then we moved the right. But we never recorded the state when s1==s2 again? After we moved the left and the right, we have s1=1, s2=1, but we broke the loop because p1>p2? Actually, after moving the left: p1=1, then we moved the right: p2=0 -> then the loop condition: p1<=p2? 1<=0 -> false -> we break. So we don't check the state s1==s2 at the end. How to fix? We can check after the loop? But note: the condition in the loop: we break when p1>p2. But when we have two candies: \n                  Step1: p1=0, p2=1 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then we add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we are still in the loop? because p1=1, p2=1 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we add right: s2=1, p2=0 -> then we break. We never check the state when s1==s2 at the end? We can do: after the loop, if s1==s2, then we set max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)? But note: at the end, p1=1, p2=0 -> total = 1 + (n-1-0) = 1 + (2-1)=1+1=2. And s1==s2? yes, both are 1. But wait: we broke the loop because p1>p2? Actually, the condition is while p1<=p2. So when we have p1=1 and p2=0, we break. Then we don't check inside the loop.",

Then we set max_candies=2. Then after the loop, we set it again to 3? because p1=2, p2=0 -> total = 2 + (3-1-0)=2+2=4? That doesn't make sense. Let me run [1,1,1] again:\n\n                  n=3, l=[1,1,1]\n                  p1=0, p2=2: \n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies = 0 + (3-1-2)=0+0=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1. p1=1, p2=2: \n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=1. p1=1, p2=1: \n                    s1=1, s2=1 -> record max_candies = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we move left: s1=1+1=2, p1=2. Now p1=2, p2=1 -> break? because 2<=1 is false -> break. Then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> not equal -> so we output 2. So we don't do the after-loop check. Now [1,1]:\n                  n=2, l=[1,1]\n                  p1=0, p2=1: \n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n                  p1=1, p2=1: \n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=0. Then break because p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false. Then we check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> true -> then max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2. So that works.

The pattern for even: \n          t = p//2\n          for k in range(t):\n              print((k*3)+2, (p*3 - k*3)) For k=0: \n            swap (0*3+2 = 2) and (2*3 - 0*3 = 6) -> swap index2 and index6.

After the first swap: \n                Original: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:N -> after first swap: 1:B, 2:N, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:A -> then we swap index5 and index3: \n                index3 is currently 'N', index5 is 'A' -> swap: \n                index3 becomes 'A', index5 becomes 'N' -> \n                string: 1:B, 2:N, 3:A, 4:B, 5:N, 6:A -> \n                Now check: \n                  We have two B's: at 1 and 4. For the first B: \n                    then we need an A after it: we have at index3 -> then we need an N after index3: we have at index5 -> so we get \"BAN\" (B at1, A at3, N at5) -> that's bad.

So the loop runs only for k in [0, t-1] -> one iteration.

The last character of that block is at index: (n-2-k)*3+3 = 3*(n-2-k)+3 = 3*(n-1-k) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-1-k) -> but wait, the last character of block i is at index (i+1)*3.

So for block j (0-indexed), the last character (the 'N') is at index 3*(j+1). For the block (n-2-k) (0-indexed), the last character is at 3*(n-2-k+1) = 3*(n-1-k).

Therefore, we can do:\n                left_index = 3*(1+k) + 1   # because the k-th block in the remaining (which is block1+k) has the A at the second character: so index = 3*(1+k) + 1?",

Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the odd case (n>=3) is:\n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(n-k)) However, note: for k in range(t-1): \n            t-1 = (n//2+1) - 1 = (n-1)//2   (since n is odd, n//2 is floor division, so (n-1)//2 = n//2)\n\n          Example: n=3 -> t-1=1, k from 0 to 0: \n            left_index = 3*(1+0)+2 = 5\n            right_index = 3*(3-0)=9\n\n          Example: n=5 -> t=5//2+1=2+1=3, so t-1=2.\n            k=0: swap 3*(1+0)+2=5, 3*(5-0)=15\n            k=1: swap 3*(1+1)+2=3*2+2=8, 3*(5-1)=12\n\n          Then the entire string for n=5: \n            Block0: we swapped (1,2) -> becomes A at1, B at2, N at3. Then we swap:\n              k=0: swap index5 (which is the A in block1) with index15 (the N in block4) -> \n              k=1: swap index8 (the A in block2) with index12 (the N in block3) ->\n\n          Then the string:\n            Block0: A1, B2, N3\n            Block1: B4, N5 (from block4's N), ... but wait, we swapped the A at5 with the N at15 -> so:\n                block1: B4, then at5 we have the N from block4 -> then the N at6 (block1's original N) remains? \n            Block4: ... and at15 we have the A from block1.",

Then for [1,1,1]:\n                  s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0. Then we break the tie by moving the right: s2=1, p2=1 -> then we have s1=0, s2=1 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we have s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1)=2. Then we break the tie by moving the right? but p2 is 1, then we move the right: we take the candy at index1? but that is the middle candy. Then s2=1+1=2, p2=0 -> then we break because p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2? no, p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 is false -> break. Then we output 2. So it works. Therefore, we can write:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2: if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n                  print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: the original code had an if for s1==s2 and then two separate ifs.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses a two-pointer approach. We have two pointers: p1 starting at the beginning (for Alice) and p2 at the end (for Bob). We maintain two sums: s1 (for Alice) and s2 (for Bob). The idea is to try to balance the two sums.\n\n However, note that the condition in the while loop is currently: while (p1-1<=p2): which seems off. We should adjust the condition to while p1 <= p2.\n\n Also, the code currently has a list l2 which is not used. The note in the code says: if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n We are supposed to record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) when s1 equals s2. But note that the problem asks for the maximum total number of candies.\n\n The plan:\n   We traverse with two pointers. When s1 == s2, we record the current total candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) and then we can try to extend by moving the pointers? But note: the problem says we want the maximum total candies.\n\n However, note that the problem says: they eat in a row from the left and right. But the catch is that they can choose any contiguous segment from the left and any contiguous segment from the right (without overlapping). The two-pointer approach is standard for this problem.\n\n Steps:\n   We start with s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=n-1.\n   We will have a variable to record the maximum total candies when s1==s2.\n\n   We do:\n        if s1 == s2:\n            total_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten [0, p1-1] (so p1 candies) and Bob has eaten [p2+1, n-1] (so n-1-p2 candies). So total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            we record this total_candies (and we want the maximum over the entire run). But note: we can continue? Actually, we can continue because we might get a larger total later? However, the problem is that we are going to move the pointers. But note: we are moving the pointers until they cross.\n\n        Then, if s1 < s2, we add l[p1] to s1 and move p1 forward.\n        Else if s2 < s1, we add l[p2] to s2 and move p2 backward.\n\n   However, note: we might have multiple times when s1==s2. We want the maximum total_candies.\n\n   But the current code prints l2[-1]. We are not using l2. So we should change the code to record the maximum total_candies.\n\n   Proposed change:\n        Instead of l2, we can have a variable max_candies = 0.\n        Then, when s1==s2, we set max_candies = max(max_candies, p1 + (n-1-p2))? But note: at the moment s1==s2, the candies eaten are p1 (from the left) and n-1-p2 (from the right). So total = p1 + (n-1-p2).\n\n        However, note: we are about to move the pointers? Actually, we are in the loop and we check conditions. We record and then we have to move one of the pointers? But the problem: if we don't move, we get stuck. So we break the tie by moving the left pointer? Actually, the problem doesn't require that we stop when they are equal. We can continue to see if we can get a larger total.\n\n        But note: we are going to continue until the pointers cross. And we record every time we have equality.\n\n        However, the condition in the while loop: while p1-1<=p2 is incorrect. We should change it to while p1<=p2.\n\n        Also, we must be cautious: when we add a candy, we move the pointer. So when s1==s2, we can either move the left or the right? But the problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. However, the two-pointer method in this way is standard.\n\n        Actually, we can do: when s1==s2, we record the total and then we can try to extend by taking the next candy from the left? But note: we are going to do that in the next step? Because after we record, we then check: if s1 < s2? But at this moment s1==s2, so we skip that. Then we check if s2 < s1? which is false. Then we come back to the top of the loop. But then we are stuck because we didn't move any pointer.\n\n        So we must move a pointer when s1==s2? Actually, we can move either. But note: if we don't move, we get an infinite loop. So we can move the left pointer? But then we break the equality. Alternatively, we can break the tie by moving the left pointer? But the problem: we are allowed to have non-overlapping and we are free to choose. However, the two-pointer method in such problems (like two-sum) when equal, we can move either. But here we want to maximize the total candies. We can try to move the left pointer? But then we might get a larger total? Actually, we are going to continue until we cover all candies.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test.\n\n        How about: when s1==s2, we record the current total, and then we move the left pointer? (so we break the tie arbitrarily). But note: we might miss a better solution? Actually, we are going to continue and we might get another equality later? And we record the maximum total.\n\n        But note: the total candies we have recorded at an equality is the number of candies eaten so far. And we are going to continue until we cover the entire array. So we can do:\n\n            max_candies = 0\n            while p1 <= p2:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies (indices 0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten n-1-p2 candies (indices p2+1 to n-1)\n                    # Then we move the left pointer? But note: we can also move the right? Actually, we can move either. Let's move the left? But then we break the tie and continue.\n                    # However, we are going to move the left and then the next step we might have s1>s2? and then we move the right? But we want to cover all possibilities.\n\n                if s1 <= s2:   # if we do this, then when equal we move left? But note: we want to record the maximum. But if we move the left, we break the equality and then we might not get the same total again? Actually, we are going to record the total at the moment of equality.\n\n                But wait: the problem is that we are going to record the total at the moment of equality, and then we move the left. Then we continue. But note: we might get a larger total later? Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing? Not exactly: when we move the left, we add one candy for Alice, but then we might have to move the right to balance? and then we get a new total that might be larger? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 (left) + (n-1-p2) (right). As we move pointers, p1 increases and p2 decreases, so the total (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? Actually, it is increasing by 1 each time we move a pointer? But we move one pointer per iteration. However, we are not necessarily moving both. But note: we are moving one pointer per iteration. So the total number of candies eaten is increasing by one per iteration? Actually, no: when we move the left, the left part increases by one, but the right part remains the same? So total increases by one. Similarly, when we move the right, the right part increases by one and the left remains? So total increases by one.\n\n                Therefore, the last time we have an equality would be the maximum total? But that is not true: because we might have an equality at a later time with a larger total? Actually, the total is increasing as we move the pointers. So the last time we have an equality would be the maximum? But note: we might have an equality at total=10, then we move and break the equality, then we move again and get an equality at total=12? How? \n\n                Example: \n                  [1, 2, 1, 2]\n                  Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0 (0 candies eaten) -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1==1, s2=0 -> so we move right? no, because s1>s2? Actually, we have condition: if s1<=s2: then we move left? But we did that. Now we have s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do: if s1>s2: then we move the right? s2 becomes 2 (from the last candy), p2=2. Now total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-2) = 1+1=2. Then we check: s1=1, s2=2 -> then we move left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2. Then we check: s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move right? but p2 is 2, so we move the right: we take the candy at index 2? but we already took the last candy? Actually, we are at p1=2, p2=2: we have one candy in the middle. Then we check: s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move the right? but p2 is 2, so we take the candy at index 2? then s2=2+1=3, p2=1. Now p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2 -> break? But we are in the loop condition: while p1<=p2 -> now 2<=1 is false -> break.\n\n                We recorded total=0 and then we didn't record the total=2? So we need to record every time we have an equality.\n\n                Therefore, we should change the condition to:\n\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n\n                But note: we are updating the pointers and then the condition is checked again. And we record every time we have an equality.\n\n                However, what if we have an equality and then we move the left and then immediately we get an equality again? That would be the same total? Actually, the total increases by one when we move the left: so the next time we have an equality, the total would be one more? But that is not necessarily the case because we might have to move the right to balance.\n\n                But note: the total candies eaten is p1 + (n-1-p2). When we move the left: p1 increases by 1 -> total increases by 1. When we move the right: p2 decreases by 1 -> then (n-1-p2) increases by 1 -> total increases by 1. So each step the total increases by 1. Therefore, the last time we have an equality is the maximum total.\n\n                However, we want the maximum total over the entire run. So we can record every time we have an equality and then take the last one? But note: it is possible that we have an equality at total=10 and then at total=12, and 12>10. So we want the maximum total. But since the total is increasing, the last equality we get is the maximum.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because we are going to update the pointers and then the total will be more? Actually, at the moment of equality, the total is p1 (left) + (n-1-p2) (right). Then we update: we move the left (if we do the condition below) and then the total becomes (p1+1) + (n-1-p2) = total+1, but that is not an equality anymore.\n\n                  So we record the current total at the moment of equality.\n\n                Then after the loop, we print max_candies? But what if we never had an equality? Then max_candies remains 0? That is acceptable because the problem says if they can't be fair, the answer is 0.\n\n                However, note: the problem says for the third test case: there is no way so the answer is 0.\n\n                But wait: what if we have an equality at the last step? For example, when p1==p2 and we haven't taken the middle candy. Then we check: if s1==s2 -> record. Then we break the tie by moving the left? Then we break the condition? Actually, we break the condition when p1>p2.\n\n                But note: we are updating the pointers and then the condition is checked at the next iteration. So when we are at the last candy (p1==p2) and we have s1==s2, we record. Then we move the left: p1 becomes p1+1, and then we break the loop because p1>p2. Then we output the recorded max_candies which is the last one.\n\n                However, what if we have an equality and then we move the left and then the next step we have s1>s2? Then we move the right? But the right pointer is already at p2, and we move it to p2-1? Then we break the condition? Actually, we break when p1>p2.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n\n                  print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: what if we have an equality at the last step? Then we record that total. Then we do: if s1<=s2 -> we add the middle candy to s1? Then p1 becomes p1+1 -> then we break. But we recorded the total before adding the middle candy. That total is the one we want? Actually, we are not allowed to split a candy. So we cannot take the middle candy by both. Therefore, we leave the middle candy. So the total we recorded at the last equality is the answer.\n\n                However, what if we have an equality and then we move the left and then we get an equality again? That is not possible because we moved the left and then s1 becomes s1 + l[p1] and then we break the equality. Then we move the right? and then we might get an equality? But the total candies eaten increases by one each time we move a pointer, so we might get an equality again? \n\n                Example: [1, 1, 1]\n                  Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0 (0 candies eaten). Then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we have s1=1, s2=0 -> then we move right: s2=1, p2=1 -> now p1=1, p2=1 -> we check: s1==1, s2==1 -> record total = 1 (from left: index0) + (n-1 - p2) = 1 + (2-1) = 1+1=2. Then we do: if s1<=s2 -> we move left: s1=1+1=2, p1=2 -> then p1>p2 -> break. Then we output 2.\n\n                But the expected answer for [1,1,1]? \n                  Alice can take the first two: [1,1] -> total=2.\n                  Bob can take the last one: [1] -> total=1 -> not equal.\n                  Or Alice takes the first one: total=1, Bob takes the last one: total=1 -> total candies=2. So answer=2.\n\n                So the code works.\n\n                However, note: the condition in the while loop: we changed to p1<=p2.\n\n                But the original code had: while (p1-1<=p2). We change that to while p1<=p2.\n\n                Also, we remove the l2 and use max_candies.\n\n                Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                  We change the while condition to: while p1 <= p2:\n                  We remove l2 and instead use a variable max_candies that we update when s1==s2.\n                  Then we print max_candies.\n\n                But note: the original code had an if condition for s1==s2 and then two separate ifs for s1<s2 and s2<s1. We can change to:\n\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                  if s1 <= s2:   # this covers s1==s2 and s1<s2\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n\n                However, note: when s1==s2, we do the first branch: we add the left candy. But we could also do the right? But the problem: we are free to choose? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of eating. But the two-pointer method is symmetric. We can choose to break the tie arbitrarily. The above code breaks the tie by moving the left.\n\n                But note: the example [1,1,1] worked.\n\n                However, what if we break the tie by moving the right? Then for [1,1,1]:\n                  s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0.\n                  Then we break the tie by moving the right: s2=1, p2=1 -> then we have s1=0, s2=1 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we have s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1)=2. Then we break the tie by moving the right? but p2 is 1, then we move the right: we take the candy at index1? but that is the middle candy. Then s2=1+1=2, p2=0 -> then we break because p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2? no, p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 is false -> break. Then we output 2.\n\n                So it works.\n\n                Therefore, we can write:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n                  print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: the original code had an if for s1==s2 and then two separate ifs. We are changing the logic. The original code had:\n\n                  if s1 == s2: \n                      # TODO\n                  if s1 < s2: ... \n                  if s2 < s1: ...\n\n                This might cause both conditions to be executed? Actually, if s1==s2, then we do the first if, then the next two ifs are false. Then we go to the next iteration? But then we are stuck because we didn't move any pointer.\n\n                So the original code would get stuck in an infinite loop when s1==s2? Therefore, we must change the logic.\n\n                We are going to restructure the code.\n\n                Since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test.\n\n                We'll do:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n\n                This is the standard solution for \"Two Sum\" in a sorted array? but here we are accumulating from both ends.\n\n                Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is to replace the while condition and the if block and the printing.\n\n                Specifically, we replace:\n\n                  l2=[]   -> we don't need l2, so we remove that line.\n                  We initialize max_candies = 0.\n\n                And then the while loop condition becomes: while p1 <= p2:\n\n                And then the if block:\n\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n                  if s1 <= s2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n\n                Then print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: the original code had the two separate ifs for s1<s2 and s2<s1. We are replacing that with an if-else.\n\n                However, the original code had:\n\n                  if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                  if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n                This might cause both to be executed? For example, if s1 < s2, then we add to s1 and then if after that s2 < s1, we also add to s2? That would be two moves in one iteration? That is not intended.\n\n                Actually, the problem: we are only allowed to move one candy per step? But the problem doesn't specify the steps, but the two-pointer method typically moves one pointer per iteration.\n\n                The original code might do two moves? That would be incorrect.\n\n                Therefore, we must change the original code to use if-else.\n\n                So the entire program1.py becomes:\n\n                  I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                  for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                      n = I()[0]\n                      l = I()\n                      s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                      p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                      max_candies = 0\n                      while p1 <= p2:\n                          if s1 == s2:\n                              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies, Bob has eaten n-1-p2 candies\n                          if s1 <= s2:\n                              s1 += l[p1]\n                              p1 += 1\n                          else:\n                              s2 += l[p2]\n                              p2 -= 1\n                      print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: the example in the problem: \n                  Test case 1: n=2, l=[1,1] -> \n                    p1=0, p2=1, s1=0, s2=0 -> record: max_candies = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? \n                    Then we do: s1<=s2 -> add l[0]=1 -> s1=1, p1=1 -> then p1=1, p2=1: \n                    Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do else: s2 += l[1]=1 -> s2=1, p2=0 -> then p1=1, p2=0 -> break.\n                    Then we print max_candies=0? but expected 2.\n\n                What went wrong? \n                  We recorded at the beginning: when s1==s2=0, we set max_candies=0. Then we moved the left: then we moved the right. But we never recorded the state when s1==s2 again? \n\n                After we moved the left and the right, we have s1=1, s2=1, but we broke the loop because p1>p2? Actually, after moving the left: p1=1, then we moved the right: p2=0 -> then the loop condition: p1<=p2? 1<=0 -> false -> we break. So we don't check the state s1==s2 at the end.\n\n                How to fix? We can check after the loop? But note: the condition in the loop: we break when p1>p2. But when we have two candies: \n                  Step1: p1=0, p2=1 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then we add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we are still in the loop? because p1=1, p2=1 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we add right: s2=1, p2=0 -> then we break. We never check the state when s1==s2 at the end? \n\n                We can do: after the loop, if s1==s2, then we set max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)? But note: at the end, p1=1, p2=0 -> total = 1 + (n-1-0) = 1 + (2-1)=1+1=2. And s1==s2? yes, both are 1.\n\n                But wait: we broke the loop because p1>p2? Actually, the condition is while p1<=p2. So when we have p1=1 and p2=0, we break. Then we don't check inside the loop.\n\n                How about we move the check to the beginning? But then we miss the initial state.\n\n                Alternatively, we can check at the beginning of the loop and then update the pointers? But we break the condition.\n\n                Another idea: we can do the check at the beginning and then update, and then after the loop, we check again? \n\n                But note: after the loop, the pointers have crossed. The total candies eaten is p1 (left) and n-1-p2 (right). And we have s1 and s2. If s1==s2, then we can update max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2). But note: we might have updated it in the loop already? But the last update in the loop was when the pointers were at a state that we recorded. However, we might have an equality at the end that we didn't record.\n\n                How about we do:\n\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n\n                  if s1 == s2:   # after the loop, we check again? but note: the pointers have crossed, but the sums might be equal? \n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n                But wait: after the loop, the pointers have crossed. The total candies eaten is p1 (left) and n-1-p2 (right). But note: we have taken all candies? Actually, we have taken the entire array? Then the total is n. And if s1==s2, then we set max_candies = n? \n\n                But in the example [1,1,1] we had an equality at the end? Actually, we had an equality at the last step inside the loop? \n\n                In the example [1,1]: \n                  After the loop: s1=1, s2=1 -> then we set max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2.\n\n                So that works.\n\n                But what if we have an array that doesn't end with an equality? Then we don't update? Then we output the last recorded max_candies.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n                  if s1 == s2 and p1 <= p2:   # but after the loop, p1>p2, so we don't need the condition? \n                  Actually, after the loop, p1>p2, but we still can have s1==s2? \n\n                We remove the condition on pointers? because we are after the loop.\n\n                So:\n\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n                But note: in the example [1,1] we do that.\n\n                However, what if we have [1,2,3,4]? \n                  We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1=1, s2=0 -> then we move right: s2=4, p2=2 -> then s1=1, s2=4 -> then we move left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then s1=3, s2=4 -> then we move left: s1=3+3=6, p1=3 -> then p1=3, p2=2 -> break. Then we check: s1=6, s2=4 -> not equal. Then we output the last recorded max_candies=0? But the expected answer? \n                  We can have Alice take [1,2] (3) and Bob take [4] (4) -> not equal.\n                  Or Alice take [1] (1) and Bob take [4] (4) -> not equal.\n                  Or Alice take [1,2,3] (6) and Bob take nothing -> not equal.\n                  Or Bob take [4,3] (7) and Alice take nothing -> not equal.\n                  Or Alice take [1,3] (4) and Bob take [4] (4) -> total candies=3. \n                  How? Alice takes index0 and index2? but she must take contiguous from the left? The problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (in a row). So contiguous. So she cannot skip index1. Therefore, the answer is 0? \n\n                But the problem says: for the third test case (which is [1,2]) the answer is 0. So [1,2,3,4] should be 0? \n\n                Therefore, the code for [1,1] gives 2, and for [1,2,3,4] gives 0.\n\n                So we do:\n\n                  I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                  for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                      n = I()[0]\n                      l = I()\n                      s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                      p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                      max_candies = 0\n                      while p1 <= p2:\n                          if s1 == s2:\n                              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                          if s1 <= s2:\n                              s1 += l[p1]\n                              p1 += 1\n                          else:\n                              s2 += l[p2]\n                              p2 -= 1\n                      if s1 == s2:   # after the loop, we check again\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: in the example [1,1,1] we had an equality at the last step inside the loop? Then we set max_candies=2. Then after the loop, we set it again to 3? because p1=2, p2=0 -> total = 2 + (3-1-0)=2+2=4? That doesn't make sense.\n\n                Let me run [1,1,1] again:\n\n                  n=3, l=[1,1,1]\n                  p1=0, p2=2: \n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies = 0 + (3-1-2)=0+0=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n                  p1=1, p2=2: \n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=1.\n                  p1=1, p2=1: \n                    s1=1, s2=1 -> record max_candies = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we move left: s1=1+1=2, p1=2.\n                  Now p1=2, p2=1 -> break? because 2<=1 is false -> break.\n                  Then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> not equal -> so we output 2.\n\n                So we don't do the after-loop check.\n\n                Now [1,1]:\n                  n=2, l=[1,1]\n                  p1=0, p2=1: \n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n                  p1=1, p2=1: \n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=0.\n                  Then break because p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false.\n                  Then we check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> true -> then max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2.\n\n                So that works.\n\n                Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n                  I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                  for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                      n = I()[0]\n                      l = I()\n                      s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                      p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                      max_candies = 0\n                      while p1 <= p2:\n                          if s1 == s2:\n                              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record\n                          if s1 <= s2:\n                              s1 += l[p1]\n                              p1 += 1\n                          else:\n                              s2 += l[p2]\n                              p2 -= 1\n                      if s1 == s2 and p1 <= p2+1:   # the condition p1<=p2+1 is always true? because we broke when p1>p2, so p1>=p2+1? then p1<=p2+1 is always true? \n                          # Actually, we don't need the pointer condition because we are after the loop.\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      print(max_candies)\n\n                But wait: the after-loop check: we set max_candies unconditionally? But we might have a larger value recorded in the loop? Actually, the total in the after-loop check is p1 + (n-1-p2). Since we moved the pointers until they cross, the total is p1 (left) + (n-1-p2) (right) = p1 + (n-1-p2). And note that p1 and p2 are such that p1>p2. But the total is the entire array? Actually, we have taken all candies? Then the total is n. But we only want to record if s1==s2.\n\n                And note: the total in the after-loop check is the entire array? But we might have recorded a value in the loop that is less than n? But if we have an equality at the end, then we want to record the entire array? \n\n                However, the problem: the entire array might be taken and the sums equal? Then we set max_candies = n? \n\n                But note: the total candies eaten is n. And we are allowed to take the entire array? But the problem says: if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. And they are taking from the left and right. But if they take the entire array, then they must have taken contiguous segments that cover the entire array? But Alice takes from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot take overlapping. So if they take the entire array, then Alice takes [0, p1-1] and Bob takes [p2+1, n-1]. But if they take the entire array, then the middle part is not taken? Actually, we have taken all: the left part by Alice and the right part by Bob. But what about the middle? The problem: they are taking contiguous segments from the left and right. But if Alice takes the entire left part and Bob takes the entire right part, then the entire array is taken? \n\n                However, the condition: the segments must be contiguous and non-overlapping. And they meet in the middle? \n\n                Therefore, the after-loop check is necessary.\n\n                But note: we might have recorded an equality in the loop that is the same as the after-loop? For example, in [1,1] we recorded 0 in the loop and then 2 after the loop. So we overwrite the 0 with 2.\n\n                That is what we want.\n\n                Therefore, the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n                However, note: the after-loop check: we set max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) only if s1==s2. And we do that even if we never recorded in the loop? \n\n                So we are good.\n\n                But note: the after-loop check: we do not have the condition on pointers? We can remove the pointer condition.\n\n                So:\n\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n                And then print(max_candies)\n\n                Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire restructured code? But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines or blocks. The original code had:\n\n                  l2=[]\n                  s1,s2=0,0\n                  p1,p2=0,n-1\n                  while (p1-1<=p2):\n                      if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                      if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                      if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n                  print(l2[-1])\n\n                We are replacing that block.\n\n                We'll write:\n\n                  s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                  p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                  max_candies = 0\n                  while p1 <= p2:\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      if s1 <= s2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                  print(max_candies)\n\n                But note: the original code had l2=[] and then printed l2[-1]. We are removing l2.\n\n                So the entire program1.py becomes:\n\n                  I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                  for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                      n = I()[0]\n                      l = I()\n                      # We remove l2=[] and the following lines\n                      s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                      p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                      max_candies = 0\n                      while p1 <= p2:\n                          if s1 == s2:\n                              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                          if s1 <= s2:\n                              s1 += l[p1]\n                              p1 += 1\n                          else:\n                              s2 += l[p2]\n                              p2 -= 1\n                      if s1 == s2:\n                          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      print(max_candies)\n\n                We are done with program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: We are given an integer n. We form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We can swap any two characters any number of times. We want to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence. We have to output the minimum number of operations and the operations.\n\n The provided code:\n\n   w=int(input())\n   for i in range(w):\n        p=int(input())\n        if p%2==0:\n            t=p//2\n            print(t)\n            for k in range(t):\n                print((k*3)+2,((p*3)-(k*3)))\n        else:\n            if p==1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1,2)\n            else:\n                t=p//2+1\n                print(t)\n                print(1,2)\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n The note says: \n   For p=1: we swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\".\n   For p=2: we swap index2 and index6 -> \"BANBAN\" becomes \"BNNBAA\".\n\n How did they get the indices?\n   For p=2: \n        s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> indices: \n          1: 'B'\n          2: 'A'\n          3: 'N'\n          4: 'B'\n          5: 'A'\n          6: 'N'\n\n        They swap index2 and index6: \n          index2 (which is 'A') and index6 (which is 'N') -> becomes:\n          index2: 'N', index6: 'A'\n          So the string becomes: B N N B A A -> \"BNNBA A\" (without space) -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        Why is that good? \n          We need to check that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence.\n          How to form \"BAN\": \n            We need a 'B', then an 'A' after that, then an 'N' after that.\n          In \"BNNBAA\": \n            The first character is 'B'. Then we have 'N' (so skip). Then next 'N' (skip). Then 'B' (we can use this as the next 'B'? but we already have a 'B' at the beginning). Then 'A', then 'A'. \n          Can we form \"BAN\"? \n            Take the first 'B' (index0), then the first 'A' is at index4. Then the next 'N'? there is no 'N' after index4? because the two 'N's are at index1 and 2. So we cannot form \"BAN\" with the first 'B'. \n          What about the 'B' at index3? \n            Then we need an 'A' after index3: we have two at index4 and 5. Then we need an 'N' after that? but there is no 'N' after index4. \n          So it works.\n\n        The pattern for even: \n          t = p//2\n          for k in range(t):\n              print((k*3)+2, (p*3 - k*3))\n\n        For k=0: \n            swap (0*3+2 = 2) and (2*3 - 0*3 = 6) -> swap index2 and index6.\n        For k=1: \n            swap (1*3+2=5) and (2*3 - 1*3 = 3) -> but wait, 2*3=6, 1*3=3 -> 6-3=3 -> so swap index5 and index3? \n            But note: the string is 6 characters: indices 1 to 6. \n            After the first swap: \n                Original: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:N -> after first swap: 1:B, 2:N, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:A -> then we swap index5 and index3: \n                index3 is currently 'N', index5 is 'A' -> swap: \n                index3 becomes 'A', index5 becomes 'N' -> \n                string: 1:B, 2:N, 3:A, 4:B, 5:N, 6:A -> \n                Now check: \n                  We have two B's: at 1 and 4. \n                  For the first B: \n                    then we need an A after it: we have at index3 -> then we need an N after index3: we have at index5 -> so we get \"BAN\" (B at1, A at3, N at5) -> that's bad.\n\n        So why did they say for p=2 we only need one operation? \n\n        The problem says: the minimum number of operations. For p=2, the minimum is 1? because they did one operation and achieved the goal.\n\n        Therefore, the code for even n: \n            t = p//2   -> for p=2, t=1 -> so only one swap.\n\n        So the loop runs only for k in [0, t-1] -> one iteration.\n\n        The pattern: \n            swap (k*3+2) and (p*3 - k*3)\n\n        For k=0: swap index2 and index (3p) -> for p=2: 3*2=6 -> so swap index2 and 6.\n\n        For p=4: \n            t=2\n            k=0: swap 2 and 12\n            k=1: swap 5 and 9\n\n        Why does this work? \n          We are swapping the second character of the k-th \"BAN\" (which is the 'A') with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th \"BAN\" (which is the 'N' of the last block? but note: the last block is at the end).\n\n          Actually, the string for p=4: \n            Block0: B A N\n            Block1: B A N\n            Block2: B A N\n            Block3: B A N\n\n          We swap:\n            k=0: swap the 'A' in block0 (index2) with the last character of the entire string (which is the 'N' in block3, index12) -> \n                becomes: B N ... (then the rest) ... A\n            k=1: swap the 'A' in block1 (index5) with the last character of the block2? but note: the last character of the entire string is already swapped? so we take the next to last? \n\n          Actually, the index for the right part: (p*3 - k*3) = 12 - 0 = 12 for k=0, and 12-3=9 for k=1.\n\n          What is at index9? the last character of block2? because block0:0,1,2; block1:3,4,5; block2:6,7,8; block3:9,10,11 -> wait, but the problem uses 1-indexed.\n\n          In 1-indexed:\n            Block0: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N\n            Block1: 4:B, 5:A, 6:N\n            Block2: 7:B, 8:A, 9:N\n            Block3: 10:B, 11:A, 12:N\n\n          So for k=0: swap index2 (which is the 'A' of block0) and index12 (the 'N' of block3) -> \n            block0: B at1, N at2 (from the swap), then the rest: ... and block3: ... A at12.\n\n          For k=1: swap index5 (the 'A' of block1) and index9 (the 'N' of block2) -> \n            block1: B at4, N at5 (from swap) and block2: ... A at9.\n\n          Then the string becomes:\n            positions: \n              1: B\n              2: N   (from block0, swapped with block3's N)\n              3: N   (block0's original N? but we didn't swap that) -> wait, no: we swapped the A of block0 with the N of block3. So:\n                block0: originally [B, A, N] -> becomes [B, N (from block3), N]? but no: we swapped the A at index2 with the N at index12. So:\n                  index2 becomes the N that was at index12.\n                  index12 becomes the A that was at index2.\n\n            So the entire string:\n              1: B\n              2: N (from block3)\n              3: N (from block0) -> but wait, the block0's N was at index3? and we didn't touch it? \n              4: B\n              5: N (from block2, because we swapped the A at5 with the N at9? but then the N at9 is now at5, and the A at5 is now at9)\n              6: N (from block1) -> no, block1's N was at index6? and we didn't swap it? \n              7: B\n              8: A (block2's A? we didn't swap it? but we swapped the A of block1 at5 with the N of block2 at9? so block2's N at9 is now at5, and block1's A at5 is now at9? so block2's A at8 is still there? \n              9: A (from block1) \n              10: B\n              11: A (block3's A? we didn't swap it? but we swapped the N of block3 at12 with the A of block0 at2, so block3's A at11 is still there? \n              12: A (from block0)\n\n            So the string: B, N, N, B, N, N, B, A, A, B, A, A -> \"BNNBNN BAABAA\" -> without spaces: \"BNNBNNBAABAA\"\n\n          Now check for \"BAN\" as a subsequence:\n            We need a B, then an A after it, then an N after that.\n            The first B at1: then we need an A after it: we have at index8,9,11,12. Then we need an N after that? but after index8, we have A, B, A, A -> no N. \n            The next B at4: then an A after it: at index8,9,11,12 -> then an N after that? no N after index8? \n            The next B at7: then an A at8 -> then we need an N after index8: but we have at index5? no, index5 is before index7. After index8: we have A, B, A, A -> no N.\n            The next B at10: then an A at11 -> then we need an N after index11: but we have only A at12 -> no N.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        Now for odd n: \n          The code says: \n            if p==1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1,2)\n            else:\n                t = p//2+1\n                print(t)\n                print(1,2)\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    # TODO\n\n          For p=3: \n            t = 3//2+1 = 1+1=2 -> so two operations.\n            First operation: swap(1,2) -> which swaps the first and second characters? \n                Original: \"BANBANBAN\" -> \n                Block0: B at1, A at2, N at3 -> swap index1 and 2: becomes A at1, B at2, N at3 -> \"ABN\" for the first block.\n            Then we need one more operation (since t-1=1).\n\n          What should we do for the next operation? \n            We note that the pattern for even was swapping the A in the k-th block (at index = k*3+2) with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block (at index = n*3 - k*3).\n\n          For p=3, we have blocks: \n            Block0: indices 1,2,3 -> we already swapped the first block? \n            Block1: indices 4,5,6\n            Block2: indices 7,8,9\n\n          We want to do one more swap. We can do k=0? but note: k in range(t-1)=range(1) -> k=0.\n\n          Then we would swap: (0*3+2 = 2) and (3*3 - 0*3 = 9) -> swap index2 and index9.\n\n          Currently after the first swap:\n            index1: A (from block0)\n            index2: B (from block0)\n            index3: N (from block0)\n            index4: B\n            index5: A\n            index6: N\n            index7: B\n            index8: A\n            index9: N\n\n          Swap index2 and index9:\n            index2 becomes N (from block2)\n            index9 becomes B (from block0)\n\n          Then the string: \n            index1: A\n            index2: N\n            index3: N  (because we swapped the B at2 with the N at9?

\n                for the A at5: then we have an N at6 -> so we get \"BAN\" (B at4, A at5, N at6) -> that's bad.\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n        What is the intended solution for p=3? \n          The problem note says: it's guaranteed that the objective is achievable in at most 10^5 operations.\n\n          The sample note for p=1: swap(1,2) -> \"ABN\"\n\n          For p=3: \n            We can do:\n              Operation1: swap(2,9) -> swap the A in the first block with the N in the last block -> \n                  becomes: B becomes B, then A swapped with last N: so index2 becomes N, index9 becomes A -> \n                  \"B N N B A N B A A\" -> but wait, the last block becomes B at7, A at8, A at9? \n              Then Operation2: swap(5,?) -> we need to break the middle block? \n\n          Alternatively, the provided code for even n does: \n            for k in range(t):   # t = n//2\n                swap (k*3+2, n*3 - k*3)\n\n          For odd n, we do one extra operation: the first operation is swap(1,2) and then we do the same as even for the remaining? but note: after swapping (1,2), the first block becomes \"ABN\" -> which is safe? then we have the remaining n-1 blocks? which is even? \n\n          But the remaining blocks: from block1 to block2 (for p=3: two blocks) -> so we can do one swap: for k=0 in the remaining? but the remaining blocks start at index4? \n\n          How about we do the same pattern for the remaining? \n            For the remaining two blocks (which is even), we do one swap: \n                swap the A in the first block of the remaining (which is block1: index5) and the last character of the last block of the remaining (which is block2: index9) -> \n                swap index5 and index9.\n\n          Then the string:\n            Block0: A at1, B at2, N at3 -> \"ABN\" -> safe.\n            Block1: B at4, then we swap index5 (which is the A in block1) with index9 (which is the N in block2) -> \n                block1: B at4, N at5 (from block2) -> then the rest: \n                block1: N at6? no, block1's N is at6? we didn't swap that? \n                block2: B at7, A at8, and at9 we have the A from block1.\n\n          So the entire string: \n            index1: A\n            index2: B\n            index3: N\n            index4: B\n            index5: N   (from block2)\n            index6: N   (from block1) -> because we didn't swap the N of block1? \n            index7: B\n            index8: A\n            index9: A   (from block1)\n\n          So: \"ABNBNN BAA\" -> \"ABNBNNBAA\"\n\n          Now check for \"BAN\":\n            We have a B at2: then we need an A after it: we have at index8,9 -> then we need an N after that? but after index8: only A -> no N.\n            Then the next B at4: then we need an A after it: we have at index8,9 -> then we need an N after that? no.\n            Then the next B at7: then we need an A after it: at index8 -> then we need an N after that? no.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, for odd n (>=3):\n            We do:\n              First operation: swap(1,2) -> to fix the first block.\n              Then we treat the remaining n-1 blocks (which is even) by doing the even pattern but starting from the next block.\n\n          How to adjust the indices for the remaining blocks?\n            The remaining blocks: from block1 to block(n-1) -> total n-1 blocks (even). \n            We do k in range( (n-1)//2 ):\n                left_index = (k*3+2) in the remaining part? but the remaining part starts at index = 4 (for the first block of the remaining, which is block1: the first character is at index4 in 1-indexed).\n\n            But note: the pattern for even for the entire string of m blocks: \n                for k in range(m//2):\n                    swap (k*3+2, m*3 - k*3)\n\n            For the remaining part: we have m = n-1 (even). The entire string of the remaining part starts at the original index of block1: which is index = 4? but we want the indices in the entire string.\n\n            The first swap in the remaining part: \n                k=0: \n                  left_index = (0)*3+2 = 2 -> but that is in the entire string? we want the first A in the remaining part: which is at index5 (the second character of block1: 1-indexed index5).\n                  right_index = (n-1)*3 - k*3 = (n-1)*3.\n\n            But note: the entire string has n blocks. The remaining part has n-1 blocks, and the first block of the remaining part is at offset 3 (so we add 3 to the indices of the remaining part?).\n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n              left_index = (1 + k) * 3 - 1   ? \n\n            Alternatively, we can note that the pattern for the entire string for the even part of the remaining blocks: \n                The remaining blocks are from block1 to block(n-1). The total length of the entire string is 3n. The remaining part is from index4 to index3n.\n\n            We can do:\n              left_index = 3 + (k*3+2)   # because the first block (block0) has 3 characters, then the next block starts at index4? \n              But wait: \n                block0: indices 1,2,3 -> then block1: 4,5,6; block2:7,8,9; ... \n              So the A in the k-th block of the remaining (which is block (1+k)) is at: 3 + (k*3+2) = 3*k+5? \n              But for k=0: 3*0+5=5 -> which is the A in block1.\n\n            The right_index: we want the last character of the (n-1-1-k)-th block? but the entire string: the last block is block(n-1) (because we have n blocks, and we skipped block0). But we are swapping the k-th block in the remaining (which is block1+k) with the (n-1-1-k)-th block in the entire string? \n\n            Actually, the pattern for the entire string for even: \n                swap (k*3+2) and (n*3 - k*3)\n\n            For the remaining part, we have n-1 blocks. The entire string has n blocks. We want to do the same pattern as even for the remaining n-1 blocks? but the indices are shifted.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do the same pattern as even but for the entire string, but skipping the first block? \n                For k in range( (n-1)//2 ):\n                    left_index = (1 + k) * 3 + 1? \n\n            Actually, the provided code for even: \n                for k in range(t):   # t = n//2\n                    print( (k*3)+2, (n*3 - k*3) )\n\n            For the remaining part (n-1 blocks), we can do:\n                for k in range( (n-1)//2 ):\n                    left_index = ( (k+1) * 3 ) + 2 - 3?   -> no.\n\n            How about we do the same formula as even but for m = n-1? \n                left_index = (k*3+2) + 3   # because we skip the first block (3 characters) -> then the entire string index for the A in the k-th block of the remaining is 3 + (k*3+2) = 3*k+5.\n                right_index = (n*3) - (k*3) - 3?   -> no, because the entire string has n*3 characters. The last character is at n*3. But we want the last character of the remaining part? the remaining part ends at n*3. And we want the last character of the (n-1-1-k)-th block in the remaining? \n\n            Actually, the pattern for the entire string for even for m blocks: \n                swap (k*3+2) and (m*3 - k*3)\n\n            But we are in the entire string, and the remaining part is the last n-1 blocks. The first character of the remaining part is at index4 (1-indexed). The last character is at index n*3.\n\n            We can do: \n                left_index = 3 + (k*3+2)   = 3*k+5\n                right_index = n*3 - k*3     # because the even pattern for the entire string of n blocks: we used n*3 - k*3. But now we are not including the first block? \n\n            However, in the even pattern for the entire string of n blocks, we swapped the A in the k-th block (at index k*3+2) with the N in the (n-1-k)-th block (at index n*3 - k*3). \n\n            For the remaining part, we want to swap the A in the k-th block of the remaining (which is block (1+k)) with the N in the (n-1-1-k)-th block of the entire string? which is the same as the (n-2-k)-th block in the entire string? \n\n            The index of the N in the (n-1-1-k)-th block: \n                The last block is block(n-1) (0-indexed) -> the block we want is block (n-1-1-k) = block(n-2-k). The last character of that block is at index: (n-2-k)*3+3 = 3*(n-2-k)+3 = 3*(n-1-k) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-1-k) -> but wait, the last character of block i is at index (i+1)*3.\n\n            Actually, block0: indices 1,2,3 -> last char at 3 = 3*1.\n            block1: 4,5,6 -> last char at 6 = 3*2.\n            block i: last char at 3*(i+1).\n\n            So for block j (0-indexed), the last character (the 'N') is at index 3*(j+1).\n\n            For the block (n-2-k) (0-indexed), the last character is at 3*(n-2-k+1) = 3*(n-1-k).\n\n            But note: the entire string has n blocks, so the last character of the entire string is at 3*n.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n                left_index = 3*(1+k) + 1   # because the k-th block in the remaining (which is block1+k) has the A at the second character: so index = 3*(1+k) + 1? \n                Actually, block1+k: \n                    starts at index 3*(1+k) + 1? no, in 1-indexed:\n                    block0: 1,2,3 -> starts at 1 = 3*0+1\n                    block1: 4,5,6 -> starts at 4 = 3*1+1\n                    block j: starts at 3*j+1.\n\n                The A in block j is at 3*j+2.\n\n                So for the k-th block in the remaining (j=1+k), the A is at 3*(1+k)+2.\n\n            And the right_index = 3*(n-1-k)   # the last character of block (n-1-k-1) ? wait, we want the block (n-2-k) in 0-indexed? but we are swapping with the block that is symmetric in the remaining part? \n\n            Actually, the remaining part has blocks from 1 to n-1 (0-indexed blocks: block1 to block(n-1)). We want to swap the k-th block from the start of the remaining with the k-th block from the end of the remaining? \n                The k-th block from the start: block1+k -> the A at 3*(1+k)+2.\n                The k-th block from the end: block(n-1-k) -> the last character (the 'N') at 3*(n-1-k+1) = 3*(n-k) -> but wait, the last character of block j is at 3*(j+1). For block j = n-1-k, the last character is at 3*(n-1-k+1)=3*(n-k).\n\n            Therefore, we swap 3*(1+k)+2 and 3*(n-k).\n\n            For p=3 (n=3) and k=0: \n                left_index = 3*(1+0)+2 = 3+2=5\n                right_index = 3*(3-0)=9\n\n            So we swap index5 and index9.\n\n            That matches what we did.\n\n          Therefore, for the odd case (n>=3):\n            t = n//2+1   # which is (n-1)//2 + 1? for n=3: 3//2=1, then +1=2 -> correct.\n            Then we do:\n                print(1,2)   # the first swap for the first block.\n                for k in range(t-1):   # t-1 = (n-1)//2\n                    left_index = 3*(1+k)+2\n                    right_index = 3*(n-k)\n                    print(left_index, right_index)\n\n          But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the odd case (n>=3) is:\n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(n-k))\n\n          However, note: for k in range(t-1): \n            t-1 = (n//2+1) - 1 = (n-1)//2   (since n is odd, n//2 is floor division, so (n-1)//2 = n//2)\n\n          Example: n=3 -> t-1=1, k from 0 to 0: \n            left_index = 3*(1+0)+2 = 5\n            right_index = 3*(3-0)=9\n\n          Example: n=5 -> t=5//2+1=2+1=3, so t-1=2.\n            k=0: swap 3*(1+0)+2=5, 3*(5-0)=15\n            k=1: swap 3*(1+1)+2=3*2+2=8, 3*(5-1)=12\n\n          Then the entire string for n=5: \n            Block0: we swapped (1,2) -> becomes A at1, B at2, N at3.\n            Then we swap:\n              k=0: swap index5 (which is the A in block1) with index15 (the N in block4) -> \n              k=1: swap index8 (the A in block2) with index12 (the N in block3) ->\n\n          Then the string:\n            Block0: A1, B2, N3\n            Block1: B4, N5 (from block4's N), ... but wait, we swapped the A at5 with the N at15 -> so:\n                block1: B4, then at5 we have the N from block4 -> then the N at6 (block1's original N) remains? \n            Block4: ... and at15 we have the A from block1.\n\n          This should break all the \"BAN\" subsequences.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            w = int(input())\n            for i in range(w):\n                p = int(input())\n                if p % 2 == 0:\n                    t = p//2\n                    print(t)\n                    for k in range(t):\n                        print(k*3+2, p*3 - k*3)\n                else:\n                    if p == 1:\n                        print(1)\n                        print(1,2)\n                    else:\n                        t = p//2+1\n                        print(t)\n                        print(1,2)\n                        for k in range(t-1):\n                            print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          Note: the indices for the odd case: \n            left_index: 3*(1+k)+2 = 3 + 3*k + 2 = 3*k+5\n            right_index: 3*(p-k)   # because n is p\n\n          But wait: in the even case, we did: \n            for k in range(t):\n                print(k*3+2, p*3 - k*3)\n\n          And in the odd case for the remaining, we did: \n            for k in range(t-1):\n                print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, note: the even case: \n            k*3+2 = 3*k+2\n            p*3 - k*3 = 3*(p-k)\n\n          And the odd case for the remaining: \n            3*(1+k)+2 = 3*k+5\n            3*(p-k) = 3*(p-k)\n\n          But 3*k+5 = 3*(k+1)+2? \n            because 3*(k+1)+2 = 3*k+3+2 = 3*k+5.\n\n          And 3*(p-k) is the same as in the even case.\n\n          Therefore, we can see the pattern: \n            In the even case, we swap the A in the k-th block (at 3*k+2) with the N in the (p-1-k)-th block (at 3*(p-k)).\n            In the odd case, we first fix the first block by swapping the first two (1,2) and then we do the even pattern for the remaining p-1 blocks, but we start k from 0 to (p-1)//2 - 1? and the blocks are shifted by one block (so k becomes k+1 in the entire string).\n\n          Alternatively, we can write the odd case as:\n\n            for k in range(t-1):\n                # k in [0, t-2] for the remaining part, but we want to do the even pattern for the entire string for the blocks from 1 to p-1? \n                # and in the even pattern for the entire string, we would do k from 0 to (p-1)//2 - 1? but note: the remaining part has p-1 blocks, which is even, so we do (p-1)//2 swaps.\n\n                # The k in the even pattern for the entire string for the remaining part: we start at block1 (which is the first block of the remaining) and we do k from 0 to (p-1)//2-1? \n                # But we can use the same k.\n\n                # The A in the k-th block of the remaining is at: (1+k)*3+2? \n                # But we can also think: in the entire string, the block index for the k-th block in the remaining is 1+k. Then the A is at 3*(1+k)+2.\n\n                # The N in the symmetric block in the remaining: the last block of the entire string is p-1 (0-indexed). The symmetric block for the k-th block in the remaining is the (p-1-1-k)-th block? but we want the last character of that block? which is at 3*(p-1-1-k+1) = 3*(p-1-k) -> but that is not 3*(p-k).\n\n          Actually, the entire string: the block index for the symmetric block: we want the block at p-1-1-k? \n            The remaining part: block1 to block(p-1) (0-indexed). The symmetric block for the k-th block in the remaining (which is block1+k) is block(p-1-1-k) = block(p-2-k). The last character of that block is at 3*(p-2-k+1)=3*(p-1-k). \n\n          But we are using 3*(p-k) -> which is the last character of block(p-1) (the last block) when k=0? \n            For k=0: 3*(p-0)=3p -> which is the last character of the entire string? that is the last character of block(p-1) (0-indexed last block is block p-1).\n\n          Why are we using 3*(p-k) for the entire string? \n            Because the even pattern for the entire string of p blocks: \n                swap (k*3+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n            But in the odd case, we are not using the entire string? we are using the entire string? the indices are global.\n\n          So the swap for the remaining part: \n            We swap the A in block(1+k) (at 3*(1+k)+2) and the N in block(p-1-k) (at 3*(p-k))? \n            But note: the last character of block j is at 3*(j+1). For block j = p-1-k, the last character is at 3*(p-1-k+1)=3*(p-k).\n\n          Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n          We output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"s1, s2 = 0, 0\\n        p1, p2 = 0, n-1\\n        max_candies = 0\\n        while p1 <= p2:\\n            if s1 == s2:\\n                max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n            if s1 <= s2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                s2 += l[p2]\\n                p2 -= 1\\n        if s1 == s2:\\n            max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n        print(max_candies)\", \"program2\": \"for k in range(t-1):\\n                print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"}\n\n          But note: the program1.py code we are replacing a block. The original program1.py had:\n\n            l2=[]\n            s1,s2=0,0\n            p1,p2=0,n-1\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n            print(l2[-1])\n\n          We are replacing that entire block with:\n\n            s1, s2 = 0, 0\n            p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n            max_candies = 0\n            while p1 <= p2:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n            if s1 == s2:\n                max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            print(max_candies)\n\n          And for program2.py, we are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          But note: the program2.py code for the odd case already has:\n\n                t = p//2+1\n                print(t)\n                print(1,2)\n\n          So we only need to fill the for loop.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          But note: the variable is p, not n.\n\n          We output the code as a string in the json.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          For program1.py, we are replacing a block. The block we are replacing starts from the line \"l2=[]\" to the line \"print(l2[-1])\". But the problem says: the missing lines or blocks. So we output the entire block that we are replacing? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n          We are to output in json: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n          For program1.py, the completion is the entire block of code that we wrote to replace the original block? \n\n          For program2.py, the completion is the for loop.\n\n          Therefore:\n\n            program1: \n                \"s1, s2 = 0, 0\\n        p1, p2 = 0, n-1\\n        max_candies = 0\\n        while p1 <= p2:\\n            if s1 == s2:\\n                max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n            if s1 <= s2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                s2 += l[p2]\\n                p2 -= 1\\n        if s1 == s2:\\n            max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n        print(max_candies)\"\n\n            program2:\n                \"for k in range(t-1):\\n                print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"\n\n          But note: the indentation. In program1.py, the block is inside the for loop. We must preserve the same level of indentation. The original code had 4 spaces per level. The block we are replacing was at the same level as the rest.\n\n          In the provided program1.py, the block after reading l is:\n\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n                print(l2[-1])\n\n          We are replacing that with 8 lines of code (if we write it compactly) but we have to match the indentation.\n\n          We'll write the code with the same indentation as the original. The original had 4 spaces for the outer, and 8 for the inner.\n\n          Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside the else block for the odd case, and inside the for loop we are to fill. The existing code has:\n\n                else:\n                    t = p//2+1\n                    print(t)\n                    print(1,2)\n                    for k in range(t-1):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                        print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          But note: the existing code has the for loop, so we only need the body of the for loop? Actually, the TODO is inside the for loop? \n\n          The original code: \n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with the print statement.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is the print statement.\n\n          But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only missing one line? \n\n          However, note: the TODO is inside the for loop. We are to output the code that goes inside the for loop? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          So for program2.py, we output:\n\n                print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". And we are only to output the missing part.\n\n          However, the example output format is a json with two strings.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            program1: the entire block of code that replaces the original block (from l2=[] to print(l2[-1])), but without the l2=[] and the print(l2[-1])? Actually, we are replacing the entire block.\n\n          But the original block had:\n\n                l2=[]\n                ... \n                print(l2[-1])\n\n          We are replacing that with:\n\n                s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                ... \n                print(max_candies)\n\n          So we output that entire block.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"    s1, s2 = 0, 0\\n    p1, p2 = 0, n-1\\n    max_candies = 0\\n    while p1 <= p2:\\n        if s1 == s2:\\n            max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n        if s1 <= s2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            s2 += l[p2]\\n            p2 -= 1\\n    if s1 == s2:\\n        max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n    print(max_candies)\",\n              \"program2\": \"        print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the indentation. In program1.py, the block is at the same level as the rest of the code in the for loop. The original code had 4 spaces for the outer for loop, and then 8 for the inner. We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\n          Actually, the original program1.py:\n\n            for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                n=I()[0]\n                l=I()\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    ... \n\n          We are replacing from \"l2=[]\" to the end of the block. We write:\n\n                s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                max_candies = 0\n                while p1 <= p2:\n                    ... \n                if s1 == s2:\n                    ... \n                print(max_candies)\n\n          The indentation: each line in the block should be indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 in total). But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, as long as it is valid python.\n\n          We'll use 4 spaces for each level.\n\n          For program2.py, the missing line is inside the for loop, which is inside the else block. The existing code has:\n\n                else:\n                    if p==1:\n                        ...\n                    else:\n                        t = p//2+1\n                        print(t)\n                        print(1,2)\n                        for k in range(t-1):\n                            # TODO\n\n          We replace the TODO with a print statement. The print statement should be indented by 12 spaces (if we count: 4 for the outer for, 4 for the else, 4 for the for loop). But we can write with 4 spaces per level.\n\n          We'll write: \n\n                for k in range(t-1):\n                    print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          But the existing code already has the for loop. We only need the body.\n\n          Therefore, the body is one line: \n\n                print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          And it should be indented by 4 more spaces than the for loop. So we output that line with 8 spaces? \n\n          But the problem: we are to output only the missing code. The missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n          We output: \"        print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"   (with 8 spaces at the beginning) to match the level of the for loop body? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But we must match the existing code.\n\n          Since the existing code in the else block has 8 spaces (for the lines inside the else), and the for loop is at 8 spaces, then the body of the for loop should be 12 spaces? \n\n          But the example: \n\n                else:\n                    t = p//2+1\n                    print(t)\n                    print(1,2)\n                    for k in range(t-1):\n                        # TODO\n\n          The TODO is at 12 spaces. So we replace the TODO with:\n\n                        print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\n\n          So we output: \"            print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"   (with 12 spaces) -> but that is 12 spaces? \n\n          Alternatively, we can output with one level of indentation (4 spaces) and let the existing code absorb it? \n\n          But the problem: we are to output the exact code that is missing.\n\n          We'll output with 8 spaces (one level of indentation relative to the for loop) but the for loop is already at 8 spaces? then the body should be 12. \n\n          However, the problem says: the code is given and we are to fill in. The existing code has the for loop and the comment at the same indentation as the body we are to fill. So we output the same indentation as the comment? \n\n          But the comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n                \"            print(3*(1+k)+2, 3*(p-k))\"\n\n          But to be safe, we can output with 4 spaces per level: \n\n            program1: we output the block with 4 spaces for the outer and 8 for the inner.\n\n          We write:\n\n           "
