However, note: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) might be true for two distinct strings that are actually the same? No, because we skip x==y. But wait: what if we have two different strings that share the same first letter? Then we count the product.",

We'll write:\n\n   Line1: 4 spaces: \"    r = int(n)\"\n   Line2: 4 spaces: \" if r >= 1900:\"\n   Line3: 8 spaces: \"        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\"\n   Line4: 4 spaces: \"    elif ...\"\n\n So the entire body string is:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n But note: in JSON, we must escape the double quotes. So we replace every \" inside the string with \\\". Therefore, the string for program2 becomes:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n\n However, we can also use single quotes in the print?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current code uses a Counter to count the frequency of each string.\n Then it iterates over the keys (strings) in the counter twice (nested loops) and checks:\n   if x != y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])\n However, note that this condition is too broad. We want pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\n But note: if two strings are the same, they are skipped by x!=y. Now, if they share the first letter OR the second letter, that doesn't necessarily mean they differ in exactly one position. They might be the same in one position and different in the other? Actually, if they share the first letter, then the second letter must be different to have exactly one difference? But wait: if they share the first letter and the second letter, then they are the same -> skipped. If they share the first letter and the second letter is different, then they differ in the second position only -> exactly one difference. Similarly, if they share the second letter and the first letter is different, then they differ in the first position only.\n\n However, what if both the first and second letters are different? Then the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is false, so we skip. That is correct because we don't want two differences.\n\n But note: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is true for two cases:\n   Case 1: same first letter, different second letter -> exactly one difference (at second)\n   Case 2: same second letter, different first letter -> exactly one difference (at first)\n\n However, what if the two strings are the same? We skip because of x!=y.\n\n But there's a problem: the condition also includes pairs that are the same in one letter and the same in the other? No, because if they are the same in both, then x==y and we skip. So the condition is correct for exactly one difference.\n\n However, the current code then does:\n   cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n But note: if we have multiple occurrences of the same string, we are counting pairs of distinct strings. The Counter s[x] gives the frequency of string x.\n\n But the problem: we are iterating over distinct strings. However, the same pair (i,j) might be counted twice? Because we iterate over x and then y, and then we do x and y in both orders? Actually, we have:\n   for x in s: for y in s: ... \n   and then we do cnt//2 at the end.\n\n However, consider: if we have three distinct strings: A, B, C. Then we will count:\n   (A,B): once\n   (A,C): once\n   (B,A): not because we skip when x!=y? Actually, we do not skip because A!=B, then we also get (B,A) in the next iteration? But wait: the inner loop runs for every distinct string. So we will get:\n      x=A, y=B: count += s[A]*s[B]\n      x=A, y=C: count += s[A]*s[C]\n      x=B, y=A: count += s[B]*s[A]   -> same as (A,B) again\n      x=B, y=C: ... and so on.\n\n So we are counting each unordered pair twice? That's why we do cnt//2.\n\n But wait: what if we have duplicate strings? The Counter counts the frequency. For two distinct strings A and B, the product s[A]*s[B] is the total number of pairs (i,j) where i is an index of A and j is an index of B. And we are adding that product twice (once for (A,B) and once for (B,A)). Then we divide by 2. So that is correct.\n\n However, the problem: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is not sufficient? Actually, it is sufficient because if two strings have the same first letter, then they must have the second letter different (because x!=y) to be considered? But wait: what if two strings are different and have the same first letter and same second letter? That's impossible because then they would be the same string. So the condition is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the strings are of length 2. So the condition is: \n   either the first letters are the same and the second letters are different, OR the second letters are the same and the first letters are different.\n\n However, there is a catch: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is true for both cases? Actually, if the two strings have the same first letter, then the condition is true regardless of the second letter? But if the second letter is also the same, then the string is the same and we skip because of x!=y. So it's okay.\n\n But wait: what if two strings have the same first letter and same second letter? Then they are the same string -> skipped by x!=y. So the condition is safe.\n\n However, the problem: the condition is also true for two strings that have the same first letter and same second letter? But we skip because x==y. So we are safe.\n\n But note: the condition is also true for two strings that have the same second letter and the first letter different? That's the other case we want.\n\n So the condition is correct.\n\n However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5. But the distinct strings might be up to 11*11=121 (because letters from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters). So the nested loops over distinct strings (which are at most 121) is acceptable.\n\n But the current code does:\n   for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])):\n                cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n Then we do cnt//2.\n\n However, note: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) might be true for two distinct strings that are actually the same? No, because we skip x==y.\n\n But wait: what if we have two different strings that share the same first letter? Then we count the product. Similarly for same second letter.\n\n However, consider: the condition is true for two strings that share the same first letter OR the same second letter. But note: it is possible that two strings share the same first letter and also share the same second letter? Then they are the same string -> skipped. So the condition is correct.\n\n But there is a problem: the condition might be true for two strings that are not the same but share both a letter in one position and a letter in the other? Actually, no: if they share the same first letter, then we don't care about the second? We want to count them even if the second is different? And that is exactly one difference. Similarly, if they share the same second letter, then we count them even if the first is different? That is also exactly one difference.\n\n However, what if two strings share the same first letter and also share the same second letter? Then they are the same -> skipped.\n\n So the condition is correct.\n\n But note: the condition is also true for two strings that share the same first letter and the same second letter? But we skip because x==y. So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is the body of the if statement: we need to add the product of the frequencies.\n\n However, the current code already has:\n   cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n And then we do cnt//2.\n\n But wait: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. The variable cnt is being incremented by integers that are products of frequencies (which can be up to 10^5). But the total distinct strings is at most 121, so the product s[x]*s[y] for one pair of distinct strings can be as large as 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is within 64-bit integer. And the total number of pairs we iterate over is 121*121 = 14641, so the entire loop is efficient.\n\n However, the current code does not initialize cnt as a 64-bit integer? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we don't have to worry.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5. However, the distinct strings per test case might be many? But the distinct strings are at most 121, so the inner loop is 121*121 per test case. And the total test cases t is at most 100, so total distinct strings we iterate over is 100 * (121*121) = 1.4641e6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 10^5. But that doesn't directly relate to the distinct strings, but the distinct strings per test case is bounded by 121.\n\n So the code for program1.py is complete? Actually, the current code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then the next line is \"print(cnt//2)\". But the if block is empty? Actually, the code as given is:\n\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n\n There is no body for the if. So we must fill the body.\n\n We need to add: cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n But note: the code already has that line? Actually, in the provided code, the line \"cnt += s[x] * s[y]\" is not indented under the if? It is at the same level as the inner for loop? That would be incorrect.\n\n The provided code:\n\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n    print(cnt//2)\n\n So the body of the if is missing. We must add the line: cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n But note: the problem says the answer for a test case is printed as cnt//2.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the condition is correct? Actually, we are counting pairs of distinct strings that share at least one letter? But we want exactly one difference. And we argued that the condition is equivalent to exactly one difference? Yes.\n\n But wait: what if two strings share the same first letter and the same second letter? Then they are the same string -> skipped by x!=y. So the condition is safe.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the line: \"cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5. But note: the distinct strings per test case might be 121, so the inner loop is 121*121 which is acceptable.\n\n But what if we have a test case with 10^5 distinct strings? Then the inner loop would be 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, which is too slow. However, the distinct strings are at most 121 because the strings are of length 2 and the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters). So the distinct strings are at most 11*11=121. Therefore, the code is efficient.\n\n So for program1.py, we complete the if block with: cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n But note: the variable cnt is being incremented by the product of the frequencies of two distinct strings. And we are iterating over every pair of distinct strings (including both orders). Then we divide by 2 at the end. This counts every unordered pair of distinct strings that satisfy the condition.\n\n However, what about pairs of the same string? We skip because x!=y. And pairs of the same string do not contribute because they are the same -> they don't have exactly one difference (they have zero). So we are good.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n But note: the indentation. We must indent it under the if.\n\n Now for program2.py:\n\n The problem: given t test cases, each with an integer rating, output the division.\n\n The divisions:\n   Division 1: rating >= 1900\n   Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n   Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n   Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n The code: \n   for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are reading all lines from stdin. The first line is t, and then we skip it by taking [1:].\n\n Then for each rating string in the rest, we convert to integer and check.\n\n We must output \"Division X\" for each.\n\n Example: \n   rating = -789 -> Division 4\n   rating = 1299 -> Division 4\n   rating = 1300 -> Division 4\n   rating = 1399 -> Division 4\n   rating = 1400 -> Division 3\n   rating = 1679 -> Division 2\n   rating = 2300 -> Division 1\n\n We can do:\n\n   rating = int(n.strip())\n   if rating >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n   elif rating >= 1600:   # and rating <= 1899, but since we checked >=1900 above, then 1600<=rating<=1899\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n   elif rating >= 1400:   # then 1400<=rating<=1599\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n   else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the problem says the rating can be from -5000 to 5000, so we cover all.\n\n However, the condition for division 4 is rating <= 1399, which is the else.\n\n So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n   rating = int(n.strip())\n   if rating >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n   elif rating >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n   elif rating >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n   else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the code is written in one line? Actually, we can write:\n\n   for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900: print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n        else: print(\"Division 4\")\n\n However, the problem says: the first line is t, and then t lines of ratings.\n\n We are using [*open(0)][1:] to skip the first line.\n\n But note: the input might have newline characters. We use int(n) which will handle the newline? Actually, the elements in [*open(0)] are strings including the newline. But int(n) will ignore the newline.\n\n Alternatively, we can use n.strip() to be safe? But int() ignores whitespace.\n\n So we can do without strip.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the problem says to output the missing code only, and the original code has a for loop that we must complete.\n\n The original code: \n   for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We must complete the body of the for loop.\n\n So we write the body.\n\n However, the problem says: output only the missing code, and in the specified JSON format.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\", \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\")\"}\n\n But note: the program2 code must be a single string? And we have to escape the quotes and newlines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\n We can represent the program2 part as a string with escaped newlines and quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the entire body as a string with the necessary indentation.\n\n But note: the original for loop in program2.py is:\n\n   for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are to replace the \"# TODO: Your code here\" with the body. The body we are writing is:\n\n   r = int(n)\n   if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n   elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n   elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n   else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But the indentation: the for loop is at the top level, so the body must be indented by 4 spaces? Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must be consistent.\n\n However, the problem says: output the missing code. For program1, we are outputting a single line: \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\". For program2, we are outputting multiple lines.\n\n We can represent the program2 part as:\n\n   \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n But note: the entire body is one level indented under the for loop. So we start with 4 spaces for the first line, and then the if-elif-else should be indented by 4 more? Actually, the for loop body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for. Then the inner blocks (like if) should be 8, then the print 12? But the problem does not require a specific style, as long as it runs.\n\n Alternatively, we can use 4 spaces per level.\n\n However, the problem says: the original program2.py has the for loop. We are to complete the body. We can write:\n\n   for n in[*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But we are only to output the missing code, which is the body. The body is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the first line of the body is indented by 4 spaces? Then the next lines: the if should be at the same level? Actually, the entire body is one block.\n\n We can write the body as:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n So the string for program2 should be:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: we must escape the double quotes and the backslashes? Actually, in JSON, we escape double quotes with \\ and newlines with \\n.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact representation. But we are to output a JSON string.\n\n We can do:\n\n   \"program1\": \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\",\n   \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\")\"\n\n But note: the program2 body has multiple lines. We represent it as a single string with embedded newlines and escaped quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can write without newlines? But that would be hard to read. The problem does not require the code to be pretty, but it must run.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n So we output the string with the necessary escapes.\n\n But wait: the program2 body: the first line is \"    r = int(n)\" and then a newline, then \"    if ...\", etc.\n\n The entire body is one string. We break it with \\n and use \\\" for the quotes.\n\n Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n}\n\n But note: the program2 body has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the entire body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop. So the first line of the body is 4 spaces, then the next lines (like the if) should also be 4 spaces? Actually, the entire body is one block. We can write:\n\n   for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        ... \n\n So the body we output must be:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        ... \n\n Therefore, the string for program2 should start with 4 spaces? Actually, the problem says: the original code has the for loop. We are to complete the body. The body must be indented by 4 spaces. So the first line of the body is 4 spaces, then the rest of the lines in the body should be at the same level? But the if block inside the body must be indented further.\n\n Actually, the entire body is one block. The first line of the body is at 4 spaces. Then the if statement is at the same 4 spaces? Then the print statements under the if are at 8 spaces.\n\n But the problem does not require a specific number of spaces, but the standard is 4 per level.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   Line1: 4 spaces: \"    r = int(n)\"\n   Line2: 4 spaces: \"    if r >= 1900:\"\n   Line3: 8 spaces: \"        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\"\n   Line4: 4 spaces: \"    elif ...\"\n\n So the entire body string is:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n But note: in JSON, we must escape the double quotes. So we replace every \" inside the string with \\\".\n\n Therefore, the string for program2 becomes:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n\n However, we can also use single quotes in the print? But the problem says the output must be exactly \"Division X\", so we use double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the print to avoid escaping? But the problem does not specify. We can do:\n\n        print('Division 1')\n\n Then we don't need to escape the double quotes? But the problem says: output the missing code. The original problem output uses double quotes? Actually, the example output in the problem uses double quotes: \"Division X\".\n\n But in Python, we can use either. However, the problem does not specify. We'll use double quotes as in the example.\n\n But then we must escape them in the JSON string.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the print to avoid having to escape in the JSON? But the problem does not require a specific quote style in the code.\n\n However, the problem says: output the missing code. We can choose. But the example in the problem uses double quotes in the output.\n\n Since the problem says: \"output a single line containing the correct division in the format \\\"Division X\\\"\", we should output double quotes.\n\n Therefore, we escape the double quotes in the JSON.\n\n So the final answer:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\", \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"}\n\n But note: the program2 string has a lot of backslashes. We must double-escape the backslashes? Actually, in JSON, to represent a backslash, we write two backslashes. And to represent a double quote, we write \\\".\n\n However, we are representing the string for program2 as a JSON string. So:\n\n   We want the program2 string to be: \n        \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    ...\"\n\n   But in JSON, we must escape the double quotes and the newlines? Actually, the newline is represented as \\n, and the double quotes as \\\".\n\n   So the JSON string for program2 is:\n\n        \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    ...\"\n\n   But when we put that in a JSON string, we must escape the double quotes and the backslashes? Actually, we only need to escape the double quotes that are inside the string.\n\n   However, the string contains double quotes. So we replace every \" in the program2 string with \\\".\n\n   And the newline is represented as \\n.\n\n   But note: the backslash itself must be escaped? Only if we have a literal backslash. Here, we are using \\n which is a single character (newline) in the target string. In JSON, we represent a newline as the two characters: backslash and 'n'. So we write \\n.\n\n   Therefore, the JSON string for program2 is:\n\n        \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n\n   This will be parsed as:\n\n        '    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\"Division 1\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\"Division 2\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\"Division 3\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\"Division 4\")'\n\n   Which is what we want.\n\n Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n   {\n      \"program1\": \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\",\n      \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n   }\n\n But note: the program1 part: the line \"    cnt += s[x] * s[y]\" is exactly what we need. The indentation: it should be inside the inner for loop and the if block. The current code has:\n\n   for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): \n                ...   # we put this line\n\n So we need 8 spaces? Actually, the provided code in program1.py already has the for loops and the if condition. The missing line must be indented by 4 more spaces? Actually, the if condition is at the same level as the inner for loop? Then the body of the if must be indented by 4 more.\n\n The current code:\n\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n\n So the next line must be indented by 8 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the if, which is one line: \"cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n And it must be indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the code we are given has the for loops and the if condition, and then the print(cnt//2) is at the same level as the outer for.\n\n So we must add a line that is indented by 8 spaces.\n\n Therefore, the program1 missing code should be: \"        cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n But wait: the current code has:\n\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): \n    print(cnt//2)\n\n The if condition ends with a colon, so the next line must be the body. We are to add one line: the increment.\n\n So the missing line must be indented by 8 spaces (relative to the outer for) or 4 spaces relative to the if? Actually, the for loops are indented by 4 and 8? Let me count:\n\n   t=0 loop: 0\n   while: 0\n   n: 4\n   s: 4\n   cnt=0: 4\n   for x: 4\n        for y: 8\n            if: 12\n\n But the problem code:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n       print(cnt//2)\n\n       t-=1\n\n Actually, the if condition is at the same level as the inner for? Then the body of the if must be indented by 4 more spaces? So 12 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the standard is 4 per level.\n\n We can write: 8 spaces for the inner for, then 12 for the if body? But the problem says: output the missing code. We can output 8 spaces? Actually, the if condition is at 8 spaces (if we count the outer for at 4, then inner for at 8, then if at 12?).\n\n Alternatively, we can output the exact code that would be inserted: one line with 8 more spaces? Actually, the if condition is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer while) and the body of the if should be at 12.\n\n But the problem does not require a specific number of spaces, but the code must run. In Python, the indentation must be consistent.\n\n The current code has:\n\n   for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            ...   # the if condition\n\n So the inner for is indented by 4 spaces relative to the outer for? Then the if is indented by 4 spaces relative to the inner for? Then the body of the if must be indented by 4 more? So 4+4+4 = 12? But the problem code as given does not show the indentation.\n\n However, the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n       print(cnt//2)\n   \n       t-=1\n\n This has 4 spaces for the while body, then 8 for the inner for, then 12 for the if? Actually, the if is at the same level as the inner for? That would be 8 spaces? Then the body of the if must be 12.\n\n But the problem does not show the exact indentation. We assume the standard: each block is indented by 4 more.\n\n Therefore, the missing line for program1 must be indented by 12 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. We can output 8 spaces? Actually, the if condition is at 8 spaces (if the outer for is 4, inner for 8, then if 12?).\n\n Alternatively, we can output the line without worrying about the exact number of spaces? But we must be consistent.\n\n Since the problem says: the code is given as above, and the if condition is written without extra indentation in the given code? Actually, the given code in the problem is:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n   print(cnt//2)\n   \n       t-=1\n\n This is not properly indented. The print(cnt//2) is at the same level as the while? Then the inner for loops are at 4 and 8? And the if is at 8? Then the body of the if must be at 12.\n\n But the problem says: the code is given as above. We see that the if condition is at the same level as the inner for? So 8 spaces. Then the body must be 12.\n\n Therefore, the missing line for program1 is: \"            cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n But wait, 12 spaces? How many spaces? The outer while body: 4 spaces. Then the for x: 8 spaces. Then the for y: 12 spaces. Then the if: 12 spaces? Then the body of the if: 16 spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem code:\n\n   while(t!=0):\n       ... # 4 spaces for the body of the while\n       for x in s:   # 4 spaces? but the problem writes it as 4? Actually, the problem writes:\n\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:   # this is at 4 spaces? \n           for y in s:   # this is at 8 spaces?\n               if(...):   # this is at 12 spaces?\n\n   So the body of the if must be at 16 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not show the exact indentation. However, the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n       print(cnt//2)\n   \n       t-=1\n\n The line \"for x in s:\" is indented by 4 spaces? Then \"for y in s:\" is indented by 8? Then the if is at 8? Actually, the problem writes the if at the same level as the inner for? That would be 8 spaces? Then the body of the if must be 12.\n\n But the problem does not specify. We can assume that the if is at 8 spaces and the body must be 12.\n\n However, the problem says: output the missing code. We can output 8 spaces? But that would be the same as the inner for? That would be incorrect.\n\n Alternatively, we can output the line with 12 spaces? \n\n But note: the problem says the code is given as above. The if condition is written with 8 spaces? Then the body must be 12.\n\n Therefore, the missing line for program1 is: \"        cnt += s[x] * s[y]\" with 8 spaces? \n\n Let me count the spaces in the given code:\n\n   while(t!=0):\n       ...   # 4 spaces for the body of the while\n       for x in s:   # 4 spaces? but the problem writes it as 4? Actually, the problem writes:\n\n   while(t!=0):\n       n = ...   # 4\n       s = ...   # 4\n       cnt = 0   # 4\n       for x in s:   # 4\n           for y in s:   # 8\n               if(...):   # 12\n\n   So the body of the if must be 16 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not show the exact indentation. However, the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n   for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            if(...): \n\n   This is not consistent. But in the problem statement, the code is written as:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n   print(cnt//2)\n   \n       t-=1\n\n   The if is written at the same level as the inner for? That would be 8 spaces? Then the body of the if must be 12.\n\n   But the print(cnt//2) is at 4 spaces? That is at the same level as the for x? That would be incorrect because the for x loop is not finished.\n\n   Actually, the print(cnt//2) is at the same level as the for x, so it is after the inner for loops.\n\n   Therefore, the for x loop has a body that is the inner for loop and then the if is not inside the inner for? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   This is likely a formatting issue in the problem statement.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we assume the standard 4 spaces per indent.\n\n   The structure:\n\n   while t!=0:\n        n = ...\n        s = ...\n        cnt = 0\n        for x in s:   # indent 4\n            for y in s:   # indent 8\n                if ...:   # indent 12\n                    ...   # indent 16\n\n   But the problem says: the if condition is written as:\n\n               if(...):   # which is 12 spaces? \n\n   Then the body must be 16.\n\n   However, the problem says: output the missing code. We can output 16 spaces: \"                cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n   But that is 16 spaces, which is 4 levels.\n\n   But the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, and the distinct strings are at most 121, so the inner loop is 121*121, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the line with 8 spaces? That would be the same as the inner for? That would be:\n\n        for x in s:\n            for y in s:\n            if ...:   # this would be at the same level as the inner for -> syntax error.\n\n   So we must have the if indented under the inner for.\n\n   Given the provided code has the if at the same level as the inner for? Actually, the provided code has:\n\n        for x in s:\n            for y in s:\n                if ...:   # so 12 spaces if the outer is 4 and inner is 8.\n\n   Then the body of the if must be 16 spaces.\n\n   But the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n        for x in s:\n            for y in s:\n                if(...):   # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So the if is at 12 spaces? Then the body must be 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program1 is: \"                cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n\n   But that is 16 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but the body of the if must be indented more than the if condition.\n\n   We'll go with 16 spaces.\n\n   But note: the problem says the code is given as above. The if condition is written with 8 spaces? In the problem statement, it is written with 8 spaces? \n\n   In the problem statement, the code is:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   t=int(input())\n   while(t!=0):\n       n=int(input())\n       s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n       cnt = 0\n       for x in s:\n           for y in s:\n               if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): # TODO: Your code here\n   print(cnt//2)\n   \n       t-=1\n\n   The if is written with 8 spaces? Actually, in the text, it is aligned with the inner for, which is at 8 spaces? Then the body should be 12.\n\n   But in the text, the inner for is written as:\n\n           for y in s:   # 8 spaces\n               if(...):   # 12 spaces? \n\n   So the if is at 12 spaces. Then the body must be 16.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program1: \"                cnt += s[x] * s[y]\" (16 spaces)\n\n   But 16 spaces is 4 levels of 4 spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem says spaces.\n\n   Given the confusion, and since the problem says the code is given as above, and the if is at 12 spaces, we use 16 spaces for the body.\n\n   But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases is at most 10^5, and the distinct strings per test case is at most 121, so the loop is efficient.\n\n   So the final answer:\n\n   {\n      \"program1\": \"                cnt += s[x] * s[y]\",\n      \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if r >= 1900:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n   }\n\n But wait, the program2 part: the first line of the body is \"    r = int(n)\" which is 4 spaces. Then the if is also 4 spaces? That would be at the same level. But the if should be at the same level as the assignment.\n\n   for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            ...\n\n   This is 4 spaces for the body of the for loop.\n\n   So the entire body is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            ...\n\n   Which is 4 spaces for the first two lines, and 8 for the print.\n\n   Therefore, the program2 string is correct.\n\n   But note: the program2 string has \"    r = int(n)\\\\n    if ...\", which means the if is at the same indentation level as the assignment, which is correct.\n\n   So we are done."
