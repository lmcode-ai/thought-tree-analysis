So that doesn't work. Alternatively, we can try to use prefix and suffix sums and then find the maximum i and j such that prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then the total candies is i+1 + j+1? But note: the suffix sum is from the end. Let me define:\n   prefix[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + w_{i-1}   (for i from 0 to n)\n   suffix[j] = w_j + w_{j+1} + ... + w_{n-1}   (for j from 0 to n, and suffix[n]=0)\n\nWe want to find i and j such that i<=j and prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then the total candies is i + (n - j). We want to maximize i + (n-j) over all i,j with i<=j and prefix[i]==suffix[j]. We can do: i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to know if there exists j>=i such that suffix[j] = prefix[i].",

The example says the second test case has answer 6, which implies n=6. So the example [1,2,1] is not the second test case. Example 2 from the problem: n=3, [1,2,1] -> the example says \"For the second test case\" with answer 6, so it must be a different instance. Let me try with the example that has answer 6: \n        n=6, arr = [2,3,2,2,3,2] (because 2+3+2=7, and 2+3+2=7) -> \n        i=0, j=5, a=0<=0 -> a=2, i=1 -> not equal. a=2, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=2, j=4 -> equal! -> ans = 1 + (6-1-4)=1+1=2. then i=1, j=4: \n             a=2<=b=2 -> a=2+3=5, i=2 -> not equal. a=5, b=2 -> a>0 -> b=2+3=5, j=3 -> equal -> ans = 2+ (6-1-3)=2+2=4. then i=2, j=3:\n             a=5<=5 -> a=5+2=7, i=3 -> not equal.\n        a=7, b=5 -> a>0 -> b=5+2=7, j=2 -> equal -> ans = 3+ (6-1-2)=3+3=6. then i=3, j=2: break. So we get 6. -> correct. Example 3: [1,2,3] -> \n        i=0, j=2, a=0<=0 -> a=1, i=1 -> not equal. a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=3, j=1 -> not equal. a=1, b=3 -> a<3 -> a=1+2=3, i=2 -> a==b -> ans = 2+(3-1-1)=2+1=3. then i=2, j=1: i<=j -> a=3<=b=3 -> a=3+3=6, i=3 -> then break. So we record 3. But the example says for the third test case: non-zero weight not possible -> answer=0. What is the third test case?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\n\nThe idea is to use two pointers (or a deque) to simulate the process:\n- Alice starts from the left and Bob from the right.\n- We maintain two sums: a (for Alice) and b (for Bob).\n- We start with a = 0, b = 0, and two pointers (or a deque) to represent the remaining candies.\n- We are going to try to balance the two sums by:\n   - If a == b, then we record the current total number of candies eaten (which is the count) and then we try to extend by taking from the left (because we want to maximize the total candies).\n   - If a < b, then we take one from the left (to increase a).\n   - If a >= b, then we take one from the right (to increase b). But note: in the provided code, the condition is written as \"if a>=b\" then Bob eats (from the right). However, the initial condition is a=0, b=0, so we start by taking from the left? But the code uses a deque and pops from the left for Alice and from the right for Bob.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a while loop that runs as long as the deque is not empty. Inside:\n   cur = 0   # This seems to be the count of candies eaten? But then we do cur+=1 at the beginning of the loop? Actually, the variable 'cur' is the total number of candies eaten so far? But note: we are going to update 'ans' only when a==b.\n\nBut the provided code has:\n   while l:\n        cur += 1\n        if a >= b:\n            b += l.pop()\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis logic is flawed because initially a and b are 0, so a>=b (0>=0) is true -> then we pop from the right and add to b. Then we have a=0, b=w_n. Then next iteration: cur becomes 1 (then 2) and then we check: now 0>=w_n? If w_n>0 then we go to the else branch.\n\nBut the else branch is missing.\n\nWe need to design the algorithm properly.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem is to use two pointers (left and right) and then:\n   Let left = 0, right = n-1\n   a = 0, b = 0\n   count = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a < b:\n            a += w[left]\n            left += 1\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            b += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n            count += 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = count   # because we want the maximum total candies, we record when the sums are equal.\n\nBut note: we can also break the symmetry by having Alice take from the left until her sum is at least Bob's, then Bob takes until his is at least Alice's, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem is that we want the maximum total candies. The known solution is to use two pointers and then when the sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is left + (n-1-right)) and then we try to extend? Actually, we can do:\n\n   left = 0\n   right = n-1\n   a = 0\n   b = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a <= b:\n            a += w[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the next index for Alice, so she has eaten left candies, and Bob has eaten (n-1-right) candies.\n\nBut note: the total candies eaten is left + (n-1-right). However, we can also do:\n\n   total_candies = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because the candies from [0, left-1] are eaten by Alice, and [right+1, n-1] by Bob.\n\nBut the provided code uses a deque and pops from the left and right. We can adapt.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the provided code:\n\nThe provided code uses a deque and a while loop until the deque is empty. But we don't necessarily have to empty the deque? We break when we have no more moves? Actually, we break when the deque is empty.\n\nBut the provided code has:\n   a, b = 0, 0\n   ans = 0\n   cur = 0\n   while l:\n        cur += 1\n        if a>=b:\n            b += l.pop()\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe see that when a>=b, we pop from the right (Bob eats). When a < b, we should have Alice eat from the left? But the deque is a double ended queue. We can pop from the left with l.popleft().\n\nSo the else block should be:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\nBut then after that, we check if a==b, then we set ans = cur.\n\nHowever, note: we want the maximum total candies. But the problem is that we are traversing until the deque is empty. But we might have multiple times when a==b. We want the last time when a==b? Actually, we want the maximum total candies at the moment when a==b. So we can update ans whenever a==b and then continue? Because we might have a later time when a==b again and with more candies? But note: once we pass a point where a==b, if we continue then we break the equality. However, we are allowed to stop at any time? Actually, the problem does not require that they eat all candies. They can stop in the middle.\n\nBut the algorithm: we are simulating the entire process until all candies are eaten? Then we record the maximum cur for which a==b during the process.\n\nBut note: the problem says they can choose any number from the left (in a row) and any number from the right (in a row). They don't have to eat until the deque is empty. However, the problem is asking for the maximum total candies they can eat. So we are allowed to stop at any time? Actually, the simulation we are doing is sequential: we are forced to alternate? But note: the problem does not specify the order of eating. They can eat arbitrarily? However, the known solution is to use two pointers and simulate the process: Alice eats from the left until her sum is at least Bob's, then Bob eats until his sum is at least Alice's, and so on. And whenever the sums are equal, we record the total candies eaten so far.\n\nBut the known solution from the note examples: \n   Example 2: n=11, weights = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10, 2, 4] -> answer=7.\n\nHow does that work?\n   We want to have Alice eat [7,3,20] (30) and Bob eat [10,8,11,1] (30). That's 7 candies.\n\nBut in the simulation with two pointers:\n\n   We start:\n      a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a +=7 -> a=7, left=1, cur=1 -> then check: 7!=0 -> then next: \n      a=7, b=0 -> a>=b -> b+=4 -> b=4, right=9, cur=2 -> then 7!=4\n      a=7, b=4 -> a>=b -> b+=2 -> b=6, right=8, cur=3 -> 7!=6\n      a=7, b=6 -> a>=b -> b+=10 -> b=16, right=7, cur=4 -> 7!=16\n      a=7, b=16 -> a<b -> a+=3 -> a=10, left=2, cur=5 -> 10!=16\n      a=10, b=16 -> a<b -> a+=20 -> a=30, left=3, cur=6 -> 30!=16\n      a=30, b=16 -> a>=b -> b+=8 -> b=24, right=6, cur=7 -> 30!=24\n      a=30, b=24 -> a>=b -> b+=1 -> b=25, right=5, cur=8 -> 30!=25\n      ... until the end.\n\nBut we never got 30==30? How do we get that?\n\nActually, we are not stopping arbitrarily. The known solution is to use two pointers and then:\n\n   a = 0, b = 0\n   left = 0, right = n-1\n   ans = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a <= b:\n            a += w[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = left + (n - 1 - right)\n\n   Then print ans.\n\nBut in the example:\n   We start: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=7, left=1 -> then a==b? no -> then next: \n        a=7, b=0 -> a>0 -> so b=4, right=9 -> then a==b? no -> \n        a=7, b=4 -> a>4 -> so b=4+2=6, right=8 -> no\n        a=7, b=6 -> a>6 -> so b=6+10=16, right=7 -> no\n        a=7, b=16 -> a<16 -> so a=7+3=10, left=2 -> no\n        a=10, b=16 -> a<16 -> so a=10+20=30, left=3 -> no\n        a=30, b=16 -> a>16 -> so b=16+8=24, right=6 -> no\n        a=30, b=24 -> a>24 -> so b=24+1=25, right=5 -> no\n        a=30, b=25 -> a>25 -> so b=25+15=40, right=4 -> no\n        a=30, b=40 -> a<40 -> so a=30+5=35, left=4 -> no\n        ... until the end.\n\nBut we never get 30==30? \n\nActually, we have to record the last time when a==b. But in the example, we never get a==b after the start? \n\nBut the example says the answer is 7. How do we get 7? \n\nWe have to consider that they can choose arbitrary contiguous segments from the left and right. They don't have to alternate one by one. However, the two pointers method that alternates is a greedy method that ensures we capture every time the sums are equal.\n\nBut note: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        L = 0\n        R = n-1\n        a = 0\n        b = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while L <= R:\n            if a < b:\n                a += arr[L]\n                L += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[R]\n                R -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                ans = L + (n - 1 - R)\n        print(ans)\n\nBut in the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] we get:\n   We want to get 7. How?\n\n   We must have Alice take [7,3,20] (30) and Bob take [10,8,11,1] (30). But note: Bob's candies are taken from the right: [4,2,10,8,11,1]? Actually, the rightmost four: [4,2,10,8] -> but wait, the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] which are the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th? (0-indexed: 7,8,9,10). But the array is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] -> \n        Alice: [0:3] -> [7,3,20] -> index0,1,2.\n        Bob: [7:11] -> [8,10,2,4]? that's not 30. \n\nWait, the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which are the weights: 10,8,11,1. In the array: \n   The array: index0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:15, index5:1, index6:11, index7:8, index8:10, index9:2, index10:4.\n\nBob eats from the right: \n   The rightmost: index10:4 -> then index9:2 -> then index8:10 -> then index7:8 -> that's 4+2+10+8=24, not 30.\n\nBut the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that would be: \n   index8:10, index7:8, index6:11, index5:1 -> 10+8+11+1=30.\n\nSo Bob's segment is the four candies starting from the rightmost that are not adjacent? Actually, they are contiguous from the right? The problem says Bob eats any number of candies from the right (in a row). So he must eat the last k candies. But note: the example: \n   Alice ate the first three from the left: [7,3,20] (so the next candy is at index3:5). \n   Bob ate the last four from the right: [1,11,8,10]? But wait, the last four in the original array are [8,10,2,4] (if we take the last four) but that doesn't include the 1 and 11. \n\nActually, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" for the second test case? That was a different example. \n\nIn the fourth test case: \n   Input: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10, 2, 4] \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30. \n\nBut note: Bob eats from the right. The candy weights at the right are: \n   ... , 2, 4 -> then next is 10, then 8, then 11, then 1? \n\nActually, the array is: \n   left: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] \n   Bob eats the last four? But the last four are [2,4] and then [10,8]? That's not contiguous from the right. \n\nBut the problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (in a row). So he must eat a contiguous block at the right. So he can eat the last k candies. \n\nIn the example, Bob eats the candies: [1,11,8,10]? But that is not contiguous at the right? Because between the 1 and the 11 there is no gap? Actually, the array is: \n   ... , 15, 1, 11, 8, 10, 2, 4\n   If Bob eats the last 6 candies? [1,11,8,10,2,4] -> that's 1+11+8+10+2+4=36, which is too much.\n\nBut the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that is 10 (which is at index8), 8 (index7), 11 (index6), 1 (index5). But these are not contiguous? They are in reverse order? \n\nActually, the problem says: the candies are numbered from left to right. Bob eats from the right. He eats a contiguous segment from the right. So the contiguous segment from the right must be the last k candies. \n\nBut the example: \n   The entire array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]\n   If Bob eats the last 4 candies: [8,10,2,4] -> 8+10+2+4=24 -> not 30.\n   If Bob eats the last 6 candies: [1,11,8,10,2,4] = 1+11+8+10+2+4=36.\n\nHow do we get 30? \n   Bob must eat the candies: [1,11,8,10] -> but these are not contiguous at the right? Because after the 10 there is 2 and 4. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". This means that Bob must eat a contiguous block that starts at the rightmost and goes left. He cannot skip the 2 and 4 to get the 10 and 8. \n\nSo the example solution must be: \n   Alice: [7,3,20] (the first three) -> 30.\n   Bob: [4,2,10,8,11,1] -> 4+2+10+8+11+1=36? -> no, 36.\n\nBut wait, the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that is 10+8+11+1=30. How is that contiguous from the right? \n\nActually, the problem does not require that Bob eats the candies in the order of the array? It says \"from the right\", meaning he can choose any contiguous segment that is at the right? But the example output says Bob eats the first three candies from the right in the second test case? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". This means that Bob eats a contiguous segment that is a suffix of the array. \n\nTherefore, the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] must have Bob eat a contiguous suffix. The only way to get 30 is to eat the entire array? \n\nBut the example says the answer is 7. How? \n\nAfter reading the note: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n\nBut [10,8,11,1] is not a contiguous suffix. \n\nI see the issue: the problem does not require that the candies Bob eats are contiguous in the array? It says \"from the right\" meaning he eats candies starting from the right and moving left, but he can stop at any time? And he must eat in a row meaning without skipping any in between? \n\nBut the example: \n   The array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]\n   Bob eats: starting from the rightmost, he can eat 4, then 2, then 10, then 8, then 11, then 1? But that would be the entire right part? \n\nBut the example says he eats [10,8,11,1] -> that is the candy with weight 10 is the 9th (0-indexed index8), then 8 (index7), then 11 (index6), then 1 (index5). This is a contiguous segment? No, because the array has 15 at index4 and 5 at index3 in between? \n\nI think the problem means: \n   Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix. And they cannot overlap. \n\nSo the entire array is divided into three parts: \n   [0, i-1] for Alice, [i, j] for no one, [j+1, n-1] for Bob.\n\nAnd the condition is that the sum of Alice's part equals the sum of Bob's part.\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of candies eaten: i + (n - j - 1).\n\nSo we can do: \n   Use two pointers: \n        left = 0, right = n-1\n        a = 0, b = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while left <= right:\n            if a <= b:\n                a += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                ans = left + (n - right - 1)\n\n        print(ans)\n\nBut let's test with the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]:\n   left=0, right=10, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=7, left=1 -> a!=b -> \n   a=7, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=4, right=9 -> a!=b -> \n   a=7, b=4 -> a>4 -> b=4+2=6, right=8 -> \n   a=7, b=6 -> a>6 -> b=6+10=16, right=7 -> \n   a=7, b=16 -> a<16 -> a=7+3=10, left=2 -> \n   a=10, b=16 -> a<16 -> a=10+20=30, left=3 -> \n   a=30, b=16 -> a>16 -> b=16+8=24, right=6 -> \n   a=30, b=24 -> a>24 -> b=24+11=35, right=5 -> \n   a=30, b=35 -> a<35 -> a=30+5=35, left=4 -> \n   now a=35, b=35 -> ans = left + (n - right - 1) = 4 + (11-5-1)=4+5=9 -> but expected is 7.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use prefix and suffix sums and then find the maximum i and j such that prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then the total candies is i+1 + j+1? But note: the suffix sum is from the end. \n\nLet me define:\n   prefix[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + w_{i-1}   (for i from 0 to n)\n   suffix[j] = w_j + w_{j+1} + ... + w_{n-1}   (for j from 0 to n, and suffix[n]=0)\n\nWe want to find i and j such that i<=j and prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then the total candies is i + (n - j).\n\nWe want to maximize i + (n-j) over all i,j with i<=j and prefix[i]==suffix[j].\n\nWe can do:\n   i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to know if there exists j>=i such that suffix[j] = prefix[i]. And we want the maximum i + (n-j).\n\nBut note: the condition i<=j means that the segments [0, i-1] and [j, n-1] do not overlap.\n\nWe can precompute the suffix sums and store them in a dictionary? But note: we want the largest j for a given suffix[j]? Actually, we want to minimize j to maximize n-j? But we also want to maximize i. \n\nAlternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and then use a pointer j that starts at n and moves left. We want to find the smallest j>=i such that suffix[j] == prefix[i]. But we want to maximize i + (n-j) = (i) + (n-j). \n\nBut note: we can do two pointers: \n   i=0, j=n\n   while i < j:\n        if prefix[i] < suffix[j]:\n            i += 1\n        elif prefix[i] > suffix[j]:\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            candidate = i + (n - j)\n            ans = max(ans, candidate)\n            i += 1   # and j -= 1? But we can also move both? \n            j -= 1\n\nBut we must move both because if we only move one, we might skip the next match? \n\nActually, we can do:\n\n   i = 0\n   j = n\n   total = 0\n   while i < j:\n        if prefix[i] < suffix[j]:\n            i += 1\n        elif prefix[i] > suffix[j]:\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            total = i + (n - j)\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n\n   But then we want the maximum total? Actually, we are only storing the last total. We need to record the maximum total when we have an equality.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case? But the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we can do one pass per test case.\n\nBut the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]:\n   prefix[0]=0\n   prefix[1]=7\n   prefix[2]=10\n   prefix[3]=30\n   prefix[4]=35\n   ... \n\n   suffix[11]=0\n   suffix[10]=4\n   suffix[9]=2+4=6\n   suffix[8]=10+2+4=16\n   suffix[7]=8+10+2+4=24\n   suffix[6]=11+24=35\n   suffix[5]=1+35=36\n   ...\n\n   Now, we start i=0, j=11: prefix[0]=0, suffix[11]=0 -> total = 0 + (11-11)=0 -> record 0.\n        then i=1, j=10: prefix[1]=7, suffix[10]=4 -> 7>4 -> j=9: suffix[9]=6 -> 7>6 -> j=8: suffix[8]=16 -> 7<16 -> i=2: prefix[2]=10 -> 10<16 -> i=3: prefix[3]=30 -> 30>16 -> j=7: suffix[7]=24 -> 30>24 -> j=6: suffix[6]=35 -> 30<35 -> i=4: prefix[4]=35 -> 35==35 -> total = 4 + (11-6) = 4+5=9.\n\n   But expected is 7.\n\nWhy 7? The example says they ate 7 candies: Alice 3, Bob 4.\n\nHow do we get 3+4=7? \n   We need prefix[3] = 7+3+20 = 30, and suffix[?] = 30. \n   We see suffix[5]=36, suffix[6]=35, suffix[7]=24, ... \n   But we need a suffix that is 30. \n\n   Let's compute suffix for j=5: suffix[5] = w5 to w10 = 1+11+8+10+2+4 = 36.\n   j=6: 11+8+10+2+4=35.\n   j=7: 8+10+2+4=24.\n   j=8: 10+2+4=16.\n   j=9: 2+4=6.\n   j=10:4.\n\n   There is no suffix[j]=30.\n\n   But wait, the example says Bob ate [10,8,11,1] -> which is 10+8+11+1=30. This corresponds to the suffix starting at j=5? \n        j=5: weight[5]=1, then j=6:11, j=7:8, j=8:10 -> but that is not a contiguous suffix? \n\n   The suffix must be contiguous at the right. The only contiguous suffixes are from j to n-1. \n\n   The candies Bob ate are not a contiguous suffix? They are the last four in the array? But the last four are [8,10,2,4] -> not 30.\n\n   The example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" for the second test case. That implies that the contiguous suffix of length 3. \n\n   In the fourth test case, if Bob eats the last four, we get 8+10+2+4=24. \n\n   How do we get 30? \n\n   I see the example: \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n   The array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]\n   The weights [10,8,11,1] are not in contiguous positions at the right. They are scattered? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". This means that Bob must eat a contiguous block at the right. \n\n   Therefore, the example solution might be in error? \n\n   Let me check the official example: \n        Example 2: n=3, weights=[1,2,1] -> answer=3? \n        But the example says: Alice will eat the first three from the left? But there are only three. And Bob will eat the first three from the right? That would be the same three. \n\n   Example 2: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" \n        The input for the second test case: n=3, weights=[1,2,1] -> \n            Alice: [1,2,1] -> sum=4.\n            Bob: [1,2,1] -> sum=4.\n        But the example says they each eat 7? \n\n   I see: the second test case is different. The example says: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n   This implies that the second test case has more than 3 candies. \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n\"\n        then the second line has n integers.\n\n   The examples: \n        Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n        Test case 2: n=3, [1,2,1] -> answer=3? but the example says answer=6? \n\n   The example says: \"For the second test case, ... answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n   So the second test case must have n=6? \n\n   The input: \n        t=4\n        test1: n=2, [1,1]\n        test2: n=3, [1,2,1] -> but then total candies eaten would be 3 (Alice ate all, and Bob ate none? or vice versa) but that's not 6.\n\n   The example says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". \n\n   So the second test case must have at least 6 candies: \n        Alice eats the first three: [a0, a1, a2] = 7\n        Bob eats the last three: [a_{n-3}, a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}] = 7\n\n   And the answer is 6.\n\n   So the example input for the second test case might be: n=6, [2,3,2,2,3,2] -> then Alice: [2,3,2]=7, Bob: [2,3,2]=7.\n\n   Therefore, the fourth test case: n=11, [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] -> \n        Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n        Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> but how is that contiguous from the right? \n\n   Unless the array is: \n        The array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]\n        Bob's contiguous suffix: the last four are [2,4] -> not 30.\n        The last five: [10,2,4] -> 16.\n        The last six: [8,10,2,4] -> 24.\n        The last seven: [11,8,10,2,4] -> 35.\n        The last eight: [1,11,8,10,2,4] -> 36.\n\n   There is no suffix that sums to 30.\n\n   Therefore, the example solution for the fourth test case might be in error? \n\n   But the problem statement says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n\n   This implies that Bob's candies are not a contiguous suffix? \n\n   I see the light: the problem does not require that the candies they eat are contiguous in the array? It says: \n        \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\"\n        \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\"\n\n   This means that Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix. The candies in between are not eaten.\n\n   Therefore, the array is split into three parts: \n        Alice: [0, i-1]\n        not eaten: [i, j]\n        Bob: [j+1, n-1]\n\n   And the sum of Alice's part = sum of Bob's part.\n\n   In the fourth test case: \n        Alice: [0,2] -> [7,3,20] -> sum=30.\n        not eaten: [3,6] -> [5,15,1,11] -> \n        Bob: [7,10] -> [8,10,2,4] -> sum=24.\n\n   That doesn't work.\n\n   But the example says Bob's weights are [10,8,11,1] -> which are the weights at indices 8,7,6,5: \n        index5:1, index6:11, index7:8, index8:10 -> sum=1+11+8+10=30.\n\n   This is a contiguous suffix? No, because the suffix must be from index5 to index8, but the array has at index9 and index10: 2 and 4, which are not eaten by anyone? \n\n   The problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\". This means that if Bob decides to eat, he must eat a contiguous block that includes the rightmost candy? \n\n   But the example: the rightmost candy is 4 (index10). If Bob eats, he must eat from index10 and then contiguous to the left. He cannot skip index10 and index9 to eat index8.\n\n   Therefore, the example solution for the fourth test case is not valid by the problem's own rules.\n\n   I think there is a mistake in the example explanation. \n\n   Let me look at the official example from the note: \n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n   This implies that the total number of candies eaten is 3+4=7.\n\n   How can Bob eat [10,8,11,1] if the array is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]? \n        The only way is if the array is reordered? \n\n   But the problem says: \"the i-th candy has weight w_i\" and they are from left to right.\n\n   Unless the array is: \n        [7,3,20,5,15,  1,11,8,10,  2,4] \n        Alice eats the first three: [7,3,20] = 30.\n        Bob eats the last four: [2,4] -> that's not 30.\n\n   or \n        [7,3,20,  5,15,1,11,8,10,  2,4]\n        Alice: [7,3,20] = 30.\n        Bob: [2,4] -> 6.\n\n   or \n        [7,3,20,5,  15,1,11,8,10,  2,4]\n        Alice: [7,3,20,5] = 35.\n        Bob: [2,4] -> 6.\n\n   None work.\n\n   I see: the example might have a different arrangement. The weights [10,8,11,1] appear in the array as [1,11,8,10] if we read from the right? \n        The rightmost is 4, then 2, then 10, then 8, then 11, then 1, then 15, then 5, then 20, then 3, then 7.\n        So if Bob eats the first four from the right: [4,2,10,8] = 24.\n        if he eats the next two: [11,1] = 12, then total 36.\n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   I found a known solution for this problem (Codeforces Round #684 (Div. 2) problem B: \n        https://codeforces.com/contest/1440/problem/B\n\n   But wait, the problem described is actually from a different contest? \n\n   I recall a problem: \"Candies\" from a contest. \n\n   After a search, I found: This is problem https://codeforces.com/contest/1472/problem/D\n\n   But wait, the problem ID is not matching.\n\n   Alternatively, the solution that passed in the contest for this problem (with the example answer 7 for the fourth test) is to use two pointers and simulate the process of Alice and Bob eating from the two ends, and when the sums are equal, record the number of candies eaten. \n\n   And the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] is not in the official test data.\n\n   Given the time, I will trust the two pointers method that is commonly used:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        a = 0\n        b = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while i <= j:\n            if a <= b:\n                a += arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                ans = i + (n - 1 - j)\n        print(ans)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: [1,1] -> \n        i=0, j=1, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=1, i=1 -> a!=b -> \n        then a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> b+=arr[1]=1, j=0 -> now a==b -> ans = i + (n-1-j) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2. -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: [1,2,1] -> \n        i=0, j=2, a=0<=0 -> a=1, i=1 -> a!=b (1!=0) -> \n        a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=1, j=1 -> a==b (1==1) -> ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2. \n        then i<=j: i=1, j=1 -> a=1<=b=1 -> a=1+2=3, i=2 -> a!=b (3!=1) -> \n        then a=3, b=1 -> a>0 -> b=1+? but j=1, so we take arr[1]=2? -> b=1+2=3, j=0 -> a==b -> ans = 2+(3-1-0)=2+2=4. \n        but expected is 3 for the second test case? \n\n   The example says the second test case has answer 6, which implies n=6. So the example [1,2,1] is not the second test case.\n\n   Example 2 from the problem: n=3, [1,2,1] -> the example says \"For the second test case\" with answer 6, so it must be a different instance.\n\n   Let me try with the example that has answer 6: \n        n=6, arr = [2,3,2,2,3,2] (because 2+3+2=7, and 2+3+2=7) -> \n        i=0, j=5, a=0<=0 -> a=2, i=1 -> not equal.\n        a=2, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=2, j=4 -> equal! -> ans = 1 + (6-1-4)=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=4: \n             a=2<=b=2 -> a=2+3=5, i=2 -> not equal.\n        a=5, b=2 -> a>0 -> b=2+3=5, j=3 -> equal -> ans = 2+ (6-1-3)=2+2=4.\n        then i=2, j=3:\n             a=5<=5 -> a=5+2=7, i=3 -> not equal.\n        a=7, b=5 -> a>0 -> b=5+2=7, j=2 -> equal -> ans = 3+ (6-1-2)=3+3=6.\n        then i=3, j=2: break.\n\n        So we get 6. -> correct.\n\n   Example 3: [1,2,3] -> \n        i=0, j=2, a=0<=0 -> a=1, i=1 -> not equal.\n        a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=3, j=1 -> not equal.\n        a=1, b=3 -> a<3 -> a=1+2=3, i=2 -> a==b -> ans = 2+(3-1-1)=2+1=3.\n        then i=2, j=1: i<=j -> a=3<=b=3 -> a=3+3=6, i=3 -> then break. \n        So we record 3.\n\n        But the example says for the third test case: non-zero weight not possible -> answer=0.\n\n        What is the third test case? \n        The example says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n        So the third test case might be [1,2,3] but then we got 3. \n\n        Let me try [1,2]: \n            i=0, j=1, a=0<=0 -> a=1, i=1 -> not equal.\n            a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=2, j=0 -> a!=b (1!=2) -> done. ans=0 (because we never had a==b after the start) -> prints 0.\n\n        So the third test case might be [1,2].\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm: \n            We initialize ans=0.\n            We simulate until i<=j.\n            Whenever a==b, we update ans = i + (n-1-j) [because Alice has eaten i candies (0..i-1), and Bob has eaten (n-1-j) candies (from j+1 to n-1)].\n\n        For [1,2]: we never have a==b after the start, so ans remains 0.\n\n   Example 4: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] -> \n        We want to get 7.\n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n        i=0, j=10: a=0<=0 -> a=7, i=1.\n        a=7, b=0 -> a>0 -> b=4, j=9.\n        a=7, b=4 -> a>4 -> b=4+2=6, j=8.\n        a=7, b=6 -> a>6 -> b=6+10=16, j=7.\n        a=7, b=16 -> a<16 -> a=7+3=10, i=2.\n        a=10, b=16 -> a<16 -> a=10+20=30, i=3.\n        a=30, b=16 -> a>16 -> b=16+8=24, j=6.\n        a=30, b=24 -> a>24 -> b=24+11=35, j=5.\n        a=30, b=35 -> a<35 -> a=30+5=35, i=4 -> a==b -> ans = 4 + (11-1-5)=4+5=9.\n        then i=4, j=5: \n             a=35<=35 -> a=35+15=50, i=5.\n        then a=50, b=35 -> a>35 -> b=35+1=36, j=4 -> now i>j -> break.\n\n        So we have ans=9.\n\n        But the example says 7.\n\n        However, the example explanation says they ate 7 candies: Alice 3, Bob 4.\n\n        When do we have a==b at 3+4=7 candies? \n            Alice has eaten 3 candies: indices0,1,2 -> sum=7+3+20=30.\n            Bob has eaten 4 candies: indices7,8,9,10 -> sum=8+10+2+4=24 -> not 30.\n\n        indices5,6,7,8,9,10: 1+11+8+10+2+4=36.\n\n        indices6,7,8,9,10: 11+8+10+2+4=35.\n\n        indices7,8,9,10: 8+10+2+4=24.\n\n        indices8,9,10: 10+2+4=16.\n\n        indices9,10:2+4=6.\n\n        indices10:4.\n\n        None is 30.\n\n        indices0,1,2: 7+3+20=30.\n        indices5,6,7,8: 1+11+8+10=30. -> but these are not contiguous at the right? indices5 to 8 is not a suffix because the suffix must include index10.\n\n        Therefore, the example might have intended a different interpretation.\n\n        I found a different approach in a solution for a similar problem (Codeforces Round 684 (Div. 2) problem B: https://codeforces.com/contest/1440/problem/B) but that's not the same.\n\n        Alternatively, the solution might be to allow not necessarily eating until the condition is met in the two pointers, but to allow early stopping. However, in our simulation, we only stop when the pointers cross.\n\n        But note: we update ans whenever a==b. In the example, we had a==b at i=4 and j=5 (35==35) and that gave 9 candies. The example says the answer is 7, so we must have had an earlier time when a==b with 7 candies.\n\n        When did we have a==b before i=4 and j=5? \n            We had at the very beginning: a=0,b=0 -> then we did a=7, then b=4, then b=6, then b=16, then a=10, then a=30, then b=24, then b=35, then a=35 -> only at the last step.\n\n        So we never had a==b in between.\n\n        How to get 7? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30, and then Bob: [1,11,8,10] = 30. \n            In the array, [1,11,8,10] are at indices5,6,7,8. \n            In the two pointers method, we haven't reached index5 for Bob because we were only at index5 for Bob at the step when we did b=35 (which included indices9 and 10 and then index8,7,6,5) -> but we added them in reverse order.\n\n        The two pointers method does not necessarily simulate the optimal partition because the optimal partition might have a gap in the middle.\n\n        Therefore, we must use the prefix-suffix method: \n            We want to find indices i and j such that i<=j and prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then total = i + (n - j) and maximize that.\n\n        For the example [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4]:\n            prefix[0]=0\n            prefix[1]=7\n            prefix[2]=10\n            prefix[3]=30\n            prefix[4]=35\n            prefix[5]=50\n            prefix[6]=51\n            prefix[7]=62\n            prefix[8]=70\n            prefix[9]=80\n            prefix[10]=82\n            prefix[11]=86\n\n            suffix[0]=86\n            suffix[1]=79\n            suffix[2]=76\n            suffix[3]=56\n            suffix[4]=51\n            suffix[5]=36\n            suffix[6]=35\n            suffix[7]=24\n            suffix[8]=16\n            suffix[9]=6\n            suffix[10]=4\n            suffix[11]=0\n\n            We are looking for i and j (i<=j) such that prefix[i] = suffix[j].\n            We see:\n                i=0, j=11: 0==0 -> total=0+ (11-11)=0.\n                i=3, prefix[3]=30 -> is there a j>=3 with suffix[j]=30? -> no.\n                i=4, prefix[4]=35 -> suffix[6]=35 -> j=6>=4 -> total=4+(11-6)=4+5=9.\n                i=6, prefix[6]=51 -> suffix[4]=51 -> but j=4 < i=6 -> not allowed.\n\n            So the maximum is 9.\n\n        Therefore, the example's intended answer for the fourth test case might be 9, not 7.\n\n        But the problem note says: \"For the fourth test case, ... the answer is 7\".\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the example explanation. \n\n        Given the constraints of the problem and the known solution with two pointers that has been accepted in Codeforces for a problem that matches the first three examples, I will output the two pointers method.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing part in the else block is: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        And then after the if a==b, we set ans=cur.\n\n        But note: the variable 'cur' is the total number of candies eaten so far. And we want the maximum number of candies when a==b. We might have multiple equals, and we want the last one (which might be the maximum count) or the maximum count overall? \n\n        In the simulation, we are eating one by one. We update ans every time a==b. Since we want the maximum total candies, we take the last time when a==b with the largest count? \n\n        But it is possible that we have a==b at count=x, and then later at count=y>x, so we should do:\n\n            if a==b:\n                ans = cur   # because cur is the current total candies eaten, and we want the maximum.\n\n        But note: we might have a==b at a smaller cur and then later at a larger cur. So we should take the maximum cur for which a==b.\n\n        However, in the loop, cur is increasing. So the last time we have a==b will be the maximum cur.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do: \n            if a==b:\n                ans = cur\n\n        And after the while loop, we print ans.\n\n        Let me test with [1,2] (example3): \n            n=2, [1,2]\n            l = deque([1,2])\n            a=0, b=0, ans=0, cur=0.\n            while l: \n                cur=1: a>=b (0>=0) -> b = 0+2 = 2, l becomes [1] -> a!=0 and b=2 -> a==b? 0!=2 -> no.\n            while l:\n                cur=2: a=0, b=2 -> a<b -> else: a = 0+1 = 1, l becomes empty -> a==b? 1!=2 -> no.\n            then print ans=0. -> correct.\n\n        Example1: [1,1]\n            cur=1: a>=b -> b=1, l=[1] -> a=0, b=1 -> not equal.\n            cur=2: a=0<1 -> else: a=0+1=1, l=empty -> a==b (1==1) -> ans=2.\n            print 2.\n\n        Example2: [2,3,2,2,3,2] (n=6)\n            We want to get 6.\n            l = deque([2,3,2,2,3,2])\n            a=0,b=0,ans=0,cur=0.\n            cur=1: a<=b (0<=0) -> a>=b is true? -> condition: if a>=b -> b+=2 (from the right) -> b=2, l=[2,3,2,2,3] -> a=0, b=2 -> not equal.\n            cur=2: a=0<2 -> else: a=0+2=2, l=[3,2,2,3] -> a==b (2==2) -> ans=2.\n            cur=3: a=2, b=2 -> a>=b -> b+=3, b=5, l=[3,2,2] -> not equal.\n            cur=4: a=2<5 -> else: a=2+3=5, l=[2,2] -> not equal.\n            cur=5: a=5>=5 -> b=5+2=7, l=[2] -> not equal.\n            cur=6: a=5<7 -> else: a=5+2=7, l=[] -> a==b (7==7) -> ans=6.\n            print 6.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing else block is: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        And we are done.\n\n        But note: the initial condition has a deque. We are popping from the right in the if branch, and from the left in the else branch.\n\n        So the completed program1.py for the while loop is:\n\n            while l:\n                cur+=1\n                if a>=b:\n                    b += l.pop()\n                else:\n                    a += l.popleft()\n                if a==b:\n                    ans = cur\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, note that the variable 'ans' might be 0 if no equality is found, which is what we want.\n\n        But the note example: fourth test case -> we expect 7, but our simulation with the given array [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2,4] yields 9. \n\n        Given the example's claimed answer is 7, and our simulation yields 9, and the prefix-suffix also yields 9, I think the example's explanation for the fourth test case is indeed flawed.\n\n        But the problem's output specification says: for each test case, print the maximum number of candies.\n\n        We trust the algorithm.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the completion is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n        The code is:\n\n            k = 0\n            a = int(input())\n            for x in range(1, a+1):\n                b = int(input())\n                if 1900<= b:\n                    d = 1\n                elif 1600 <= b <= 1899:\n                    d = 2\n                elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif b <= 1399:\n                    d = 4\n                print('Division', d)\n\n        The TODO is for the division 3: rating between 1400 and 1599 inclusive.\n\n        So we should set d=3.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: \"d = 3\"\n\n        But note: the conditions are if-elif, so we don't need an else.\n\n        However, the code has an elif for the next condition. So we simply put:\n\n            elif 1400 <= b <= 1599:\n                d = 3\n\n        But the code already has the condition, so we just need to set d=3.\n\n        Therefore, the missing line is: \"d = 3\"\n\n        But note: the code has a variable k that is not used. We can ignore it.\n\n        So the output in JSON is:\n            {\"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\", \"program2\": \"d = 3\"}\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py the missing code is only the else block, which is one line.\n\n        But wait, in program1.py, the else block is only one line: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n        But in the provided code, the else block is:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we replace the TODO line with \"a += l.popleft()\", and that's it.\n\n        Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is in the elif block, and we replace it with \"d = 3\".\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n                \"program2\": \"d = 3\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We output only the string for the missing part for each program.\n\n        However, for program1.py, the missing part is only the one line in the else block.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing part is only the one line in the elif block.\n\n        We output exactly those lines.\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the line is exactly \"d = 3\", and in program1.py, the line is \"a += l.popleft()\".\n\n        However, in program1.py, the line is indented. But the problem does not specify to output the indentation. Since the surrounding code is indented, we assume the line should be indented. But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code exactly as it would appear in the program, including the indentation? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code\", and in the context, the missing code in program1.py is inside the else block, so it should be indented by 8 spaces (because the else: is indented by 4, and then the code inside is 8). \n\n        But the example output format is a string. We should output the string with the necessary indentation? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. But to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program, including the indentation.\n\n        For program1.py, the else block currently has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO line with \"a += l.popleft()\", so the block becomes:\n\n            else:\n                a += l.popleft()\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the line \"a += l.popleft()\", and it should be at the same indentation as the comment, which is 8 spaces.\n\n        But the problem does not specify whether to include the indentation. Since the instruction says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line of code (without the else: and without the surrounding structure), we output only the line \"a += l.popleft()\" without the indentation? \n\n        However, the example output for program1 in the JSON is a string that is exactly \"a += l.popleft()\", and for program2 is \"d = 3\".\n\n        The grading will insert that string in the TODO spot, and it will be indented by the existing structure.\n\n        Therefore, we output without extra indentation.\n\n        So the answer is as above.\n\n        Let me double-check the program2.py: the condition for division 3 is 1400<=b<=1599, and we set d=3.\n\n        The example: \n            rating=1400 -> division 3.\n            rating=1599 -> division 3.\n            rating=1399 -> division 4.\n            rating=1600 -> division 2.\n            rating=1899 -> division 2.\n            rating=1900 -> division 1.\n\n        This matches the problem description.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
