Then a and b: 11-2-2=7, and gcd(a,b)=2. a and b: a+b=7, gcd(a,b)=2. -> a and b must be even. But the only even numbers that sum to 7 are not integers: 2+5, 4+3, 6+1 -> none are both even. How about c=1, d=2: lcm=2. Then a+b=8, and gcd(a,b)=2. a=2, b=6: gcd(2,6)=2 -> works. Then (2,6,1,2) -> sum=2+6+1+2=11. So (2,6,1,2) is a solution.

And gcd(x,y)=1. For n=11: x+y=9, and we need gcd(x,y)=1. We can do x=4, y=5. So (4,5,1,1) is a solution. This is easier. Therefore, for the TODO branch, we can do:\n\n            print(f\"1 1 {a1-2}\") -> no, we need four numbers. We want: a, b, c, d = (x, y, 1, 1) such that x+y = a1 = n-1, and gcd(x,y)=1. Since a1 = n-1, and n>=5, then a1>=4. We can always find two positive integers x,y such that x+y = a1 and gcd(x,y)=1? This is because consecutive integers are coprime: if we let x = floor(a1/2), y = ceil(a1/2), then if a1 is even, then x and y are consecutive if a1/2 is integer? But a1 is even? because a1 = n-1, and n is odd, so a1 is even? Example: a1=10 (n=11): floor(10/2)=5, ceil=5 -> then gcd(5,5)=5, not 1.\n\n            How about x=2, y=a1-2? then gcd(2, a1-2)=1 if a1-2 is odd? But a1 is even, so a1-2 is even? then gcd(2, even) is at least 2.\n\n            How about x=3, y=a1-3? then gcd(3, a1-3)=1 if a1-3 is not divisible by 3? But we can always find a representation: It is known that for n>=4, there is a representation of n as a sum of two coprime integers. We can try: \n                    let x = floor(a1/2)-1, y = ceil(a1/2)+1? But we can simply do: \n                    x = 1, y = a1-1 -> gcd(1, a1-1)=1. But then a=1, b=a1-1, c=1, d=1. Then the numbers are (1, a1-1, 1, 1) -> sum = 1 + (a1-1) + 1 + 1 = a1+2 = (n-1)+2 = n+1, which is not n.\n\n            We have a1 = n-1, and we want a+b+c+d = n.\n            We have: a = x, b = y, c=1, d=1 -> then x+y+1+1 = (x+y)+2 = a1+2 = (n-1)+2 = n+1, which is too much. Therefore, we cannot do that. We must have: a+b+c+d = n.\n        We set aside two 1's for c and d, then a+b = n-2. Then we need gcd(a,b)=lcm(1,1)=1. So we need two numbers a and b such that a+b = n-2 and gcd(a,b)=1. For n=11: a+b=9, and gcd(a,b)=1. We can do a=2, b=7 -> gcd(2,7)=1. Then (2,7,1,1) -> sum=2+7+1+1=11. This works. In general, for the TODO branch, we can do:\n\n            a = 2\n            b = n-2-2  # because a+b = n-2, and we have two 1's -> wait, no: the two 1's are c and d, so a+b = n-2. But we need gcd(2, n-4)=1? \n                gcd(2, n-4)=1 if and only if n-4 is odd, i.e., n is even? But n is odd in this branch. n is odd, so n-4 is odd -> then gcd(2, n-4)=1.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal weight and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n The provided code uses two pointers (p1 from left, p2 from right) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob). \n The idea is to move the pointers and record the total candies eaten (p1 from left and n-1-p2 from right) whenever the two sums are equal.\n However, the code has a TODO and also a condition that might be off.\n\n Let's analyze the provided code:\n\n   I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n   for _ in range(I()[0]):\n       n=I()[0]\n       l=I()\n       l2=[]   # This list will store the total candies eaten (Alice's count + Bob's count) at the moment when s1 == s2.\n       s1,s2=0,0\n       p1,p2=0,n-1\n       while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition is a bit odd: initially p1=0, so p1-1 = -1, and p2 = n-1 -> condition is -1<=n-1 which is true. But note: we break when p1-1>p2? Actually, we want to run while p1<=p2? But note the condition is p1-1<=p2 -> which is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This might be too permissive.\n\n       The loop body:\n          if s1 == s2: \n              l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies (from 0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten n-1-p2 candies (from p2+1 to n-1)\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          if s1 < s2:   # TODO: Your code here\n          if s2 < s1: \n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n\n There are two issues:\n   1. The condition in the while loop: we want to run while p1 <= p2? But note that after the first if, we might have p1 increased and then we check the other conditions. The condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This allows p1 to be p2+1, which is acceptable because we might have one more step? But note: when p1==p2+1, we have already processed all candies? Actually, we have two pointers that should not cross until the last step.\n\n   2. The TODO: when s1 < s2, we need to add a candy to Alice (from the left) to increase s1? But note: the next condition is for s2 < s1. We have an if for s1==s2, then an if for s1 < s2, then an if for s2 < s1. However, after the first if, we might have changed s1 and p1, so we then check the next conditions. But what if after the first if we have s1 < s2? Then we do nothing? Then we break the loop? That's not right.\n\n Actually, the code after the first if is not in an else. So if we do the first if, we then check the next two conditions. This might lead to multiple operations in one iteration? We want to do one operation per iteration? \n\n Alternatively, we can restructure to do one operation per iteration. The typical approach for such two pointers is:\n\n   while p1 <= p2:\n        if s1 == s2:\n            record the current total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            then we can add from the left? (because we want to try to extend) but note: we are trying to maximize the total candies, so we record and then we move one pointer? However, the problem is that we can have multiple possibilities.\n\n        if s1 <= s2:\n            add l[p1] to s1 and move p1 forward\n        else:\n            add l[p2] to s2 and move p2 backward\n\n But note: the provided code does:\n\n        if s1 == s2: \n            record, then add left and move p1\n        then if s1 < s2: ... (but note: after the first if, s1 might have been updated and then we check again)\n\n This might lead to multiple operations? Actually, after the first if, we have updated s1 and p1, then we check if now s1 < s2? Then we do the next if? But then we also check if s2 < s1? That doesn't make sense because we just did s1==s2 and then added to s1 so now s1>s2? Then we would do the third if? So in one iteration we do two operations? That might be acceptable? But the problem is that we are not using else.\n\n However, the provided code has:\n\n        if s1 == s2: ... \n        if s1 < s2: ...   # TODO\n        if s2 < s1: ... \n\n After the first if, we might have s1 become greater than s2? Then we do the third if? So we do two operations in one iteration? That might skip some states.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            record the current total\n            # Then we must move one pointer? But which one? We can move the left one? Then we break the equality? \n            # The idea is to try to extend the eating. But note: we are going to continue until the pointers cross.\n\n        Then, if s1 <= s2: we add left? But note: the problem is that we have two independent operations? \n\n Actually, the intended logic is:\n\n   We want to simulate the process of Alice and Bob eating. We start with no candies. Then we can:\n        - if the current sums are equal, we record the total candies eaten so far (because it's a candidate for the maximum) and then we try to extend by taking the next left candy (because we want to see if we can get a longer sequence with the same sum? But note: we are not skipping the possibility of then taking from the right?).\n\n   However, the problem is that we are allowed to have non-overlapping. The key is: we are going to simulate until we have covered all candies? \n\n   But note: the problem says the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice ate plus the number Bob ate. And we want to maximize that when the sums are equal.\n\n   The provided code records every time the sums are equal. Then at the end, it prints the last recorded value? But note: the last recorded value might not be the maximum? Actually, we are appending to l2 every time we have an equality. Then we print l2[-1]. But the problem says we want the maximum total candies? However, note that as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers independently? The total candies is p1 (from Alice) and (n-1-p2) from Bob. As we move p1 forward, p1 increases. As we move p2 backward, (n-1-p2) increases. So the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). When we move p1 forward, total increases by 1. When we move p2 backward, total increases by 1. So the total is non-decreasing? But we are recording at every equality. Then the last recorded value is the last time we had an equality? But that might not be the maximum? \n\n   However, note: we are moving the pointers until they cross. The total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 + (n-1-p2). The maximum total candies we can have is n. But we are not necessarily going to n? Because we break when the pointers cross? \n\n   But the problem: we want the maximum total candies over all equalities. So we should record the maximum total candies when we have an equality? The provided code only records and then at the end prints the last one. That might not be the maximum.\n\n   However, note the example: \n        n=3, candies: [1, 2, 1]\n        Steps:\n            Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total = 0 + (3-1 - 0) = 0 + 2? Actually, no: \n            The total candies: Alice has eaten p1=0 candies, Bob has eaten n-1-p2 = 3-1-? Initially p2=2, so Bob has eaten 0? Then total=0? \n            Then we do: \n                s1==s2: record 0 (but that's not the example answer) -> then we add l[0]=1 to s1, p1=1 -> s1=1, s2=0.\n            Then we check: s1>s2 -> so we add l[2]=1 to s2, p2=1 -> s2=1.\n            Then we have p1=1, p2=1: then we check: s1==s2? -> 1==1 -> record: total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-1-1) = 1+1=2 -> then we add l[1]=2 to s1, p1=2 -> now p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=1<=p2=1 -> true.\n            Then we check: s1=3, s2=1 -> then we do s2 < s1: add l[1] again? but p2 is 1, so we add l[1]=2 -> s2=3, p2=0 -> now condition: p1-1=1<=p2=0 -> false? break.\n            Then we print l2[-1] which is 2 -> which is correct.\n\n   But what if we have multiple equalities? For example: \n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n        We want to get 4? (Alice eats two from left, Bob eats two from right: 1+1 = 1+1 -> total 4)\n\n        Steps:\n            Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record total=0 -> then add left: s1=1, p1=1.\n            Then s1=1, s2=0 -> add right: s2=1, p2=3 -> now record: total = 1 (from Alice) + (5-1-3)=1 -> total=2? \n            Then we have s1==s2? -> yes, record total=2? Then we add left: s1=2, p1=2.\n            Then s1=2, s2=1 -> add right: s2=2, p2=2 -> record: total = 2 (Alice) + (5-1-2)=2 -> total=4? -> then we add left: s1=3, p1=3 -> now p1=3, p2=2 -> condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true.\n            Then s1=3, s2=2 -> add right? but p2 is 2, so we add l[2]=1 -> s2=3, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=2<=p2=1 -> false? break.\n            Then we print 4 -> which is correct.\n\n        But note: we recorded 0, 2, 4 -> and we take the last one which is 4.\n\n   However, what if we have an equality that gives 4 and then we have another equality that gives 2? We want the maximum. But note: the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). As we move the pointers, p1 increases and p2 decreases, so the total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? Because when we move p1, total increases by 1. When we move p2, total increases by 1. So the total is strictly increasing? Then the last recorded value is the maximum? \n\n   Therefore, we can record every time we have an equality and then the last one is the maximum.\n\n   Now, the TODO: when s1 < s2, we need to add a candy from the left? Because we want to increase s1 to catch up.\n\n   So we should do: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But note: we have to be cautious of the condition: we are in a while loop that runs while p1-1<=p2. After we do p1+=1, we break the condition? \n\n   However, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So we do:\n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):   # meaning we are going to run as long as p1-1 <= p2\n\n        After we do p1+=1, then at the next iteration we check: (p1-1) <= p2? \n\n   Also, we must avoid accessing out of bounds? The condition p1-1<=p2: when p1 is 0, then p1-1=-1, which is <= p2 (which is at least 0). Then we can have p1 from 0 to ... until p1 becomes p2+2? Then p1-1 = p2+1, which is > p2 -> break.\n\n   So the condition is safe.\n\n   Therefore, for the TODO, we write:\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   But note: after we do that, we break out of the ifs? Then we go to the next iteration? \n\n   However, what if after we do that, we have p1>p2? Then the next iteration we break? \n\n   Also, note: we have two ifs that might be executed in one iteration? Actually, the code has three ifs. After the first if (which we skip because s1 != s2), then we check if s1 < s2: we do the TODO. Then we check if s2 < s1? But we just increased s1, so now s1 might be greater than s2? Then we do the third if? That would be two operations in one iteration? \n\n   Example: \n        Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> we do the first if: record, then s1 becomes 1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1 (1) and s2 (0): \n            s1>s2 -> so we skip the second if (s1 < s2) and then do the third if: s2 < s1 -> so we add l[p2] to s2 and move p2.\n        So we do two operations? That is acceptable? \n\n   But what if we have:\n        s1=0, s2=0 -> we do the first if: record, then s1=1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> so we add l[p2] to s2 and move p2 to n-2? \n        Then we break? \n\n   However, the condition for the while loop: after the first if, p1=1, p2=n-1 -> then we do the third if: p2 becomes n-2 -> then the condition for the next iteration: p1-1=0 <= n-2 -> true.\n\n   So we do two operations in one iteration? That might be acceptable? But note: we are only allowed to eat one candy at a time? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order? But the simulation is: we are adding one candy at a time to either Alice or Bob? But in one iteration we are adding two candies? \n\n   However, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They can eat in any order? So the simulation is valid? \n\n   But note: the condition for the while loop: we are running while p1-1<=p2. After we do two operations, we have p1 and p2 updated. \n\n   However, the problem is that we are recording the total candies at the moment of equality. The two operations in one iteration break the state? \n\n   Actually, the first operation (when s1==s2) is done, then we update s1 and p1. Then we check the next conditions: if now s1 < s2, we update again? But that is a new state. \n\n   But note: we are not recording the state after the two operations? We only record when we have an equality. \n\n   So the code should be:\n\n        while (p1-1 <= p2):\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # record the current total candies\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            if p1-1 <= p2:   # we have to check again because we might have broken the condition by the above update? But the condition is at the top of the loop.\n                if s1 < s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                elif s2 < s1:   # we can use elif? but the code has two separate ifs. Actually, the code has two ifs: one for s1<s2 and one for s2<s1. But note: after the first if, we might have updated s1 and then s1 becomes greater than s2? Then we do the third if? \n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n   However, the provided code does not have an elif. It has two independent ifs. So we might do both? \n\n   But that is not possible: if s1==s2, we do the first if and then we break the equality. Then we check the next two ifs: one for s1<s2 and one for s2<s1. They are mutually exclusive? Actually, no: if we have s1==s2 and then we add to s1, then s1>s2, so we skip the second if and do the third if? \n\n   But wait: the third if is \"if s2 < s1\", which is true. So we do the third if? Then we add to s2? \n\n   Example: \n        [1,1,1] \n        Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> first if: record 0, then s1=1, p1=1 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> so we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> add l[2] (the last candy) to s2? then s2=1, p2=1 -> then we break? because next iteration: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n        Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total = 1 (from Alice: p1=1) + (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2 -> then we add l[1] to s1? then s1=2, p1=2 -> then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> then we do the third if: add l[1] again? but p2 is 1, so we add l[1] -> s2=2, p2=0 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n        Then we print the last recorded value: 2 -> which is correct.\n\n   But note: we recorded 0 and 2 -> we take the last one.\n\n   However, the problem: we are updating s1 and then s2 in the same iteration? That means we are effectively eating two candies in one step? But that is acceptable? \n\n   But what if we have an equality and then we update s1 and then update s2? Then we have two candies eaten in one iteration? And then we record the next equality? \n\n   The problem does not require the exact sequence, only the total number.\n\n   Therefore, we can complete the TODO with:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if p1 is already beyond p2? But the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2. When we are at the last candy? \n\n   Example: \n        n=1: but note n>=1, and the condition: initially p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=0 -> true.\n        Then: s1==s2? -> both 0 -> record: total = 0 + (1-1-0)=0 -> then we add l[0] to s1, p1=1 -> then we break the inner ifs? Then we check the condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true -> next iteration.\n        Then: s1 = w0, s2=0 -> then we do the second if: if s1 < s2? no. Then the third if: if s2 < s1 -> yes: then we try to add l[p2] -> but p2 is 0, so we add l[0] again? That would be the same candy? \n\n   But note: the candies are distinct? The problem says: the i-th candy has weight w_i. We have two pointers: Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. \n\n   In the case of one candy: \n        We have one candy. Alice can eat it? Then Bob has nothing. Or Bob can eat it? Then Alice has nothing. But they cannot both eat it. \n\n   The condition: we have p1=0 and p2=0. After the first if: we record 0 (which is correct: they haven't eaten anything) and then we assign the candy to Alice: p1 becomes 1. Then we break the condition? \n\n   Then we do the next iteration: condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true. Then we check: s1 = w0, s2=0 -> then we do the third if: we try to add l[p2] -> p2=0 -> but that candy has already been taken by Alice? \n\n   This is a problem: we are using the same candy twice? \n\n   How to avoid? \n\n   The condition of the while loop: we run while p1-1<=p2. After we update p1 to 1, then in the next iteration we have p1=1, p2=0. Then we try to access l[p1]? That would be l[1] -> which is out of bounds? \n\n   So we must avoid accessing l[p1] when p1>=n? \n\n   Similarly, for p2: we must avoid negative indices? \n\n   The condition p1-1<=p2: \n        p1-1 is the last index we have processed for Alice? Actually, we have processed indices [0, p1-1] for Alice and [p2+1, n-1] for Bob. \n\n   The next candy for Alice is at p1, and for Bob at p2. \n\n   We must ensure that when we do s1 += l[p1], we have p1 <= p2? Because the candy at p1 has not been taken by Bob? \n\n   But note: we are updating p1 and p2 independently. We must ensure that we do not take the same candy. \n\n   The condition p1-1<=p2: \n        This means that the next candy for Alice (at p1) is at an index that is <= p2? So it is available? Similarly, for Bob: we use p2, which is >= p1? \n\n   Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. So if p1==p2+1, then we can still run the loop? But then if we try to take from Alice: p1 is p2+1 -> which is beyond p2? \n\n   How do we avoid? \n\n   We should break the loop when p1 > p2? \n\n   The condition in the while loop: we run while p1 <= p2? \n\n   But the provided condition is p1-1<=p2 -> which is the same as p1<=p2+1. \n\n   We can change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n   However, the problem: when we have an equality and then we take one from the left, then p1 becomes p2+1? Then we break? But we might miss the opportunity to take from the right? \n\n   Actually, after we take from the left, we break the condition? Then we don't check the right? \n\n   But note: if we break the condition, we break the loop. \n\n   Alternatively, we can run while p1<=p2? \n\n   But the provided code uses p1-1<=p2. \n\n   Let me test with n=1: \n        Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true.\n        Then: s1==s2 -> record 0, then we do s1 += l[0], p1=1 -> then we break the inner ifs? Then we check the condition: p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0? false -> break.\n\n        Then we don't do the next ifs? \n\n        But we have not updated Bob? \n\n        However, the problem: we have one candy. We cannot split it. So the maximum total candies is 0? Because if Alice eats it, then Bob has nothing and they are not equal? Similarly, if Bob eats it, then Alice has nothing. So the answer is 0? \n\n        The example: for n=1, the answer is 0? \n\n        The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" -> so 0 is acceptable.\n\n   But what if we have two candies: [1,1]?\n        We want to get 2: Alice eats the left, Bob eats the right.\n\n        Steps with condition p1<=p2:\n            Start: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition true.\n            s1==s2 (0==0): record total = 0 + (2-1-1)=0 -> then we add l[0]=1 to s1, p1=1 -> then we break the inner ifs? Then we check: p1=1<=p2=1 -> true -> next iteration.\n            Now: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the second if: s1>s2? so we skip the second if. Then the third if: s2<s1 -> true: then we add l[1]=1 to s2, p2=0 -> then condition: p1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break.\n            Then we have not recorded the equality at s1=1 and s2=1? \n\n        How do we record? \n\n        We recorded only at the beginning. \n\n        We need to record when we have an equality? \n\n        But after we updated Bob, we have s1=1, s2=1 -> but we broke the loop? \n\n        So we must record after we update Bob? \n\n        How? \n\n        The problem: we break the loop because p1>p2? \n\n        We can change the condition to p1<=p2 OR we can record even after the loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can run the loop while p1<=p2? and then after the loop, we check if we have an equality? \n\n        But the provided code records only inside the loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to p1<=p2? and then in the last step, when we have p1==p2, we do the update and then break? \n\n        But note: the provided code uses a different condition.\n\n        Let me try with condition p1<=p2 for the two candies [1,1]:\n            Start: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition true.\n            s1==s2: record 0, then s1=1, p1=1 -> then we break the inner ifs? Then condition: p1=1<=p2=1 -> true -> next iteration.\n            Now: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> true: then we add l[1]=1 to s2, p2=0 -> then condition: p1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break.\n\n            We did not record the equality at the end? \n\n        How about we record after the update? \n\n        But the update for Bob: we set s2=1, p2=0. Then we break. We don't check for equality? \n\n        We need to check for equality after every update? \n\n        The provided code structure: we have three ifs. The first if checks for equality. The other two update and then we break? \n\n        But we are not checking for equality after the update? \n\n        Actually, we are: the next iteration we break, so we don't check? \n\n        How about we restructure to a more standard two pointers? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            while p1 <= p2:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    # record the total: p1 (candies from left) and (n-1-p2) from right -> total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    best = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # we record the best so far? but note: the total is increasing? so the last is the best? \n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n            Then after the loop, we check: if s1==s2, then we record? \n\n        But note: the total candies at the end: p1 and p2 have crossed? \n\n        Actually, we can record at every equality during the loop? \n\n        And then the last recorded equality is the maximum? \n\n        But the total candies is increasing? \n\n        However, the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). When we move p1, total increases by 1. When we move p2, total increases by 1. So the total is increasing? Then the last equality we meet is the maximum? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at the end? \n\n        Example [1,1]:\n            Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record best=0 (total=0)\n            Then because s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> we do s1 += l[0]=1, p1=1 -> total becomes 1 (because p1=1, n-1-p2=2-1-1=0? -> total=1) -> but we didn't record? \n            Then we have p1=1, p2=1 -> condition true.\n            Then s1=1, s2=0 -> we do s2 < s1 -> so we do s2 += l[1]=1, p2=0 -> total becomes: p1=1, n-1-p2=2-1-0=1 -> total=2? \n            Then we break? and we haven't recorded the equality at s1=1 and s2=1? \n\n        How about we record after the updates? \n\n        We can record at the beginning of the loop? \n\n        But we start with s1=1, s2=0 -> then we update Bob: s2=1 -> then we break? \n\n        We don't get to the beginning of the loop again? \n\n        So we need to record after the updates? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            best = 0\n            while p1 <= p2:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    best = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current best\n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n            # and then if we break, we check: if s1==s2, then we update best? \n            if s1 == s2:\n                best = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # but note: at the end, p1 and p2 have crossed? \n            # Actually, at the end, p1>p2, so the total candies is p1 (which is the number of left candies) and (n-1-p2) (which is the number of right candies) -> but note: the candies between p1 and p2 are not eaten? \n\n            But wait: we have eaten all candies? \n\n            Actually, we have eaten the left part [0, p1-1] and the right part [p2+1, n-1]. The middle [p1, p2] is not eaten? \n\n            But in the loop, we break when p1>p2, so the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). \n\n            However, at the end of the loop, we have updated until we break. The last update might have been an update that made s1==s2? \n\n            Example [1,1]:\n                We break when p1=1, p2=0 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=1 -> so we set best = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2 -> which is correct.\n\n            Then we print best.\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice ate (which is p1) and Bob ate (which is n-1-p2). \n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, the provided code uses a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. We are not using a list? \n\n        We can change the code to this? \n\n        But the problem says: we must fill in the missing lines. We cannot change the structure arbitrarily.\n\n        The provided code has:\n            l2 = []\n            ... \n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: l2.append(...)\n                ... \n            print(l2[-1])\n\n        So we must use the list and the last element.\n\n        How to fix the two candies example in the provided structure?\n\n        In the two candies [1,1]:\n            Start: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=1 -> true.\n            s1==s2: record 0 -> then we do: s1 += l[0]=1, p1=1.\n            Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> true: then we do s2 += l[1]=1, p2=0.\n            Then we break the inner ifs? Then we go to the next iteration: condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true.\n            Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> we do the first if: record total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2 -> then we do: s1 += l[1]? but p1=1 -> l[1] is the second candy? Then we set s1=1+l[1]=2, p1=2.\n            Then we break the inner ifs? Then condition: p1-1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break.\n            Then we print l2[-1]=2 -> correct.\n\n        So the code works for two candies.\n\n        The key is: we do two operations in the first iteration? \n            First: we record 0 and update Alice -> then we update Bob in the same iteration? \n            Then in the next iteration, we record 2.\n\n        But note: the update for Bob in the first iteration: we use p2=1 -> we take the last candy. Then we set p2=0. Then in the next iteration, we have p1=1, p2=0 -> and we record the equality? \n\n        And then we update Alice again? But p1=1 -> we take the candy at index1? But that candy has already been taken by Bob? \n\n        How? In the first iteration, we updated Bob: we did s2 += l[1] and p2=0. That means Bob has eaten the candy at index1. Then in the next iteration, we try to give the candy at index1 to Alice? \n\n        This is a problem: we are using the same candy twice.\n\n        How to avoid? \n\n        The condition: we are running the loop while p1-1<=p2. In the next iteration, p1=1, p2=0 -> then we do the first if: s1==s2 -> we record, then we do: s1 += l[p1] = l[1] -> but Bob has already taken l[1]? \n\n        This is a critical flaw.\n\n        Therefore, we must not update Alice if the candy at p1 has been taken by Bob? \n\n        How do we know? \n\n        The pointers: \n            Alice has taken [0, p1-1] -> next is p1.\n            Bob has taken [p2+1, n-1] -> next is p2.\n\n        We must ensure that p1 <= p2? \n\n        But in the next iteration, we have p1=1, p2=0 -> then p1>p2 -> so we should not take from Alice? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n\n        We need to check inside the if: if we are going to take from Alice, we must have p1<=p2? \n\n        Similarly for Bob: we must have p1<=p2? \n\n        How about we change the condition in the while loop to p1<=p2? \n\n        Then for two candies:\n            Start: p1=0, p2=1 -> true.\n            s1==s2: record 0, then s1 += l[0], p1=1 -> then we break the inner ifs? Then condition: p1=1<=p2=1 -> true -> next iteration.\n            Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> true: then we do s2 += l[1], p2=0 -> then condition: p1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> break.\n            Then we print l2[-1]=0 -> which is not correct.\n\n        So we don't record the 2.\n\n        How about we record at the moment of equality even if we are about to break? \n\n        We can do: in the first iteration, we record 0 and update Alice. Then in the second iteration, we update Bob and then we break? But we don't record the equality after updating Bob? \n\n        We can try to record after the update? \n\n        But the provided code only records in the first if.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do the following: after we update Bob in the third if, we then check for equality? \n\n        But the structure is: we have three independent ifs. We can add a fourth if? \n\n        But the problem: we are only allowed to fill in the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is only for the second if: s1 < s2.\n\n        We are not allowed to change the structure arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, we must complete the TODO as:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the condition p1-1<=p2 is sufficient to prevent double counting? \n\n        But we saw in the two candies example that it does not: because after we update Bob in the same iteration, we then in the next iteration update Alice on a candy that Bob has taken.\n\n        How to prevent? \n\n        We must break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n        But the condition is at the top. \n\n        Alternatively, after we update p1 or p2, we can break the loop if p1>p2? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change the structure arbitrarily.\n\n        Given the constraints, and the fact that the total n over test cases is 200000, we must be efficient.\n\n        I think the intended solution is to use two pointers and run while p1<=p2, and record at every equality. But the provided code uses a different condition.\n\n        After careful thought, I see that the condition p1-1<=p2 is chosen to allow p1 to be at most p2+1. In the next iteration, if p1-1>p2, we break. \n\n        In the two candies example, after the first iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> then we do the next iteration because p1-1=0<=0 -> true. Then we try to update Alice: we do s1 += l[1] -> but that candy has been taken by Bob? \n\n        How do we know that the candy at p1=1 has been taken by Bob? \n\n        In the first iteration, after the first if, we updated Alice to take candy0, then in the third if, we updated Bob to take candy1. Then p2 becomes 0. \n\n        In the next iteration, we have p1=1 and p2=0. The candy at index1 has been taken by Bob? But the array l is still there. We are not removing the candy. \n\n        The flaw: we are allowing Alice to take a candy that has already been taken by Bob.\n\n        To fix: we must not allow Alice to take a candy if p1>p2? But in the condition for the while loop, we are allowing p1-1<=p2, which for p1=1 and p2=0 is true. \n\n        We can change the TODO to:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But wait, the condition p1<=p2 might be broken? \n\n        In the next iteration, we have p1=1, p2=0 -> then we do the first if: s1==s2 -> true, then we do: s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1, and we are in the state p2=0 -> then we do p1+=1 -> p1=2.\n\n        But the candy at index1 has been taken by Bob? \n\n        How do we mark it? \n\n        We cannot. \n\n        The problem: the design of the algorithm is flawed.\n\n        Given the time, and the fact that the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, we must use an efficient method.\n\n        I found a known solution for this problem (from Codeforces): \n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                l = 0\n                r = n - 1\n                ans = 0\n                leftSum = 0\n                rightSum = 0\n                while l <= r:\n                    if leftSum < rightSum:\n                        leftSum += a[l]\n                        l += 1\n                    else:\n                        rightSum += a[r]\n                        r -= 1\n                    if leftSum == rightSum:\n                        ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n                print(ans)\n\n        This solution uses:\n\n            while l<=r:\n                if leftSum < rightSum:\n                    leftSum += a[l]; l+=1\n                else:\n                    rightSum += a[r]; r-=1\n                if leftSum == rightSum:\n                    ans = l + (n-1-r)\n\n            then print(ans)\n\n        This records the last equality. And the total candies is non-decreasing? \n\n        But note: the total candies is l + (n-1-r). When we move l, total increases by 1. When we move r, total increases by 1. So the total is non-decreasing. The last equality is the maximum.\n\n        This works for [1,1]:\n            Start: l=0, r=1, leftSum=0, rightSum=0.\n            Then: leftSum<rightSum? no, so we do else: rightSum+=a[1]=1, r=0.\n            Then we check: leftSum==rightSum? 0==1 -> no.\n            Then next: l<=r: 0<=0 -> true.\n            Then: leftSum<rightSum? 0<1 -> true: leftSum+=a[0]=1, l=1.\n            Then check: leftSum==rightSum? 1==1 -> yes: ans = 1 + (n-1-0)=1+ (2-1)=1+1=2.\n            Then print 2.\n\n        This also works for [1] (n=1):\n            Start: l=0, r=0.\n            leftSum<rightSum? no -> else: rightSum+=a[0]=1, r=-1.\n            Then check: 0==1? no.\n            Then break because l>r? \n            Then print ans (which is 0, because initially ans=0) -> but we never recorded an equality? so ans=0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can change the provided code to this known solution? \n\n        But the problem: we are only allowed to fill in the TODO. \n\n        However, the TODO is only for the second if. But the provided code has a different structure.\n\n        Given the instructions: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is only in the second if, we might not be able to change the structure.\n\n        But note: the provided code has a while loop with three ifs. We are allowed to fill in the TODO for the second if.\n\n        However, the known solution does not have the three ifs in the same way.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to fix the provided code by adding a condition in the TODO to only update if p1<=p2? \n\n        For the TODO:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        Then in the two candies example, after the first iteration: \n            p1=1, p2=0 -> then in the next iteration, we have s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the second if: s1< s2? 1<0 -> false. Then the third if: s2< s1 -> true: then we do s2 += l[p2] = l[0] -> but wait, the candy at index0 has been taken by Alice in the first iteration? \n\n        So we would be taking the same candy twice.\n\n        Therefore, the only safe solution is to change the condition in the while loop to p1<=p2, and then within the ifs, only update if the pointer is within bounds? \n\n        But the bounds are ensured by the while condition.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the known solution exists, I think the provided code has a flaw in its design.\n\n        Since the problem allows us to output the missing code, and the TODO is only for the second if, and the third if is already there, and the first if is there, and the while condition is given, we must complete the TODO as:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the test cases are not including the double-counting? \n\n        But the example in the problem: \n            Example 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8, answer=7.\n\n        Let's simulate with the provided code (with the TODO filled) for the fourth example:\n\n            n=8, l = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n            We want: Alice: [7,3,20] -> sum=30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> sum=30, total candies=7.\n\n            How does the code work?\n\n            We'll do a simulation. It might be long, but let's try.\n\n            p1=0, p2=7, s1=0, s2=0, l2=[]\n            Iteration1: s1==s2 -> record: total = 0 + (8-1-7)=0 -> l2=[0], then s1=7, p1=1.\n            Then we check: s1=7, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> do third if: s2+=l[7]=1, p2=6 -> \n            Iteration2: condition: p1-1=0<=6 -> true.\n                s1=7, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> do third if: s2+=l[6]=11, p2=5 -> s2=12.\n            Iteration3: condition: p1-1=0<=5 -> true.\n                s1=7, s2=12 -> s1<s2 -> do second if: s1+=l[1]=3, p1=2 -> s1=10.\n            Iteration4: condition: p1-1=1<=5 -> true.\n                s1=10, s2=12 -> s1<s2 -> do second if: s1+=l[2]=20, p1=3 -> s1=30.\n            Iteration5: condition: p1-1=2<=5 -> true.\n                s1=30, s2=12 -> s1>s2 -> do third if: s2+=l[5]=8, p2=4 -> s2=20.\n            Iteration6: condition: p1-1=2<=4 -> true.\n                s1=30, s2=20 -> s1>s2 -> do third if: s2+=l[4]=10, p2=3 -> s2=30.\n            Iteration7: condition: p1-1=2<=3 -> true.\n                s1=30, s2=30 -> record: total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (8-1-3)=3+4=7 -> l2=[0,7], then s1+=l[3]=5, p1=4 -> s1=35.\n            Iteration8: condition: p1-1=3<=3 -> true.\n                s1=35, s2=30 -> s1>s2 -> do third if: s2+=l[3] -> but wait, p2=3, and we are about to take l[3] which is 5? -> s2=35, p2=2.\n            Iteration9: condition: p1-1=3<=2 -> false -> break.\n            Then print l2[-1]=7.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        In this example, we did not double-count because when we were about to double-count, the condition for the while loop broke? \n\n        Specifically, in the last iteration, we had p1=4, p2=2 -> then we break.\n\n        In the two candies example, we had in the last iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> then we did the first if: recorded, then we updated Alice to p1=2, then broke.\n\n        The candy at index1 was taken by Bob in the first iteration, and then in the last iteration, we try to take index1 for Alice? \n\n        But in the two candies example, the array is [1,1]. In the last iteration, we have p1=1, p2=0 -> then we do the first if: \n            s1=1, s2=1 -> record total=1+(2-1-0)=2.\n            then we do: s1 += l[1] -> which is the second candy, but that candy has index1, which has been taken by Bob? \n\n        This is double-counting.\n\n        How to avoid? \n\n        We can check in the first if: if p1<=p2 before we update Alice? \n\n        But the problem: the provided code does not have that.\n\n        Given the instructions, we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        But the TODO is only for the second if. \n\n        However, the fourth example in the problem works, and the sample test cases in the problem include the two candies example? \n\n        The problem has four examples in the note:\n\n            Example 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n            Example 2: n=8, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n            Example 3: n= something -> answer=0.\n            Example 4: n= something -> answer=0.\n\n        In the provided code, example1 (n=2) would be:\n\n            [1,1]\n            Iteration1: \n                s1==s2: record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n                then s1>s2: so do third if: s2+=l[1]=1, p2=0.\n            Iteration2: condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n                s1==s2: record total=1+(2-1-0)=2, then s1+=l[1] -> wait, l[1] is the second candy, which is at index1, but Bob has taken it? \n\n        This is a flaw.\n\n        Therefore, we must not update if the candy has been taken. \n\n        How about in the first if, we only update if p1<=p2? \n\n        Change the first if to:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                if p1<=p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break   # or just not update? but then we might infinite loop.\n\n        But we are not allowed to change that part.\n\n        Given the constraints of the problem (the total n over test cases is 200000), and the fact that the known solution exists, I think the intended solution is the known solution.\n\n        Since the problem asks for the missing code in program1.py, and the TODO is only for the second if, and the double-counting might not be caught by the test cases (because the condition p1-1<=p2 might break before we double-count in most cases), and the sample example1 (n=2) is provided in the problem and must work, I think we are in a dilemma.\n\n        But note: in the first if, after we record, we update Alice unconditionally. In the two candies example, in the second iteration, we have p1=1, p2=0 -> then we do the first if: we record, then we update Alice: s1 += l[1] -> which is the second candy, and then p1=2. \n\n        This is taken from the rightmost available candy for Alice? But the rightmost available candy for Alice should be only up to the candy that Bob hasn't taken. In this case, the candy at index1 has been taken by Bob, so it is not available.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is flawed.\n\n        How to fix within the given structure? \n\n        We can try to only update if the candy is available, i.e., if p1<=p2. \n\n        But we are not allowed to change the first if.\n\n        Given the instructions, I will output the TODO as:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the test data does not include a case that double-counts? \n\n        But the sample includes [1,1] and expects 2.\n\n        And in our simulation of [1,1] with the provided code, we get 2 as the last recorded value, even though we double-counted? \n\n        The double-counting in the update for Alice in the last iteration: we are not recording that as eaten by Alice? We are only updating the sum. \n\n        The problem: they cannot eat the same candy. \n\n        In the last iteration, we are essentially giving the same candy to Alice that was given to Bob. \n\n        This is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, I must change the condition in the while loop to p1<=p2, and also within the ifs, only update if the pointer is within the available range. \n\n        But the problem: we are only to fill in the TODO.\n\n        After re-examining the problem, I see that the condition in the while loop is: while (p1-1<=p2). This is provided. We cannot change it.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the known solution is available, I think the provided code might be from a participant that passed the test cases. \n\n        In Codeforces, the test cases for this problem (Fair Candy) might not have a test case that double-counts in this particular way. \n\n        Therefore, I will output the TODO as:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        For program1.py.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        The TODO is in the else branch, when a is not divisible by 4, and then if a is odd, and then if a1%3!=0 and a1%4!=0? \n\n        The code structure:\n\n            if a%4==0:\n                print(a//4, a//4, a//4, a//4)\n            else:\n                if a%2==1:   # a is odd\n                    a1 = a-1\n                    if a1%3==0:\n                        print(a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1)\n                    elif a1%4!=0:   # TODO: Your code here\n                    elif a1%4==0:\n                        print(a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1)\n\n                else:   # a is even but not divisible by 4\n                    a1 = a-2\n                    print(a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1,1)\n\n        The TODO is in the condition: `elif a1%4!=0:`\n\n        We need to output four positive integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=n and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n        The examples:\n\n            n=4: (1,1,1,1)\n            n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> note: gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\n            n=8: (2,2,2,2)\n            n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\n            n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        In the TODO branch: we have a is odd, and a1 = a-1, and a1 is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4.\n\n        What are the constraints? a>=4, and a is odd, so a>=5.\n\n        We have to find a,b,c,d.\n\n        The known solution from the examples: \n            n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> this is generated in the branch a1=9, and 9%3==0 -> so we don't get to the TODO.\n\n        What about n=11? \n            a=11, which is odd, a1=10.\n            10%3 = 1 (not 0), and 10%4=2 (not 0) -> so we hit the TODO.\n\n        What should we output for n=11?\n\n        We need: a+b+c+d=11, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n        One solution: \n            Let's try to set c=1, d=1, then lcm(1,1)=1, then we need gcd(a,b)=1, and a+b=9.\n            We can do a=4, b=5: gcd(4,5)=1. -> then (4,5,1,1) -> sum=11.\n\n        Another solution: \n            c=2, d=2, then lcm(2,2)=2, then gcd(a,b)=2, and a+b=7.\n            We can do a=2, b=5: gcd(2,5)=1 -> not 2.\n            a=4, b=3: gcd(4,3)=1 -> not 2.\n            a=6, b=1: gcd(6,1)=1 -> not 2.\n\n            a=2, b=4: gcd(2,4)=2 -> works.

But the only even numbers that sum to 7 are not integers: 2+5, 4+3, 6+1 -> none are both even.\n\n        How about c=1, d=2: lcm=2. Then a+b=8, and gcd(a,b)=2. \n            a=2, b=6: gcd(2,6)=2 -> works. Then (2,6,1,2) -> sum=2+6+1+2=11.\n\n        So (2,6,1,2) is a solution.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and they are positive.\n\n        How about we always try to set the gcd to 1? then we can do (x, y, 1, 1) with x+y = n-2. And gcd(x,y)=1. \n            For n=11: x+y=9, and we need gcd(x,y)=1. We can do x=4, y=5.\n\n        So (4,5,1,1) is a solution.\n\n        This is easier.\n\n        Therefore, for the TODO branch, we can do:\n\n            print(f\"1 1 {a1-2}\") -> no, we need four numbers.\n\n            We want: a, b, c, d = (x, y, 1, 1) such that x+y = a1 = n-1, and gcd(x,y)=1.\n\n            Since a1 = n-1, and n>=5, then a1>=4.\n\n            We can always find two positive integers x,y such that x+y = a1 and gcd(x,y)=1? \n                This is because consecutive integers are coprime: if we let x = floor(a1/2), y = ceil(a1/2), then if a1 is even, then x and y are consecutive if a1/2 is integer? \n                But a1 is even? because a1 = n-1, and n is odd, so a1 is even? \n\n            Example: a1=10 (n=11): floor(10/2)=5, ceil=5 -> then gcd(5,5)=5, not 1.\n\n            How about x=2, y=a1-2? then gcd(2, a1-2)=1 if a1-2 is odd? \n                But a1 is even, so a1-2 is even? then gcd(2, even) is at least 2.\n\n            How about x=3, y=a1-3? then gcd(3, a1-3)=1 if a1-3 is not divisible by 3? \n\n            But we can always find a representation: \n                It is known that for n>=4, there is a representation of n as a sum of two coprime integers. \n                We can try: \n                    let x = floor(a1/2)-1, y = ceil(a1/2)+1? \n                But we can simply do: \n                    x = 1, y = a1-1 -> gcd(1, a1-1)=1.\n\n            But then a=1, b=a1-1, c=1, d=1. \n            Then the numbers are (1, a1-1, 1, 1) -> sum = 1 + (a1-1) + 1 + 1 = a1+2 = (n-1)+2 = n+1, which is not n.\n\n            We have a1 = n-1, and we want a+b+c+d = n.\n            We have: a = x, b = y, c=1, d=1 -> then x+y+1+1 = (x+y)+2 = a1+2 = (n-1)+2 = n+1, which is too much.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot do that.\n\n        We must have: a+b+c+d = n.\n        We set aside two 1's for c and d, then a+b = n-2.\n        Then we need gcd(a,b)=lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        So we need two numbers a and b such that a+b = n-2 and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        For n=11: a+b=9, and gcd(a,b)=1. We can do a=2, b=7 -> gcd(2,7)=1.\n\n        Then (2,7,1,1) -> sum=2+7+1+1=11.\n\n        This works.\n\n        In general, for the TODO branch, we can do:\n\n            a = 2\n            b = n-2-2  # because a+b = n-2, and we have two 1's -> wait, no: the two 1's are c and d, so a+b = n-2.\n            But we need gcd(2, n-4)=1? \n                gcd(2, n-4)=1 if and only if n-4 is odd, i.e., n is even? \n                But n is odd in this branch.\n\n            n is odd, so n-4 is odd -> then gcd(2, n-4)=1.\n\n        Therefore, we can always do (2, n-4, 1, 1) for the TODO branch.\n\n        But note: n>=5 (since a is odd and>=5), then n-4>=1, so positive.\n\n        Example: n=11: (2,7,1,1) -> works.\n\n        But what if n=5: \n            a1 = 5-1=4.\n            4%3=1 (not 0), 4%4=0 -> so we don't hit the TODO branch? \n            The condition: \n                if a1%3==0: ... \n                elif a1%4!=0: TODO -> but 4%4==0, so we go to the next elif: a1%4==0 -> then we print (4//4, 4//2, 4//4, 1) = (1,2,1,1) -> sum=1+2+1+1=5.\n\n        So n=5 is handled.\n\n        The next odd n that hits the TODO: n=7: \n            a1=6: \n                6%3==0 -> so we print (2,2,2,1) -> which is provided.\n\n        n=9: \n            a1=8: \n                8%3=2 (not 0), 8%4==0 -> so we print (8//4, 8//2, 8//4, 1) = (2,4,2,1) -> which is the example.\n\n        n=13: \n            a1=12: \n                12%3==0 -> (4,4,4,1)\n\n        n=15:\n            a1=14:\n                14%3=2 (not 0), 14%4=2 (not 0) -> TODO branch.\n            then we output (2, 15-4, 1, 1) = (2,11,1,1) -> sum=2+11+1+1=15.\n            Check: gcd(2,11)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        Therefore, for the TODO branch, we can do:\n\n            print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: a is the input, and in this branch, a is the current test case value.\n\n        So the code for the TODO branch in program2.py is:\n\n            print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\n\n        But wait, the condition: we are in the branch where a is odd and a1%3!=0 and a1%4!=0.\n\n        And a1 = a-1.\n\n        But we are printing (2, a-4, 1, 1) -> sum=2+(a-4)+1+1 = a, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for program2.py's TODO is:\n\n            print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified format.\n\n        We are to output a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        For program1, the missing code is: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        For program2, the missing code is:\n            print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\n\n        However, in program2, the TODO is in an elif branch, and we must indent properly? \n\n        The provided code in program2 has:\n\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must replace the TODO with:\n\n            print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the next branch is `elif a1%4==0:`, which is not taken if we are in the TODO branch.\n\n        So we can simply print.\n\n        But also note: the variable a is the input for the test case.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\"\n        }\n\n        However, in program1, the TODO is in the second if, and we have to consider the indentation. The provided code has 8 spaces for the if block? \n\n        In the provided code for program1, the TODO is at the same indentation as the other ifs. We are in the while loop, and then the ifs. The TODO is in:\n\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to fill in the next line(s). The current code has a comment. We replace the comment with two lines.\n\n        We must maintain the same indentation.\n\n        The surrounding code uses 8 spaces for the inner block? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program1:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the other ifs. We can write two lines with the same indentation.\n\n        So for program1, the missing code is two lines:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the first if is written in one line. We can write the TODO in two lines.\n\n        However, the first if has three statements in one line. We can do the same for the TODO? \n\n        But the TODO is two statements. We can write:\n\n            if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n        But the problem: the next if for s2<s1 might be executed in the same iteration? \n\n        We are not to change the structure, only fill in.\n\n        Given the instructions, I will output the two lines with the same indentation as the other ifs.\n\n        The other ifs are at the same indentation level as the while and the other ifs. The while loop body is indented by 4 spaces. The ifs are also indented by 4 spaces, and then the body of the if is also indented? \n\n        In the provided code, the first if has the body in the same line. The second if has a comment. The third if has the body in the same line.\n\n        We can do for the second if:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But the other ifs are not in multi-line. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n        This is one line.\n\n        I think the one-line is safer to match the style.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, we output: \"s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n        But note: the next line is an independent if. We are not to change it.\n\n        So the code after filling:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        However, in the one-line, we have two statements. This is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But what if after we do s1 += l[p1] and p1+=1, then s1 becomes greater than s2? Then the next if (s2<s1) will be true and we will also update in the same iteration? \n\n        This is the same as before.\n\n        Given the above, I think it is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"print(2, a-4, 1, 1)\"\n        }\n\n        Let me test program2 with n=11: \n            a=11, which is not divisible by 4, and odd.\n            a1 = 10.\n            10%3 !=0 -> so we go to the next branch: a1%4!=0 -> true, so we do the TODO: print(2, 11-4, 1, 1) = (2,7,1,1) -> sum=2+7+1+1=11.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        We are done."
