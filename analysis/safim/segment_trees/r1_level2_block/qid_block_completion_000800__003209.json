We call label(1,2,1) -> because the parent of the root of the right subtree should be the current root, which is 0-indexed index0 -> 1-indexed parent is 1.

But the prefix sum part is incomplete.\n\n Let me analyze the code:\n\n   We read n, then a matrix of n x n.\n\n   Then we build a 2D prefix sum array S? The loops:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                    S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                elif i > 0:\n                    S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                elif j > 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   This TODO is for the case when j>0 and i==0. We should do:\n\n        S[0][j] += S[0][j-1]\n\n   But note: the initial S is built from the input matrix? Actually, no: we read the input and stored in S? \n\n   Actually, the code:\n\n        S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n                S[i][j] = c\n\n   Then we are building a 2D prefix sum for S? But note: the prefix sum we are building is in-place and we are using the same array.\n\n   However, the standard 2D prefix sum is:\n\n        Let P[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} A[x][y]\n\n        Then: P[i][j] = A[i][j] + P[i-1][j] + P[i][j-1] - P[i-1][j-1]\n\n   But in the code, we are doing:\n\n        if i>0 and j>0: S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n        elif i>0: S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n        elif j>0: ...   -> we need to do: S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n   So we can complete the TODO with:\n\n        S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n   But note: the indices? i is 0 and j>0.\n\n   However, the problem: the input matrix is symmetric? and we are going to use the function `acc` which uses this prefix sum.\n\n   The function `acc(i1, i2, j1, j2)` is defined to compute the sum of the submatrix from rows i1 to i2-1 and columns j1 to j2-1? \n\n        It returns: \n            a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n            b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1>0 else 0\n            c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1>0 else 0\n            d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1>0 and j1>0 else 0\n            result = a - b - c + d\n\n   This is the standard inclusion-exclusion for the rectangle [i1, i2-1] x [j1, j2-1]. \n\n   However, note that our prefix sum array S was built from the original matrix of messages. But the problem: the matrix c is symmetric and we are going to use it to compute the cost.\n\n   The main idea of the solution:\n\n        We are going to use dynamic programming to build an optimal binary search tree? But note the constraint: the tree must be such that for any node, the left subtree has smaller indices and the right has larger. This is exactly the structure of a BST built from the sorted order of indices (which are 0 to n-1, but representing the jobs 1 to n).\n\n        The problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" but with a different cost function? \n\n        However, note the cost: the total cost is sum_{i<j} c_{ij} * d_{ij}. \n\n        The distance d_{ij} in the tree is the sum of the distances from the root of i and the root of j minus twice the distance from the root to the LCA. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the cost can be broken down by edges: each edge is traversed by all pairs that have the edge on their path.\n\n        Actually, the problem is similar to: \"Minimum cost of searching\" but for multiple keys and with a given frequency of access for every pair? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let F(i, j) be the minimum total cost for the subtree containing the keys from i to j (inclusive). \n\n            Then we choose a root k in [i, j]. The root will be at depth 0. Then the left subtree [i, k-1] and right [k+1, j] will have their costs, and then we add the cost of the root: which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs that pass through the root? \n\n        How to account for the cost? \n\n        Actually, note: the cost for a pair (x,y) is the distance in the tree. The distance is the sum of the depths of x and y minus twice the depth of the LCA. But when building the tree recursively, the root k will be the LCA for every pair (x,y) such that i<=x<=k and k<=y<=j. \n\n        However, the cost for the root: every time we go down a level, the path length for every pair that goes through that edge increases by 1? Actually, we can break the cost by levels: the edge from the root to the left child will be traversed by every pair that has one node in the left subtree and the other in the entire rest of the tree? But note: the entire rest of the tree includes the root and the right subtree? \n\n        Actually, the problem is known and the solution uses the following recurrence:\n\n            F(i, j) = min_{i<=k<=j} [ F(i, k-1) + F(k+1, j) ] + W(i, j)\n\n        but what is W(i,j)? \n\n        In the classical optimal BST, W(i,j) is the sum of the frequencies of the keys in [i,j] (for single accesses). Here, we have pairs.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known result: \n\n            The total cost can be expressed as the sum_{i,j} c_{ij} * (depth(i) + depth(j) - 2 * depth(LCA(i,j))) \n            = [sum_i depth(i) * (sum_j c_{ij})] - 2 * [sum_{i,j} c_{ij} * depth(LCA(i,j))]\n\n        But note: the problem is symmetric and we are building a BST. \n\n        There is a known solution for this problem: \n\n            We define:\n                dp[i][j] = minimum total cost for the subtree [i, j] (if we consider the entire set, then dp[0][n-1] is the answer for the cost)\n\n            But note: the problem asks for the tree structure, not the cost. And we are to output the parent array.\n\n        However, the provided code does:\n\n            M = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n            P = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n\n            def solve(b, e):\n                if e - b == 1: \n                    M[b][e-1] = 0\n                    return 0\n                if e - b == 0: \n                    return 0\n                if M[b][e-1] != -1: \n                    return M[b][e-1]\n                M[b][e-1] = 1e18\n                for i in range(b, e):\n                    s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n                    s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n                    if s < M[b][e-1]:\n                        M[b][e-1] = s\n                        P[b][e-1] = i\n                return M[b][e-1]\n\n        Then we call solve(0, n) and then build the tree.\n\n        What is the meaning of the added terms?\n\n            acc(0, b, b, i)   -> submatrix: rows [0, b-1] and columns [b, i-1]? \n            acc(b, i, i, n)   -> rows [b, i-1] and columns [i, n-1]?\n            acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) -> rows [0, i] and columns [i+1, e-1]?\n            acc(i+1, e, e, n)   -> rows [i+1, e-1] and columns [e, n-1]?\n\n        This doesn't look symmetric. \n\n        Alternatively, note: the problem says that the total cost for a tree is the sum over pairs (i,j) of c_{ij} * d_{ij}. \n\n        When we choose a root k in [b, e-1] (the segment [b, e)), then:\n\n            The root k will be the LCA for any pair (i,j) such that i<=k<=j and i and j are in [b, e). \n\n            However, the pairs that are entirely in the left subtree [b, k) or entirely in the right [k+1, e) are handled recursively.\n\n            The cost that we add at the root k is the cost for the pairs that have k as the LCA? Actually, no: the entire path for a pair (i,j) is the sum of the edges from i to the root and from the root to j? But note: the root is at depth 0? Then the distance from i to j is (depth(i) - depth(k)) + (depth(j) - depth(k))? \n\n        Actually, the entire cost can be broken by the root: \n\n            The root k will add 1 to the path of every pair that has one element in the left subtree and the other in the right subtree? Why? Because the path from any node in the left to any node in the right must go through the root. And then the root is traversed? Actually, the entire path from left to right goes through the root and then the two edges from the root to the two children? \n\n        But note: the distance d_{ij} is the number of edges. So for a pair (i,j) that is split by the root (i in left, j in right), the path is: from i up to the root (which is depth(i) edges) and then down to j (depth(j) edges). However, if we are building the tree recursively, the depths in the subtree are relative? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence in the code:\n\n            s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) \n            then add: \n                acc(0, b, b, i)   -> let me denote: this is the sum of the submatrix: rows [0, b-1] and columns [b, i-1]? \n                acc(b, i, i, n)   -> rows [b, i-1] and columns [i, n-1]?\n                acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) -> rows [0, i] and columns [i+1, e-1]?\n                acc(i+1, e, e, n)   -> rows [i+1, e-1] and columns [e, n-1]?\n\n        This seems to be adding the cost for the root at k=i? \n\n        How does this relate to the cost? \n\n        Note: the problem says that the total cost is the sum over all pairs (i,j) of c_{ij} * d_{ij}. \n\n        When we split at k, the pairs that are entirely in [b, i) or entirely in [i+1, e) are taken care of by the recursive calls. The pairs that cross the split? \n\n        The pairs that are split by the root k=i: \n            - pairs (x, y) where x in [b, i) and y in [i+1, e): the path goes through the root k, and the distance for such a pair is (depth of x in the left subtree + 1) + (depth of y in the right subtree + 1) = (depth in left) + (depth in right) + 2. But note: the recursive solutions for the left and right already account for the depths in their subtrees? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence in the classical \"Optimal BST\" for the case when the cost is the sum over all nodes of (depth+1)*freq(node) is:\n\n            dp[i][j] = min_{k} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + w(i,j)\n\n        where w(i,j) is the sum of the frequencies of the keys in [i,j] (because when we add a root, we add one more level to every node in the subtree, so we add the total frequency of the subtree).\n\n        But here, we have pairs. \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n            T = sum_{i<j} c_{ij} * d_{ij}\n\n        and when we choose a root k, then:\n\n            T = T_left + T_right + T_cross\n\n        where T_left and T_right are the costs for the pairs entirely in the left and right subtrees, and T_cross is the cost for the pairs that have one in the left and one in the right.\n\n        For a pair (x,y) with x in [b, k) and y in [k+1, e): \n            d_{x,y} = (depth of x in the left subtree + 1) + (depth of y in the right subtree + 1) \n                    = (depth_left(x) + depth_right(y)) + 2\n\n        But note: the recursive calls T_left and T_right already account for the depths within their subtrees? Actually, the recursive calls return the total cost for the pairs within the subtree? \n\n        However, the recursive calls do not account for the extra edge from the root to the subtree? \n\n        Actually, the entire cost T can be broken as:\n\n            T = [T_left + (number of edges traversed in the left subtree for all pairs that involve the left subtree)] \n                but wait, the pairs that involve the left subtree and the right subtree are not in T_left.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known approach: \n\n            The total cost T for the entire tree is the sum over edges of the total number of pairs that go through that edge multiplied by 1 (the weight of the edge). \n\n            For an edge connecting a node to its parent, the number of pairs that go through that edge is: \n                (number of nodes in the subtree of the child) * (n - number of nodes in the subtree of the child) \n            but that would be if every pair of nodes that are separated by the edge? Actually, that is for the case when the graph is a tree and we are counting every pair that has one node in the subtree and the other outside. \n\n        However, here the cost is weighted by c_{ij}. \n\n        So for an edge that separates the set of nodes S from the rest, the cost added for that edge is: \n            (sum_{i in S, j not in S} c_{ij}) * 1\n\n        Therefore, the total cost is the sum over edges of the cut value (the sum of c_{ij} for i in S, j not in S).\n\n        Now, if we build the tree recursively: \n\n            When we choose a root k, then the left subtree will be [b, k) and the right [k+1, e). The root k is not included in either? Actually, the root is fixed and the left subtree is the nodes with indices < k and the right with indices > k? \n\n        Then the edge from the root to the left child will be traversed by every pair that has one node in the left subtree and the other not in the left subtree. The other node can be in the right subtree or in the rest of the tree (which is [0, b) and [e, n))? \n\n        Similarly for the right.\n\n        Therefore, the cost for the edge from the root to the left child is:\n\n            = (sum of c_{i,j} for i in [b, k) and j in [0, b) U [k, n) ) \n            = (sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0,b)} c_{ij}) + (sum_{i in [b,k), j in [k, n)} c_{ij})\n\n        Similarly, the edge from the root to the right child is:\n\n            = (sum_{i in [k+1,e), j in [0, k+1)} c_{ij}) + (sum_{i in [k+1,e), j in [e, n)} c_{ij})\n\n        But note: the entire set of nodes is [0, n). The current segment we are building is [b, e). The rest of the nodes are [0, b) and [e, n). \n\n        Therefore, for the left subtree [b, k):\n\n            The cut for the edge from the root to the left child is:\n                = (sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0,b) U [k, n)} c_{ij})\n                = (sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0,b)} c_{ij}) + (sum_{i in [b,k), j in [k, n)} c_{ij})\n\n            But note: [k, n) = [k, e) U [e, n) and [k, e) is the right subtree and the rest? Actually, the right subtree is [k+1, e). So [k, n) = [k] U [k+1, e) U [e, n). However, the pair (i,j) with i in [b,k) and j=k is not in the left subtree? Actually, the root k is not in the left subtree. So the left subtree is [b, k) and the root is k. The pairs (i,k) for i in [b,k) are between the left subtree and the root? But note: the root is the parent of the left subtree, so the edge from the root to the left child will carry the traffic from the entire left subtree to the root and to the entire right subtree and to the rest? \n\n        Actually, the entire traffic from the left subtree to any node not in the left subtree must go through the edge. So:\n\n            = sum_{i in [b,k)} [ sum_{j in [0, n) \\ [b,k)} c_{ij} ]\n\n        Similarly, for the right subtree [k+1, e):\n\n            = sum_{i in [k+1,e)} [ sum_{j in [0, n) \\ [k+1,e)} c_{ij} ]\n\n        But note: the root k is not included in the left or right? So the entire set [0, n) \\ [b,k) = [0, b) U [k, n). Similarly, [0, n) \\ [k+1,e) = [0, k+1) U [e, n).\n\n        Therefore, the cost for the left edge is:\n\n            = acc(0, b, b, k)   -> but wait, our function `acc` is defined for a 2D range. \n\n        How do we express:\n\n            sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0, b) U [k, n)} c_{ij} \n            = sum_{i in [b,k)} [ sum_{j in [0, b)} c_{ij} + sum_{j in [k, n)} c_{ij} ]\n\n        We can break it:\n\n            = [sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0, b)} c_{ij}] + [sum_{i in [b,k), j in [k, n)} c_{ij}]\n\n        Now, using the prefix sum array:\n\n            [sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0, b)}] = acc(0, b, b, k)   -> rows [0, b) and columns [b, k) -> but note: the matrix is symmetric? Actually, the matrix is symmetric, but the function `acc` does not use symmetry? \n\n        The function `acc(i1, i2, j1, j2)` returns the sum of the submatrix from row indices [i1, i2-1] and column indices [j1, j2-1]. \n\n        So:\n\n            [sum_{i in [b,k), j in [0, b)}] = \n                rows: [b, k-1] (because i in [b,k) -> from b to k-1) and columns: [0, b-1] (because j in [0, b) -> from 0 to b-1) \n                = acc(0, b, b, k)   -> but wait: the parameters: \n                    i1=0, i2=b -> rows [0, b-1] -> but we want rows [b, k-1]? \n                Actually, we want: \n                    rows: [b, k-1] and columns: [0, b-1] -> but note: the prefix sum array we built is for the entire matrix? \n\n        How to get the submatrix [b, k-1] x [0, b-1]? \n\n            = acc(0, k, 0, b)   -> but wait, that would be rows [0, k-1] and columns [0, b-1]. We only want the rows [b, k-1]. \n\n        We can use:\n\n            = acc(0, k, 0, b) - acc(0, b, 0, b) \n\n        But the function `acc` we have is:\n\n            acc(i1, i2, j1, j2) = the sum of the submatrix [i1, i2-1] x [j1, j2-1]\n\n        So:\n\n            [b, k-1] x [0, b-1] = \n                = acc(0, k, 0, b) - acc(0, b, 0, b) - acc(b, k, 0, 0) + ...? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            = acc(b, k, 0, b)   -> but note: the function `acc` as defined: \n                acc(b, k, 0, b) = the submatrix: rows [b, k-1] and columns [0, b-1] -> that's exactly what we want.\n\n        Similarly, [b, k-1] x [k, n-1] = \n            = acc(b, k, k, n)\n\n        Therefore, the cost for the left edge is: \n            = acc(b, k, 0, b) + acc(b, k, k, n)\n\n        Similarly, for the right edge: \n            = [sum_{i in [k+1, e), j in [0, k+1)}] + [sum_{i in [k+1, e), j in [e, n)}]\n            = acc(k+1, e, 0, k+1) + acc(k+1, e, e, n)\n\n        But note: the root k itself is not included in the left or right. The traffic from the root to the left subtree and to the right subtree is already accounted for by the edges? \n\n        However, the problem: the root k is a node and the pairs (k, x) for any x != k? \n\n        The distance from k to x is the depth of x (if x is in the left or right) plus one? But note: the root is at depth 0. The depth of a node in the left subtree is 1 (for the direct child) plus the depth in the left subtree? \n\n        Actually, the entire cost for the root k: \n            The root k is connected to the left and right. The cost for the pair (k, x) for x in the left: the distance is 1 + (depth of x in the left). Similarly for the right. \n\n        But note: the recursive calls for the left and right subtrees already account for the depths within the subtrees? And the root k is not included in the subtrees. \n\n        How is the cost for the pair (k, x) accounted? \n\n        The pair (k, x) for x in the left subtree: \n            The path goes from k to x: which is the edge from k to the left child and then the path from the left child to x. The cost for the edge from k to the left child is traversed by this pair. Similarly, the entire path is 1 + (depth of x in the left). \n\n        But the recursive call for the left subtree returns the cost for the pairs within the left subtree. The pair (k, x) is not within the left subtree. \n\n        Therefore, we must account for the pairs (k, x) for every x != k? \n\n        However, in the recurrence above, we only accounted for the pairs that cross the root (i.e., one in the left and one in the right) and the pairs that go from the left to the outside and the right to the outside? \n\n        The pairs (k, x) for x in the left: \n            The edge from k to the left child is traversed by this pair. And then the rest is in the left subtree. But note: the left subtree's edges are traversed by the pair? \n\n        Actually, the entire cost for the pair (k, x) is the entire path from k to x. This path is entirely in the left subtree? No, the first edge is from k to the left child, and then the rest is in the left subtree. \n\n        How do we account for the first edge? \n\n        The first edge (k to left child) is traversed by every pair that has one endpoint in the left subtree and the other endpoint not in the left subtree? That includes (k, x) for x in the left, and also (x, y) for x in the left and y in the right, and (x, y) for x in the left and y in the rest of the tree? \n\n        So the cost for the edge is the total of all these pairs. \n\n        Therefore, the cost for the edge from k to the left child is:\n\n            = (sum_{x in [b,k)} [ sum_{y not in [b,k)} c_{x,y} ])\n\n        which is exactly what we computed: acc(b, k, 0, b) + acc(b, k, k, n)\n\n        Similarly, the edge from k to the right child is:\n\n            = (sum_{x in [k+1,e)} [ sum_{y not in [k+1,e)} c_{x,y} ]) \n            = acc(k+1, e, 0, k+1) + acc(k+1, e, e, n)\n\n        And the root k itself: the pairs (k, x) for x not in [b,e) (i.e., the rest of the tree) are not accounted? Actually, the rest of the tree is [0, b) and [e, n). The pairs (k, x) for x in [0, b) or [e, n) are not accounted in the edges of the left and right? \n\n        But note: the root k is at depth 0. The entire path from k to x (for x not in [b,e)) is not going through the left or right child? It goes through the parent of k? But k is the root? \n\n        Actually, the problem: the entire tree is built on the set [0, n). The current segment [b,e) is being built. The rest of the nodes [0,b) and [e,n) are not in this subtree? \n\n        How are they connected? \n\n        The problem: the tree we are building is the entire tree? The problem says: \"a hierarchy tree\" for the n team members. So the entire set [0, n) is the set of nodes. \n\n        But the DP is building the tree for the segment [b,e). The rest of the nodes are already placed above? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence is building the tree for the entire set? Then why do we have [0, b) and [e, n) as the rest? \n\n        The DP is called with (0, n). Then the entire set is [0, n). \n\n        However, the recurrence for the segment [b,e) does not include the nodes outside [b,e). \n\n        How are the nodes outside [b,e) connected? \n\n        The problem: the tree must be a BST on the indices. The entire set of indices [0, n) is fixed. The root of the entire tree is one node in [0, n). Then the left subtree is the set of indices less than the root, and the right subtree the indices greater than the root. \n\n        Therefore, the DP is building the tree for the contiguous segment [b,e) of the sorted indices. The nodes outside [b,e) are not in this subtree? \n\n        Actually, the entire tree is built on the entire set [0, n). The DP is building a subtree for a contiguous segment? \n\n        But note: the BST property: the set of nodes in the subtree must be a contiguous interval? Actually, no: the BST for the entire set [0, n) will have the root, then the left subtree is the set of indices less than the root, which is [0, root), and the right is [root+1, n). \n\n        So the entire tree is built by recursively building on contiguous intervals. \n\n        Therefore, the nodes outside [b,e) are not in the current subtree. The communication between nodes in [b,e) and outside [b,e) must go through the parent of the root of the current subtree? \n\n        But the problem: the entire tree is built from the root down. The current segment [b,e) is a contiguous interval. The parent of the root of [b,e) is already fixed? \n\n        Actually, in the DP we are building the entire tree? Then the root of the entire tree is the root of the entire set [0, n). \n\n        However, the recurrence for the segment [b,e) is independent? \n\n        The key: the cost for the entire tree is the sum over edges of the total weight of the pairs that cross that edge. \n\n        For the current subtree [b,e), the edges that we are adding (the root and the edges to the left and right children) will be traversed by:\n\n            - The pairs that have one node in the left subtree and one node in the right subtree: they cross the root? Actually, they cross the two edges? \n\n        Actually, the pair (x,y) with x in the left and y in the right: \n            The path goes from x to the root of the left subtree, then to the root of the entire subtree [b,e), then to the root of the right subtree, then to y. But note: the root of the entire subtree [b,e) is k. The edge from k to the left child is traversed by the entire path from k to the left subtree. Similarly, the edge from k to the right child is traversed by the entire path from k to the right subtree. \n\n        Therefore, the pair (x,y) traverses both the edge from k to the left and the edge from k to the right? Actually, no: the path is: \n            x -> ... -> left_child -> k -> right_child -> ... -> y.\n\n        So the edge (k, left_child) is traversed by the entire traffic from the left subtree to the rest of the tree (which includes the right subtree and the outside). Similarly, the edge (k, right_child) is traversed by the entire traffic from the right subtree to the rest of the tree (which includes the left subtree and the outside). \n\n        Therefore, the cost for the edge (k, left_child) is:\n\n            = (sum_{x in [b,k)} [ sum_{y not in [b,k)} c_{x,y} ])\n\n        and similarly for the right.\n\n        Now, note that the pair (x,y) with x in the left and y in the right is counted in both? \n\n            - For the left edge: it is counted as (x,y) for x in [b,k) and y in [k, n) (which includes the right subtree and the root and the outside) -> so it is included.\n            - For the right edge: it is counted as (x,y) for x in [k+1,e) and y in [0, k+1) (which includes the left subtree and the root and the outside) -> but note: the left subtree is [b,k), so it is included.\n\n        However, the pair (x,y) is counted twice? \n\n        But the path for (x,y) uses two edges: the left edge and the right edge. So we should count it twice? \n\n        Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n            s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) \n                 + [cost for the left edge] + [cost for the right edge]\n\n            = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) \n                 + [acc(b, i, 0, b) + acc(b, i, i, n)]   # left edge: [b, i) -> note: the segment [b, i) is the left subtree? but in the code the root is i, so the left is [b, i) and the right [i+1, e). \n                 + [acc(i+1, e, 0, i+1) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)]\n\n        But note: in the code, the root is at index i. The left subtree is [b, i) and the right is [i+1, e). \n\n        Therefore, the code has:\n\n            s += acc(0, b, b, i)   -> but wait, the parameters: \n                acc(0, b, b, i): \n                    rows: [0, b-1] and columns: [b, i-1] -> that is the submatrix for the pairs (x,y) with x in [0, b) and y in [b, i) -> which is the same as the pairs (y,x) for y in [b,i) and x in [0,b) -> so that is the left edge: the part [b,i) to [0,b). \n\n            acc(b, i, i, n): \n                rows: [b, i-1] and columns: [i, n-1] -> which is the left edge: the part [b,i) to [i, n) -> which includes the root i and the right subtree and the outside.\n\n            Similarly, \n            acc(0, i+1, i+1, e): \n                rows: [0, i] and columns: [i+1, e-1] -> but note: the right subtree is [i+1, e). This is the pairs (x,y) for x in [0, i+1) and y in [i+1, e) -> but note: the right subtree is [i+1, e). The pairs (x,y) for x in [0, i+1) and y in [i+1, e) includes the left subtree and the root? \n\n            Actually, we want for the right edge: \n                = [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [0, i+1)} c_{x,y} ] + [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [e, n)} c_{x,y} ]]\n\n            The first part: [0, i+1) = [0, i] U {i} -> but the root i is included? \n\n            The second part: [e, n) is the outside.\n\n            So:\n\n                [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [0, i+1)} c_{x,y} ] = acc(0, i+1, i+1, e)   -> but note: \n                    rows: [0, i] and columns: [i+1, e-1] -> this is the pairs (x,y) for x in [0, i] and y in [i+1, e-1]. \n                But we also need the pairs (x,y) for x in [i+1,e) and y=i? \n\n            However, the root i is at index i. The pair (x,i) for x in [i+1,e) is not included? \n\n            Similarly, the second part: [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [e, n)} c_{x,y} ] = acc(i+1, e, e, n)   -> which is rows [i+1, e-1] and columns [e, n-1] -> that is the outside.\n\n            But the pair (x,i) for x in [i+1,e) is missing? \n\n        How do we get the pair (x,i) for x in [i+1,e)? \n\n            It would be in: \n                [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} c_{x,i}]\n\n            But note: the entire matrix is stored. We can get:\n\n                = acc(i, i+1, i+1, e)   -> rows [i, i] (i.e., row i) and columns [i+1, e-1] -> but wait, the root i is at row i? \n\n            However, the function `acc` does not include the row i? Because the parameters: \n                acc(i, i+1, i+1, e) = the submatrix: rows [i, i] (only row i) and columns [i+1, e-1] -> that is the pairs (i, j) for j in [i+1, e-1]. \n\n            But note: the root i is not in the right subtree? The right subtree is [i+1, e). \n\n            The pair (i, j) for j in [i+1, e) is not accounted in the left edge? \n\n            Actually, the left edge accounted for the left subtree [b,i) to the outside (which includes the root i and the right subtree and the rest). The pair (i, j) for j in [i+1, e) is between the root and the right subtree. \n\n            How is this pair accounted? \n\n            The path for (i,j) is: from i to j: which goes through the edge from i to the right child. So it is accounted in the right edge? \n\n            Specifically, the right edge cost includes the entire traffic from the right subtree to the outside of the right subtree. The outside of the right subtree includes the root i and the left subtree and the rest of the tree. \n\n            Therefore, the pair (i,j) is included in the right edge: \n                = [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y not in [i+1,e)} c_{x,y} ]]\n                = [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ c_{x,i} + sum_{y in [0, i+1) \\ [i+1,e)} ... ]]\n\n            But note: the root i is not in the right subtree, so it is in the \"not in [i+1,e)\" part. \n\n            Therefore, the pair (i,j) is included in the right edge cost. \n\n            However, in the expression for the right edge cost we broke it as:\n\n                = [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [0, i+1)} c_{x,y} ] + [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [e, n)} c_{x,y} ]]\n\n            The first part: [0, i+1) includes the root i? \n\n            But note: the root i is at index i, and [0, i+1) is [0, i] (because the range is [0, i+1) -> indices 0 to i). So the root i is included. \n\n            Therefore, the pair (i,j) for j in [i+1,e) is not included in the first part? \n\n            The first part is: \n                [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [0, i+1)} c_{x,y} ] \n                = [sum_{x in [i+1,e)} [ sum_{y in [0, i] } c_{x,y} ] \n\n            This does not include the root i? Because the root i is at index i, and [0, i] includes i? \n\n            Actually, [0, i] includes i. \n\n            But note: the matrix is stored with indices from 0 to n-1. The element c_{i,j} is stored at row i and column j. \n\n            The submatrix [0, i] (rows) and [i+1, e) (columns) does not include the row i? \n\n            The function `acc(0, i+1, i+1, e)` returns the sum for rows [0, i] and columns [i+1, e-1]. This includes the row i? \n\n            Yes: rows [0, i] -> indices 0 to i (because the range is [0, i+1) -> rows 0 to i). \n\n            Therefore, the element c_{i,j} for j in [i+1, e) is included in the submatrix: row i and column j (which is in [i+1, e-1] if j<e). \n\n            So the pair (i,j) is included in the first part of the right edge cost. \n\n        Therefore, the recurrence in the code is:\n\n            s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) \n                 + acc(0, b, b, i)   # [0, b) x [b, i) -> but note: [0, b) is the rows and [b, i) is the columns -> this is the pairs (x,y) for x in [0, b) and y in [b, i) -> which is the same as the left edge: the part [b,i) to [0,b)\n                 + acc(b, i, i, n)   # [b, i) x [i, n) -> the left edge: the part [b,i) to [i, n)\n                 + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) # [0, i+1) x [i+1, e) -> the right edge: the part [0, i+1) to [i+1, e) -> which includes the root i to the right subtree? \n                 + acc(i+1, e, e, n)   # [i+1, e) x [e, n) -> the right edge: the part [i+1, e) to [e, n)\n\n        But note: the entire left edge cost is: \n            = acc(b, i, 0, b)   # [b, i) x [0, b) -> same as acc(0, b, b, i) by symmetry? \n            and acc(b, i, i, n)   # [b, i) x [i, n)\n\n        However, the function `acc` is not symmetric in the sense of parameters: we have to be careful. \n\n        Actually, the matrix is symmetric: c_{x,y}=c_{y,x}. But the function `acc` does not assume symmetry? It just sums the submatrix. \n\n        But note: the submatrix [0, b) x [b, i) is the same as the submatrix [b, i) x [0, b) in terms of the set of pairs? \n\n        However, the function `acc` is defined for a fixed row range and column range. \n\n        We have:\n\n            acc(0, b, b, i) = sum_{x in [0, b)} sum_{y in [b, i)} c_{x,y}\n\n            and \n\n            acc(b, i, 0, b) = sum_{x in [b, i)} sum_{y in [0, b)} c_{x,y} \n\n        and by symmetry, these are equal.\n\n        Therefore, we can use either. \n\n        But the code uses:\n\n            acc(0, b, b, i)   -> which is the same as acc(b, i, 0, b) \n\n        So the recurrence is as above.\n\n        However, the code has:\n\n            s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Now, the base case: \n            if e-b==1: then we have one node. The cost is 0? \n            if e-b==0: then no node, cost 0.\n\n        Then we build the parent array: \n\n            We have a DP table P: P[b][e-1] = the root chosen for the segment [b,e).\n\n            Then we define:\n\n                def label(b, e, p):\n                    if e-b==1:\n                        sol[b] = str(p)   # the node at index b has parent p (if p==0 then it's the root)\n                        return\n                    elif e-b==0: \n                        return\n                    i = P[b][e-1]   # the root of the segment [b,e)\n                    sol[i] = str(p)   # the parent of the root i is p (which is passed from the parent call)\n                    label(b, i, i+1)   # the left subtree: [b, i), and the parent of the root of the left subtree is i+1? \n                    label(i+1, e, i+1) # the right subtree: [i+1, e), and the parent of the root of the right subtree is i+1?\n\n            Why is the parent of the left subtree's root i+1? \n\n            Note: the root of the entire segment [b,e) is i. The left subtree is [b, i) and the right is [i+1, e). \n\n            The root of the left subtree is the node that we choose as the root for [b,i). We are passing the parent of that root as i+1? \n\n            But the parent of the left subtree's root should be i (the current root). \n\n            However, the problem: the nodes are numbered by their index. The parent of a node should be the index of the parent node. \n\n            The current root is at index i. The left subtree's root is at some index, say j (which we will get from the recursive call). The parent of j should be i. \n\n            But in the call: label(b, i, i+1) -> the third argument is the parent index to assign to the root of the subtree [b,i). \n\n            Why i+1? \n\n            Actually, the parent of the left subtree's root is the current root i. But we are passing i+1? \n\n            This seems odd.\n\n        Let me check the example: \n            n=2, candies: [1,2] (weights not important for the tree structure, but the tree must be a BST: the root must be either 0 or 1? \n\n            The entire set [0,1] (if we use 0-indexed indices). \n\n            The root can be 0: then left subtree is empty, right subtree is [1]. \n            Or root 1: then left subtree [0], right subtree empty.\n\n            The minimal cost will determine the root.\n\n            The code: \n                solve(0,2): \n                    for i in [0,2): i=0 and i=1.\n                    For i=0: \n                        left: [0,0) -> empty -> cost 0\n                        right: [1,2) -> one node -> cost 0\n                        then add: \n                            acc(0,0,0,0) -> 0? \n                            acc(0,0,0,n) -> 0\n                            acc(0,1,1,2) -> [0,1) x [1,2) = [0] x [1] -> c_{0,1}\n                            acc(1,2,2,n) -> [1,2) x [2, n) -> if n=2, then [1,1] x [2,2) -> empty -> 0\n                        so total added = c_{0,1}\n                    For i=1: \n                        left: [0,1) -> one node -> cost 0\n                        right: [2,2) -> empty -> 0\n                        then add:\n                            acc(0,0,0,1) -> 0\n                            acc(0,1,1,n) -> [0,1) x [1, n) = [0] x [1,2) -> c_{0,1} (if n=2, then [0]x[1] = c_{0,1})\n                            acc(0,2,2,2) -> 0\n                            acc(2,2,2,n) -> 0\n                        so total added = c_{0,1}\n\n                    So both have the same cost. \n\n                Then the code chooses one arbitrarily? \n\n                Then we build the tree: \n                    If we choose i=0 for the root of [0,2):\n                        Then: \n                            sol[0] = str(p) = 0? because the call is label(0,2,0) -> then i=0, so sol[0] = \"0\" (meaning the parent of node0 is 0? but that would be the root? but the root should have parent 0? the problem says: for the leader output 0.\n\n                        Then we call:\n                            label(0,0,1) -> which does nothing because e-b=0.\n                            label(1,2,1) -> then e-b=1: so sol[1] = \"1\" -> meaning the parent of node1 is 1? but that is not the root? \n\n                    This is not correct.\n\n                If we choose i=1 for the root of [0,2):\n                    Then: \n                        sol[1] = \"0\" (because p=0) -> so node1 is the root? \n                        Then call:\n                            label(0,1,2) -> [0,1): one node at index0? \n                                then sol[0] = \"2\" -> but 2 is not a node? the nodes are 0 and 1.\n\n        What is the issue? \n\n        The parent of the left subtree's root should be the current root. The current root is i. So we should pass i (the index) as the parent. \n\n        But the code passes i+1? \n\n        Why? \n\n        Actually, the problem: the nodes are numbered from 1 to n? But the input indices are 0-indexed? \n\n        The problem says: \"for each team member from 1 to n output the number of the member in its parent node\"\n\n        So we have to output the parent for node i (which is 1-indexed) as the parent's index (which is 1-indexed). \n\n        But our array `sol` is indexed by 0-indexed index. \n\n        The root of the entire tree: we assign sol[i] = \"0\" (if the root is at index i, then the parent is 0).\n\n        For the left subtree: the root of the left subtree is at some index j (0-indexed). We want to set sol[j] to the parent's 1-indexed index? \n\n        The parent of j is the current root i. The 1-indexed index of the parent is i+1. \n\n        Similarly, for the right subtree: the parent of the root of the right subtree is i, so we set sol[k] = i+1.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct: we pass the parent's 1-indexed index to the children.\n\n        Example: \n            n=2, and we choose root i=0 (0-indexed). Then the root node0 (which is 1-indexed node1) has parent 0. \n            Then the right subtree: [1,2) -> node1 (0-indexed index1, which is 1-indexed node2). We call label(1,2,1) -> because the parent of the root of the right subtree should be the current root, which is 0-indexed index0 -> 1-indexed parent is 1. \n            Then in label(1,2,1): \n                e-b=1 -> so set sol[1] = \"1\" -> meaning the parent of node1 (0-indexed) is 1 (1-indexed) -> which is node1? \n\n        But wait: the root is node0 (0-indexed) and the right child is node1 (0-indexed). The parent of node1 should be node0, which is 1-indexed node1? \n\n        Actually, the nodes: \n            node0 (0-indexed) corresponds to team member 1.\n            node1 (0-indexed) corresponds to team member 2.\n\n        So the parent of node1 (which is team member 2) should be team member 1 -> which is 1 (1-indexed).\n\n        Therefore, the code sets:\n            sol[0] = \"0\"   -> parent of team member 1 is 0 (the leader).\n            sol[1] = \"1\"   -> parent of team member 2 is 1 (which is team member 1).\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Similarly, if we choose root i=1 (0-indexed) for the entire tree:\n            Then sol[1] = \"0\" -> parent of team member 2 is 0.\n            Then we call label(0,1,2): \n                which sets sol[0] = \"2\" -> parent of team member 1 is 2 (which is team member 2).\n\n        So the tree: \n            team member 2 is the root, and team member 1 is the left child of team member 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code for building the parent array is correct.\n\n        Now, the problem: the code does not handle multiple test cases.\n\n        The input: \n            t = number of test cases.\n\n        The current code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            ... then the rest.\n\n        We must loop for t test cases.\n\n        How to fix?\n\n            We should read t first, then loop t times.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                ... then the rest.\n\n        However, the provided code does not have that. \n\n        Therefore, we must add the loop for t.\n\n        But the problem: the code we are to complete is only the missing parts? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        The missing parts are:\n\n            - The TODO in the prefix sum: for the case j>0 and i==0: we need to do S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n            - The entire code is missing the loop for t? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        And the provided code does not have the loop for t.\n\n        Therefore, we must add the loop for t.\n\n        But note: the constraints on t: up to 10000, but the total n<=200000, so the number of test cases t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum t is 10000, but the average n is 200000/10000 = 20, which is small. \n\n        However, the DP: the state (b,e) and we have O(n^2) states. For n=200000, that is 40e9 states, which is too many.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over all test cases <= 200000. \n\n        However, the DP in the code is for one test case: it runs on a segment [0, n) and the state is (b,e) with 0<=b<=e<=n, and the number of states is n*(n+1)/2. For n=200000, that is about 20e9 states, which is too many.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is not efficient enough.\n\n        But the note: the problem says the total n over all test cases <= 200000. \n\n        So the sum of the sizes of the test cases is <=200000. \n\n        However, the worst-case test case could have n=200000 and t=1. Then the DP would be O(n^3) because the inner loop runs over the segment. \n\n        Actually, the recurrence:\n\n            for i in range(b, e):   # O(n) per state\n            and the number of states is O(n^2)\n\n            total O(n^3) -> for n=2000, that would be 8e9, which is too slow.\n\n        But note: the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, meaning the sum of the n's is 200000. \n\n        However, the worst-case test case has n=200000, and then the DP would be O(n^3) = 8e15 operations, which is too slow.\n\n        Therefore, we need a more efficient solution.\n\n        Actually, there is a known efficient solution for the optimal BST problem that runs in O(n^2) using Knuth's optimization. But the cost function here is not the same as the classical one? \n\n        However, the recurrence:\n\n            dp[i][j] = min_{k in [i,j]} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + (w(i,j) defined as ...)\n\n        and the cost we add is:\n\n            = [acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)]\n\n        But note: the cost we add depends on the entire matrix? \n\n        How can we compute these acc terms quickly? \n\n        We built a 2D prefix sum, so each acc is O(1). \n\n        But the state is O(n^2) and the inner loop is O(n) -> total O(n^3). \n\n        And n can be up to 2000? But the problem says n up to 200000? \n\n        Actually, the constraint: n up to 200000? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". \n\n        So the total n for all test cases is at most 200000. \n\n        However, the worst-case test case: t=1 and n=200000. Then the DP would be O(n^3) which is 8e15, too slow.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is not efficient for the constraints.\n\n        But the note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=200000, meaning the sum of the n's for the test cases is 200000. \n\n        And the worst-case test case has n=200000? Then we have one test case with n=200000. \n\n        How can we do it faster? \n\n        There is a known solution for the problem \"Tree with weights on pairs\" that uses the fact that the cost function satisfies the Knuth condition for quadrangle inequalities? \n\n        But the problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" with weights on pairs? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: \n            \"Minimum cost of searching for pairs\" and the recurrence is:\n\n                dp[i][j] = min_{i<=k<=j} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + f(i,j,k)\n\n            and f(i,j,k) = (prefix sum of the entire matrix for the cuts) as above.\n\n        But note: the cost f(i,j,k) can be rewritten as:\n\n            = [ (sum_{x in [b,k)} [ sum_{y not in [b,k)} c_{x,y} ]) + (sum_{x in [k+1,e)} [ sum_{y not in [k+1,e)} c_{x,y} ]) ]\n\n        = [ (sum_{x in [b,k)} [ total_x - sum_{y in [b,k)} c_{x,y} ]) + (sum_{x in [k+1,e)} [ total_x - sum_{y in [k+1,e)} c_{x,y} ]) ]\n\n        where total_x = sum_{y} c_{x,y}\n\n        But this doesn't help.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the cost for a given segment [b,e) and a split k without using the 2D prefix sum? \n\n        But we have the 2D prefix sum, so we can compute each term in O(1). \n\n        However, the state (b,e) has O(n^2) states and the inner loop O(n) -> O(n^3) per test case. \n\n        Given that the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case test case has n=200000, we need an O(n^2) solution.\n\n        There is a well known result: the optimal BST can be solved in O(n^2) if the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality and the monotonicity condition. \n\n        But our cost function is complicated. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the cost for the edge is the total weight of the cut. And the cut for the left subtree [b,k) is independent of the structure of the tree? \n\n        But the recurrence is:\n\n            dp[b][e] = min_{k in [b,e)} { dp[b][k] + dp[k+1][e] } + cost_left(b,k) + cost_right(k+1,e)\n\n        where cost_left(b,k) = acc(b, k, 0, b) + acc(b, k, k, n)\n        and cost_right(k+1,e) = acc(k+1, e, 0, k+1) + acc(k+1, e, e, n)\n\n        But note: the cost_left(b,k) is the cost for the left edge, which is the cut for the left subtree [b,k). This cost is fixed for the segment [b,k) and does not depend on the tree structure? \n\n        However, the cost for the left edge is: the total weight of the cut between [b,k) and the rest of the tree. This is fixed: it does not depend on how we build the left subtree. \n\n        Similarly for the right.\n\n        Therefore, the cost for the edge is fixed for the entire segment. \n\n        Then the recurrence becomes:\n\n            dp[b][e] = min_{k in [b,e)} { dp[b][k] + dp[k+1][e] } + fixed_cost_left(b,k) + fixed_cost_right(k+1,e)\n\n        And we can precompute fixed_cost_left and fixed_cost_right for every segment? \n\n        But note: the fixed_cost_left(b,k) = the cut for the set [b,k) = \n            = (sum_{x in [b,k)} total_x) - 2 * (sum_{x in [b,k), y in [b,k)} c_{x,y}) \n            ? \n\n        Actually, the cut for a set S is: \n            = sum_{x in S} sum_{y not in S} c_{x,y} \n            = sum_{x in S} [ total_x - sum_{y in S} c_{x,y} ]\n            = (sum_{x in S} total_x) - 2 * (sum_{x,y in S, x<y} c_{x,y})   [because c_{x,y} is counted once for x and once for y?]\n\n        But note: the matrix is symmetric, so:\n\n            = (sum_{x in S} total_x) - 2 * (sum_{x,y in S, x<y} c_{x,y}) \n            is not correct: because in the double sum over x in S and y in S, we have c_{x,y} for every pair, and it is counted twice in the term (sum_{x in S} sum_{y in S} c_{x,y})? \n\n        Actually, \n\n            sum_{x in S} total_x = sum_{x in S} sum_{y} c_{x,y} = sum_{x in S, y in S} c_{x,y} + sum_{x in S, y not in S} c_{x,y}\n\n            so: \n            sum_{x in S, y not in S} c_{x,y} = (sum_{x in S} total_x) - (sum_{x in S, y in S} c_{x,y})\n\n        Therefore, we can precompute:\n\n            Let T[x] = total_x = sum_{y} c_{x,y}\n\n            and let we have a 2D prefix sum for the matrix, so we can compute the sum over any submatrix.\n\n        But the term sum_{x in S, y in S} c_{x,y} is the sum of the submatrix S x S. \n\n        We can compute it with the 2D prefix sum: \n\n            = acc(b, k, b, k)   -> the submatrix [b, k-1] x [b, k-1]\n\n        Therefore, \n\n            fixed_cost_left(b,k) = (sum_{x in [b,k)} T[x]) - acc(b, k, b, k)\n\n        Similarly, \n\n            fixed_cost_right(k+1,e) = (sum_{x in [k+1,e)} T[x]) - acc(k+1, e, k+1, e)\n\n        Then the recurrence:\n\n            dp[b][e] = min_{k in [b,e)} { dp[b][k] + dp[k+1][e] } \n                        + [ (sum_{x in [b,k)} T[x] - acc(b,k,b,k)) + (sum_{x in [k+1,e)} T[x] - acc(k+1,e,k+1,e)) ]\n\n        But note: the entire cost for the current node also includes the cost for the root? \n\n        We haven't accounted for the pairs (k, x) for x not in [b,e)? \n\n        The root k is not in the left or right subtree. The cost for the edge from the root to the parent is not in this recurrence? \n\n        Actually, the entire tree is built for the segment [b,e). The parent of the root of [b,e) is outside, so the edge from the parent to the root is not in this recurrence. \n\n        But the recurrence for the entire tree (the whole set [0,n)) does not have a parent, so that edge is not present. \n\n        However, the cost for the edge from the root to the left child and to the right child is included in fixed_cost_left and fixed_cost_right. \n\n        And the cost for the edge from the parent of the entire tree to the root of the entire tree is not included because the entire tree has no parent. \n\n        Therefore, the recurrence is complete.\n\n        But note: the cost for the entire tree is the sum over edges of the cut at that edge. \n\n        The edge from the root to the left child: cut between [b,k) and the rest -> fixed_cost_left(b,k)\n        The edge from the root to the right child: cut between [k+1,e) and the rest -> fixed_cost_right(k+1,e)\n\n        And the cost for the edge from the parent of the entire tree to the root is not included because the entire tree has no parent.\n\n        So the recurrence is as above.\n\n        However, the provided code does not use this form. It uses the acc with four terms. \n\n        But we can see that:\n\n            fixed_cost_left(b,k) = acc(b,k,0,b) + acc(b,k,k,n)\n            = [sum_{x in [b,k), y in [0,b)} c_{x,y}] + [sum_{x in [b,k), y in [k,n)} c_{x,y}]\n            = sum_{x in [b,k)} [ sum_{y in [0,b) U [k,n)} c_{x,y} ]\n            = sum_{x in [b,k)} [ total_x - sum_{y in [b,k)} c_{x,y} ]   as above.\n\n        So they are the same.\n\n        Now, can we optimize the recurrence to O(n^2) using Knuth? \n\n        The conditions for Knuth optimization in optimal BST: \n\n            We have: \n                dp[i][j] = min_{i<=k<=j} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + w(i,j)\n\n            and if w(i,j) satisfies: \n                - quadrangle inequality\n                - and is monotonic\n\n            then we can use that the optimal k is between the optimal k for [i][j-1] and [i+1][j].\n\n        In our case, the cost added is:\n\n            w(i,j,k) = fixed_cost_left(i,k) + fixed_cost_right(k+1,j) \n                       = [ (sum_{x in [i,k)} T[x] - acc(i,k,i,k)) + (sum_{x in [k+1,j)} T[x] - acc(k+1,j,k+1,j)) ]\n\n        But note: this cost does not depend on the tree structure, only on the segment and the split. \n\n        However, the cost w(i,j,k) is not of the form of a function that is added once for the entire segment (like w(i,j) in the classical optimal BST) but depends on the split k. \n\n        Therefore, the classical Knuth optimization does not apply directly.\n\n        Given the constraints (total n<=200000) but the worst-case test case has n=200000, and the O(n^3) is too slow, we must use a more efficient method.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. This means that the sum of the sizes of the test cases is 200000. \n\n        However, the worst-case test case has n=200000, and then the DP has about n^2/2 = 20e6 states? and then the inner loop O(n) -> 2e12 operations, which is too many in Python.\n\n        Therefore, we must use a different approach.\n\n        There is a known solution for this problem: it is called the \"Garsia-Wachs\" algorithm? But that is for when the cost is only on the leaves.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the cost function is the total cut and the tree is a BST, and use a greedy or other method.\n\n        But the problem is from a contest, and there is an efficient solution.\n\n        However, the provided code is O(n^3) and the constraints say n<=200000, so it will not run in time.\n\n        But wait: the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\"\n\n        This means that if we have many test cases, the sum of the n's is 200000. \n\n        For example, if we have 10000 test cases, then the average n is 20. Then the DP for one test case: O(n^3) = 8000, and for 10000 test cases: 8000 * 10000 = 80e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the intended solution is to loop over test cases and for each test case do an O(n^3) DP, because the sum of n is 200000, but note: the sum of n is the total number of candies over test cases. \n\n        However, the DP in the code is not over the number of candies in one test case, but over the segment [0,n) and the number of states is O(n^2) and the inner loop O(n) -> O(n^3) per test case. \n\n        For a test case with n=2000, the number of states is about 2e6, and the inner loop 2000 -> 4e9 operations, which is too many in Python.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code will not work for the worst-case test case with n=2000 (which is within the total sum 200000, because 2000<200000).\n\n        But the total sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n in a test case can be 200000? \n\n        However, the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so if one test case has n=200000, then there is only one test case. \n\n        And for n=200000, the DP would have about (200000)^2 / 2 = 20e9 states, and each state does an inner loop of 200000 -> 4e15, which is too slow.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code is not efficient.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        We are to complete the TODO and also add the loop for t.\n\n        So we will output the completed TODO and the loop for t, even though it is not efficient for the worst-case.\n\n        Or is there a note that the total n over test cases is the total number of candies, and the sum of the squares of n might be large? \n\n        The problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\"\n\n        So the sum of the values of n (the number of candies in each test case) is 200000.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum n in a test case can be 200000, but then there is only one test case.\n\n        And the provided code will not handle n=200000.\n\n        However, the sample test cases have n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5.\n\n        So we output the code as provided, with the TODO completed and the loop for t added.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read t.\n          2. For each test case:\n               - read n\n               - read the matrix\n               - build the 2D prefix sum S (which is n x n)\n               - then run the DP and output the parent array.\n\n        But note: the 2D prefix sum: we are building it in-place. The matrix is n x n, and n can be up to 200000? Then the matrix has 4e10 entries, which is too many.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot build a 200000 x 200000 matrix.\n\n        We must use a different approach.\n\n        The acc function only needs the global 2D prefix sum array. But if n is 200000, then the matrix is 200000x200000, which is 40e9 elements, and each integer is 4 or 8 bytes -> 160e9 bytes or 320e9 bytes, which is too much.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid building the matrix.\n\n        How to compute the acc function without the matrix? \n\n        We have the function acc(i1,i2,j1,j2) = sum_{i=i1}^{i2-1} sum_{j=j1}^{j2-1} c_{i,j}\n\n        We can precompute a 2D prefix sum array, but its size is n x n, which is too big for n=200000.\n\n        We need to compute the values on the fly. \n\n        But the matrix is given as input. We cannot store it.\n\n        Alternative: we can use a 1D array for the matrix in flattened form? But the size is 40e9 entries, which is too big.\n\n        Therefore, we must use a different recurrence.\n\n        We can precompute the following arrays:\n\n            T[i] = sum_{j} c_{i,j}   # the total for row i\n\n            and \n\n            We also need the sum over a submatrix. \n\n        But without storing the matrix, we cannot compute the submatrix sum.\n\n        However, the matrix is given as input. We have to read it. \n\n        The size of the matrix: 200000 * 200000 = 40e9 integers, which is 40e9 * 4 = 160e9 bytes = 160 GB, which is too much.\n\n        Therefore, the intended solution must work without storing the entire matrix.\n\n        There is a known solution for this problem: \n            It is called the \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" with weights on the edges between pairs, and it can be solved in O(n^2) using the Knuth optimization, and the cost function can be computed in O(1) per state if we precompute some prefix sums.\n\n        But we need to compute the cost for a given set S = [b,e) quickly: \n\n            cost(S) = (sum_{i in S} T[i]) - acc(S,S)   # for the cut of S: cut(S) = sum_{i in S} T[i] - 2 * acc(S,S) ? \n            Actually, cut(S) = sum_{i in S} T[i] - acc(S,S)   because: \n                cut(S) = sum_{i in S, j not in S} c_{i,j} = sum_{i in S} T[i] - sum_{i in S, j in S} c_{i,j} = sum_{i in S} T[i] - acc(S,S)\n\n        So if we can compute acc(S,S) quickly, then we can compute cut(S) in O(1).\n\n        How to compute acc(S,S) for S=[b,e) quickly? \n\n            acc(S,S) = sum_{i=b}^{e-1} sum_{j=b}^{e-1} c_{i,j}\n\n        This is the sum of the submatrix [b,e) x [b,e). \n\n        We can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix, but that requires O(n^2) space, which is too much for n=200000.\n\n        Therefore, we must find another way.\n\n        Note: the matrix is not stored, but we can read it once and then build the prefix sum? But the space is O(n^2), which is 40e9 integers, too much.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the total sum over all test cases of n is 200000, but that is the sum of the sizes, not the sum of the squares.\n\n        We are stuck.\n\n        However, the sample test cases are small.\n\n        Given the problem constraints and the provided code, and the fact that the total n over test cases is 200000, but the matrix for one test case with n=200000 requires 200000*200000=40e9 integers, which is too much, we must assume that the intended solution does not store the entire matrix.\n\n        There is a known efficient solution in C++ that uses O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space, but that is for n<=2000. \n\n        The problem says n<=200000, so that won't work.\n\n        Therefore, there must be a different approach.\n\n        After checking known problems: \n            This problem is known as: \"CEOI, 2001\" or \"Binary search tree\" in SPOJ, but with a different cost function.\n\n        Actually, the cost function in this problem is: \n            sum_{i<j} c_{ij} * (depth(i) + depth(j) - 2 * depth(LCA(i,j)))\n            = sum_{i} depth(i) * (sum_{j} c_{ij}) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_{ij} * depth(LCA(i,j))\n\n        = sum_{i} depth(i) * T[i] - 2 * [ sum_{k} depth(k) * (sum_{i in left_k} sum_{j in right_k} c_{ij}) ]\n\n        But this doesn't help.\n\n        Given the time, and since the problem asks for the missing parts in the provided code, we will output the completed TODO and the loop for t, and hope that the test cases are small.\n\n        But the matrix for n=200000 is too big.\n\n        The problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000. This means that the total number of candies in all test cases is 200000. \n\n        Therefore, the matrix for one test case has size n x n, and the sum of the sizes of the matrices is sum_{test cases} n^2. \n\n        This is not bounded by 200000. \n\n        For example, one test case with n=200000, then the matrix has 200000^2 = 40e9 integers.\n\n        So the input size is at least 40e9 integers, which is 40e9*4=160e9 bytes, which is 160 GB, which is too much.\n\n        Therefore, the intended solution must work with a sparse representation or without storing the matrix.\n\n        But the matrix is given as input.\n\n        We must read the matrix row by row and build the 2D prefix sum without storing the entire matrix? \n\n        How to build the 2D prefix sum without storing the matrix? \n\n        We can compute the 2D prefix sum on the fly by reading each row and then discarding it, but then we lose the matrix and cannot compute the acc function for arbitrary submatrices.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store only the 2D prefix sum array, which is also n x n, so same space.\n\n        Therefore, we are stuck.\n\n        Given the provided code and the TODO, we will complete the code as follows:\n\n            - Add the loop for t.\n            - Complete the TODO: for the case j>0 and i==0: S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        And hope that the test cases are very small.\n\n        Or the intended solution is for small n.\n\n        The sample test cases: n=2,3,4,5.\n\n        So for the given sample, it will work.\n\n        Therefore, the missing parts are:\n\n            program1: \n                - We must read t and loop for t.\n                - Complete the TODO: in the prefix sum, for the case j>0 and i==0: S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        But note: the code after the TODO has:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                        S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                    elif i > 0:\n                        S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                    elif j > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We complete the TODO with: \n                        S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        And then we must add the loop for t.\n\n        How to add the loop for t? \n\n            t = I()[0]   # since I() reads a list of integers, and the first integer is t.\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = I()[0]\n                l = I()   # but then we read n integers for the next n lines? \n\n        Actually, the next part: \n\n            l2 = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                row = list of n integers\n                but the code currently: \n\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n                            S[i][j] = c\n\n            But we have to read n lines.\n\n        The current code reads n and then reads n lines.\n\n        We will put the entire code for one test case inside the loop.\n\n        But note: the matrix S is defined inside the test case loop.\n\n        So the completed code for program1.py is:\n\n            I = lambda: [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n            t = I()[0]\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = I()[0]\n                # Read the matrix\n                S = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    row = I()\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        S[i][j] = row[j]\n\n                # Build prefix sum in S in-place\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                        elif i > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                        elif j > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]   # TODO completed\n\n                # ... the rest of the code (the function acc, the DP, and the label, and then print the solution)\n\n        But note: the function acc and the DP are defined inside the loop? \n\n        Actually, the function acc is defined inside the loop? \n\n        We can define the function acc outside the loop because it does not change.\n\n        But the array S is changing per test case.\n\n        So we can leave it inside.\n\n        However, the recursive DP and the label function are defined inside the loop.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the recursion depth: for n=2000, the recursion depth might be 2000, which is acceptable in Python with increased recursion limit? \n\n        But we hope that the test cases are small.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the TODO and the loop for t.\n\n        But the problem also has program2.py? \n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n        But in the input, we only have program1.py provided.\n\n        And the output format: \n            { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n        What is program2.py? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So program2.py is a separate program that reads the output of program1.py and does something? \n\n        But the problem only asks for the description of the tree, which is printed by program1.py.\n\n        And program2.py is not provided.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to output for program1.py.\n\n        But the output format requires both.\n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        And for program2.py, if there is no missing code, then we output empty string.\n\n        But we are not given program2.py.\n\n        Re-read the problem: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        So both programs have missing parts.\n\n        But in the input, only program1.py is provided.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        The sample output format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        Since we are not given program2.py, we assume it is not needed and output empty string for program2.\n\n        Or perhaps program2.py is not used in this problem? \n\n        The command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" \n\n        This pipes the output of program1.py to program2.py.\n\n        The problem says: \"runs correctly\"\n\n        What is program2.py? It might be a program that checks the output.\n\n        But the problem does not provide program2.py.\n\n        Given the information, we only have program1.py to complete.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py the completed code (the TODO and the loop for t) and for program2.py an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n        And in JSON format.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n            program1: the string for the missing part in program1.py: which is the TODO and the loop for t.\n\n        However, the provided code for program1.py already has the TODO missing and the loop for t missing.\n\n        We are to output the missing lines or blocks.\n\n        The missing block in program1.py is:\n\n            - The outer loop for t.\n            - The TODO line.\n\n        But the TODO is a single line.\n\n        How to output? \n\n            We output the exact code that is missing.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing part is:\n\n            We need to add at the very beginning: reading t and then loop for t.\n\n            And in the prefix sum loop, add the line for the TODO.\n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n\n            S = ... \n\n        We change that to:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                S = ...\n\n        and then in the prefix sum, add the line.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n                        S[i][j] = c\n\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                        elif i > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                        elif j > 0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]   # this line is the TODO\n\n                ... the rest of the code (from the function acc to the print)\n\n        But note: the function acc and the DP are inside the loop.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        For program2.py, since we are not given any code, we output an empty string.\n\n        However, the problem says \"program2.py\", so we must have been given it? \n\n        In the user input, only program1.py is provided.\n\n        Therefore, we assume program2.py is"
