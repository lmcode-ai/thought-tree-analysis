    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe note that the problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values defined by the sign of the subarray sum and the length.\n\nThe provided code uses a dynamic programming approach with coordinate compression and Fenwick trees (or segment trees) for efficient range maximum queries.\n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n (inclusive), we compute dp[i] as the maximum value we can achieve for the prefix ending at i.\n\nThe current code sets:\n    dp[i] = max(i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n\nThen it updates the Fenwick trees with:\n    pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n    nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n\nBut then there is a TODO: update dmx (a dictionary that maps prefix sums to the best dp value so far for that prefix sum).\n\nWe should update dmx[pref[i]] to be the maximum between the current value (if any) and dp[i]. However, note that the condition in the problem says: if we have the same prefix sum, we can use the best dp value for that prefix.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the problem says that when s=0, the value of the subarray is 0. However, in the recurrence, we have a term that uses dmx: \n    dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)\nwhich corresponds to the case when we have a subarray from j to i such that the sum of that subarray is 0 (because pref[i] - pref[j] = 0) and then we can use the value 0 for that subarray? Actually, note that the recurrence already includes the possibility of having a segment that ends at i and has a sum of 0? \n\nBut looking at the recurrence for dp[i]:\n    dp[i] = max( ... , dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n\nThis term is for the case when we end a segment at i and the entire segment from the last occurrence of the same prefix sum (so that the segment in between sums to 0) and then we use the value 0 for that segment? Actually, the recurrence is built so that we consider:\n\nOption 1: positive segment: i + (dp[j] - j) for j with pref[j] < pref[i] (because then the segment j+1..i has positive sum) -> then we get (i - j) for the segment and then add dp[j]? Actually, the value of the segment is (i - j) and then we add dp[j]. So the total is dp[j] + (i - j). But note: in the Fenwick tree for positive (pfen) we store dp[j] - j. Then when we query, we get max_{j} (dp[j]-j) and then we add i -> so we get i + (dp[j]-j) = dp[j] + (i-j).\n\nSimilarly, for negative segments: we have (j..i) has negative sum -> then the value is -(i-j). Then the total would be dp[j] - (i-j). In the Fenwick tree for negative (nfen) we store dp[j]+j. Then when we query, we get max_{j} (dp[j]+j) and then subtract i -> so we get (dp[j]+j) - i = dp[j] - (i-j).\n\nAnd the third option: when the segment from j+1 to i has sum 0 -> then the value is 0. Then the total is dp[j]. But note: we are storing by prefix sums. If we have the same prefix at j and i, then the segment j+1..i has sum 0. So we can set dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]) for any j with pref[j] = pref[i]. However, we want the best dp[j] for the same prefix. So we maintain a dictionary dmx for the prefix sums.\n\nTherefore, after computing dp[i], we must update dmx for the current prefix sum pref[i] to be the maximum between the current value and dp[i].\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut note: we are using -INF as the initial value. We have defined INF = 1<<30, which is 2^30 (about 1e9). However, the constraints say that n can be up to 500000 and the values can be as large as 1e9, so the dp values can be as large as 500000 (if all segments are positive) which is 5e5. But 2^30 is about 1e9, so it's safe. However, we are using -INF. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we are iterating about 500000 times. We are updating the Fenwick trees and the dictionary. The dictionary update is O(1). So we can do:\n\n    if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the current code uses:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we are only updating when dp[i] is greater than the current value. Therefore, we can write:\n\n    if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition above the TODO is: \n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)\n\nSo we can simply do:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]   # because we are only updating when it's greater? \n\nBut wait: what if there are multiple indices with the same prefix? We want the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. So we should take the maximum. However, the condition above the TODO is checking if dp[i] is greater than the current value. So if it is, we update. Otherwise, we skip.\n\nBut the code above the TODO is:\n\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we only update when dp[i] is greater. Therefore, we can write:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if we have two indices with the same prefix and the first one has a larger dp? Then we don't update. But we want the maximum. So we should set it to the maximum. However, the condition is that we only update when dp[i] is greater. So we are setting it to the current dp[i] which is the maximum so far? Actually, we are iterating from left to right. It is possible that an earlier index j with the same prefix has a larger dp[j] than a later one? Then we don't want to update to a smaller value. But the condition is: we update only when we have a larger value. So we are storing the maximum.\n\nBut note: we are iterating i from 1 to n. We want to store the best dp[j] for the prefix at j. When we compute a new dp[i], we compare it with the current best for that prefix. If it's greater, we update.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition above the TODO is already checking that dp[i] is greater. So we can simply assign.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut what if we have multiple indices with the same prefix? We want the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. The condition above the TODO ensures that we only update when we have a new maximum. So we can write:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code is inside the loop for i from 1 to n, and inside the if condition.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: minimum operations to turn all numbers to zero.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    for i in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().split()\n        if s.count(\"0\"):\n            print(n-s.count(\"0\"))\n        else:\n            for i in s:\n                if s.count(i)>1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\nWe note that if there is at least one zero, then we can use the zeros to turn other numbers to zero? Actually, the provided code prints n - (number of zeros) when there is at least one zero. Why?\n\nExample: if we have [0,1,2], then we can do:\n  Operation1: choose 0 and 1 -> since they are different, we change both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,2] (then we have two zeros)\n  Operation2: choose 0 and 2 -> change both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 2 operations.\n\nBut the code prints n - count(0) = 3 - 1 = 2 -> which is correct.\n\nBut what if there are no zeros? Then we enter the else branch.\n\nWe are iterating over each element i in s. If we find any element that appears more than once, then we do something (and break out of the loop? because we are in a for-else). But note: the else branch of the for loop is executed only if the loop did not break. So if we find an element that appears more than once, we break and then we don't execute the else.\n\nWhat should we do when we find an element that appears more than once? The note in the problem says: if we have two equal numbers, we can change one of them to zero in one operation. Then we have a zero. Then we can use that zero to change the rest? So the total operations would be n (because we first create one zero in one operation, then we have n-1 nonzeros and we can change each nonzero to zero by pairing it with the zero, which takes n-1 operations -> total n operations).\n\nBut the example: [1,1,3] -> \n  Operation1: change one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,3] -> then we have one zero. Then we do:\n      Operation2: change 0 and 1 -> [0,0,3] \n      Operation3: change 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0] -> total 3 operations? \nBut n=3, so we would output 3? \n\nBut the example in the note says the minimum operations is 4? \n\nWait, the example in the note is:\n\n  [1,2,3] -> \n      Operation1: change a1 and a2 (1 and 2) -> both become 1 -> [1,1,3]\n      Operation2: change the two ones -> one becomes 0 -> [0,1,3]\n      Operation3: change 0 and 1 -> becomes 0 -> [0,0,3]\n      Operation4: change 0 and 3 -> becomes 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\nSo 4 operations.\n\nBut if we have two ones initially, we can do:\n\n  Operation1: change the two ones -> one becomes 0 -> [0,1,3] -> then 3 operations: total 1+2 = 3? \n\nBut wait: the operation requires two distinct indices. After the first operation, we have [0,1,3]. Then we can do:\n  Operation2: change the 0 and 1 -> both become 0 -> [0,0,3] -> then \n  Operation3: change the 0 and 3 -> both become 0 -> [0,0,0] -> total 3.\n\nSo the example in the note had to first create two ones? \n\nTherefore, if we have a duplicate, we can create a zero in one operation, and then we have n-1 nonzeros and one zero -> then we need n-1 operations to turn the rest to zero -> total n operations? \n\nBut wait: we have n elements. After the first operation, we have one zero and the rest nonzeros. Then we can use the zero to turn each nonzero to zero: each operation turns one nonzero to zero (by pairing the zero and the nonzero: then we set the nonzero to min(0, nonzero)=0). So we need one operation per nonzero. Initially, we have n nonzeros. After the first operation, we have n-1 nonzeros and one zero. Then we need n-1 operations. Total: 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\nBut in the example [1,1,3]: \n  Operation1: change the two ones -> one becomes 0 -> [0,1,3] -> then we have two nonzeros (1 and 3). Then we need two more operations: total 3.\n\nSo the total is n? But n=3 -> 3 operations.\n\nBut the example in the note for [1,2,3] took 4 operations. Why? Because they didn't have duplicates. \n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  If there is at least one zero, then we can use the zeros to turn the nonzeros to zero without creating a zero first. So the number of operations is the number of nonzeros: n - count(0).\n\n  If there are no zeros, then:\n      If there is a duplicate (at least one number appears at least twice): then we can create a zero in one operation, and then we have n-1 nonzeros -> total operations = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n      If there are no duplicates (all distinct): then we cannot create a zero in one operation? How?\n\n        Example: [1,2,3] (all distinct). \n          We can do:\n            Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> change both to min(1,2)=1 -> [1,1,3] -> now we have duplicates.\n            Then we can do:\n            Operation2: choose the two ones -> change one to 0 -> [0,1,3] -> then we need two more operations -> total 4.\n\n        Alternatively, we could do:\n            Operation1: choose 1 and 3 -> change both to 1 -> [1,2,1] -> then we have duplicates (two ones) -> then Operation2: change two ones -> one becomes 0 -> [0,2,1] -> then we need two more operations -> total 4.\n\n        So the minimum operations is n+1? \n\n        The note says: \n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\n        So the code already prints n+1 in the case of no duplicates.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in the for loop is: we break and print n (if we found a duplicate) and then we break out of the loop so that the else branch of the for loop is not executed.\n\n        But note: the code is:\n\n            for i in s:\n                if s.count(i)>1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\n        We want to break and print n. So we can do:\n\n            print(n)\n            break\n\n        But note: we are iterating over each element. We only need to find one duplicate. Once we find one, we output n and break. Then we don't run the else branch.\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n            print(n)\n            break\n\n        However, what if there are multiple duplicates? We break at the first duplicate.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over the list. The first duplicate we find, we break.\n\n        But what if the list is [1,2,3,1]? Then the first element is 1, and we check s.count(1) which is 2 -> duplicate -> we break and print n (which is 4). That is correct: 4 operations.\n\n        But what if the list is [1,2,3,4]? Then no duplicate, so we don't break and then we print n+1 (5) at the else.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n            print(n)\n            break\n\nBut note: the variable i is used in two loops? The outer loop is for test cases, and the inner loop uses the same variable i? That might cause an issue? Actually, the inner loop variable is i, but the outer loop variable is also i? \n\nIn the outer loop: \n    for i in range(int(input())):\n        ...\n        for i in s:\n            ...\n\nThis is valid in Python, but the outer i will be overwritten. However, we don't use the outer i after the inner loop. But to avoid confusion, we can change the inner variable? But the problem says: do not change the entire program. We are only to fill the missing lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave it as is. The code will run correctly.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n            print(n)\n            break\n\nBut note: the problem says: output only the missing code in the specified format.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            print(n)\\n            break\"}\n\nBut note: the missing code in program1.py is inside an if block and indented. We must preserve the indentation.\n\nIn program1.py, the current code at the TODO is:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the TODO is a comment. We remove the comment and put the code.\n\nIn program2.py, the current code at the TODO is:\n\n            for i in s:\n                if s.count(i)>1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            for i in s:\n                if s.count(i)>1:\n                    print(n)\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\nBut note: the break is important to avoid the else branch.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the two lines that are missing: the print and the break, with the same indentation.\n\nBut note: the code in program2.py uses 4-space indentation. We output:\n\n            print(n)\n            break\n\nBut the original code has 8 spaces at the beginning of the for loop and 12 for the if. So the missing code should be at 12 and 12? Actually, the if block is at 12, and the missing code should be at 16? But the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire block.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines with the same indentation as the if.\n\nIn the given code for program2.py, the if statement is indented by 12 spaces (relative to the outer for). So the missing code should be indented by 12? Actually, the if block is:\n\n                if s.count(i)>1:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with two lines: \n                    print(n)\n                    break\n\nSo each of these lines should be indented by 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. However, we must match the surrounding code.\n\nIn the provided code for program2.py, the if block is indented by 12 spaces (from the outer for) and the body of the if is indented by 16. So we output:\n\n                    print(n)\n                    break\n\nBut note: the entire program2.py code uses 4-space indentation. The outer for loop is at 0, then the inner for loop is at 4, then the if is at 8, then the body of the if is at 12? Actually, let me count:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().split()\n    if s.count(\"0\"):\n        print(n-s.count(\"0\"))\n    else:\n        for i in s:\n            if s.count(i)>1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            print(n+1)\n\nThe else branch of the outer if is at 4 spaces. Then the inner for is at 8, then the if inside the for is at 12, then the TODO is at 16. So the missing code should be at 16.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n                    print(n)\n                    break\n\nBut note: the break is necessary to break out of the inner for loop so that the else of the for loop is not executed.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"                    print(n)\\n                    break\"}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the code is:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSo the missing code is one line: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\". The indentation is 8 spaces? Actually, the outer for loop is at 4, then the body of the for loop (for i in range(1, n+1)) is at 8, then the if is at 12, then the body of the if is at 16? But the TODO is at 16. So we output:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the current code in the TODO is at 16 spaces. So we output:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the string that would replace the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"                    print(n)\\n                    break\"}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            ... (some code)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is one line at the same indentation as the TODO (which is 16 spaces). So we output:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is two lines at 16 spaces:\n\n                    print(n)\n                    break\n\nBut note: the break must be at the same level as the print.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as a single string with a newline.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n  \"program2\": \"                    print(n)\\n                    break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly. And output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\n\nWe output the JSON string.\n\nBut note: the string for program2 has a newline. We represent it as \\n.\n\nLet me write the exact string for program2: \n  \"                    print(n)\\n                    break\"\n\nBut the original code in program2.py has 16 spaces for the body of the if? Actually, 16 spaces from the beginning of the line? \n\nAlternatively, we can count the spaces:\n\nThe outer if-else is at 4 spaces (the else branch). Then the inner for is at 8 spaces. Then the if inside the for is at 12 spaces. Then the body of the if is at 16 spaces. So the two lines we are adding are at 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the line we are adding is at 16 spaces? \n\nThe outer for loop (for i in range(1, n+1)) is at 8 spaces. Then the body of the for loop is at 12. Then the if condition is at 12, and the body of the if is at 16. So yes.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"                    print(n)\\n                    break\"}"
