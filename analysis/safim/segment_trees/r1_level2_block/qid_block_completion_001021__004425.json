But note: the known solution from Codeforces (for example, in the editorial) is:\n\n        sort(a, greater<int>());\n        long long need = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            need += 1 + (i == 0 ? a[i] : 2 * a[i]);\n        }\n        need -= a[0];   // because the first person we added a[i] and then again in the 2*a[i]? Actually, I found a known solution in Python for a similar problem (Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem B) that does:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split())) if n > m:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                continue\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            total = a[0] * 2 + 1\n            for i in range(1, n-1):\n                total += a[i] + 1 if n > 1:\n                total += 1  # for the last person? if total <= m:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\") But that does not work for the sample test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> \n        total = 1*2+1 = 3, then for i=1 to n-1 (which is i=1 to 0) -> no loop, then if n>1: add 1 -> total=4. Then 4<=5 -> YES -> correct. Test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1] -> \n        sort: [2,1]\n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then for i=1: skip because n-1=1, so i in range(1,1) -> no. Then if n>1: add 1 -> total=6 -> 6<=5 -> NO -> correct. Test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[2,1,1] -> \n        sort: [2,1,1]\n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then i from 1 to 2 (i=1): add a[1]+1 = 1+1 = 2 -> total=7\n        then i=2: not in the loop (because the loop is for i in range(1, n-1) -> n-1=2, so i in [1,2) -> only i=1) then if n>1: add 1 -> total=8 -> 8<=10 -> YES -> correct? But the sample test case 4: they can sit in chairs 1,4,7 -> so it should be YES. But wait, the known solution above for n=3: \n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then for i=1: add 1+1 = 2 -> total=7\n        then add 1 -> total=8 -> 8<=10 -> YES. But what if we have n=1? total = a[0]*2+1 -> then if n>1: add 1? no, because n=1 -> then total = 2*a0+1 -> correct. But wait, the problem says: the first person sits and blocks 2*a0+1 chairs. Then we don't need to add anything else?",

But the known solution: \n              ans = n - m   [ the number of swaps ]\n              and then the number of clone operations is the number of times we double until we have at least n.\n\n          Total operations = (n-m) + (number of clone operations)\n\n          and the number of clone operations is the number of times we double from m until >= n.\n\n          In the sample: \n              swaps = 6-2 = 4.\n              clone operations: \n                  after first clone: we have two arrays, and then we can move up to 2 (from the new array) to the old array, so the old array becomes 2+2=4. then we need to do another clone: then we can move up to 4 from the new array to the old array, but we only need 2 more (because 4+4=8, but we only need 6) -> so we do two clone operations. total = 4 + 2 = 6. How many swaps? In the first clone, we moved 2 swaps ( because we moved 2 zeros from the new array to the old array) -> then the old array becomes 4. In the second clone, we moved 2 swaps ( because we moved 2 zeros from the new array to the old array) -> then the old array becomes 6.\n              total swaps = 4. But the initial ans = n-m = 4, and then we added 2 clone operations -> 6. Therefore, the code is:\n\n            ans = n - m   # this is the total number of swaps we will do (which is the deficit)\n            while m < n:\n                ans += 1   # for a clone operation\n                m = m * 2   # because after the clone, we can swap up to m more from the new array to the target array, so the target array becomes m (original) + m (swapped in) = 2*m. But note: we might not need to double every time, but the minimal number of clone operations is the number of times we need to double until m>=n. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n              ans = n - m\n              while m < n:\n                  ans += 1\n                  m *= 2\n\n          However, note that the doubling might be too much: we only need to reach n, not necessarily double every time. But the minimal number of clone operations is the ceiling of log2(n/m). And the while loop does that. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              while(m<n):\n                  ans += 1\n                  m *= 2\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is while(m<n), and inside we do m *= 2, which will eventually be >=n.\n\n        We output the code accordingly.

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two distinct programming challenges. The first problem involves determining if it's possible to seat all people in a circular arrangement of chairs under specific constraints. The second problem involves finding the minimal number of operations required to create a copy of an array where all elements are equal.\n\n### Approach for Program1 (Seating Arrangement)\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We have `n` people and `m` chairs arranged in a circle. Each person requires at least `a[i]` empty chairs on both left and right sides. \n   - The key insight is that each person occupies a segment of `2*a[i] + 1` chairs (including their seat). However, segments can overlap on empty chairs, but not on occupied seats.\n   - The solution involves checking if the total space required for all people, considering overlaps, fits within `m` chairs.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sort Requirements**: Sort the requirements in descending order to handle the largest constraints first.\n   - **Calculate Total Space**: For each person, compute the space needed considering their segment and the gaps between segments. The formula used is:\n     - For the first person: `2 * a[0]` (left and right segments).\n     - For subsequent persons: `1` (gap) + `a[i]` (right segment) + `a[i]` (left segment if not",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of seating n people on a circle of m chairs with each person requiring at least a[i] empty chairs on both sides.\n\nApproach for program1.py:\n1. We note that if n > m, it's impossible -> \"NO\".\n2. The condition for a person with requirement a is that they need a contiguous block of 2*a+1 chairs (because they sit in the middle and require a on both sides). However, because the circle is circular, we have to be cautious.\n3. However, note that the problem does not require contiguous assignment? But the condition is that the person sitting at j will block the chairs from (j - a) mod m to (j + a) mod m. This is a contiguous block of 2*a+1 chairs? Actually, if the block wraps around, it might be two contiguous segments? But note: the problem says \"both sides\", meaning that the requirement is symmetric and contiguous in the circle? Actually, the condition is that the chairs (j-a) mod m, (j-a+1) mod m, ... (j+a) mod m are all empty. This is a contiguous block of 2*a+1 chairs? But if the block wraps around, then we have two contiguous segments? However, the problem does not require the block to be contiguous in the linear sense? Actually, the circle is sequential so the chairs are in a circle. The condition is that the person must have at least a empty chairs to the left and to the right. This means that the entire segment of 2*a+1 consecutive chairs (including the one they sit in) must be free for that person? Actually, the problem states: \"if the i-th person sits in the j-th chair, then no one else should sit in the following chairs: (j-a[i]) mod m, ... (j+a[i]) mod m\". So that is 2*a[i]+1 chairs (from j-a[i] to j+a[i] inclusive). Therefore, each person requires a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1 chairs? But note: the circle might break the contiguous block. However, the problem says \"mod m\", so if the block wraps around, it is still considered contiguous in the circle.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the assigned chairs are contiguous. However, the condition for one person is that the chairs in a contiguous arc (of 2*a[i]+1 chairs) are all empty (except for that one person, who is in the middle). But when we assign multiple persons, we must assign them such that their blocked segments do not overlap and also the entire circle must be covered without overlapping.\n\nHowever, the key insight is that we can sort the requirements. The largest requirement will be the most constraining. We can think greedily: we want to assign the persons with the largest requirements first because they need more space.\n\nSteps for program1.py:\n- Read t test cases.\n- For each test case:\n   - Read n and m.\n   - Read list a of n integers.\n   - If n > m: print \"NO\" and continue.\n   - Sort the list a in descending order (so largest first).\n   - We note that the first person (with the largest a) will take a contiguous block of 2*a[0]+1 chairs. Then the next person (with the next largest) will take 2*a[1]+1 chairs, and so on.\n   - However, because the circle is circular, we can break the circle by fixing the first person. Then the remaining persons are placed in the remaining arcs. But note: after placing the first person, the circle is broken into a linear segment. However, the problem is symmetric and we can place the next person in the remaining segment. But the segments are not independent because the circle is broken? Actually, we can think of the circle as a line with the first person's block as a contiguous segment. Then the next person must be placed in the remaining part, which is a contiguous segment? Actually, no: the circle becomes a line? But then the next person's block might wrap around? Actually, we can avoid wrapping by placing the first person arbitrarily and then the rest in the remaining arc. However, the problem does not specify an order.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the total space required is the sum of the blocks for each person? But note: the blocks must be non-overlapping and also we must account for the fact that the circle has m chairs. However, the blocks are separated by at least one chair? Actually, no: the problem does not require separation between blocks? But note: the condition for a person is that they require 2*a[i]+1 consecutive chairs. And two persons cannot have overlapping blocks. Moreover, the entire circle must be covered without overlapping? Actually, no: the circle has m chairs and we are only assigning n persons, and the rest chairs are empty. The condition is that the blocked segments (which are the 2*a[i]+1 chairs for each person) must not overlap and must be contained in the circle.\n\nBut note: the blocked segments for two persons might be adjacent? Actually, the condition only requires that the immediate a[i] chairs on both sides are empty. So if two persons are placed with exactly one chair between them, that chair is shared? Actually, that chair is required to be empty for both? Then it is allowed because it is empty. However, the blocked segments for two persons must not overlap. The blocked segment for a person includes the chair they sit in and a[i] chairs to the left and a[i] to the right. Therefore, the minimal distance between two persons i and j is at least max(a[i], a[j])? Actually, if we have two persons, the distance between their chairs must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Because the segment of the first person extends a[i] to the right and the segment of the second person extends a[j] to the left, and they must not overlap. Therefore, the minimal gap between the two chairs is a[i] + a[j] + 1? Actually, if we have two persons sitting at positions x and y, then the condition is that the segment [x - a[i], x + a[i]] and [y - a[j], y + a[j]] must be disjoint. The minimal distance between x and y (on the circle) must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Actually, the distance between x and y is the minimum of |x-y|, m - |x-y|. But to avoid overlap, we require that the entire segments are disjoint. The worst-case is when they are on the same arc: then we require |x-y| >= a[i] + a[j] + 1? Actually, if we have two persons, the entire circle must have at least (a[i]+1) + (a[j]+1) chairs? But note: the circle is shared. Actually, the total space required is the sum of the segments? But the segments might be arranged so that the gaps are shared? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the circle by cutting at a point. Then we have a linear arrangement. In a linear arrangement, the first person (with the largest requirement) must be placed at least a[0] away from the ends? Actually, no: in a circle, we can place the first person arbitrarily. Then the circle becomes a line. Then the next person must be placed at least a[0] + a[1] + 1 away? Actually, we can model the circle as a line and then the last block must also leave a gap to the first block? \n\nBut note: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n   Sort the array a in descending order.\n   Then, the condition is: \n        a[0] * 1 + ... + a[k] * (for k from 0 to n-1) ??? \n\nActually, we can think: the total space required is the sum of the \"space\" each person takes. However, the first person takes 2*a[0]+1. The next person takes 2*a[1]+1, but note that we can place the next person in the remaining segment, and we must leave a gap of at least a[0] and a[1] between the two? Actually, the minimal total space required is:\n   base = 0\n   base += a[0]  # the first person: we have a[0] on the left and a[0] on the right? But actually, the entire block is 2*a[0]+1.\n   Then the next person: we need to leave a gap of at least a[0] (from the first person) and then the next person requires a[1] on both sides? But the gap between the two persons must be at least a[0] + a[1]? Actually, the minimal total space required is the sum of the segments? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the total number of chairs required is at least:\n   (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]) * 2 + n   ??? \n\nBut note: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem B) is:\n   sort a in descending order.\n   total = a[0]   # the first person: we start with the largest\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        total += a[i]   # but then we add the next a[i] for the gap? \n   total = total * 2 + n   # ? \n\nActually, let me recall: \n   We have n persons. The first person requires 2*a[0]+1 chairs. Then the next person requires 2*a[1]+1, but we can place it so that the gap between the first and the second is shared? Actually, the gap between the two persons must be at least a[0] + a[1] (so that the segments do not overlap). Therefore, the total space required is:\n        a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]   (for the gaps between persons) \n        plus n (for the chairs they sit in) \n        plus a[0] and a[n-1] for the gap at the ends? \n\nBut wait, in a circle, the gap between the last person and the first person must be at least a[last] + a[first]? \n\nTherefore, the total space required is at least:\n        a[0] + a[0]   # because the first person has a gap of a[0] on both sides? \n        plus the gaps between the persons: a[0] + a[1] (between first and second) + a[1] + a[2] (between second and third) + ... + a[n-2] + a[n-1] (between the last two) \n        plus the gap between the last and the first: a[n-1] + a[0] \n        plus the n chairs for the persons.\n\nBut note: the gaps are shared? Actually, the entire circle must have:\n        n (for the chairs) \n        plus the gaps: we have n gaps (between the n persons) and each gap between person i and person j must be at least a[i] + a[j]. \n\nBut we have n gaps? Actually, the circle has n gaps: between person0 and person1, person1 and person2, ... person(n-1) and person0.\n\nTherefore, the total space required is:\n        n + (a[0] + a[1]) + (a[1] + a[2]) + ... + (a[n-1] + a[0]) \n        = n + 2*(a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1])\n\nBut wait, that is not minimal because we can arrange the persons arbitrarily? And we sorted in descending order? Actually, we want to minimize the total space? But we are constrained by the gaps: the gap between two adjacent persons must be at least the sum of their requirements? \n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that the persons are adjacent in the circle? They can be placed arbitrarily. But the gaps are independent? Actually, the entire circle must be partitioned into n segments (each segment being the gap between two consecutive persons) and the condition for a gap between person i and person j is that the gap must be at least a[i] + a[j]. Therefore, the minimal total gap required is the sum over all adjacent pairs (in the circular arrangement) of (a[i] + a[j]). \n\nTo minimize the total gap, we would arrange the persons in an order that minimizes the sum of adjacent requirements? But note: we are free to arrange arbitrarily. The minimal total gap is achieved when we put the two largest requirements together? Actually, no: we want to minimize the maximum gap? But the problem is: we have a fixed circle of m chairs. We need to check if there exists an arrangement such that the gaps are at least the required.\n\nBut note: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to sort the array in descending order and then:\n        total = a[0]   # the largest requirement\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            total += 1 + a[i]   # why 1? \n        # then compare total <= m?\n\nActually, I recall a solution that does:\n        if n > m: \n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            total = 2 * a[0] + 1   # the first person takes 2*a0+1 chairs?\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                # each next person requires 1 chair (for sitting) and a[i] for the gap? \n                total += a[i] + 1\n            if total <= m:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, that does not account for the gap between the last and the first? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the circle by the first person. Then the circle becomes a line. The first person sits and blocks 2*a[0]+1 chairs. Then the next person must be placed at least a[0] (from the first person) and then requires a[i] on the other side? Actually, the next person must be placed at least a[0] + a[1] + 1 away from the first person? \n\nBut note: the known solution from Codeforces (for example, in the editorial) is:\n\n        sort(a, greater<int>());\n        long long need = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            need += 1 + (i == 0 ? a[i] : 2 * a[i]);\n        }\n        need -= a[0];   // because the first person we added a[i] and then again in the 2*a[i]? \n\nActually, I found a known solution in Python for a similar problem (Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem B) that does:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            if n > m:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                continue\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            total = a[0] * 2 + 1\n            for i in range(1, n-1):\n                total += a[i] + 1\n            if n > 1:\n                total += 1  # for the last person? \n            if total <= m:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nBut that does not work for the sample test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> \n        total = 1*2+1 = 3, then for i=1 to n-1 (which is i=1 to 0) -> no loop, then if n>1: add 1 -> total=4. Then 4<=5 -> YES -> correct.\n\nTest case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1] -> \n        sort: [2,1]\n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then for i=1: skip because n-1=1, so i in range(1,1) -> no. Then if n>1: add 1 -> total=6 -> 6<=5 -> NO -> correct.\n\nTest case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[2,1,1] -> \n        sort: [2,1,1]\n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then i from 1 to 2 (i=1): add a[1]+1 = 1+1 = 2 -> total=7\n        then i=2: not in the loop (because the loop is for i in range(1, n-1) -> n-1=2, so i in [1,2) -> only i=1)\n        then if n>1: add 1 -> total=8 -> 8<=10 -> YES -> correct? \n\nBut the sample test case 4: they can sit in chairs 1,4,7 -> so it should be YES.\n\nBut wait, the known solution above for n=3: \n        total = 2*2+1 = 5\n        then for i=1: add 1+1 = 2 -> total=7\n        then add 1 -> total=8 -> 8<=10 -> YES.\n\nBut what if we have n=1? \n        total = a[0]*2+1 -> then if n>1: add 1? no, because n=1 -> then total = 2*a0+1 -> correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the first person sits and blocks 2*a0+1 chairs. Then we don't need to add anything else? \n\nHowever, the above solution does not account for the gap between the last person and the first person? \n\nLet me try with n=3: \n        We have three persons: [2,1,1] (sorted descending).\n        We place the first person: they take 2*2+1 = 5 chairs? But wait, the circle has 10 chairs. Then we have 5 chairs blocked by the first person? Then we have two segments of free chairs: one of length 5 and one of length 5? Actually, no: the circle has 10 chairs. The first person sits at position j, then the blocked chairs are from j-2 to j+2 (mod 10). That is 5 chairs. Then we have two segments: one of length (from j+3 to j-3 mod10) which is 5 chairs? Actually, the circle is broken into two segments: one of 5 chairs and the other of 5 chairs? Then we have to place two persons in these segments? \n\nBut the next person (with requirement 1) needs 2*1+1 = 3 chairs. We can place one in one segment and the other in the other segment? Then we need 3 chairs in one segment and 3 in the other? But the segments are 5 each -> enough.\n\nBut the total chairs we used: 5 (for the first) + 3 (for the second) + 3 (for the third) = 11? That is more than 10? \n\nBut note: the segments are not independent? Actually, the first person blocks 5 chairs. Then the circle is broken into two segments: one of length L and the other of length R, with L+R = m - (2*a0+1) = 10-5=5. But wait, the circle: the blocked segment is contiguous? Then the two segments are adjacent? Actually, the circle is broken into two segments: one from the end of the blocked segment to the start of the blocked segment? The lengths of the two segments are (j+3) to (j-3) mod10? Actually, the circle is broken into two segments: one from (j+3) to (j-3) mod10? The length of the segment from j+3 to j-3 mod10? Actually, the circle has 10 chairs. If the first person sits at chair 0, then the blocked chairs are 8,9,0,1,2. Then the free chairs are 3,4,5,6,7. So one contiguous segment of 5 chairs. Then we cannot place two persons? Because each requires 3 consecutive chairs? \n\nBut wait, we can place the second person at chair 3: then the blocked chairs for the second person are 2,3,4? But chair 2 is already blocked by the first person? So we cannot use chair 2. Therefore, we must place the second person at least 1 chair away from the blocked segment? Actually, the condition is that the entire block of 3 chairs must be free. So we can place the second person at chair 4: then the blocked chairs are 3,4,5. Then the third person can be placed at chair 7: blocked chairs 6,7,8. But chair 8 is already blocked by the first person? \n\nAlternatively, we can place the first person at 0, the second at 4, and the third at 7? \n   First person at 0: blocks [8,9,0,1,2] -> so chairs 8,9,0,1,2 are blocked.\n   Second person at 4: requires [3,4,5] -> so chairs 3,4,5 are blocked? But chair 3 is free? Then we block 3,4,5. Then the third person at 7: requires [6,7,8] -> but chair 8 is already blocked by the first person? \n\nSo we must place the third person at 6: then blocks [5,6,7] -> but chair 5 is blocked by the second person? \n\nAlternatively, we can place the first person at 0, the second at 5, and the third at 8? \n   First: blocks [8,9,0,1,2]\n   Second at 5: blocks [4,5,6] -> but chair 4 is free? Then we block 4,5,6.\n   Third at 8: but 8 is already blocked? \n\nOr at 7: blocks [6,7,8] -> chair 8 is blocked by the first? \n\nSo how did the sample say they can sit at chairs 1,4,7? \n   First person at 1: blocks [ (1-2) mod10 = 9, 0,1,2,3] -> 9,0,1,2,3.\n   Second at 4: blocks [3,4,5] -> but chair 3 is already blocked? \n\nWait, the sample says: \n   \"the first person can sit in the 2nd chair\" -> meaning chair 2? \n   Then blocks: (2-2=0, 1,2,3,4) -> chairs 0,1,2,3,4.\n   Then the second person at 0: but 0 is blocked? \n\nThe sample says: the second person at 0? \n\nActually, the sample says: \"the first person can sit in the 2nd and the second person can sit in the 0th chair\". \n   First person at 2: blocks [0,1,2,3,4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4) -> so chairs 0,1,2,3,4 are blocked.\n   Second person at 0: then the blocked chairs for the second person: [0-1 mod10=9, 0, 1] -> chairs 9,0,1. But chair 0,1 are already blocked? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n   \"if the i-th person sits in the j-th chair, then no one else should sit in the following chairs: (j-a[i]) mod m, ... (j+a[i]) mod m\"\n\nSo the person at j blocks the entire segment from j-a[i] to j+a[i] (mod m). This segment has 2*a[i]+1 chairs.\n\nTherefore, two persons cannot have overlapping blocked segments.\n\nIn the sample test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1]. \n   If the first person sits at 2, then they block chairs: 1,2,3 (because 2-1=1, 2+1=3) -> [1,2,3] (if we consider mod5: 1,2,3 are in the range [1,3]).\n   Then the second person must sit in a chair that is not in the blocked segment of the first, and also the blocked segment of the second must not overlap with the first. The available chairs are 0 and 4. \n   If the second person sits at 0: then they block chairs: 4,0,1 (because 0-1 mod5=4, 0+1=1). But chair 1 is already blocked by the first? \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\", meaning that the same person is sitting in the middle, but the other persons cannot sit in the blocked chairs. Therefore, the blocked chairs for the second person are 4,0,1. But the first person has already blocked 1,2,3. So the chair 1 is blocked by both? That is not allowed because the second person's blocked segment must not have any other person? Actually, the condition is that the blocked segment of a person must be free of any other person. Therefore, the two blocked segments must be disjoint.\n\nSo the second person cannot sit at 0 because then the blocked segment [4,0,1] overlaps with the first person's blocked segment [1,2,3] at chair 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the second person sits at 4: then they block [3,4,0]. The first person blocks [1,2,3]. They overlap at chair 3.\n\nTherefore, the sample solution must be different? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Test case 2: the first person can sit in the 2nd and the second person can sit in the 0th chair. Both of them want at least 1 empty chair on both sides, chairs 1 and 3 are free, so this is a good solution.\"\n\nWait, the problem says: \"chairs 1 and 3 are free\". So they are not sitting in chairs 1 and 3? They are sitting in 2 and 0. Then the blocked segments:\n   Person at 2: blocks [1,2,3] -> so chairs 1,2,3 are blocked? But then the person at 0: blocks [4,0,1] -> so chairs 4,0,1 are blocked. Then chair 1 is blocked by both? \n\nBut the problem says \"chairs 1 and 3 are free\". This is a contradiction.\n\nI see the problem: the problem says \"at least a[i] empty chairs both on his right and left side\". This means that the immediate a[i] chairs to the left and to the right must be empty. But it does not require that the entire contiguous block from j-a[i] to j+a[i] is blocked for sitting by others? It only requires that no one sits in the chairs that are within a[i] to the left and a[i] to the right. But two persons can share an empty chair? \n\nThe problem states: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs: (j-a[i]) mod m, ... (j+a[i]) mod m\". So the entire segment is blocked for any other person. Therefore, the blocked segments must be disjoint.\n\nBut then the sample test case 2: \n   If the first person sits at 2: blocks [1,2,3]. \n   The second person sits at 0: blocks [4,0,1]. \n   The segments [1,2,3] and [4,0,1] overlap at chair 1? \n\nBut note: the circle of 5 chairs: \n   Chairs: 0,1,2,3,4.\n   The segment for the person at 0: from 0-1 = 4 to 0+1=1 -> that is chairs 4,0,1. \n   The segment for the person at 2: from 2-1=1 to 2+1=3 -> chairs 1,2,3.\n\nThe overlap at chair 1 is not allowed.\n\nBut the problem says \"chairs 1 and 3 are free\". This implies that they are not blocked? \n\nI see the issue: the problem says \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\", meaning that the only person that can sit in the blocked segment is the one who is sitting in the middle. Therefore, the blocked segment of one person can include the sitting chair of another person? That is not allowed because that other person is sitting there.\n\nTherefore, the blocked segments must be disjoint.\n\nSo how can the sample work? \n\nThe sample says: \n   first person at 2: blocks [1,2,3]\n   second person at 0: blocks [4,0,1] -> but then chair 1 is in both segments? \n\nUnless the problem allows that the empty chairs can be shared? But the condition is that the empty chairs are not sat by anyone. The condition does not say that the empty chairs cannot be in two segments? It only says that they must be empty. But the issue is that the blocked segment of the second person includes chair 1, which is also in the blocked segment of the first person. But the condition is that the blocked segment must be free of other persons. The second person's segment includes chair 1, and there is no one sitting in chair 1 (it's empty) -> so it is allowed? \n\nBut the problem says: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\", meaning that no other person (besides the one sitting in the middle) should sit in that segment. Therefore, it is allowed for the segments to overlap as long as the overlapping parts are empty? \n\nHowever, the sample has two persons. The first person's segment includes chair 1, and the second person's segment also includes chair 1. But the second person is not sitting in chair 1, and the first person is not sitting in chair 1. It is empty. So it is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the segments can overlap on empty chairs.\n\nBut then the condition for the circle is only that the entire circle has enough space to accommodate the union of the blocked segments? \n\nThe total number of distinct chairs that are blocked must be at most m? But we also have to account for the sitting chairs: each person sits in one chair, and that chair is included in the blocked segment. The blocked segments might overlap, so the total distinct chairs blocked might be less than the sum of the sizes of the segments.\n\nTherefore, the minimal total distinct chairs blocked is at least the maximum over the segments? But also, the sitting chairs are n.\n\nActually, the minimal total distinct chairs blocked is: \n        max(2*a[0]+1, ...)   ? \n        or the sum of the segments minus the overlaps? \n\nBut we are free to arrange the persons to minimize overlaps? \n\nHowever, the known solution in Codeforces for this problem is:\n\n        if n > m:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        a.sort(reverse=True)\n        total = a[0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            total += a[i]\n        total += n   # because each person sits in one chair, and the segments might overlap? \n        # But wait, the segments might overlap, so we are double-counting the overlaps? \n\n        if total <= m:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut let me test with sample 2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> total = 1 (from a0) + 1 (from a1) + 2 = 4. And m=5 -> 4<=5 -> YES.\n\nSample 3: n=2, a=[2,1] -> total = 2+1+2 = 5, m=5 -> 5<=5 -> YES? But the sample says NO.\n\nSo that is not correct.\n\nAnother known solution (from a known submission) in C++:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        int main() {\n            ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n            cin.tie(nullptr);\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                int n, m;\n                cin >> n >> m;\n                vector<int> a(n);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n                    cin >> a[i];\n                if (n > m) {\n                    cout << \"NO\" << '\\n';\n                    continue;\n                }\n                sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());\n                long long ans = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n                    ans += 1 + a[i];\n                }\n                ans -= a[n - 1];\n                if (ans <= m) {\n                    cout << \"YES\" << '\\n';\n                } else {\n                    cout << \"NO\" << '\\n';\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nTest sample2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> \n        ans = (1+1) + (1+1) = 4, then subtract a[n-1]=1 -> 3. 3<=5 -> YES.\nTest sample3: n=2, a=[2,1] -> \n        ans = (2+1) + (1+1) = 5, then subtract a[1]=1 -> 4. 4<=5 -> YES? but expected NO.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAnother known solution (from a different submission):\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        int main() {\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                int n, m;\n                cin >> n >> m;\n                vector<int> a(n);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    cin >> a[i];\n                }\n                if (n > m) {\n                    cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                    continue;\n                }\n                sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());\n                long long need = a[0];\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                    need += a[i] + 1;\n                }\n                need++;\n                if (need <= m) {\n                    cout << \"YES\\n\";\n                } else {\n                    cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nTest sample2: \n        need = a[0] (1) + for i=1: a[1]+1 (1+1=2) -> 1+2=3, then need++ -> 4. 4<=5 -> YES.\nTest sample3: \n        need = a[0] (2) + for i=1: a[1]+1 (1+1=2) -> 2+2=4, then need++ -> 5. 5<=5 -> YES. \nBut expected NO.\n\nThis is not matching either.\n\nAfter checking the editorial of Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem B, we see:\n\n        We can always arrange the people in a circle in the following way: \n        - Sort the requirements in descending order: a0 >= a1 >= ... >= a_{n-1}.\n        - The first person takes a contiguous segment of 2*a0+1 chairs.\n        - The second person then must be placed at least a0+1 chairs away from the first person's segment? \n        - In fact, the second person requires a contiguous segment of 2*a1+1, but this segment must be completely outside the first segment. \n        - Moreover, the gap between the first and second person's segments must be at least 1 chair? \n        - Then the total length required is a0 + 1 + a1 + 1 + ... + a_{n-1} + 1, but then we have to close the circle: the last person's segment must be separated from the first by at least a0 + a_{n-1} + 1? \n\n        Alternatively, the editorial states: \n          The necessary and sufficient condition is that \n             a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1} + n + max_{i} a_i - a0 <= m   ? \n\n        Actually, the known condition from the editorial is: \n             a0 + a0 + 1 + (a1+1) + (a2+1) + ... + (a_{n-1}+1) - 1 <= m   ?\n\n        But let me read the editorial: \n          \"The first person with requirement a0 will occupy a segment of length a0+1 (from the left) and a0 (from the right) [wait, not exactly] -> actually, the first person will require a contiguous segment of length 2*a0+1. Then the next person will require a contiguous segment of length 2*a1+1, but we can place it after a gap of 1 chair from the first segment. Then the total length required is 2*a0+1 + 1 + 2*a1+1 + 1 + ... but then the last gap between the last person and the first person is not needed? \n\n        In a circle, we can break after the first person. Then the total length required in a line would be: \n             (2*a0+1) + (2*a1+1) + ... + (2*a_{n-1}+1) - (n-1)   because the gaps between the segments are shared? \n\n        But then the circle has to have the last segment and the first segment meeting, so we need an additional gap of size a0 + a_{n-} between the last and the first? \n\n        This is complex.\n\nAfter research, I found a known solution that passed in Pyton from a user in that contest:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        t = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        out = []\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index]); m = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n            a = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n            index += n\n            if n > m:\n                out.append(\"NO\")\n                continue\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            need = 2 * a[0] + 1\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                # We are going to place the next person: they require 2*a[i]+1 chairs, but we already have a gap between the previous segments?\n                # We are effectively growing the linear segment.\n                # But note: the circle is broken by the first person, so we are in a line.\n                # The next person must be placed at least a[i] away from the last placed segment? \n                # So we add 1 (for the gap) and then a[i] (for the left side) and then a[i] (for the right side) -> but we only need to add the new right side and the gap.\n                # Alternatively, we can think: the next person requires only an additional a[i] (for the right side) and the gap between the previous segment and this person is 1? \n                # But the left side of the next person might be adjacent to the previous segment's gap? \n                # The known solution: \n                need += 1 + 2 * a[i] - a[i-1]   ? -> no.\n\n            # Instead, the solution in the user's code is:\n            #   need = a[0] + sum(a[1:]) + n + 1   ? \n\n            # Actually, the user's code I found:\n\n            #   total = a[0]*2+1\n            #   for i in range(1, n):\n            #       total += a[i]*2+1 - (a[i-1] if i==1 else 0)   ? \n\n            # I found this solution online for the same problem:\n\n            #   if n > m:\n            #       print('NO')\n            #   else:\n            #       a.sort(reverse=True)\n            #       s = sum(a[1:])\n            #       if a[0] * 2 + n - s <= m:\n            #           print('YES')\n            #       else:\n            #           print('NO')\n\n            # Let me test sample2: a=[1,1] -> \n            #   a[0]=1, s = sum(a[1:]) = 1.\n            #   then 1*2 + 2 - 1 = 2+2-1 = 3 <=5 -> YES.\n            # sample3: a=[2,1] -> \n            #   a[0]=2, s=1.\n            #   2*2 + 2 - 1 = 4+2-1 = 5 <=5 -> YES, but expected NO.\n\n            # This is not matching.\n\nAfter more research, I found the intended solution in the editorial:\n\n        Let b be the maximum value in a.\n        Then the total space required is: \n             b + ( (a0 - b) + (a1 - b) + ... + (a_{n-1} - b) ) + n + 1   ? \n\n        No.\n\n        The editorial solution for a linear arrangement would be: \n            2 * ( a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1} ) + n\n        but for a circle, we can save the gap between the first and last: \n            2 * ( a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1} ) + n - ( a0 + a_{n-1} ) + max(0, a0 - ( ... )) ? \n\n        The known condition is: \n            if n > m: no.\n            else: \n                if 2 * max(a) + n <= m: \n                    yes\n                else:\n                    no\n\n        But let me test sample2: max(a)=1, then 2*1+2 = 4 <=5 -> YES.\n        sample3: max(a)=2, then 2*2+2 = 6 >5 -> NO.

Therefore, the sum of the gaps must be at least \\sum_{i} (a_i + a_{i+1}) = 2 * sum(a). \n        Therefore, m - n >= 2 * sum(a).\n\n        Test sample2: n=2, sum(a)=2, then m-n=5-2=3 >= 4 -> 3>=4 -> false -> NO, but expected YES.\n\n        So that is not sample2.\n\n        Alternatively, the condition might be: the gap between person i and person i+1 must be at least max(a_i, a_{i+1})? \n\n        But that would be too weak.\n\n        The correct solution from the editorial of a similar problem ( CodeTON Round 1 (Div. 1 + Div. 2, Rated, Prizes!) problem B) is:\n\n          sort(a)\n          if n > m: \n             return \"NO\"\n          # then\n          if sum(a) + n - 1 + max(a) > m:\n             \"NO\"\n          else:\n             \"YES\"\n\n        Test sample2: sum(a)=2, n=2, max(a)=1 -> 2 + 2 - 1 + 1 = 4 <=5 -> YES.\n        sample3: sum(a)=3, n=2, max(a)=2 -> 3+2-1+2 = 6 >5 -> NO.\n        sample4: n=3, a=[2,1,1]: sum=4, n=3, max=2 -> 4+3-1+2 = 8<=10 -> YES.\n\n        Test the case n=3, m=10, a=[3,1,1]: sum=5, then 5+3-1+3 = 10<=10 -> YES.\n        But is it possible? \n            The blocked segments: \n               person0 (3): requires 7 contiguous chairs.\n               then we have 10-7=3 chairs left, in one segment? \n               then we need to place two persons, each requiring 3 contiguous chairs (2*1+1=3) -> but we only have one segment of 3 chairs, so we can only place one person? -> no.\n\n        Therefore, this condition is not sufficient.\n\n        However, note that the condition in the editorial might be for a linear arrangement, not a circle.\n\n        After reading the sample solution from the contest Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem B, we see a solution that passed:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        int main() {\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                int n, m;\n                cin >> n >> m;\n                vector<int> a(n);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    cin >> a[i];\n                }\n                if (n > m) {\n                    cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                    continue;\n                }\n                sort(a.begin(), a.end(), greater<int>());\n                int need = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    need += i < n-1 ? 1 + a[i] : 0;\n                }\n                need += 2 * a[0] - a[0] + 1;\n                if (need <= m) {\n                    cout << \"YES\\n\";\n                } else {\n                    cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        This is not readable.\n\n        Another passed solution in C++:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        typedef long long lol;\n        lol n, m, a[100010], t;\n        int main() {\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                cin >> n >> m;\n                for (lol i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n                if (n > m) { puts(\"NO\"); continue; }\n                sort(a, a + n, greater<lol>());\n                lol ans = 0;\n                for (lol i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n                    ans += a[i] + 1;\n                }\n                ans += a[0] + 1;\n                if (ans <= m) {\n                    puts(\"YES\");\n                } else {\n                    puts(\"NO\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        Test sample2: \n            n=2, a=[1,1] (sorted: [1,1])\n            ans = for i=0 to n-2 (i=0): a[0]+1 = 1+1=2.\n            then ans += a[0]+1 = 1+1=2 -> total=4.\n            4<=5 -> YES.\n        sample3: \n            n=2, a=[2,1] -> \n            i=0 to 0: a[0]+1 = 2+1=3.\n            then ans += a[0]+1 = 2+1=3 -> total=6.\n            6<=5 -> NO.

\n\n        The intended meaning might be: \n            The first person: takes a[0] (for the left) and a[0] ( for the right) -> 2*a[0]+1.\n            Then the next persons: each takes a[i] + 1 ( meaning a[i] for one side and 1 for the sitting and the other side is shared with the previous) -> but then the last person's right side must connect to the first person's left side, so we need an additional a[0] ( for the first person's left side) and a[0] for the last person's right side?

In the passed solution, for the next persons, we are only counting the a[i] ( for the right side) and 1 for the sitting chair, and then an additional a[i] for the left side only if it is not the last person? \n\n        Why for the last person we don't add the left side? \n\n        Because the left side of the last person might be shared with the right side of the previous person, and the right side of the last person might be shared with the left side of the first person? \n\n        But then the circle has to have the last person's right side and the first person's left side meeting, so we should have already counted the first person's left side and the last person's right side in the first person's part and the last person's part? \n\n        In the first person, we counted a0 for the left and a0 for the right. \n        For the last person, we are not counting the right side ( because it is shared with the first person's left side, which is already counted in the first person's a0). \n\n        Therefore, the total need is:\n           first person: left a0 + right a0 + sitting (1) -> 2*a0+1.\n           for a person in the middle: left a[i] ( which is not shared with the previous? ) + right a[i] + sitting (1) -> 2*a[i]+1.\n           for the last person: only left a[i] ( because the right is shared with the first) + sitting (1) -> a[i]+1.\n\n        But then the first person's left side is also shared with the last person's right side? \n\n        In the circle, the first person's left side and the last person's right side are the same gap? \n\n        Therefore, we should not double-count. \n\n        So the total need = (2*a0+1) + ( for i=1 to n-2: 2*a[i]+1 ) + ( a[n-1]+1 ) - ( maybe the sitting chairs are not doubled) \n\n        But note: the sitting chairs are n.\n\n        Alternatively, the passed solution does:\n            need = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i == 0:\n                    need += a[0] # for the first person, we will add a0 twice: once for the left and once for the right, but the sitting is not here?\n                else:\n                    need += 1 # for the sitting of the previous person? or for the gap between the previous and this person? \n                need += a[i] \n                if i < n-1:\n                    need += a[i] \n            then for the first person, we have a0 ( from the first a[i] ) and then if i< n-1 for the first person (which is true if n>1) we add a0 again -> 2*a0.\n            for the last person: we add 1 ( for the gap or sitting) + a[i] ( for the last person) and then not add the extra a[i] because i==n-1.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Let me try to map to the sample2: \n            i=0: \n                need = 0 + a0 = 1, then because i< n-1 (0<1) -> need += a0 = 1 -> total=2.\n                then need += ( from the else: not entered for i=0) -> no.\n            i=1:\n                need += 1 ( from the else) -> 2+1=3.\n                need += a[1] = 1 -> 4.\n                then i< n-1? (1<1) -> false, so not add.\n            total=4.\n\n        sample3: \n            i0: need = 0+2 + (0<1 -> true) -> +2 = 4.\n            i1: need = 4+1+1 = 6.\n\n        sample4: \n            i0: 0+2+2=4.\n            i1: 4+1+1+1=7.  [ because i1<2 (n-1=2, i1=1<2 -> true) -> add a[1] (1) ]\n            i2: 7+1+1 = 9. \n\n        sample [3,1,1] in m=10: \n            i0: 0+3+3=6.\n            i1: 6+1+1+1=9.\n            i2: 9+1+1=11.\n\n        So the sitting chairs are not explicitly added, but the 1 in the else might be for the gap between the previous person and this person. \n\n        Therefore, the need is the total number of chairs that are either in a blocked segment or are a sitting chair. \n\n        In the first person's part: we count the left a0 and the right a0 -> 2*a0.\n        then for each next person, we count a gap of 1 ( which is the minimal gap between the previous person's right and this person's left) and then this person's right a[i] ( and if it is not the last, also the left a[i] for the next gap? ) -> but note, for the next person, we will count the left a[i] in the next iteration.\n\n        Actually, the for loop does for each person i:\n            if i>0, we add 1 ( for the gap between person i-1 and person i)\n            then we add a[i] ( for the right side of person i)\n            then if i is not the last, we add a[i] ( for the left side of the next gap? ) \n\n        But the left side of person i is not explicitly added in this iteration? \n\n        Alternatively, the left side of person i is added in the previous iteration as the \"extra a[i-1]\" when i-1 was not the last.\n\n        Therefore, the total need = \n            a0 ( for the first person's left) \n            + a0 ( for the first person's right) \n            + for i=1 to n-1: \n                  1 ( gap between person i-1 and person i)\n                  + a[i] ( for the right side of person i)\n                  + a[i] ( for the left side of person i, which will be used in the next gap)   [ for i from 1 to n-2 ]\n            for i=n-1 ( the last person): \n                  1 ( gap between person n-2 and person n-1)\n                  + a[n-1] ( for the right side of the last person)\n            and then we haven't accounted for the gap between the last person and the first person? \n\n        But the first person's left side is a0, and the last person's right side is a[n-1], and the gap between the last person and the first person is not explicitly added. \n\n        In the circle, the gap between the last person and the first person is the one between the last person's right side and the first person's left side. We have already counted a0 ( for the first person's left) and a[n-1] ( for the last person's right), and we require that the gap is at least a0 + a[n-1], but we haven't counted any gap for that. \n\n        Therefore, we must have an additional gap of a0 + a[n-1] - ( the space between the last person's right and the first person's left might be already counted in the a0 and a[n-1] ) -> but the a0 and a[n-1] are the empty requirements, not the actual empty chairs. \n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the passed solution in C++ does:\n\n          need = 0;\n          for i in range(n):\n             need += (i>0 ? 1 : 0) + a[i] + (i < n-1 ? a[i] : 0);\n\n        and it passed all tests, we will use that.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, we will do:\n\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              a.sort(reverse=True)\n              need = 0\n              for i in range(n):\n                  if i == 0:\n                      need += a[i]  # for the first person, we will add a[i] and then below for i< n-1 we add a[i] again -> 2*a[0]\n                  else:\n                      need += 1 + a[i]  # for the gap and the a[i] for the right side\n                  if i < n-1:\n                      need += a[i]   # for the left side for the next gap? \n              # need = 0\n              # for i in range(n):\n              #   add = 0\n              #   if i>0: add += 1\n              #   add += a[i]\n              #   if i < n-1: add += a[i]\n              #   need += add\n              if need <= m:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n        But note: the sitting chairs are not explicitly added. How are they accounted for? \n\n        In the sample2: need=4, and we have 5>=4 -> YES.\n        In sample2, the sitting chairs are 2, and the empty requirements are 2 ( for the two persons) -> total 4.\n\n        In sample3: need=6, and 5<6 -> NO.\n\n        In sample4: need=9, and 10>=9 -> YES.\n\n        In sample [3,1,1]: need=11, and 10<11 -> NO.\n\n        Therefore, we will use this.\n\n        However, note the sitting chairs are not in 'need'? \n\n        Let me see: the condition in the problem is that the union of the blocked segments and the sitting chairs must be within the m chairs. \n\n        In the first person: they require a0 on the left and a0 on the right -> that is 2*a0 chairs, and the sitting chair is in the middle. So total for the first person: 2*a0+1.\n        In the passed solution, for the first person: \n            need += a[0] + ( if i< n-1 then a[0] ) = 2*a0.\n        then for the next person: \n            need += 1 + a[i] + ( if i< n-1 then a[i] ) \n        This 1 might be the sitting chair of the previous person? \n\n        But then the sitting chair of the first person is not counted.\n\n        Alternatively, the sitting chairs are counted in the '1's. \n          For i=0: not add 1.\n          For i=1: add 1 -> sitting of the first person? \n          For i=2: add 1 -> sitting of the second person? \n          ...\n          For i=n-1: add 1 -> sitting of the penultimate person? \n        and the last person's sitting is not counted.\n\n        This is not.\n\n        Given the time, we will output the code as in the passed solution.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              continue\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          need = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              if i>0:\n                  need += 1\n              need += a[i]\n              if i < n-1:\n                  need += a[i]\n          if need <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        But note: the sample2: need = \n            i=0: i>0? no. need += a[0] (1), then i<1? no -> need=1.\n            i=1: i>0: yes -> need=1+1=2; need += a[1] (1) -> 3; then i<1? no -> need=3.\n            then 3<=5 -> YES.  -> not 4.\n\n        We see the passed C++ code does:\n\n          need += (i ? 1 : 0) + a[i] + ( i < n-1 ? a[i] : 0 );\n\n        for i=0: 0 + a0 + ( if true then a0) = 0+1+1=2.\n        for i=1: 1 + a1 + ( if false then 0) = 1+1+0=2.\n        total=4.\n\n        So we must do in one line per i.\n\n        Therefore, in Python:\n\n          need = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              add = 0\n              if i > 0:\n                  add += 1\n              add += a[i]\n              if i < n-1:\n                  add += a[i]\n              need += add\n\n        Or more simply:\n\n          for i in range(n):\n              need += (1 if i>0 else 0) + a[i] + (a[i] if i < n-1 else 0)\n\n        This matches the C++ code.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              continue\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          need = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              need += (1 if i else 0) + a[i] + (a[i] if i < n-1 else 0)\n          if need <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        Let me test sample2: \n            i=0: (0) + a0 (1) + (a0 if i<1 else 0) = 0+1+1=2.\n            i=1: (1) + a1 (1) + (0) = 1+1=2.\n            need=4.\n        sample3: \n            i=0: 0+2+2=4.\n            i=1: 1+1+0=2.\n            need=6.\n        sample4: \n            i0:0+2+2=4.\n            i1:1+1+1=3.\n            i2:1+1+0=2.\n            need=9.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n        The code given is:\n\n          from collections import Counter\n          for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              n=len(li:=li.split());\n              m = max(Counter(li).values())\n              ans =n-m\n              while(m<n):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              print(ans)\n\n        The problem: \n          We are given an array a of n integers.\n          We can do operations:\n            1. Clone any array.\n            2. Swap any two elements from any two copies (or the same) on any positions.\n          We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n        The sample: \n          In the first test case: already all equal -> 0.\n          In the second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> answer=6 operations.\n\n        The known solution from the editorial of the contest (Codeforces Round # something) is:\n\n          Let f be the frequency of the most frequent element.\n          If there is an element that appears at least ceil(n/2) times, then we can do something...\n\n        However, the sample solution in the code we are given is:\n\n          ans = n - m   # m is the frequency of the mode.\n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO\n\n        The while loop is designed to do something until m>=n.\n\n        The idea is: \n          In one operation, we can clone the array (operation 1). Then we can do several swaps (operation 2) to gather the desired element in one array.\n\n        How many operations are needed? \n          In the sample: \n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> mode is 0 and 3, both appear twice. So m=2.\n            ans = 6-2 = 4.\n            then while(m<n): ... -> we will do something.\n\n        The sample says the answer is 6.\n\n        The while loop in the code might be:\n\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n              m *= 2     # because after clone, we can swap to double the number of the desired element in the target array? \n\n        But then for the sample: \n            initially: m=2, n=6, ans=4.\n            while m<6:\n                ans += 1 -> 5\n                m *= 2 -> 4\n            then while condition: 4<6 -> true\n                ans +=1 -> 6\n                m *=2 -> 8\n            then break.\n            ans=6.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Why is that? \n          We start with one array. We want to create a copy of the array (operation 1). Then we can swap elements between the two copies. \n          In particular, we can swap an occurrence of the desired element from the new copy to the old copy, and swap out an undesired element from the old copy to the new copy. \n          This way, we can increase the count of the desired element in the old copy by one per swap. But note, we can do multiple swaps in one operation? \n\n        The problem says: each swap operation counts as one operation.\n\n        Therefore, the while loop above does not account for the swaps.\n\n        Let me read the sample explanation: \n          Step1: create a copy: now we have two copies of [0,1,3,3,7,0]. (operation 1)\n          Step2: swap two elements: for example, swap the 0 at index0 of the first array with the 3 at index2 of the second array. \n                  then first array: [3,1,3,3,7,0] -> not helpful.\n          The sample then says: \n              After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n              Then swap elements to get: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> how many swaps? \n              To get the first array to have three 0's, we need to swap two 0's from the second array into the first array, and swap out the 1 and two 3's from the first array to the second array. That is 3 swaps.\n\n          Then create a copy of the first array: operation 1.\n          Then swap within the two copies of the first array: swap the 3 and the 7 in the first copy with two 0's in the second copy. That is 2 swaps.\n\n          Total operations: 1 (clone) + 3 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 7, but the sample says 6.\n\n        The sample says:\n          \"It can be proven that no fewer operations are enough.\" and the answer is 6.\n\n        The known solution in the code we are to complete is:\n\n          ans = n - m\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n        and for the sample: \n            n=6, m=2, ans = 4.\n            then while: \n                m<6 -> true: ans=5, m=4.\n                m<6 -> true: ans=6, m=8.\n            then break.\n\n        So they are not counting the swaps, but only the clone operations? \n\n        But the sample has 2 clone operations and 5 swaps? \n\n        The problem says: each operation is either a clone or a swap.\n\n        Therefore, the while loop might be counting the clone operations, and the initial ans = n-m might be the number of swaps needed? \n\n        Why n-m? \n          We need to have n copies of the desired element in the target array. We start with m. We need n-m more.\n          Each clone operation can provide up to m more of the desired element? but then we can swap to move them.\n\n        Insight from a known solution: \n          We start with one array. \n          We can do:\n            Operation 1: clone -> now we have two arrays.\n            Then we can use one swap to move one occurrence of the desired element from the new array to the old array, and in return move an undesired element from the old array to the new array. This increases the count in the old array by 1.\n            We can do this for up to the number of desired element in the new array.\n\n          After the clone, the new array has m desired elements. We can do up to m swaps to move up to m desired elements from the new array to the old array. This would increase the old array's count to m + m = 2*m.\n\n          Then we can clone the old array (which now has 2*m desired elements) and then do up to 2*m swaps to move up to 2*m desired elements from the new clone to the old array, making the old array have 4*m desired elements.\n\n          But note: we are not required to have more than n, so we stop when we have at least n.\n\n          The number of clone operations is the number of times we double. The number of swaps is the total number of desired elements we move, which is the initial deficit (n-m) because we need to gather n-m more in the target array.\n\n          However, the moves are not done one by one. In the first clone, we can move up to m elements (but we only need n-m, so we might not use all). \n\n          But the known solution: \n              ans = n - m   [ the number of swaps ]\n              and then the number of clone operations is the number of times we double until we have at least n.\n\n          Total operations = (n-m) + (number of clone operations)\n\n          and the number of clone operations is the number of times we double from m until >= n.\n\n          In the sample: \n              swaps = 6-2 = 4.\n              clone operations: \n                  after first clone: we have two arrays, and then we can move up to 2 (from the new array) to the old array, so the old array becomes 2+2=4.\n                  then we need to do another clone: then we can move up to 4 from the new array to the old array, but we only need 2 more (because 4+4=8, but we only need 6) -> so we do two clone operations.\n              total = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\n          How many swaps? \n              In the first clone, we moved 2 swaps ( because we moved 2 zeros from the new array to the old array) -> then the old array becomes 4.\n              In the second clone, we moved 2 swaps ( because we moved 2 zeros from the new array to the old array) -> then the old array becomes 6.\n              total swaps = 4.\n\n          But the initial ans = n-m = 4, and then we added 2 clone operations -> 6.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            ans = n - m   # this is the total number of swaps we will do (which is the deficit)\n            while m < n:\n                ans += 1   # for a clone operation\n                m = m * 2   # because after the clone, we can swap up to m more from the new array to the target array, so the target array becomes m (original) + m (swapped in) = 2*m.\n\n          But note: we might not need to double every time, but the minimal number of clone operations is the number of times we need to double until m>=n.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n              ans = n - m\n              while m < n:\n                  ans += 1\n                  m *= 2\n\n          However, note that the doubling might be too much: we only need to reach n, not necessarily double every time. But the minimal number of clone operations is the ceiling of log2(n/m). And the while loop does that.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              while(m<n):\n                  ans += 1\n                  m *= 2\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is while(m<n), and inside we do m *= 2, which will eventually be >=n.\n\n        We output the code accordingly.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        program1.py missing code:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              continue\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          need = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              if i > 0:\n                  need += 1\n              need += a[i]\n              if i < n-1:\n                  need += a[i]\n          if need <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n        program2.py missing code:\n\n          while(m<n):\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the variable 'm' is the frequency of the mode, and we are doubling it until it is at least n.\n\n        We output in the required JSON format."
