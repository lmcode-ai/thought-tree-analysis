Should we remove spaces in the +=? The existing code in the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1 So we should remove spaces in the += for program1? We can do:\n\n            b+=n[r]\n            r-=1\n\n Similarly, for program2, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n      print('YES') So we output:\n\n      print('NO') Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\",\n  \"program2\": \"      print('NO')\"\n}\n\n But note: the problem says the code for program1 has a variable `n` which is the list of weights. And `r` is the index. So `n[r]` is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight they eat to be equal. We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n Approach for program1.py:\n We are going to use two pointers: one starting at the left (for Alice) and one at the right (for Bob). We maintain two sums: `a` for Alice and `b` for Bob.\n We traverse from both ends. We move the left pointer to the right if Alice's current sum is less than or equal to Bob's, and add the candy to Alice. Otherwise, we move the right pointer to the left and add to Bob's sum.\n Whenever the two sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten so far (which is `l` from the left and `(len(n)-1 - r)` from the right, so total = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + (n - r - 1) = n - r + l - 1? Actually, note: the candies eaten are from index 0 to l-1 (so l candies) and from r+1 to n-1 (so n-1 - r candies). Therefore, total = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r. But note that in the code we have `f = len(n)-r+l-1` which is the same as: (len(n) is n) -> n - r + l - 1 = (l) + (n - r - 1) -> which is the same as above.\n\n However, note the condition: we are updating `l` and `r` such that we break when `l` exceeds `r`. We must update the sums accordingly.\n\n The code provided has a while loop that runs while `l<=r`. Inside:\n   - If a<=b, we add the left candy and move left pointer.\n   - Else (if a>b), we should add the right candy and move the right pointer. But the code for the else part is missing.\n\n Also, note that we have an initial condition: a, b, l, f are set to 0. `r` is set to len(n)-1.\n\n We are to output `f` at the end. But note: we update `f` only when a==b. However, we might have multiple points where a==b. We want the maximum total candies? Actually, the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\", so we want the maximum total candies for which a==b.\n\n But note: we are traversing the entire array? Actually, we are going until l<=r. And we update f every time a==b. Since we are traversing from both ends, and we update f whenever we have equality, and we are going to cover all possible contiguous segments? However, note that we are moving the pointers in a greedy way: we add to the smaller one. This ensures that we are covering the possibility of having the same weight.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do two pointers.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n The missing part in program1.py is the else block for when b < a. We should do:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n However, note the condition: the condition in the if is \"if a<=b\", so the else is when a>b. Then we do the above.\n\n But note: we must also check for equality after updating? Actually, after updating either a or b, we check if a==b and then update f.\n\n However, the code already has:\n        if a==b:\n            f = len(n)-r+l-1\n\n But note: after updating a or b, we might have a==b. So we check after every update.\n\n But note: the code structure is:\n\n        if a<=b:\n            ... update a and l\n        elif b<a:   # which is the same as else because the condition is a<=b or not\n            ... update b and r\n\n        then check if a==b: then update f.\n\n However, the code has an \"elif\" but in the provided code it's written as \"elif b<a:\". Actually, the condition in the elif is redundant because if we are in the else, then a>b. But we can write it as else. However, the problem says \"elif b<a\", so we can leave it.\n\n But note: the code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" in the elif block.\n\n So we fill the elif block with:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n However, note: we must be cautious because we are using 0-indexed and the array `n` is given.\n\n But wait: the code for the if block is:\n        a += n[l]\n        l += 1\n\n Similarly, for the else we do:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n But note: the condition in the while loop is `while l<=r`. When we update, we move the pointers and then check for equality.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: when we update the left, we do l+=1, and then we check a==b. Similarly for the right.\n\n But note: the total candies eaten at that point is: \n   Alice: from 0 to l-1 -> l candies.\n   Bob: from r+1 to n-1 -> (n-1 - r) candies.\n   Total = l + (n-1 - r) = n - r + l - 1.\n\n We update f every time we have a==b. And we want the maximum total? Actually, we are traversing and we update f every time we have an equality. Since we are moving the pointers and the total candies eaten at each equality is increasing? Actually, no: we are moving from the ends and we are going to meet in the middle. The total candies at an equality event is the current count. But note: we are updating f every time we have an equality, and we are going to get the last equality? But the problem asks for the maximum total candies. However, note that as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten (l + (n-1 - r)) is increasing? Actually, no: we are eating one candy at a time, so the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, we are adding one candy per step. But note: we are not necessarily having increasing total? Because we are moving one pointer per step, so the total candies (l + (n-1 - r)) is increasing by one each step? Actually, let me see:\n\n   Initially: l=0, r = n-1 -> total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0.\n   Then if we move left: l becomes 1, r remains n-1 -> total = 1 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 1.\n   Then if we move right: l=1, r = n-2 -> total = 1 + (n-1 - (n-2)) = 1+1=2.\n\n So each step we are increasing the total by one. Therefore, the last time we have an equality will be the maximum total? But note: we might have an equality at a point and then later we have another equality? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers and the sums are increasing. Once we pass a point, we don't go back. However, it is possible that we have multiple equalities? For example, if we have [1,2,1,1,1,2,1]. But note: we are moving greedily: we add to the smaller one. So we might have:\n\n   Initially: a=0, b=0 -> equal, then we add left: a=1, then we have a=1, b=0 -> then we add right: b=1 -> then we have a=1, b=1 -> record total=2 (l=1, r=5 -> total=1 + (7-1-5)=1+1=2). Then we continue: now we have a=1, b=1 -> then we add left? because a<=b? so a becomes 1+2=3. Then we have a=3, b=1 -> then we add right: b=1+2=3 -> then we have a=3, b=3 -> record total=4 (l=2, r=4 -> total=2 + (7-1-4)=2+2=4). Then we continue: a=3, b=3 -> then we add left: a=3+1=4 -> then we have a=4, b=3 -> then add right: b=3+1=4 -> then record total=6 (l=3, r=3 -> total=3 + (7-1-3)=3+3=6). Then we break because l>r? Actually, when l=3 and r=3, we do the update: then we check l<=r -> true. Then we do the if: a<=b? 4<=4 -> true, so we add n[3] (which is the fourth element, index 3) to a -> a=4+1=5, and l becomes 4. Then we break the loop? because l=4 and r=3 -> l>r. So we don't check the last update? Actually, we check after updating: after updating a and l, we then check if a==b? 5==4? no. Then we break.\n\n So we recorded f=6 at the last equality? But note: we update f every time we have an equality. So the last equality we get is the one with the highest total? Actually, the total candies at the time of equality is increasing as we go? Because we are adding one candy per step. So the last equality we get is the one with the most candies.\n\n However, note: we are not guaranteed that the last equality is the maximum? Actually, the total candies at the time of an equality is the current count (l + (n-1 - r)), and we are increasing the count by one each step. So the last time we have an equality is the maximum total.\n\n But what if we have an equality at the beginning and then we don't have any more? Then we only record the first one? But the total candies at the first one is small. However, we are going to continue until we meet? So we might get a larger one later? Actually, we are traversing until the pointers cross. And we update f every time we have an equality. So we are capturing the maximum total because we are going until the end? But note: the total candies at an equality event is the current count, and the count increases as we move the pointers. Therefore, the last equality we get (if any) is the maximum.\n\n However, what if we have two equalities? The later one has a higher total. So we are updating f to the latest (and hence largest) total.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   if a<=b: \n        a += n[l]; l += 1\n   else: \n        b += n[r]; r -= 1\n\n   then if a==b: f = l + (len(n)-1 - r)   [which is the same as len(n)-r+l-1]\n\n But note: the code already has: f = len(n)-r+l-1.\n\n However, we must note: the variable `n` in the code is the list of candies. So len(n) is the total number of candies.\n\n But wait: the input for each test case: the second line has n integers. And we are storing that in a list called `n`. So the length is the total candies.\n\n But note: the variable `n` is reused? Actually, the code reads the second line and stores it in `n` (which is a list). Then we set `r = len(n)-1`.\n\n So the code for the else block is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n However, note: the code has an \"elif b<a:\" and then the block. We can write:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But note: the condition is redundant because we have an if and then an elif. We can also write \"else\" for simplicity, but the problem says \"elif b<a\", so we do that.\n\n But note: what if we have a==b? Then we don't enter the if or the elif? Actually, the condition is: \n   if a<=b: ... \n   elif b<a: ... \n\n So if a==b, we enter the if block? because a<=b is true. Then we add the left candy. Then we break the equality? But that's okay because we already recorded the equality at the previous step? Actually, we record the equality after updating? \n\n However, note: we are updating the sums and then checking for equality. So when we have a==b, we record and then we continue? But we are going to break the equality by adding one more candy? But we want to continue because we might get a larger total? \n\n Example: [1,1] \n   Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we check: a<=b -> true, so we add the left: a=1, l=1. Then we check a==b? 1==0? no. Then we go to next iteration: now a=1, b=0 -> then we do the else: add the right: b=1, r=0. Then we check: a==b? yes -> then f = len(n)-r+l-1 = 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2. Then we break because l=1 and r=0 -> l>r? Then we break the loop.\n\n So we get f=2.\n\n But what if we have [1,1,1]? \n   Initially: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add left: a=1, l=1 -> then a!=b -> then next iteration: a=1, b=0 -> add right: b=1, r=1 -> then a==b -> f = 3 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 2? \n        Actually, total candies: Alice ate 1, Bob ate 1 (from the right: the last candy) -> total=2. But note: we have one candy in the middle that is not eaten? And we break because l=1 and r=1 -> then we do the next iteration: l<=r -> true. Then we check: a<=b? 1<=1 -> true, so we add the middle: a=1+1=2, l=2. Then we break because l=2 and r=1 -> l>r. Then we output f=2? But is there a way to get 3? \n        If they eat the same total: Alice eats [1,1] -> 2, Bob eats [1] -> 1 -> not equal. Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1,1] -> 1 and 2. Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> 1 and 1 -> total=2. So 2 is the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n But note: the code has an indentation. We must be careful.\n\n However, the problem says: Output only the missing lines or blocks.\n\n For program2.py:\n The problem is about checking if a six-digit ticket is lucky (sum of first three equals sum of last three).\n\n The code provided reads an integer t, then for each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is the six-digit number). Then it breaks the number into six digits: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6.\n\n Then it checks: if a1+a2+a3 == a4+a5+a6, then print 'YES'. Otherwise, we are to print 'NO'. The else block is missing.\n\n So we can simply do:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But note: the problem says the input is a string of six digits. However, the code reads an integer. But the input is a string of six digits. The problem says: \"one string consisting of six digits\". \n\n But the code does: \n        a = int(input())\n\n This will work because the input is a string of digits and we convert it to an integer. Then we extract the digits by modulus and division.\n\n However, what if the ticket has leading zeros? The integer conversion will preserve the value, but the extraction of digits by modulus and division will work correctly? For example, if the ticket is \"000000\", then a=0, and then:\n        a6 = 0 % 10 = 0\n        a5 = (0//10)%10 = 0\n        ... all will be 0.\n\n So it's okay.\n\n But note: what if the ticket is \"000001\"? \n        a = 1 -> then:\n        a6 = 1 % 10 = 1\n        a5 = (1//10)%10 = 0\n        ... so we get a1=0, a2=0, a3=0, a4=0, a5=0, a6=1 -> then the sum of the first three is 0, and the last three is 1 -> so we output 'NO'. Correct.\n\n However, the problem says: the input is a string of six digits. But the code uses integer conversion. This is acceptable because the string has six digits and no non-digit characters.\n\n But note: the problem says the number of test cases t (<=1000). \n\n The missing part in program2.py is the else block. We simply output 'NO'.\n\n Therefore, the code for the else block is:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n However, note: the code already has:\n\n   if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n So we fill the else block with:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But note: the problem says we can output in any case, and \"NO\" is the negative answer.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n And the output format is a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n So we output:\n\n {\"program1\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\", \"program2\": \"        print('NO')\"}\n\n But note: the program1 part must be exactly the two lines of code that are missing. And program2 is one line.\n\n However, in program1, the code block for the elif is two lines: one for adding to b and one for decrementing r.\n\n But note: the code in program1 has an indentation. The existing code in the elif block is:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace that with:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n And in program2, the else block is:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace that with:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But note: the existing code in program1 has an \"elif b<a:\" and then the block. We are only replacing the two lines.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the code in program1 has a comment in the elif block. We are replacing the entire block? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the missing lines that replace the TODO.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n For program1: the two lines (with the same indentation as the if block above) and for program2: the one line.\n\n But note: the program1 code we are to output is the two lines that go in the elif block. The existing code has:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n We remove that and put:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n So the entire elif block becomes:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But we are only to output the two lines of the block body (without the elif condition). So we output:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n Similarly, for program2, we output:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n However, note: the program2 code has an else: and then a comment. We are replacing the comment with the print.\n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the two lines for program1 and the one line for program2.\n\n But note: the program1 code has an if condition and then an elif condition. We are only replacing the body of the elif.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\", \"program2\": \"        print('NO')\"}\n\n However, we must be cautious about the exact string. The program1 code has 8 spaces of indentation? Actually, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n        a += n[l]\n        l += 1\n\n So the body of the if is indented by 8 spaces. Similarly, the elif block should have the same indentation for the body.\n\n Therefore, we output the two lines for program1 with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the code we are given for program1 has:\n\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n\n So the body of the elif should be indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while). But the if block inside the while is indented by 4 (the while is at 4, then the if is at 8, then the body of the if is at 12). Actually, in Python, we use 4 spaces per level.\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the existing code. The existing code for the if block has:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n So each line is indented by 12 spaces (relative to the start of the line). Therefore, the two lines we write for program1 should be indented by 12 spaces.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact lines that would replace the TODO.\n\n Since the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent, and the elif block is at the same level as the if, the body of the elif should be at the same level as the body of the if.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\n But note: the existing code in the if block uses 8 spaces for the body? Actually, the entire code:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n\n The while loop body is indented by 4 (relative to the for). Then the if and elif and the next if are all at 8. Then the bodies of the if and elif are at 12.\n\n So we output the two lines for program1 with 12 spaces (i.e., 8 for the while and then 4 more for the block) but actually the existing code uses 4 for the while and then 4 for the if and then 4 for the body? \n\n Actually, the code we are given for the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n So we must output:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the style. The existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The while loop is at 4, then the if/elif are at 8, then the body of the if/elif should be at 12.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the existing code in the if block has two lines, each starting with 12 spaces. So we output two lines each starting with 12 spaces? But the problem does not require the exact spaces? Actually, we are to output the code that would replace the TODO. The TODO is at 12 spaces? Then we output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n But in the provided code, the if block body is written without extra spaces? Actually, in the problem statement, the code for the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n So we write the same for the elif block.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted. We are to output:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But wait: the existing code in the if block uses no space after the variable? It uses `a+=n[l]` and `l+=1`. We can write with spaces for clarity? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says the code is as given. We should match the style? The existing code in the if block does not have spaces around the +=. But we can write with spaces? Actually, the problem does not care about that. But to be safe, we can write without spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not specify. But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the existing code in the if block is without spaces. So we write without spaces? \n\n But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only to output the two lines for the elif block.\n\n Therefore, for program1, we output:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But wait, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n So if we write with spaces, it might be acceptable? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says the program must run correctly. The Python interpreter accepts both. But to match the style, we can write without spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require matching the style exactly? It only requires the code to run correctly. So we can write:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n But the existing code in the if block is without spaces. However, the problem does not say we must match the style. We can write with spaces? It is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can write without spaces? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, we can choose. But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the example code in the if block is without spaces. So we write without spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". So we are free to write the code as long as it runs correctly. But to be safe, we can write without spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not specify. Let me see the example: the if block has \"a+=n[l]\" and \"l+=1\". So we write:\n\n            b+=n[r]\n            r-=1\n\n But note: the variable names: we have `r` and `n` and `b`. \n\n Therefore, for program1, the two lines are:\n\n            b+=n[r]\n            r-=1\n\n And for program2, the one line is:\n\n            print('NO')\n\n But note: the program2 code has the else block at the same level as the if. The existing code for the if block is:\n\n      if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:\n          print('YES')\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n The if and else are at 4 spaces (relative to the for). The body of the if is at 8. So the body of the else should be at 8? But the problem says: the existing code has:\n\n   if ...:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n So the body of the else should be at the same level as the print in the if. Therefore, we output:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But note: the existing print in the if is at 8 spaces (relative to the for). So we write the print in the else at 8 spaces? \n\n However, the problem says: the code for program2 is:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor i in range(1, t + 1):\n   summa = 0\n   a = int(input())\n   a6 = a % 10\n   a5 = (a // 10) % 10\n   a4 = (a // 100) % 10\n   a3 = (a // 1000) % 10\n   a2 = (a // 10000) % 10\n   a1 = (a // 100000) % 10\n   if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n The if and else are at 3 spaces? Actually, the entire block inside the for loop is indented by 3 spaces? \n\n But wait: the code uses 3 spaces? \n\n   for i in range(1, t + 1):\n   summa = 0   -> this is at 3 spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says the code is as given. The code for the if block is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n which is at 6 spaces? \n\n Actually, the code is:\n\n   if ...:\n      print('YES')\n\n So the print is at 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the print in the if. So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But note: the existing code for the if block has:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n However, the problem says: the code for program2 is given with 3 spaces for the for loop body? Actually, the code:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor i in range(1, t + 1):\n   summa = 0\n   a = int(input())\n   ... \n\n The body of the for loop is indented by 3 spaces. Then the if and else are at 3 spaces? Actually, the if is at 3 spaces, and the body of the if is at 6 spaces. So we output the print at 6 spaces.\n\n Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", so we output the exact line that should be in the else block.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But we must match the existing style. The existing style for the if body is 3 spaces for the outer and then 3 more? So 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem says: the code is given. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at 6 spaces? \n\n Actually, the code has:\n\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n The TODO is at 6 spaces? Actually, the else is at 3, and the body of the else (the TODO) is at 6. So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? The problem says the program must run correctly. In Python, the indentation must be consistent. The existing code uses 3 spaces per indent? \n\n Actually, the code for the for loop body is:\n\n   summa = 0\n   a = int(input())\n   ... \n\n and the if is at the same level? \n\n But the problem says: the code is given. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the print in the if. So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with the same indentation as the print('YES').\n\n Since the print('YES') is at 6 spaces (if the outer for loop is 3, then the if body is 6), we output 6 spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But to be safe, we can output 3 spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the line that goes in the else block. The existing code for the if block has:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with the same indentation.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the exact string of the line? We are to output the line as we would write it in the code.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation, we can use the same as the if block. The if block has 3 spaces for the outer? Actually, the code:\n\n   if ...:\n      print('YES')\n\n The print is indented by 3 spaces relative to the if? And the if is at 3 spaces relative to the for? So the print is at 6 spaces relative to the start of the line? \n\n But the problem says: the code is given. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the print in the if. So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? \n\n However, the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? Actually, the problem says the program must run correctly. The existing code uses 3 spaces per indent? Then the else block body should be at 6 spaces.\n\n But the problem does not specify. We can output:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact number. Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted. The existing code in the if block is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But note: the problem says the code for program2 is:\n\n   ... \n   if ...:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n So the else block body should be at the same level as the if body. Therefore, we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact string. We can write:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But to be safe, we note that the existing print('YES') has 3 spaces of indentation relative to the if? Actually, the entire code:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor i in range(1, t + 1):\n   summa = 0\n   a = int(input())\n   a6 = a % 10\n   a5 = (a // 10) % 10\n   a4 = (a // 100) % 10\n   a3 = (a // 1000) % 10\n   a2 = (a // 10000) % 10\n   a1 = (a // 100000) % 10\n   if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n The print('YES') is at 3 spaces relative to the for? Actually, the for loop body is indented by 3 spaces, and the if body is indented by 3 more? So 6 spaces? \n\n But the code uses 3 spaces per indent? Then the if body is 6 spaces. So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that would be in the program.\n\n Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But wait, the existing print('YES') is written as:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n with 3 spaces? Actually, the code in the problem statement for the if block is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n which is at 3 spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem statement uses a mix of spaces? It's hard to tell. But the problem says: the code is given. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the print('YES'). So we output the same.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, we can output the same as the print('YES')? But the problem says the program must run correctly. The Python interpreter requires consistent indentation. The existing code uses 3 spaces for the for body and 3 more for the if body? Then we output 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem does not specify. We can assume that the existing code uses 3 spaces per indent, so the else body should be 6 spaces. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the line of code that goes in the else block. The existing code for the if block has:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with the same indentation.\n\n But to be safe, we note that the problem does not care about the exact number of spaces as long as it is consistent. We can output:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? But the problem does not specify. Alternatively, we can output without any extra spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the exact line that would be in the program. The program uses 3 spaces per indent. The else block is at the same level as the if block, so the body of the else should be at 6 spaces. Therefore, we output:\n\n        print('NO')\n\n But wait, 6 spaces is two indents? \n\n However, the problem says: the code for the if block is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n which is at 3 spaces? Then we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 3 spaces? \n\n I see the confusion. The problem statement's formatting might have been altered. But the code as given in the problem for program2 is:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor i in range(1, t + 1):\n   summa = 0\n   a = int(input())\n   a6 = a % 10\n   a5 = (a // 10) % 10\n   a4 = (a // 100) % 10\n   a3 = (a // 1000) % 10\n   a2 = (a // 10000) % 10\n   a1 = (a // 100000) % 10\n   if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:\n      print('YES')\n   else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n The body of the for loop is indented by 3 spaces. The body of the if and else are indented by 6 spaces (3 for the for and 3 for the if). So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces? \n\n But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the string that is exactly the line. The line is:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But note: the existing print('YES') is written as:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output the same with 'NO'. \n\n Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But to be precise, the existing code uses 3 spaces for the first indent and 3 more for the second, so 6 spaces in total? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact string. We can output the line as:\n\n\"      print('NO')\"\n\n with 6 spaces at the beginning.\n\n But the problem says: the program must run correctly. As long as the indentation is the same as the if block, it will run.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says the existing code is as given, we output the line with the same indentation as the if block's print.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"      print('NO')\"\n}\n\n But wait, for program1, the existing if block body is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n which is at 12 spaces (3 indents of 4 spaces). And for program2, the if block body is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n which is at 6 spaces (2 indents of 3 spaces).\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the existing code. \n\n But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the existing code for the if block in program1 has two lines with 12 spaces. So we output two lines with 12 spaces for program1.\n\n For program2, the existing code for the if block has one line with 6 spaces, so we output one line with 6 spaces.\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, so we output as per the given code structure.\n\n However, to avoid overcomplicating, and since the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", we output only the code that is missing, and we assume the indentation is as in the given code.\n\n Therefore, for program1, the two lines are:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n And for program2, the one line is:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n But note: the problem says the code for program1 is given with 4-space indents, and the body of the if is at 12 spaces (which is 3 levels: for -> while -> if). So we output 12 spaces for each line in program1.\n\n For program2, the code is given with 3-space indents, and the body of the if is at 6 spaces (2 levels: for -> if). So we output 6 spaces for the line in program2.\n\n But the problem does not require the spaces to be exactly counted? It requires the code to run correctly. We can output without specifying the exact spaces? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the exact string that would be in the program. Therefore, we must output the exact indentation.\n\n Given the provided code in the problem, we can count the spaces:\n\n In program1:\n\n   for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:   -> level 0\n       n=[*map(int,n.split())]   -> level 4\n       a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1   -> level 4\n       while l<=r:   -> level 4\n           if a<=b:   -> level 8\n               a+=n[l]   -> level 12\n               l+=1   -> level 12\n           elif b<a:   -> level 8\n               # TODO: Your code here   -> level 12\n           if a==b:   -> level 8\n               f=len(n)-r+l-1   -> level 12\n\n So the missing code in the elif block should be at level 12.\n\n Therefore, we output for program1:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n with 12 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n In program2:\n\n   t = int(input())   -> level 0\n   for i in range(1, t + 1):   -> level 0\n      summa = 0   -> level 3\n      a = int(input())   -> level 3\n      ...   -> level 3\n      if a1 + a2 + a3 == a4 + a5 + a6:   -> level 3\n         print('YES')   -> level 6\n      else:   -> level 3\n         # TODO: Your code here   -> level 6\n\n So the missing code in the else block should be at level 6.\n\n Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n with 6 spaces at the beginning.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the exact string, but we must output the code as it would appear.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output:\n\n For program1: two lines, each starting with 12 spaces and then the code.\n For program2: one line starting with 6 spaces and then the code.\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we can deduce from the structure.\n\n Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and let the JSON string handle it? But we must output the exact string.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"      print('NO')\"\n}\n\n But wait, the program1 code in the if block uses `a+=n[l]` without spaces. Should we remove spaces in the +=? \n\n The existing code in the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\n So we should remove spaces in the += for program1? \n\n We can do:\n\n            b+=n[r]\n            r-=1\n\n Similarly, for program2, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n      print('YES')\n\n So we output:\n\n      print('NO')\n\n Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\",\n  \"program2\": \"      print('NO')\"\n}\n\n But note: the problem says the code for program1 has a variable `n` which is the list of weights. And `r` is the index. So `n[r]` is correct.\n\n And for program2, we output the string 'NO'.\n\n Let me double-check with an example.\n\n Example for program1: \n   Test case: n = [1,1] \n   Initially: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=1, f=0.\n   while l<=r (0<=1): \n        a<=b (0<=0) -> true: \n            a = 0+1 = 1, l=1.\n        then check a==b? 1==0 -> false.\n        then next iteration: l=1, r=1 -> l<=r true.\n        now a=1, b=0 -> a<=b? false -> so we go to elif: b<a -> true.\n            then we do: b += n[1] -> b=0+1=1, r=0.\n        then check a==b? 1==1 -> true: then f = len(n)-r+l-1 = 2-0+1-1 = 2.\n        then next iteration: l=1, r=0 -> l>r -> break.\n        output f=2. Correct.\n\n Example for program2: \n   Ticket \"213132\": \n        a1=2, a2=1, a3=3 -> sum=6; a4=1, a5=3, a6=2 -> sum=6 -> output 'YES'. \n   Ticket \"000000\": \n        sums are 0 and 0 -> 'YES'. \n   Ticket \"111112\": \n        a1=1, a2=1, a3=1 -> 3; a4=1, a5=1, a6=2 -> 4 -> 'NO'. \n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the input for program2 is a string of six digits. The code reads it as an integer. This is acceptable.\n\n However, there is a potential issue: if the ticket has leading zeros, the integer conversion is correct. But what if the ticket is \"000000\", then a=0, and the digit extraction works.\n\n So we output the JSON as above."
