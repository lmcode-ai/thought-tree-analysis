So we do:\n\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x)) But note: the problem says that the first line of each test case contains two integers n and m. However, in the code we have:\n  n, _ = map(int, input().split()) We are ignoring m? But we don't need m because we are reading n lines of m characters. But the transposition: \n  a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\nThis will read n lines and then zip them (which gives m tuples of n characters) and then we join each tuple to form a string. So we have m strings (each of length n) representing the columns. Then we process each column (each string of length n) by splitting by 'o'. Then we reassemble and then we transpose back by zip(*a) which will give n tuples of m characters? Then we join each tuple to form a row. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n  print(''.join(x)) But note: we must output each row on a separate line. So we do:\n\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x))",

For example, if a cell is stamped twice: \n        W -> R (if first stamp made it R) and then if stamped again as the left cell (so it becomes B) then it becomes B. \n  - Actually, each stamping operation flips the color of the two cells in a specific way? But note: the problem says that the stamp can be applied in two ways: BR or RB. So if we look at the entire process, we can consider the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped as the left part of the stamp and the right part?",

For example, a segment of three cells: \n  We can do:\n      Step1: stamp on cells 1 and 2: [R, B, W]\n      Step2: stamp on cells 2 and 3: [R, R, B] -> because when we stamp on cells 2 and 3, we can choose to make cell2 R and cell3 B? But wait: the stamp must be either RB or BR. So if we stamp on cells 2 and 3 as RB, then cell2 becomes R and cell3 becomes B -> so we get [R, R, B]. But note: the stamping operation always sets the two cells to one R and one B. So if we stamp on cells 2 and 3 as RB, then cell2 becomes R and cell3 becomes B. But cell2 was already B?

So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1\n\n      But note: the variable in the loop is called 'i' (as in the provided code: for i in ...). So we write:\n\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: b = 1\n\n      However, we can write it without an extra if?",

Then we set b=1 if we find an invalid segment. Then we print: \n          if b==0 -> then we print 'YES' \n          if b==1 -> then we print 'NO'\n\n      How? \n          'YNEOS' is a string. [b::2] means: \n            if b=0: then we take the substring starting at index 0 and stepping by 2: 'YES' -> because: \n                index0: 'Y', index2: 'E', index4: 'S' -> but stepping by 2: [0::2] -> 'YES'? Actually: \n                    'YNEOS'[0::2] -> take every other starting at 0: 'Y' (index0), then skip index1, then index2: 'E' -> but wait, we want \"YES\" or \"NO\". Actually, the string is 'YNEOS' -> \n            We want to output \"YES\" if b==0, and \"NO\" if b==1. How does [b::2] work? If b=0: \n                s = 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> \n                    indices: 0, 2, 4 -> 'Y'+'E'+'S' -> \"YES\"\n            If b=1:\n                s = 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> \n                    indices: 1, 3 -> 'N'+'O' -> \"NO\"\n\n          So we set b=1 for an invalid segment. Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i != '':   # non-empty segment\n                  if len(i)==1:\n                      b = 1\n                  else:\n                      # check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B? if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                          b = 1\n\n      But note: we might have multiple segments. We must check every segment. So we cannot break? But if we set b=1, then we want to output \"NO\". However, we can set b=1 and then continue to check? But that is okay: once we set b=1, we know the answer is \"NO\". But we can break early?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are simulating stones falling in a grid. The idea is that stones ('*') fall until they hit an obstacle ('o') or the bottom or another stone that has already settled. We note that the grid has obstacles that don't move.\n\nA clever way to do this is to process each column independently. We can split the column by obstacles and then within each segment, we can let the stones fall to the bottom of the segment (which is either the next obstacle below or the bottom of the grid). Since the stones fall, we can imagine that in a segment, if we ignore the obstacles, we want all the stones to be at the bottom of the segment. So we can sort the characters in each segment: we want the stones to be at the bottom and the empty spaces above. But note: the segment is a contiguous part of the column. However, the grid is given from top to bottom.\n\nBut note: the grid is given as n rows. The falling happens from top to bottom. So in a column, we can break the column by the obstacles. Then, for each segment (which is between two obstacles or an obstacle and the boundary), we can collect the stones and empty cells. Then we want to put all the stones at the bottom of the segment and the empty cells above. We can do this by counting the stones and then creating a string of the segment with the required number of stones at the bottom and the rest as empty.\n\nHowever, the provided code does:\n  a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\nThis transposes the grid so that we are processing columns as rows? Actually, it transposes the grid: rows become columns and columns become rows. Then we split each string (which is a column) by the obstacles ('o'). Then for each segment in the column, we sort the characters in reverse order? Why reverse?\n\nActually, if we have a segment (which is a string of '.' and '*'), and we sort in reverse order, then the '*' (which has ASCII 42) is greater than '.' (ASCII 46) so in reverse order, the stones come first and then the dots. But that would put the stones at the top? We want them at the bottom.\n\nWait: the grid is given from top to bottom. But when we transpose, the column becomes a row? And then we are processing that row. However, when we split by 'o', we get segments. In each segment, we want the stones to fall to the bottom. But in the segment, the bottom is the last element? Actually, in the original grid, the bottom row is the last row. But when we transpose, the column becomes a row and the bottom of the column becomes the last character in that row? Then we are processing the row from left to right? \n\nBut note: the falling is downward. In the transposed grid, we have a row that represents a column. The falling in the original column: we want the stones to go to the last row (which is the last element in the string of the column). So in the segment, we want the stones to be at the end (the rightmost in the row representation). \n\nSo if we have a segment: \"**..\" (meaning two stones above two empty) and we want them to fall to become \"..**\". How? We can sort the segment in reverse? \n  sorted(\"**..\", reverse=True) -> ['*', '*', '.', '.'] -> \"**..\" -> that's not what we want.\n\nWe want the stones to be at the bottom. So we want the segment to become \"..**\". So we should sort without reverse? Then we get ['.', '.', '*', '*'] -> \"..**\". \n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"reverse=True\" in the provided code. Actually, the provided code has:\n  a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n\nBut that would put the stones at the top of the segment? That is the opposite of what we want.\n\nAlternatively, note that the grid is given from top to bottom. In the segment, the top is the first character and the bottom is the last. We want the stones to fall to the bottom. So we want the segment to have as many '.' as possible at the top and then stones at the bottom. So we want to sort the segment so that the stones are at the end. But if we sort in the natural order, then '.' (which is 46) comes before '*' (42) -> so we get '.' then '*'. But that would put the stones at the bottom? \n\nWait: in the natural order, '.' is greater than '*'? Actually, no: in ASCII, '.' is 46 and '*' is 42, so '.' is greater than '*'. Therefore, sorted(y) would put '*' first and then '.' -> which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nSo we have two options:\n  Option 1: sort without reverse and then reverse the segment? \n  Option 2: sort with reverse=True? \n\nBut if we sort with reverse=True, then we get the larger characters first. Since '.' is larger than '*', we get '.' first? Actually, no: \n  sorted(['*', '.'], reverse=True) -> ['.', '*'] -> which is what we want: the stones at the bottom? \n\nBut wait: in the segment, the first character is the top and the last is the bottom. So if we have a segment \"..*\" and we sort with reverse=True, we get ['.', '.', '*'] -> which becomes \"..*\" -> but that is the same? \n\nActually, no: the segment \"..*\" has two empty and one stone. After falling, the stone should be at the bottom and the empty above, so it should become \"..*\" -> same? \n\nBut what if the segment is \"*..\"? Then we want the stone to fall to the bottom: becomes \"..*\". How do we get that? \n  sorted('*..', reverse=True) -> ['.', '.', '*'] -> which is \"..*\" -> that's what we want.\n\nSo indeed, sorting the segment in reverse order (so that the '.' come first and then the '*') is the way to go. Because in reverse sort, the '.' (which is the largest) comes first? Actually, no: in reverse sort, we are sorting in descending order. Since '.' (46) > '*' (42), in descending order, '.' comes before '*'? But that would give the string \"..*\" for the segment \"*..\", which is correct.\n\nBut note: the segment might be mixed. The operation: we are taking the segment and rearranging it so that all the stones are at the bottom? Actually, we are not rearranging arbitrarily: we are sorting. And since we have only two types, sorting in reverse order (descending) will put all the '.' first and then the '*'? Because '.' > '*'. \n\nSo the provided code for program1.py is:\n\n  a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\n  a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n\nThen we have to output. The next line is:\n  for x in zip(*a):\n\nBut note: we transposed the grid at the beginning to process columns. Then we processed each column (which is now a row) by splitting by 'o' and then processing each segment. Then we reassembled the column by joining the segments with 'o'. Then we have a generator for the processed columns. Now we need to transpose back to get the original orientation.\n\nSo we do:\n  for x in zip(*a):\n\nThis will transpose the grid back. Then we have to output each row? The problem says: output the grid with n rows and m columns.\n\nSo we can do:\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x))\n\nBut note: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", but the sample outputs have each test case on separate lines. Actually, we are printing each row of the grid. We must output the grid for the test case. The problem says: output a grid with n rows and m columns.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to print each row. However, note that the grid is now represented by the transposed and then processed and then transposed back. So we have the rows.\n\nBut the code already has:\n  for x in zip(*a):\n\nWe need to output the row. So we can do:\n\n  print(''.join(x))\n\nBut note: the problem says the input has multiple test cases. We are inside the loop for test cases. We must output the grid for each test case. And the grid has n rows.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x))\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", meaning that we don't need an extra blank line between test cases? But the sample outputs have each test case as a grid of n rows. So we output n rows for the test case.\n\nHowever, note that the next test case will start after that. So we are printing the grid for the current test case.\n\nBut what about the last test case? We must not output an extra blank line. The above will output the grid and then the next test case (if any) will start.\n\nBut the provided code structure:\n\n  for _ in range(int(input())):\n      n, _ = map(int, input().split())\n      a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\n      a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n      for x in zip(*a):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we must fill the TODO.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x))\n\nBut note: the problem says that the first line of each test case contains two integers n and m. However, in the code we have:\n  n, _ = map(int, input().split())\nWe are ignoring m? But we don't need m because we are reading n lines of m characters.\n\nBut the transposition: \n  a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\nThis will read n lines and then zip them (which gives m tuples of n characters) and then we join each tuple to form a string. So we have m strings (each of length n) representing the columns.\n\nThen we process each column (each string of length n) by splitting by 'o'. Then we reassemble and then we transpose back by zip(*a) which will give n tuples of m characters? Then we join each tuple to form a row.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n  print(''.join(x))\n\nBut note: we must output each row on a separate line. So we do:\n\n  for x in zip(*a):\n      print(''.join(x))\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\". This means that we don't have to output an extra blank line between test cases. The above will output the grid for the test case as n lines. Then the next test case will start. That is acceptable.\n\nBut what if the next test case starts? The input for the next test case will be read after we finish printing. So it's okay.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B') and we want to know if it is possible to obtain by stamping. The stamping operation: we can stamp two adjacent cells, and each stamping colors the two cells: one red and one blue (in either order). We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. The stamp must be completely on the grid.\n\nImportant: the entire grid is initially white. We can only stamp on two adjacent cells at a time. The stamp can be rotated arbitrarily.\n\nWe note that the stamping operation always changes two adjacent cells. Also, note that the same cell can be stamped multiple times. The operation is reversible? Not exactly. But we can think of the following:\n\nObservation: \n  - The stamping operation always changes two adjacent cells: one to R and one to B. Therefore, the entire process must produce a coloring that has the same number of R and B? Not exactly: because if a cell is stamped multiple times, it might change. For example, if a cell is stamped twice: \n        W -> R (if first stamp made it R) and then if stamped again as the left cell (so it becomes B) then it becomes B. \n  - Actually, each stamping operation flips the color of the two cells in a specific way? \n\nBut note: the problem says that the stamp can be applied in two ways: BR or RB. So if we look at the entire process, we can consider the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped as the left part of the stamp and the right part? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire picture must be composed of contiguous segments that are non-white. And within a contiguous non-white segment, the colors must alternate? But note: we can have overlapping stamps arbitrarily.\n\nHowever, a known solution for this problem is to split the string by 'W' and then check each contiguous segment of non-white. For each contiguous segment, we must have at least one R and at least one B? And also, the segment must have at least two characters? Actually, no: because if the segment has one character, then we cannot have stamped it (since the stamp covers two). So a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\nBut note: the entire segment might be built by multiple overlapping stamps. However, we can also note that the parity of the positions might matter. \n\nKnown solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem C) is:\n\n  - Split the string by 'W'\n  - For each segment (non-white part), if the segment is non-empty:\n        if the length of the segment is 1 -> impossible.\n        else, check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? Actually, no: because if the entire segment is the same color, that is impossible? \n\nBut why? Consider: \n  How can we get a segment of all R? \n      We start with white. We stamp a pair: that gives one R and one B. Then if we stamp again on the same two, we flip them: \n          First stamp: [R, B]\n          Then stamp again on the same two: \n              The first cell: if we stamp as the left part: then it becomes B? \n              The second cell: becomes R? \n          So we get [B, R]. \n      Then if we stamp again: \n          [R, B] again? \n      So we can only get alternating colors? \n\nBut note: we can stamp overlapping. For example, a segment of three cells: \n  We can do:\n      Step1: stamp on cells 1 and 2: [R, B, W]\n      Step2: stamp on cells 2 and 3: [R, R, B] -> because when we stamp on cells 2 and 3, we can choose to make cell2 R and cell3 B? But wait: the stamp must be either RB or BR. So if we stamp on cells 2 and 3 as RB, then cell2 becomes R and cell3 becomes B -> so we get [R, R, B]. \n\nBut note: the stamping operation always sets the two cells to one R and one B. So if we stamp on cells 2 and 3 as RB, then cell2 becomes R and cell3 becomes B. But cell2 was already B? Then we are overwriting? The problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells\". So it sets them to the new colors. \n\nTherefore, we can set arbitrarily? But note: we can only set two adjacent cells at a time to one R and one B. \n\nSo the key is: \n  - The entire picture must be such that in every contiguous segment of non-white, the segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n  - And also, the segment must have at least two cells? \n\nBut what about a segment of two? \n  [R, B] -> valid? \n  [B, R] -> valid? \n  [R, R] -> invalid? because we cannot have two R's without a B? How would we get two R's? \n      We can do: \n          Start: [W, W, W] -> we want [R, R, W]? \n          We can stamp on the first two: [R, B, W] -> then stamp on the second two: [R, R, B] -> but that gives three non-white. \n      How to get [R, R]? \n          We can stamp on the first two: [R, B] -> then stamp on the first two again: [B, R] -> then we have [B, R]. \n          Then if we stamp on the first two again: [R, B] -> we never get two R's.\n\n      Alternatively, we can stamp on the first two as [R, B] and then stamp on the first two again as [B, R] -> but that alternates. \n\n      But note: we can also stamp on the same two multiple times? \n          First: [R, B] \n          Second: [B, R] (if we use the stamp as BR on the same two: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R) \n          Third: [R, B] \n          ... \n      So we can never get two R's in a row? \n\n  However, consider: \n      We have three cells: \n          Step1: stamp on the middle and right: [W, R, B] \n          Step2: stamp on the left and middle: [R, B, B] -> now we have two B's at the end? \n          But wait: step2: stamp on left and middle: we set the left to R and the middle to B? Then we get [R, B, B] -> that has two B's? \n\n      How? The middle cell was R and then we set it to B? \n\n      So we can have two adjacent B's? \n\n      But then we can also have two R's? \n          Step1: stamp on the left and middle: [R, B, W]\n          Step2: stamp on the left and middle again: [B, R, W] -> then stamp on the left and middle again: [R, B, W] -> ... \n          How to get two R's? \n          Step1: [R, B, W]\n          Step2: stamp on the middle and right: [R, R, B] -> so we have two R's? \n\n      So we can have two R's? \n\n  Therefore, we can have two adjacent R's? \n\n  But note: the stamping operation always sets two adjacent cells to one R and one B. So if we stamp on two cells that are already non-white, we can change them? \n\n  The operation is: \n      It sets the two cells to R and B (in one of the two orders). \n\n  So if we have [R, B] and we stamp again as BR, we get [B, R]. \n  If we have [R, B] and we stamp as RB, we get [R, B] again? \n\n  Actually, no: the stamp sets the two cells to the new colors. So if we stamp as BR, then the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R. \n\n  Therefore, we can change the colors arbitrarily? \n\n  But then what constraints are there? \n\n  Known solution from Codeforces problems (like \"Stamp Coloring\") is:\n\n      We split the string by 'W'. Then for each contiguous non-white segment:\n          if the segment has length 1 -> impossible -> set flag to false.\n          else, we check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B? \n\n      Why? \n          Because if a segment has only R's, then how did the B's disappear? \n          Actually, we can only set two adjacent cells to one R and one B. So if we have a segment that is entirely R, then every time we stamped we set one R and one B. Then we must have at least one B? \n\n      But wait: we can overwrite the B? \n\n      Example: \n          We have a segment of two: \n              We stamp: [R, B] -> then we stamp the second cell again with a stamp that covers the second and a third cell? But the segment is only two? \n\n      Actually, the segment is contiguous and non-white. We are considering the entire contiguous segment. \n\n      How can we get a segment of two that is [R, R]? \n          We start: [W, W]\n          Step1: stamp on the two: [R, B] -> then we stamp again on the two: [B, R] -> then we stamp again: [R, B] -> ... \n          We never get [R, R]. \n\n      How about with three? \n          We want [R, R, W]? \n          Step1: stamp on the first two: [R, B, W] -> then we stamp on the second and third: [R, R, B] -> then we have [R, R, B]. \n          Then we can stamp on the second and third again: [R, B, R] -> then again: [R, R, B] -> ... \n          We never get rid of the B? \n\n      How to get [R, R, R]? \n          We start: [W, W, W]\n          Step1: [R, B, W]\n          Step2: [R, R, B]  (stamp on the second and third as RB: so second becomes R and third becomes B)\n          Step3: stamp on the first and second: [B, R, B] -> then we have two B's? \n          Step4: stamp on the second and third: [B, B, R] -> then we have two B's? \n          Step5: stamp on the first and second: [R, B, R] -> then step6: stamp on the second and third: [R, R, B] -> ... \n\n      It seems we cannot get three R's? \n\n  Therefore, the constraint is: \n      In any contiguous non-white segment, we must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n  But wait: what if the segment is of length 1? Then we cannot have both R and B? So that is impossible. \n\n  And if the segment is of length>=2, then we must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n  However, consider a segment of two: [R, B] -> valid. \n  [B, R] -> valid. \n  [R, R] -> invalid? because we don't have a B? \n  [B, B] -> invalid? \n\n  So the solution: \n      Split the string by 'W'\n      For each part in the split:\n          if the part is not empty:\n              if the length of the part is 1 -> then it's impossible -> set b=1 (meaning we break and output NO)\n              else, if the part has only R's or only B's -> then it's impossible -> set b=1.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do this.\n\n  The provided code for program2.py:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n      The variable b is initially 0. Then we set b=1 if we find an invalid segment. Then we print: \n          if b==0 -> then we print 'YES' \n          if b==1 -> then we print 'NO'\n\n      How? \n          'YNEOS' is a string. \n          [b::2] means: \n            if b=0: then we take the substring starting at index 0 and stepping by 2: 'YES' -> because: \n                index0: 'Y', index2: 'E', index4: 'S' -> but stepping by 2: \n                [0::2] -> 'YES'? \n                Actually: \n                    'YNEOS'[0::2] -> take every other starting at 0: 'Y' (index0), then skip index1, then index2: 'E' -> but wait, we want \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n\n          Actually, the string is 'YNEOS' -> \n            We want to output \"YES\" if b==0, and \"NO\" if b==1.\n\n          How does [b::2] work?\n            If b=0: \n                s = 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> \n                    indices: 0, 2, 4 -> 'Y'+'E'+'S' -> \"YES\"\n            If b=1:\n                s = 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> \n                    indices: 1, 3 -> 'N'+'O' -> \"NO\"\n\n          So we set b=1 for an invalid segment.\n\n      Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i != '':   # non-empty segment\n                  if len(i)==1:\n                      b = 1\n                  else:\n                      # check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B?\n                      if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                          b = 1\n\n      But note: we might have multiple segments. We must check every segment. So we cannot break? But if we set b=1, then we want to output \"NO\". However, we can set b=1 and then continue to check? But that is okay: once we set b=1, we know the answer is \"NO\". But we can break early? The problem does not require to break early, and the total length is bounded.\n\n      However, we can do:\n\n          for part in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if part == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(part)==1 or 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                  b = 1\n\n      But note: if the segment is empty, we skip. \n\n      However, what if the entire string is white? Then we get an empty string? Then we skip. Then b remains 0 -> YES. That is correct: we don't need to stamp.\n\n      But note: the condition: \n          if len(part)==1 -> invalid.\n          or if the part has no 'R' OR no 'B' -> invalid.\n\n      But if the part has no 'R' then it must be all 'B'? and if it has no 'B' then it must be all 'R'. So that condition is equivalent to: the part is not empty and (either it has length 1 or it is missing one of the colors).\n\n      However, if the part has length>=2 and has both colors, we do nothing.\n\n      But note: what if the part has both colors? Then we leave b unchanged.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: if we have multiple segments, and one segment is invalid, we set b=1. But if a later segment is valid, we don't reset b to 0. So we set b=1 at the first invalid segment and then we leave it.\n\n      So the code:\n\n          for part in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if part:   # non-empty\n                  if len(part)==1 or 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                      b = 1\n\n      But note: the condition: if the part has both colors, we do nothing. \n\n      However, what if the part has both colors? Then we skip. \n\n      But what if the part has both colors but also has white? No, because we split by 'W', so the part has no white.\n\n      So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1\n\n      But note: the variable in the loop is called 'i' (as in the provided code: for i in ...). \n\n      So we write:\n\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1\n\n      However, we can write it without an extra if? Because if i is empty, we skip. But the condition: \n          if i:   # skips empty\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n              b = 1\n\n      But note: the condition: \n          (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n          This is true if at least one of the conditions holds.\n\n      But if the segment is non-empty and has both colors and length>=2, then the condition is false.\n\n      So that is what we want.\n\n  However, note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary because we don't want to consider empty segments.\n\n  But the split might produce empty strings. We skip them.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n          print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n  But note: the input reading: \n      [*open(0)] -> reads all lines.\n      [2::2] -> starts at index2 (the third element) and takes every other: so the first test case's n and s? \n          The input: \n            t\n            n1\n            s1\n            n2\n            s2\n            ...\n\n          So [2::2] gives the s1, s2, ... (the strings for the test cases). \n\n      Then we do: s[:-1] -> because each line has a newline? So we remove the last character? But the last character of the string is the newline. Then we split by 'W'.\n\n  However, what if the string ends with a newline? Then s[:-1] removes the newline. Then we split by 'W' and get the parts.\n\n  But what if the string has a newline? Then s is, for example, \"RBRB\\n\", so s[:-1] is \"RBRB\". \n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the last test case might not have a newline? The problem says: the string s of length n. And we read with open(0) and then [2::2] and then s[:-1]. \n\n  However, the input is guaranteed to have a newline? Because the problem says: the first line is t, then each test case: first line n, second line s. \n\n  But the last test case might not have a trailing newline? Actually, the sample inputs do have newlines. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use .strip()? But the problem says the string s has length n. And the next test case starts with the next integer. So we can use s.strip()? \n\n  But the provided code uses s[:-1]. So we assume the input has a newline.\n\n  Therefore, we use the above.\n\n  However, note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary to skip empty segments.\n\n  But what if the segment is non-empty? Then we check.\n\n  Example: \n      s = \"R\\n\" -> then s[:-1] = \"R\", then split by 'W' -> ['R'] -> then we set b=1 -> output \"NO\". Correct.\n\n      s = \"RR\\n\" -> then split: ['RR'] -> then condition: \n          len(i)==2 -> false, but then 'B' not in i -> true -> so condition true -> set b=1 -> \"NO\". Correct.\n\n      s = \"RB\\n\" -> then split: ['RB'] -> \n          len(i)=2 -> false, \n          'R' in i -> true, \n          'B' in i -> true -> \n          so condition: (false or false or false) -> false -> b remains 0 -> \"YES\". Correct.\n\n      s = \"RWR\\n\" -> split: ['R', 'R'] -> \n          first segment: 'R' -> set b=1 -> \"NO\". \n          But wait: the entire string is \"RWR\", which is three characters. \n          How to make \"RWR\"? \n            We start: [W, W, W]\n            Step1: stamp on the first two: [R, B, W] -> then we have \"RBW\"\n            Step2: stamp on the last two: we cannot because the last two are [B, W] -> we can stamp: [R, R, B] -> then we have \"RRB\", not \"RWR\".\n\n          How to get \"RWR\"? \n            We want: \n                first: R, second: W, third: R.\n            The second cell is white? But we started with white. How to make it white again? \n            Once we stamp, the cell becomes non-white. We cannot revert to white. \n\n          Therefore, \"RWR\" is impossible? \n\n          But note: the problem says the stamp must be applied to two neighboring cells. We cannot stamp a single cell. And we cannot partially stamp. \n\n          So the second cell must be stamped? But if we stamp the first two, the second becomes non-white. Then we cannot have it white. \n\n          Therefore, \"RWR\" is impossible. \n\n          Our code: \n            split by 'W': we get ['R', 'R'] -> two segments: \n                first segment: \"R\" -> invalid -> set b=1 -> \"NO\". \n\n          So it works.\n\n  But what about \"WW\"? \n      split: ['',''] -> both empty -> skip -> b=0 -> \"YES\". Correct.\n\n  What about \"RW\"? \n      split: ['R'] -> invalid -> \"NO\". \n      But is \"RW\" possible? \n          We start: [W, W]\n          We can stamp on the first two: [R, B] -> then we have \"RB\", not \"RW\". \n          How to get \"RW\"? \n            We want the second cell to remain white? But we have to stamp two adjacent cells. The only two adjacent cells are the first and second. So we must stamp them? Then the second becomes non-white. \n\n          Therefore, \"RW\" is impossible. Correct.\n\n  What about \"W\"? \n      split: [''] -> skip -> \"YES\". \n      But the picture \"W\" is all white -> we don't stamp -> possible. Correct.\n\n  However, note: the test case has n=1? \n      The first line of the test case: n=1, then the string \"W\". \n      Then we do: \n          for i in \"W\"[:-1].split(\"W\") -> \n          \"W\"[:-1] is \"\" -> split by 'W' -> ['','']? Actually, no: \n          s = \"W\\n\", then s[:-1] = \"W\". \n          \"W\".split('W') -> ['', '']? \n\n          Then we iterate: \n              i = '' -> skip\n              i = '' -> skip\n          so b remains 0 -> \"YES\". \n\n      But what if the string is \"R\" for n=1? \n          s = \"R\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"R\"\n          split by 'W' -> ['R'] -> then we set b=1 -> \"NO\". \n\n  So the code is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n          b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition is: \n      if the segment is non-empty and (either the segment has length 1 or the segment has no 'R' or the segment has no 'B') -> then invalid.\n\n  We can also write:\n\n      if i: \n          if len(i)==1:\n              b = 1\n          else:\n              if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1\n\n  But the one-liner is acceptable.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the body of the for-loop: \n      print(''.join(x))\n\nBut note: the code block is:\n\n      for x in zip(*a):\n          print(''.join(x))\n\nSo we output the string: \"    print(''.join(x))\" (with the indentation). But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the entire block that replaces the TODO? \n\nActually, the TODO is a single line? But the provided code has:\n\n      for x in zip(*a):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with a print statement. But note: the TODO is at the same indentation level as the for-loop body. So we must output the line that goes in the body.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we output the block? \n\n  But the example output format is a JSON with two strings: the completions for program1 and program2.\n\n  For program1, we output the string that is the code to put in the body of the for-loop. But note: the for-loop is already there. We only need the body.\n\n  So for program1, we output: \"print(''.join(x))\"\n\n  But we must preserve the indentation? The original code has 8 spaces of indentation? Actually, the provided code uses 4 spaces per level. The for-loop is at one level, then the body is one more level. \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n, _ = map(int, input().split())\n          a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\n          a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n          for x in zip(*a):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the body of the inner for-loop should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we must output the code that runs. So we use 4 spaces per level. \n\n  Since the line above the TODO is indented by 12? Actually, the provided code in the problem is:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n, _ = map(int, input().split())\n          a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\n          a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n          for x in zip(*a):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We see that the for-loop is at 8 spaces (two indents). Then the body should be 12 spaces. \n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the line: \"print(''.join(x))\" with the same indentation as the TODO? \n\n  Actually, the TODO is a comment. We replace it with the print statement at the same indentation level.\n\n  So we output: \"        print(''.join(x))\" (with 8 spaces at the beginning? But the for-loop line has 8 spaces and the body should have 12? \n\n  Let me count: \n      The first line: for _ ... -> 0 indent? \n      Then the next lines: \n          n, _ ... -> 4 spaces\n          a = ... -> 4 spaces\n          a = ... -> 4 spaces\n          for x ... -> 4 spaces? \n          then the body: 8 spaces.\n\n  Actually, the provided code in the problem uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\n  So the for-loop body should be indented by 8 spaces (two levels). \n\n  Therefore, for program1, we output: \"    print(''.join(x))\" (with 8 spaces: two tabs of 4) -> but we can use 4 spaces per indent, so two indents: 8 spaces? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify. But the sample output is just the code. We can use 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact indentation? But the problem says: so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n  We must output the code with the same indentation as the surrounding. \n\n  Since the for-loop line is at 4 spaces and the body is one more level, we use 8 spaces.\n\n  But the problem does not show the exact indentation of the provided code. However, the TODO is at the same level as the body. \n\n  We'll output: \"    print(''.join(x))\" meaning 4 more spaces? \n\n  Actually, the provided code in the problem has:\n\n      for x in zip(*a):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO line is indented by 4 more spaces than the for-loop line? \n\n  In Python, the body of a loop must be indented. We'll assume the standard: 4 spaces per indent.\n\n  So the for-loop is at 4 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop) and the body is at 8 spaces. \n\n  Therefore, we output for program1: \"    print(''.join(x))\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning of the line? Actually, the entire line should be 8 spaces: 4 for the outer block and 4 for the inner block). \n\n  But the problem does not show the exact indentation. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n  We'll output the line as: \"    print(''.join(x))\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning) meaning that in the context of the program, it will be at the correct indentation level? \n\n  Actually, the outer for-loop body is already indented by 4 spaces. Then the inner for-loop is indented by 4 more (so 8 in total). Then the body of the inner for-loop should be indented by 4 more (so 12). But the TODO is at 12? \n\n  The problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n  We'll output the exact line that should replace the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the inner for-loop body. \n\n  So we output: \"        print(''.join(x))\" (with 8 spaces at the beginning of the line) to make it 12 in the entire program? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. However, to be safe, we output the code that is exactly the body of the inner for-loop, with the same indentation as the TODO. \n\n  Since the TODO is a comment, we replace it with the print statement at the same indentation. \n\n  How many spaces? The problem does not specify. But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n  We'll output the line as: \"        print(''.join(x))\" (with 8 spaces) because the inner for-loop is at 4 spaces (so the body should be 8). \n\n  Actually, the provided code in the problem has:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          ... # 4 spaces\n          for x in zip(*a):\n              ... # 8 spaces\n\n  So the body of the inner for-loop should be at 8 spaces. \n\n  But the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n  Therefore, we output: \"        print(''.join(x))\" -> wait, that would be 8 spaces? But the line already has 4 from the outer block? \n\n  Actually, the entire program:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n, _ = map(int, input().split())\n          a = map(\"\".join, zip(*(input() for _ in range(n))))\n          a = (\"o\".join(\"\".join(sorted(y, reverse=True)) for y in x.split(\"o\")) for x in a)\n          for x in zip(*a):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The line with the TODO is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop). \n\n  So we output the line: \"        print(''.join(x))\" meaning 8 spaces? But that would be 8 spaces from the very left? \n\n  We must output the code that, when inserted, has the same indentation as the TODO. \n\n  Since the TODO is at 8 spaces, we output the print statement at 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. So we output:\n\n      \"        print(''.join(x))\"\n\n  with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But to run correctly, the indentation must be consistent. \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the spaces? But that would be invalid.\n\n  We'll output with 8 spaces.\n\n  Similarly, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n      if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n          b = 1\n\n  And the TODO is at the same indentation as the for-loop body. The for-loop body is at 4 spaces? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n  The for-loop over i is at 4 spaces. The body should be at 8 spaces? \n\n  But the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n  So we output: \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\n  But wait, that is two lines. \n\n  We can write:\n\n      if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1\n\n  in one line? \n\n  But the problem does not require one line. We can break it.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  We output:\n\n      \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\n  But note: the next line after the condition must be indented. \n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      if i: \n          if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n              b = 1\n\n  in three lines? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. \n\n  We choose the one-liner to save space? \n\n  But the condition might be long. \n\n  We'll output:\n\n      \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b = 1\"\n\n  as one line? \n\n  But that is acceptable in Python.\n\n  However, the style is not important as long as it runs.\n\n  So we output for program2: \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b = 1\"\n\n  with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n  But note: the for-loop body is at 4 spaces? Then the body of the for-loop should be indented by 4 more. So 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"        print(''.join(x))\",\n        \"program2\": \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b = 1\"\n      }\n\n  But wait: in program1, the print statement is one line. In program2, the condition is one line.\n\n  However, note: in program1, the for-loop body is one line. In program2, the for-loop body is one line.\n\n  But what if we have multiple lines? The problem does not restrict.\n\n  We output the above.\n\n  However, for program1, note: the for-loop body is only one print statement. \n\n  But what if we have multiple lines? The problem says: the missing block. \n\n  We output the exact code that should replace the TODO.\n\n  For program1: the TODO is one line, we replace with one line.\n\n  For program2: the TODO is one line, we replace with one line.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
