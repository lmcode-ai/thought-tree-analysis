What's wrong in the recurrence for j=2, i=1: \n                dp[1][2] = dp[0][1] (which is 0) + dp[1][2-1] = dp[1][1] = 1 -> then dp[1][2]=1. then for i=2, j=2: \n                dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = 1+0 = 1.\n            then ans=1+1=2. So the recurrence is:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i] and then if j>=D+1, subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1] \n\n            Why subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1]? In the example: for i=1, j=2: \n                not j>=3, so no subtract.\n\n            for i=2, j=2: \n                not j>=3, so no subtract. So it gives 2.\n\n            Test n=1, D=1, max_f=1:\n                i=1, j=1: \n                    dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[1][0] = 1+0 = 1.\n                ans=1. Test n=3, D=1, array [1,1,1]: \n                distinct_count=1, max_f=3.\n                Partitions of 3 with at least 3 parts and each part at most 1: \n                    only [1,1,1] -> 1.\n                dp[3][3] = \n                    i=3, j=3: \n                        = dp[2][2] + dp[3][0] \n                    dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = (dp[0][0]+dp[1][0]) + 0 = 1.\n                    then dp[3][3] = 1 + 0 = 1.\n                then ans=1. Test n=3, D=2, array [1,1,2]: distinct_count=2, max_f=2.\n                Partitions: [3] -> 1 part, but 1 part <2 -> not valid. [2,1] -> 2 parts: valid. [1,1,1] -> 3 parts: valid. so two. dp[2][3] = dp[1][2] + dp[2][1] \n                    dp[1][2] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][1] = 0+1 = 1.\n                    dp[2][1] = 0 because j=1 < i=2. so dp[2][3]=1. dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + dp[3][0] = (dp[1][1]+dp[2][0]) + 0 = 1.\n                ans = dp[2][3] + dp[3][3] = 2. So the recurrence seems to be: \n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i] \n                and then if j-i >= something, we subtract? In the code above, they subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1] when j>=D+1. Why? Explanation:",

However, the recurrence for partitions with exactly i parts and at least one part of size D: \n                    = dp[i][s-i] - dp[i][s-i, with parts at most D-1] But we don't have that state. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    Let g(i, s) = number of partitions of s into i parts, each at most D.\n                    Then: \n                         g(i, s) = g(i, s-i) + g(i-1, s-1) - g(i-1, s-1-D)   ??? Let me test with small: \n                    n=2, i=1, D=1: \n                         g(1,2) = g(1, 2-1) + g(0,1) - g(0, 1-1) = g(1,1) + 0 - 0 = 1? But g(1,2) should be 0 because the only part would be 2, but 2>1 -> invalid. So the recurrence is not matching. After checking, a standard recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and each part at most D is:\n\n            g(k, n) = g(k, n-1) + g(k-1, n-1) - g(k-1, n-D-1) How? Consider the partition:",

But note: the parts in the partition of s-i are at most D? So if we remove one part of size D, then the rest is a partition of s-i-D into i-1 parts, and each part at most D? Therefore: \n                    dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] - dp[i-1][s-1 - D] [if s-1-D>=0?]\n\n                However, wait: the term dp[i][s-i] gives partitions that might have a part of size D+1? Actually, we are adding 1 to every part, so if there was a part of size D, it becomes D+1 -> which is invalid. So we subtract the partitions that had a part of size D in the partition of s-i? Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n                    dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] \n                    but then subtract the partitions that have a part of size D in the partition of s-i? = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] - (if s-i >= D then dp[i-1][s-i - D] else 0) But note: the term dp[i][s-i] counts partitions of s-i into i parts (each at most D). Then we add 1 to every part -> then we get a partition of s into i parts, but the parts are now at least 2 and at most D+1.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are counting the number of distinct multisets M (of set sizes) that can be formed.\n\n Insight:\n The problem can be transformed as follows:\n\n Initially, we have one-element sets. Notice that the entire process is about merging disjoint sets. The disjointness condition is automatically satisfied if we are merging sets that come from distinct numbers? Not exactly: if two sets have the same number, then they are disjoint? Actually, note: the sets are built from distinct numbers? But wait: the array a can have repeated numbers. However, note that the initial sets are one-element sets of the same number? Actually, the array a has integers. For example, if we have two ones, then we have two sets {1} and {1}. These are disjoint? Actually, no: they are both {1} but they are distinct sets? However, the problem says: \"choose two different sets S and T on the whiteboard such that S \u2229 T = \u2205\". Since both sets are {1}, their intersection is {1} which is not empty. So we cannot merge two sets that have the same element? \n\n But note: the sets are built from the array. Each occurrence is a distinct set? Actually, the problem says: \"For each i, write the one-element set {a_i}\". So if we have two ones, we have two sets: {1} and {1}. However, these two sets are not disjoint because they both contain 1? \n\n However, in set theory, two sets that are both {1} have intersection {1}. Therefore, we cannot merge two sets that have the same element? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"S \u2229 T = \u2205\". So we can only merge sets that have no common element. Therefore, we can only merge sets that come from distinct numbers? \n\n However, consider: if we have two sets {1} and {1}, they are not disjoint? Then we cannot merge them. \n\n Therefore, the merging is only allowed between sets that have distinct numbers? \n\n But note: what if we have a set that is {1,2} and another set that is {1}? Then they are not disjoint? So we cannot merge them? \n\n Therefore, the merging is only allowed when the two sets have no common element. \n\n How do we form the sets? \n\n Actually, the process is equivalent to: \n   We start with n sets, each containing one element (the array element). \n   We can merge two sets if they are disjoint. \n\n The key is: two sets are disjoint if and only if they do not share any common number. Since each set initially has one number, two sets are disjoint if they have different numbers? \n\n However, after merging, a set may contain multiple numbers. Then we can only merge two sets that have no common number. \n\n Therefore, the entire process is building a collection of disjoint sets that cover the n elements? But note: the elements are the numbers in the array? Actually, the array elements are the labels? \n\n However, note: the array a may have repeated numbers. But the sets are built from the occurrences. Each occurrence is a distinct element? Actually, the problem does not say that the numbers are distinct. \n\n Important: The sets are built from the array. Each set initially is a singleton containing one element of the array. But note: if we have two ones, then we have two sets: each containing the number 1. These two sets are not disjoint? \n\n Therefore, we cannot merge two sets that have the same number? \n\n Then the process is: we can only merge sets that come from distinct numbers? \n\n However, after merging, we have a set that contains multiple distinct numbers. Then we can merge that set with another set that has a number that is not in that set? \n\n So the entire process is building connected components of a graph? Actually, we can think of the numbers as colors? But note: the array a has numbers (colors) from 1 to 10^9? \n\n Actually, the array a has n integers, and we are told that 1<=a_i<=10^9, but n<=2000. So we can compress the numbers.\n\n How to model the process?\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n The problem is equivalent to: we have a multiset of colors. We start with n singletons. We can merge two sets that have no common color. The goal is to count the distinct multisets of the sizes of the sets at the end.\n\n However, note: the merging process is arbitrary? We can do any sequence of merges? \n\n But note: the disjointness condition: we can only merge sets that are disjoint. This is equivalent to: we can merge any two sets that do not share a common color. \n\n Therefore, the entire process is building a partition of the set of occurrences (n occurrences) such that in each part, all the occurrences have distinct colors? \n\n Actually, no: because if two occurrences have the same color, they cannot be merged? But wait: they are initially in separate sets. Then we cannot merge them? And they must remain separate? \n\n Therefore, the condition is: in the same set, we cannot have two occurrences of the same color? \n\n So the sets we form must be such that each color appears at most once in each set? \n\n Therefore, the entire process is partitioning the multiset of colors (with n occurrences) into groups such that in each group, all the colors are distinct? \n\n Then the multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of these groups.\n\n And we are to count the distinct multisets M that can be formed? \n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use all the sets? Actually, we start with n sets and we merge until we have a collection of sets. We are allowed to stop at any time? \n\n But note: the problem says \"after zero or more operations\". So we can have any partition of the set of occurrences (the n elements) into groups that are color-disjoint (i.e., no two elements in the same group have the same color). \n\n However, wait: the initial sets are the occurrences. Then we merge disjoint sets arbitrarily. The condition for merging is that the two sets are disjoint (so no common color). Therefore, the sets we form are exactly the groups that are color-disjoint? \n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n   We have a multiset of colors (with n elements, and the frequency of each distinct color is known). \n   We wish to partition the multiset into groups (each group being a set of distinct colors) and we are free to form any partition? \n\n But note: the same color can appear multiple times in the entire multiset, but in one group we can have at most one occurrence of that color? \n\n Therefore, the problem is: we have a multiset of colors. We wish to partition the multiset into groups such that each group has distinct colors. The multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the groups. How many distinct multisets M can be formed? \n\n However, note: the groups are unlabelled, and the multiset M is the sorted list of group sizes? Actually, the problem says \"multiset\", so order does not matter.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the groups to be non-empty? Actually, we start with n elements, so the groups are non-empty and form a partition.\n\n However, the problem does not require the entire set to be partitioned? Actually, we start with n sets and we merge arbitrarily (so we can leave some sets unmerged). Therefore, the entire set of n elements is partitioned.\n\n Therefore, we are to count the distinct multisets of the sizes of the groups in a partition of the multiset of n elements (with colors) such that in each group, all colors are distinct.\n\n How to count?\n\n Let the distinct colors be c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, and let f_i be the frequency of color c_i.\n\n In a valid partition, each group can contain at most one occurrence of each color. Therefore, the entire partition must assign each occurrence to a group, and for each color, all its occurrences must go to distinct groups.\n\n How to model the multiset of group sizes? \n\n We can use generating functions and combinatorial optimization.\n\n Alternatively, note that the multiset of group sizes is a partition of n (the sum of the group sizes is n) and the group sizes are positive integers. However, there is an additional constraint: for each color i, we have f_i occurrences that must be assigned to distinct groups. This means that the number of groups that have at least one occurrence of color i is at least f_i? Actually, no: each occurrence of color i must be in a distinct group. Therefore, the group that gets an occurrence of color i must be distinct for each occurrence. So the constraint is: the number of groups that contain color i is at least f_i? Actually, no: each group can contain at most one occurrence of color i. Therefore, we need at least f_i groups to cover the f_i occurrences of color i? \n\n Actually, the constraint is: the group sizes are arbitrary, but the entire partition must cover all occurrences and for each color i, the occurrences of that color must be in distinct groups. \n\n How to count the distinct multisets of group sizes? \n\n We can use the following:\n\n Let the multiset of group sizes be represented by a partition of n: (l_1, l_2, ..., l_k) with l_1>=l_2>=...>=l_k and sum l_i = n.\n\n The condition: for each color i, we have at most one occurrence of that color in a group. Therefore, the number of groups that have at least one occurrence of color i must be at least f_i? Actually, no: we have exactly f_i occurrences of color i, and each group can have at most one occurrence of color i. Therefore, we must assign these f_i occurrences to f_i distinct groups. Therefore, the condition is: the number of groups (which is k) must be at least max_i f_i? \n\n But note: we can have more groups? Actually, we can have groups that do not contain color i? \n\n The condition for color i: we need at least f_i groups that have at least one occurrence of color i? Actually, no: we need to assign each occurrence of color i to a distinct group. So we need at least f_i groups? But note: the same group cannot have two of the same color. Therefore, the entire partition must have at least max_i f_i groups? \n\n However, consider: if we have two colors: color 1 appears 3 times, color 2 appears 2 times. Then we need at least 3 groups? \n\n But what if we have a partition: [1,2], [1], [1]? \n   Group1: {1,2} -> size 2\n   Group2: {1} -> size 1\n   Group3: {1} -> size 1\n This is valid? \n   For color1: the three ones are in three different groups? Actually, no: the first group has one occurrence of color1 and the second group has one and the third has one -> that's three distinct groups -> valid.\n   For color2: the two occurrences? They are in the first group and ... wait, we only have one occurrence of color2? Actually, the array: we have two colors: so we have 3 ones and 2 twos? Then the groups:\n        Group1: {1,2} -> one occurrence of 1 and one of 2.\n        Group2: {1} -> one occurrence of 1.\n        Group3: {1} -> one occurrence of 1.\n        But we have only one occurrence of 2? Then we are missing one occurrence of 2? \n\n Actually, we have 3+2=5 elements. The groups must cover all 5. So we need to assign the two 2's: we have only one 2 in group1, so we need another group for the other 2? \n\n Therefore, we need at least max(f_i) groups? Actually, we need at least max(f_i) groups? But also, the total number of groups must be at least the maximum frequency? \n\n However, note: the condition for color i: we need at least f_i groups? So the total number of groups must be at least max_i f_i. \n\n Therefore, a partition (l_1, l_2, ..., l_k) is valid if and only if k >= max_i f_i? \n\n But is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: we have two colors: color1: 3 times, color2: 3 times. Then we need at least 3 groups. \n\n Now, can we assign the 3 ones and 3 twos to 3 groups? \n   We can do: \n        Group1: {1,2} -> size 2\n        Group2: {1,2} -> size 2\n        Group3: {1,2} -> size 2\n   This is valid: each group has distinct colors? Yes, because each group has one 1 and one 2? \n\n But what if we have 3 groups of size 3? \n        Group1: {1,2,?} -> but we only have two colors? Actually, we have two colors? Then we cannot put three distinct colors? \n\n Actually, we have only two distinct colors. So in a group, we can have at most two elements? (one for each color). Therefore, the maximum size of a group is the number of distinct colors? \n\n Actually, the maximum size of a group is the total number of distinct colors? But note: we are not required to use all colors in a group? \n\n However, the constraint is only that in a group, we cannot have two of the same color. Therefore, the maximum size of a group is the total number of distinct colors? \n\n Actually, no: the group can have at most one element per color. Therefore, the maximum size of a group is at most the total number of distinct colors? \n\n But note: we don't have to have all colors in a group? So the group size can be at most the total distinct colors? \n\n Therefore, the constraints for a partition (l_1, l_2, ..., l_k) are:\n   (1) k >= max_i f_i   [because for the color with frequency f_i, we need at least f_i groups to put each occurrence in a distinct group]\n   (2) each l_j <= k0, where k0 is the total distinct colors? Actually, no: the total distinct colors is the number of distinct colors that appear? But note: a group can have at most one element per color, so the size of a group cannot exceed the total distinct colors? \n\n However, note: the total distinct colors is the number of distinct colors that appear? Let D = number of distinct colors. Then condition (2) is l_j <= D for every j? \n\n But wait: what if we have D=3, then a group can have at most 3 elements? \n\n Therefore, the partition must satisfy:\n   k >= max_i f_i\n   and for every j, l_j <= D\n\n However, is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: we have two colors: color1: 3 times, color2: 3 times, and D=2. Then we require k>=3 and each group size at most 2. Then the only partition of 6 with k>=3 and each part <=2 is: [2,2,2]. \n\n How do we assign? \n   We have 3 groups. We need to assign 3 ones and 3 twos. \n   We can assign: \n        Group1: one 1 and one 2 -> size 2\n        Group2: one 1 and one 2 -> size 2\n        Group3: one 1 and one 2 -> size 2\n   This works.\n\n But what if we have: color1: 3 times, color2: 3 times, and we try a partition [3,3]? \n   This partition has k=2, but we require k>=max(f_i)=3 -> so k=2 is invalid. \n\n What if we have: color1: 3 times, color2: 1 time? \n   Then we require k>=3. \n   We have 4 elements. The partition must have k>=3 and each group size at most 2 (since D=2). \n   The only partition: [2,1,1] (or permutations). \n   How to assign? \n        Group1: {1,2} -> size 2\n        Group2: {1} -> size 1\n        Group3: {1} -> size 1\n        This uses the one 2 and three 1's? \n        But we have only one 2? Then we have two groups with one 1 and one group with one 1 and one 2? \n        That uses the 2 and two of the 1's? We are missing one 1? \n\n Actually, we have 3 ones and one two. \n        Group1: {1,2} -> uses one 1 and the one 2.\n        Group2: {1} -> uses one 1.\n        Group3: {1} -> uses one 1.\n        That uses all.\n\n Therefore, the conditions are:\n   (1) k (the number of groups) >= max_i f_i\n   (2) each group size l_j <= D (the total distinct colors)\n\n But note: condition (2) is necessary because a group cannot have two elements of the same color? Actually, no: a group can have multiple colors? But the constraint is that a group cannot have two elements of the same color. Therefore, the maximum number of elements in a group is the total distinct colors? \n\n However, note: we might not have all colors? Actually, the distinct colors that appear in the entire array is D. But a group can only contain a subset of these colors? So the size of a group is at most D? \n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n   Count the number of multisets (which correspond to partitions of n) such that:\n        (a) the number of parts (groups) k >= max_f (where max_f = max_i f_i)\n        (b) each part is at most D (the total distinct colors)\n\n But note: the multiset M is the multiset of the group sizes. And we are counting distinct multisets? \n\n However, note: two different partitions that are rearrangements of the same multiset of group sizes are the same multiset? \n\n Therefore, we are counting the number of partitions of n (with parts at most D) that have at least max_f parts? \n\n But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: the condition (a) is about the number of parts (k) being at least max_f. \n\n However, note: the partition of n is represented by a multiset of positive integers that sum to n. The condition (a) is that the number of parts (which is the count of numbers in the multiset) is at least max_f. \n\n But note: the condition (b) is that each part is at most D.\n\n Therefore, the answer is: \n        Let max_f = max(f_i) and D = number of distinct colors (i.e., the number of i such that f_i>0).\n        Then we want the number of partitions of n with at least max_f parts and each part at most D.\n\n However, note: the partition must have at least max_f parts and each part at most D? \n\n But wait: what if max_f is 0? Then n=0? But n>=1. \n\n Example: n=1, then max_f = 1, D=1. \n        Partitions of 1: [1] -> number of parts=1>=1 -> valid. \n        So answer=1.\n\n Example: n=2, and two distinct colors: [1,2] -> then f_1=1, f_2=1 -> max_f=1, D=2.\n        Partitions of 2: \n            [2] -> number of parts=1>=1 -> valid? But condition (b): part=2<=2 -> valid? \n            [1,1] -> number of parts=2>=1 -> valid? \n        So two multisets: {2} and {1,1}. \n\n But what does the problem say for n=2? \n        The array: [1,2]\n        The possible M: \n            Option1: no merge: then we have two sets: {1}, {2} -> M = {1,1} -> multiset of sizes: two ones.\n            Option2: merge: then we have one set: {1,2} -> M = {2}.\n        So indeed two.\n\n Example: n=2, and one color: [1,1] -> then f_1=2, D=1.\n        Partitions of 2: \n            [2] -> number of parts=1 -> but we require at least max_f=2 -> invalid.\n            [1,1] -> number of parts=2>=2 -> valid? \n        But condition (b): each part must be at most D=1 -> [1,1] is valid, but [2] is invalid because 2>1? \n        So only one.\n\n        The process: \n            We cannot merge the two sets because they are both {1} -> not disjoint? \n            So we must have two sets: {1} and {1} -> M = {1,1}. \n        So only one.\n\n Therefore, the conditions are correct.\n\n How to compute the number of partitions of n with at least k0 parts and each part at most D? \n\n We can use generating functions? \n\n Alternatively, note: \n        Let p(n, k, D) = number of partitions of n with exactly k parts and each part at most D.\n\n        Then we want: \n            sum_{k = k0}^{n} p(n, k, D)\n\n        But note: the condition \"each part at most D\" is equivalent to \"each part in the range [1, D]\". \n\n        Also, the condition of having exactly k parts: we can use the recurrence:\n\n            dp[k][n] = number of partitions of n into exactly k parts with each part in [1, D]\n\n            We can do: \n                dp[0][0] = 1\n                for i in range(1, n+1): # parts\n                    for j in range(i, n+1): # total sum\n                        # we add a part of size at least 1 and at most D\n                        # but note: we require the parts to be at least 1 and at most D, and we are building in increasing order? Actually, we don't care about order? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use generating functions.\n\n        However, note: the constraints: n, k0, D up to 2000? \n\n        We can do:\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-k] + dp[k-1][n-1] - ... ? \n\n        Actually, we can use the recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and maximum part at most D? \n\n        We know: the number of partitions of n into exactly k parts is the same as the number of partitions of n with maximum part at most k? \n\n        But here we have two constraints: \n            - each part at most D\n            - exactly k parts\n\n        We can use: \n            Let f(n, k, D) = number of partitions of n into exactly k parts, each at most D.\n\n        We can use: \n            f(n, k, D) = f(n, k, D-1) + f(n-D, k-1, D)   [if we take at least one D?] \n        But note: we are building with exactly k parts. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use generating functions: \n            The generating function for one part: x + x^2 + ... + x^D.\n            Then the generating function for k parts: (x + x^2 + ... + x^D)^k.\n\n        But we want the coefficient of x^n in the sum_{k=k0}^{n} (x + ... + x^D)^k? \n\n        However, n up to 2000, k0 up to 2000, D up to 2000? \n\n        We can do a DP for partitions? \n\n        Let dp[k][n] = number of ways to partition n into k parts (each between 1 and D). \n        Then:\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i from 1 to n: \n                for j from i to n: \n                    # we can add a part of size 1 to D? \n                    # but we are building k parts? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp[k][j] = dp[k][j-1]   [we can increase every part by 1?] -> no.\n\n        Standard recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and each part at least 1: \n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-k] + dp[k-1][n-1] \n            But that recurrence is for partitions with parts at least 1 and we don't have the upper bound.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp[k][n] = number of partitions of n into k parts, each in [1, D]\n\n            Then:\n                dp[0][0] = 1\n                for i from 1 to n:\n                    for j from 1 to min(i, D):   # j is the size of the next part? \n                        for k from j to n:\n                            dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k-j]\n\n            But that is O(n^2 * D) -> 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 -> too slow.\n\n        We can use generating functions and convolution? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the recurrence:\n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-1] + dp[k-1][n-1] - (if n-1-D>=0 then dp[k-1][n-1-D] else 0)\n\n        Why? \n            Consider: \n                We can form a partition of n into k parts by taking a partition of n-1 into k parts and adding 1 to one of the parts? But then the parts are not necessarily distinct? \n\n            Actually, we can use:\n\n                dp[k][n] = dp[k-1][n-1] + dp[k][n-k]   [if we assume the parts are non-decreasing?] \n\n            But we have an upper bound D.\n\n        Another recurrence: \n            We can use the generating function: \n                F_k(x) = (x + x^2 + ... + x^D) * F_{k-1}(x) \n            Then we can do convolution? \n\n        Since n and k are up to 2000, we can do:\n\n            dp = [0]*(n+1)\n            dp[0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, k_max+1):   # k_max = n (since k can be up to n)\n                new_dp = [0]*(n+1)\n                for j in range(0, n+1):\n                    if dp[j] != 0:\n                        # add a part of size s in [1, D]\n                        for s in range(1, D+1):\n                            if j+s <= n:\n                                new_dp[j+s] = (new_dp[j+s] + dp[j]) % M\n                dp = new_dp\n                # then for k>=k0, we add the total for k to the answer? \n\n            Then we would do:\n                ans = 0\n                for k in range(k0, n+1):\n                    ans = (ans + dp_k[n]) % M\n\n            But the state is n (which is 2000) and k from 1 to 2000, and inner loop D (2000) -> 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 -> too slow.\n\n        We need a better recurrence.\n\n        We can use a different recurrence: \n\n            Let dp[n] = number of partitions of n with parts in [1, D] (without fixing the number of parts). Then we want to count by the number of parts? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use generating functions and exponent? \n\n        But note: we need to count by the number of parts. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-1] + dp[k-1][n-1] - dp[k-1][n-D-1]   [if we consider the recurrence for the generating function: (x*(1-x^D)/(1-x))^k ]\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-1] + dp[k-1][n-1] \n            but then subtract the ones that have a part of size D+1? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-k] + dp[k-1][n-1] - (if n-1>=D+1 then dp[k-1][n-D-1] else 0) \n\n        This is not standard.\n\n        Standard recurrence for bounded part: \n            We can use the recurrence that considers the smallest part:\n\n            Let p(n, k, D) = p(n, k, D-1) + p(n-D, k-1, D)   [if we take at least one part of size D]\n\n            But note: we are counting partitions with exactly k parts. \n\n            Then:\n                p(n, k, D) = 0 if n<k or n>k*D\n                p(n, k, D) = 1 if n==k and D>=1? \n                Otherwise: \n                    p(n, k, D) = p(n, k, D-1) + p(n-D, k-1, D)\n\n            However, note: if we set D as the maximum part, then we can do:\n\n                p(n, k, D) = \n                    if D==0: then 0\n                    else: \n                         p(n, k, D-1)   [partitions that do not use D] \n                         + p(n-D, k-1, D)   [partitions that use at least one D: then we remove one part of D and reduce the problem to n-D and k-1, and we can still use D?]\n\n            But note: we are allowing multiple parts of size D? \n\n            This recurrence is standard. \n\n            However, the state: n up to 2000, k up to 2000, D up to 2000 -> 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 -> too slow.\n\n        We need to optimize: note that k and D are bounded by n, but n is 2000 -> 2000^3 is 8e9 which is too slow in Python.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use generating functions and use convolution with FFT? But n=2000, and we are working modulo 998244353, but we don't need FFT for n=2000? \n\n        We can do a 2D DP: \n            dp[k][n] = p(n, k, D)   [for fixed D?] \n\n        But note: D is fixed (the distinct count) and we want to compute for k from k0 to n.\n\n        How to compute without the third dimension? \n\n        We can fix D and do:\n\n            dp = [0]*(n+1)\n            dp[0] = 1\n            # we are going to iterate for part sizes from 1 to D? \n            # but we want to count by the number of parts? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Let f(k) = coefficient of x^n in (x*(1-x^D)/(1-x))^k? \n\n        But we need to sum for k from k0 to n.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            F(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} (x*(1-x^D)/(1-x))^k   [but then we are summing over k?]\n\n        Then the answer is the coefficient of x^n in F(x) but only for k>=k0? \n\n        Actually, we want: \n            F(x) = sum_{k=k0}^{n} [x*(1-x^D)/(1-x)]^k\n\n        Then F(x) = [x*(1-x^D)/(1-x)]^{k0} / (1 - x*(1-x^D)/(1-x))   [if we consider geometric series?] \n\n        But note: the generating function for one part: x*(1-x^D)/(1-x) = x + x^2 + ... + x^D.\n\n        Then F(x) = (x + x^2 + ... + x^D)^{k0} / (1 - (x + x^2 + ... + x^D))   [but the denominator is for k>=k0?]\n\n        Actually, the generating function for k>=k0 is:\n\n            (x + x^2 + ... + x^D)^{k0} * (1 + (x+...+x^D) + (x+...+x^D)^2 + ... ) \n            = (x+...+x^D)^{k0} / (1 - (x+...+x^D))\n\n        But note: the denominator: 1 - (x+...+x^D) = 1 - x(1-x^D)/(1-x) = (1-x - x(1-x^D))/(1-x) = (1-2x+x^{D+1})/(1-x) ? \n\n        This seems messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a 2D DP that is O(n^2) by iterating the part size? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-1] + dp[k-1][n-1] \n            but then subtract the partitions that have a part of size D+1? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-1] + dp[k-1][n-1] - (if n-1>=D+1 then dp[k-1][n-1-D] else 0)\n\n        Why? \n            Consider: \n                We can form a partition of n into k parts by:\n                  Option1: take a partition of n-1 into k parts and add 1 to one of the parts? But then we don't know which part we add to? \n\n            Instead, we can use the recurrence that considers the smallest part? \n\n        Actually, we can use the recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and maximum part at most D? \n\n        We know: \n            The number of partitions of n into exactly k parts is the same as the number of partitions of n with largest part k? \n\n        But we have an upper bound D on the part size? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and each part at most D: \n\n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-k] + dp[k-1][n-1] - dp[k-1][n-D-1]   ??? \n\n        I recall: \n            We can map a partition with exactly k parts (each at least 1) to a partition with parts in non-decreasing order: a1<=a2<=...<=ak.\n            Then we can define b_i = a_i + (k-i)  [this is the Frobenius representation?] \n            Then the condition a_i>=1 and a_i<=D becomes ... \n\n        This might be complicated.\n\n        Given the constraints (n, k0, D up to 2000), we can do:\n\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            # dp[k][s] = number of partitions of s into exactly k parts, each at most D\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):   # i: number of parts\n                # j: total sum, from i to min(i*D, n)\n                for s in range(i, n+1):\n                    # we can have the smallest part being 1? \n                    # then the rest: i-1 parts that sum to s-1, and each part at least 1 and at most D -> but then the rest parts are at least 1 and at most D? \n                    # but if we set the smallest part to be 1, then we remove one part of 1 and we have a partition of s-1 into i-1 parts, each at most D? \n                    # However, the smallest part might be greater than 1? \n\n                    # Alternatively, we can do:\n                    #   dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i]   [if we subtract 1 from every part, then we get a partition of s-i into i parts, each at least 0?] -> no.\n\n                    # We can do: \n                    #   dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-1]   [by adding 1 to the smallest part?] -> no.\n\n                    # Instead, we can use:\n                    #   dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s-1]   [if the smallest part is 1] \n                    #            + dp[i][s-i]      [if we add 1 to every part?] \n                    #   but then we might exceed D? \n\n            Actually, we can use the recurrence that increases every part by 1: \n                Consider: \n                    We can form a partition of s into i parts by taking a partition of s-i into i parts (and then add 1 to every part) -> but then the parts become at least 2? \n                And we also have the partitions that have a part of size 1: then we remove that part and get a partition of s-1 into i-1 parts.\n\n                So: \n                    dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1]\n\n                But then we have to subtract the ones that have a part that becomes D+1? \n\n                Specifically, the recurrence dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] counts partitions that might have a part exceeding D? \n\n                How to account for the upper bound? \n\n                In the term dp[i][s-i]: \n                    This corresponds to taking a partition of s-i into i parts (each at most D) and then adding 1 to every part -> then the new parts are at most D+1? \n                    But we want at most D. So we must subtract the partitions that originally had a part of size D (so after adding 1, it becomes D+1). \n\n                How many such partitions? \n                    They are the partitions of s-i into i parts that have at least one part of size D. \n                    This is the same as the number of partitions of s-i - D into i-1 parts (if we remove one part of size D) and then we have i-1 parts? \n                    Actually, we remove one part of size D and then we have a partition of s-i - D into i-1 parts? But then we add 1 to every part? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use inclusion: \n                    The number of partitions of s-i into i parts that have at least one part of size D is dp[i-1][s-i - D]? \n                    Why? \n                        Remove one part of size D, then we have a partition of s-i - D into i-1 parts? \n\n                But note: the parts in the partition of s-i are at most D? So if we remove one part of size D, then the rest is a partition of s-i-D into i-1 parts, and each part at most D? \n\n                Therefore: \n                    dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] - dp[i-1][s-1 - D]   [if s-1-D>=0?]\n\n                However, wait: the term dp[i][s-i] gives partitions that might have a part of size D+1? Actually, we are adding 1 to every part, so if there was a part of size D, it becomes D+1 -> which is invalid. \n\n                So we subtract the partitions that had a part of size D in the partition of s-i? \n\n                Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n                    dp[i][s] = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] \n                    but then subtract the partitions that have a part of size D in the partition of s-i? \n\n                    = dp[i][s-i] + dp[i-1][s-1] - (if s-i >= D then dp[i-1][s-i - D] else 0) \n\n                But note: the term dp[i][s-i] counts partitions of s-i into i parts (each at most D). Then we add 1 to every part -> then we get a partition of s into i parts, but the parts are now at least 2 and at most D+1. \n                We want to remove the ones that have a part of size D+1. \n                How many of these? They correspond to partitions of s-i that had at least one part of size D. \n                And the number of such partitions is: \n                    = the number of partitions of s-i into i parts that have at least one part of size D? \n                    = the number of partitions of s-i - D into i-1 parts (each at most D)   [because we remove one part of size D]? \n                    = dp[i-1][s-i-D]   ??? \n\n                But note: we are removing one part of size D, and then we have i-1 parts that sum to s-i-D, and each at most D? \n\n                However, the recurrence for partitions with exactly i parts and at least one part of size D: \n                    = dp[i][s-i] - dp[i][s-i, with parts at most D-1] \n                But we don't have that state.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    Let g(i, s) = number of partitions of s into i parts, each at most D.\n                    Then: \n                         g(i, s) = g(i, s-i) + g(i-1, s-1) - g(i-1, s-1-D)   ??? \n\n                Let me test with small: \n                    n=2, i=1, D=1: \n                         g(1,2) = g(1, 2-1) + g(0,1) - g(0, 1-1) = g(1,1) + 0 - 0 = 1? \n                         But g(1,2) should be 0 because the only part would be 2, but 2>1 -> invalid.\n\n                So the recurrence is not matching.\n\n        After checking, a standard recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and each part at most D is:\n\n            g(k, n) = g(k, n-1) + g(k-1, n-1) - g(k-1, n-D-1)\n\n        How? \n            Consider the partition: \n                If the smallest part is 1, then we remove that part: g(k-1, n-1)\n                If the smallest part is at least 2, then we subtract 1 from every part: then we get a partition of n-k into k parts, each at least 1 and at most D-1? \n                But then we have: \n                    g(k, n) = g(k-1, n-1) + g(k, n-k, D-1) \n\n            But we don't have D-1? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            g(k, n, D) = g(k, n, D-1) + g(k-1, n-D, D)   [if we use a part of size D]\n\n        But then we have a 3D state? \n\n        Given the constraints (n, k, D <= 2000), we can do a 2D DP that iterates over k and n, and we fix D? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            # dp[k][s] = number of partitions of s into exactly k parts, each at most D\n            # We fix D = distinct_count (which is at most n, but we are given D)\n\n            for k in range(0, n+1):\n                for s in range(0, n+1):\n                    if k==0:\n                        dp[k][s] = 1 if s==0 else 0\n                    else:\n                        # Option1: the smallest part is 1 -> then we remove one part of 1: then we have k-1 parts and total s-1.\n                        # Option2: every part is at least 2 -> then we subtract 1 from every part: then we have k parts and total s-k, and each part at least 1 and at most D-1? \n                        # But note: we want each part at most D.

This counts the number of ways to write s as sum of k parts (each in [1,D]) but the parts are unordered? \n\n            However, in a partition, the parts are unordered. \n\n            But note: the recurrence above counts compositions? (ordered) -> no, because we are iterating m and then for each m we add a part of size m. This is for unordered partitions? \n\n            Actually, it is the standard knapsack for distinct part sizes? No, it allows repeated use of the same part size? \n\n            But in a partition, we can have repeated part sizes. \n\n            This recurrence is for: number of partitions of s into exactly k parts, each at most D, and the parts can be repeated? \n\n            And it is O(n*k*D) = 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 -> too slow.\n\n        We need a better method.\n\n        Insight: we can use generating functions and then use a 1D FFT?

But n=2000, and we are convolving with a polynomial of degree D (which is up to 2000) -> convolution can be done in O(n log n) per k? Then total O(n^2 log n) which is 2000^2 * log(2000) ~ 4e6 * 11 = 44e6 -> acceptable in C++ but in Python? \n\n        But note: we are in Python and n=2000, and we have 2000 convolutions? 2000 * (n*log(n)) = 2000 * (2000 * log2(2000)) ~ 2000 * (2000 * 11) = 44e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if we use efficient convolution? \n\n        However, we are working modulo 998244353, so we can use NTT?

But the problem says one test case.\n\n        Steps for the entire solution:\n\n            Step 1: Read n.\n            Step 2: Read the array a of n integers.\n            Step 3: \n                Count frequencies: \n                    cnt = [0]*(n)   # but a_i can be up to 10^9, so we compress.\n                Actually, we only care about the distinct count D and the maximum frequency max_f.\n\n            Step 4: \n                D = number of distinct colors in a.\n                max_f = max(frequencies)\n\n            Step 5: \n                If n==0: print 0 and exit.\n\n            Step 6: \n                Precompute h[0..n]: \n                    h[0] = 1\n                    for s in range(1, n+1):\n                        h[s] = 0\n                        # for j in range(1, min(s, D)+1):\n                        #   h[s] = (h[s] + h[s-j]) % M\n                        # But we can do: \n                        #   h[s] = (h[s-1] + ... + h[s-D])   for s>=1, but if s<=D, then we go from 1 to s.\n                        # We can use a Fenwick tree? But n=2000, so we can do a loop of D for each s -> O(n*D) = 2000*2000 = 4e6 -> acceptable.\n\n            Step 7: \n                If k0 = max_f is 0, then we only have the empty partition? but n>=1, so k0>=1.\n\n                Compute f = C(x)^{k0} by exponentiation by squaring, where C(x) = x + x^2 + ... + x^D.\n\n                We represent f as a polynomial of degree at most n.\n\n            Step 8: \n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if i <= n and n-i>=0:\n                        ans = (ans + f[i] * h[n-i]) % M\n\n            Step 9: \n                Print ans.\n\n        But note: what if k0 is 0? then we use the entire series? \n\n        However, k0 = max_f, and since n>=1, max_f>=1.\n\n        But what if there is no element? n=0 -> then we skip.\n\n        However, n>=1.\n\n        But note: the generating function for C(x)^0 = 1.\n\n        Then for k0=0: \n            f = [1] + [0]*n   (degree 0 polynomial)\n            then ans = h[n] \n\n        But if k0=0, then we are summing from k=0 to infinity: \n            G(x) = 1 + C(x) + C(x)^2 + ... = 1/(1-C(x)) = H(x)\n            so ans = h[n]\n\n        But our recurrence for h: \n            h[0]=1, and for n>=1: h[n] = h[n-1]+...+h[n-D] \n            and note that h[n] is the number of compositions of n into parts of size at most D? \n\n        And also, it is the number of ways to write n as a sum of parts of size at most D (order matters? no, in the generating function for the sum, it is the number of compositions, not partitions). \n\n        But wait: our derivation for h(s) was from the equation: \n            H(x) = 1 + C(x)*H(x) \n            and C(x) = x+...+x^D -> then the recurrence is for compositions? \n\n        But in our problem, the multiset M is for partitions (unordered), but we are counting compositions? \n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        Let me reexamine: \n            We have: \n                G(x) = sum_{k>=k0} (C(x))^k \n            and (C(x))^k is the generating function for the number of ways to have a sequence of k parts (each in [1,D]) that sum to s? (compositions) \n\n            But in our problem, the parts are unordered? \n\n        How did we get here? \n\n        We started by: \n            We want to count the number of multisets M that are the sizes of the groups in a partition of the multiset of n elements (with the distinctness condition) and we reduced to: \n                The multiset M is a partition of n (the sum of the group sizes is n) that has at least max_f parts and each part at most D.\n\n            But note: the group sizes are unordered, so we are counting the number of integer partitions of n with at least max_f parts and each part at most D.\n\n        However, the generating function for integer partitions (unordered) with parts in [1,D] is:\n\n            P(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{D} \\frac{1}{1-x^i}\n\n            and then we want to count the partitions that have at least max_f parts? \n\n        How to count by the number of parts? \n\n            Let P(x,y) = \\prod_{i=1}^{D} \\frac{1}{1-y*x^i} \n            Then the generating function for partitions with exactly k parts is the coefficient of y^k in P(x,y).\n\n            Then we want: \n                [x^n] (sum_{k>=max_f} [y^k] P(x,y))\n\n            = [x^n] (P(x,1) - sum_{k=0}^{max_f-1} [y^k] P(x,y))\n\n        But this is complicated.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the recurrence for integer partitions with at most D parts and each part at most D? \n\n        But note: the number of parts is at least max_f and at most n, and each part is at most D.\n\n        And we know: the number of partitions of n with at most D parts and each part at most D is the same as the number of partitions of n with parts at most D? \n\n        But we also have a constraint on the number of parts: at least max_f.\n\n        And the number of partitions of n with parts at most D is the same as the number of partitions of n into at most D parts? \n\n        But we want at least max_f parts. \n\n        So: \n            Let Q(n, D) = number of partitions of n with parts at most D.\n            And let R(n, k, D) = number of partitions of n with exactly k parts, each at most D.\n\n            Then we want: \n                sum_{k = max_f}^{min(n, D)} R(n, k, D)   [because the number of parts cannot exceed D? no, the part size is at most D, but the number of parts can be up to n? but if we have n parts, then each part is 1, and 1<=D, so it's allowed. \n\n            But note: the number of parts can be at most n, and also, since each part is at least 1, the number of parts is at most n.\n\n            And the condition: each part at most D -> the number of parts is at least ceil(n/D). \n\n        How to compute R(n, k, D)? \n\n            We can use the recurrence: \n                R(n, k, D) = R(n-1, k-1, D) + R(n-k, k, D) - R(n-k, k, D) ??? \n\n            We can use the recurrence that considers the smallest part:\n\n                R(n, k, D) = \n                    if the smallest part is 1: then R(n-1, k-1, D)   [remove one part of 1]\n                    if the smallest part is at least 2: then we can subtract 1 from every part: then we get a partition of n-k into k parts, each at most D-1? \n                    -> R(n-k, k, D-1)\n\n            But then we have:\n\n                R(n, k, D) = R(n-1, k-1, D) + R(n-k, k, D-1)\n\n            But note: after subtracting 1, the parts are at least 1 and at most D-1, and there are still k parts.\n\n            Base: \n                if n<k or n>k*D: R(n,k,D)=0\n                if k==0: then 1 if n==0 else 0\n                if D==0: then 0\n\n            Then we can do a DP: \n                dp = a 2D array for k in [0, n] and n in [0, n] and D is fixed? \n                But we have three dimensions: n, k, and D? \n\n            The state: n from 0 to 2000, k from 0 to 2000, and D is fixed (distinct_count) -> 2000*2000 = 4e6 states, and each state O(1) -> 4e6, which is acceptable.\n\n            Recurrence:\n                dp[k][n] = \n                    if n<k or n>k*D: 0\n                    elif k==0: 1 if n==0 else 0\n                    else: \n                         dp[k-1][n-1] + (dp[k][n-k] if n-k>=0 else 0)   [but wait, we have to use D-1 in the second term?]\n\n            But note: in the second term, we are using D-1? \n\n            We are not storing D in the state? \n\n            We are fixing D = distinct_count. \n\n            But the recurrence for R(n,k,D) = R(n-1,k-1,D) + R(n-k,k,D-1)\n\n            So we need to iterate D from 0 to distinct_count? \n\n            Then we would do a 3D DP: \n                dp = a 3D array: [0..D_max][0..n][0..n] -> D_max = distinct_count (<=n<=2000) -> 2000*2000*2000 = 8e9 -> too slow.\n\n        Given the time constraints, and that n is only 2000, we can try to do a 2D DP for fixed D by the recurrence:\n\n            Let dp[k][n] = number of partitions of n into exactly k parts, each at most D.\n\n            Recurrence: \n                dp[k][n] = dp[k-1][n-1] + dp[k][n-k] - (some adjustment for the bound D) \n\n            The adjustment: in the term dp[k][n-k], we are partitions of n-k into k parts, each part at least 1, and then we add 1 to each part -> so the new parts are at least 2. \n            But we want the parts to be at most D. In the new partition, the parts are at most D if and only if in the old partition the parts were at most D-1.\n\n            So we need to know dp_with_bound. \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate the size of the largest part? \n\n        I found a recurrence online: \n            p(n, k, m) = p(n, k, m-1) + p(n-m, k-1, m)   [p(n,k,m) = partitions of n into exactly k parts, each at most m]\n\n            Then we can do:\n\n                dp[0][0] = 1\n                for m in range(1, D+1):   # maximum part allowed\n                    for k in range(1, n+1):\n                        for s in range(m, n+1):\n                            dp[k][s] = (dp[k][s] + dp[k-1][s-m]) % M\n\n            This is the unbounded knapsack style and it is O(n*k*D) = 8e9.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that we are in Python, we must use the recurrence that is O(n^2) or O(n^2 log n). \n\n        After research, the best is to use the generating function with exponentiation by squaring for the polynomial (C(x))^{k0} and then multiply by H(x) = 1/(1-C(x)), and use the recurrence for h (which is O(n*D)) and the exponentiation by squaring for the polynomial (which is O(n^2 * log(k0))).\n\n        Steps for the generating function approach (which we hope is correct for the integer partitions? but note: our generating function counts compositions, not partitions) -> so it is not the same.\n\n        We must count partitions, not compositions.\n\n        How to count partitions with exactly k parts, each at most D? \n            The generating function is: \n                P_k(x) = x^k * product_{i=1}^{D} (1-x^i)^{-1} ? \n            -> no, that is for at most k parts? \n\n        The generating function for partitions with exactly k parts, each at most D is the same as partitions with exactly k parts and largest part at most D, and it is: \n            not simply (x+...+x^D)^k / k!  -> because the parts are indistinct.\n\n        In fact, the generating function for partitions (unordered) with exactly k parts is: \n            x^k * product_{i=1}^{k} (1-x^{m_i})^{-1} ? \n\n        This is not a closed form.\n\n        I recall: the generating function for partitions with at most k parts and largest part at most D is the same as the generating function for partitions with Young diagrams inside a k x D grid, and it is a q-binomial coefficient.\n\n        And the number of such partitions is the same as the number of partitions of n into parts from the set {1,2,...,D} with at most k parts? \n\n        But we want exactly k parts.\n\n        And the generating function is: \n            not simply (x+...+x^D)^k.\n\n        Therefore, the generating function approach with C(x) = x+...+x^D is for compositions, not partitions.\n\n        We must use a different method.\n\n        Given the time, I will use the recurrence for partitions with exactly k parts and each part at most D using a 2D DP that is O(n*D) per k, and then sum for k>=max_f. \n\n        But then the total is O(n^2 * D) = 8e9.\n\n        However, note that k (number of parts) cannot exceed n, and also cannot exceed D*k? \n        and we only need to iterate k from max_f to n, and for each k, we iterate s from 0 to n, and for each s, we iterate the part size from 1 to D, but we can use a prefix sum.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp = [0]*(n+1)   # for fixed k, dp[s] = number of partitions of s into exactly k parts, each at most D.\n            # we will iterate k from 1 to n.\n\n            # for k=1:\n            dp1 = [0]*(n+1)\n            for s in range(1, D+1):\n                dp1[s] = 1\n\n            then for k=2 to n:\n                new_dp = [0]*(n+1)\n                for s in range(k, n+1):   # s from k to n\n                    # we can use a sliding window: \n                    # new_dp[s] = dp[s-1] + dp[s-2] + ... + dp[s-D]   but wait, this is for compositions.\n\n                This is not for partitions.\n\n        For partitions, we can use: \n            new_dp[s] = dp[s-1] (s-1>=0) + new_dp[s-1] ( if s-1>=0) ? \n\n        I give up and use the recurrence: \n            dp[k][s] = dp[k-1][s-1] + dp[k][s-k] \n            but then subtract the ones that exceed D in the second term? \n\n        Specifically: \n            dp[k][s] = dp[k-1][s-1] + dp[k][s-k] - ( if (s-k) >= (D+1)*k ? ) -> no.\n\n        The recurrence without bound: \n            dp0[k][s] = dp0[k-1][s-1] + dp0[k][s-k]   [partitions with exactly k parts, any part size allowed]\n\n        With bound: \n            dp[k][s] = dp[k-1][s-1] + dp[k][s-k] - ( if s-k > (D)*(k) then 0 else ( if we added 1 to a part that was D, it becomes D+1, which is invalid) \n\n        How to subtract? \n            In the term dp0[k][s-k]: it includes partitions of s-k into k parts, any part size. When we add 1 to each part, we get a partition of s into k parts with each part at least 2. \n            But we want each part at most D. The only ones that become invalid are the ones that had a part of size D in the partition of s-k? \n            -> then after adding 1, it becomes D+1.\n\n            So we must subtract the partitions of s-k into k parts that have at least one part of size D.\n\n            = the number of partitions of s-k into k parts that have at least one part of size D.\n\n            = dp0[k][s-k] - dp0[k][s-k, with parts at most D-1] \n\n        But we don't have dp0 with at most D-1.\n\n        Therefore, we must maintain a separate 2D DP for the bounded case. \n\n        We can do a 2D DP for fixed D: \n            dp[k][s] = 0 for s<k or s>k*D\n            for k=0: dp[0][0]=1, and for k>=1 and s<k, 0.\n            for k>=1 and s>=k and s<=k*D:\n                dp[k][s] = dp[k-1][s-1] + dp[k][s-k] - dp[k-1][s-1 - D]   ? \n\n        I found a recurrence in a book: \n            Let p(n, k, m) = p(n-1, k-1, m) + p(n-k, k, m) - [ if n-1>=D+1 then p(n-1-D, k-1, m) else 0 ] \n        -> not.\n\n        After thinking, the simplest is to iterate over the value of the largest part or use the 3D recurrence: \n            dp[k][n][m] = dp[k][n][m-1] + dp[k-1][n-m][m] \n\n        and then we only need to go m from 1 to D, and we can iterate m from 1 to D, and for each m, update a 2D table for k and n. \n\n        The state: m from 1 to D (2000), and for each m, we iterate k from 1 to n (2000) and n from 0 to n (2000) -> 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9.\n\n        But note: when m increases, we can do:\n\n            new_dp = dp  # for m-1\n            for k in range(1, n+1):\n                for s in range(m, n+1):\n                    new_dp[k][s] = (new_dp[k][s] + new_dp[k-1][s-m]) % M\n\n        This is 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e9.\n\n        We must optimize.\n\n        Notice: in the loop for m, we are doing a knapsack. We can do it in O(n^2) per m? \n            for k in range(1, n+1):\n                for s in range(m, n+1):\n                    new_dp[k][s] = (new_dp[k][s] + new_dp[k-1][s-m]) % M\n\n        This is O(n^2) per m, and m from 1 to D -> 2000 * (2000^2) = 8e9.\n\n        We can swap the loops: \n            for m in range(1, D+1):\n                for s in range(m, n+1):\n                    for k in range(1, n+1):\n                        dp[k][s] = (dp[k][s] + dp[k-1][s-m]) % M\n\n        This is still O(n^2 * D) = 8e9.\n\n        We can use a 1D array and iterate s in reverse for each m to do a knapsack for fixed m, and then for k from 1 to n, but then we lose the k dimension. \n\n        We want to count by the number of parts. \n\n        We can do for each m: \n            for k in range(1, n+1):\n                for s from n downto m:\n                    dp[k][s] = (dp[k][s] + dp[k-1][s-m]) % M\n\n        This is O(n * n * D) = 8e9.\n\n        Given the constraints (n, D up to 2000) in C++ we might pass with optimizations, but in Python it is 8e9 iterations -> too slow.\n\n        Therefore, we must use a different method.\n\n        I found a better recurrence: \n            dp[k][n] = dp[k][n-k] + dp[k-1][n-1] - dp[k-1][n-D-1] \n        is not correct.\n\n        After reading, a standard solution for this problem in C++ is: \n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            typedef long long ll;\n            const int N = 2000;\n            const int MOD = 998244353;\n            int dp[N+1][N+1];\n            int main() {\n                int n;\n                cin >> n;\n                vector<int> a(n);\n                map<int,int> cnt;\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    cin >> a[i];\n                    cnt[a[i]]++;\n                }\n                int D = cnt.size();\n                int max_f = 0;\n                for (auto &p : cnt) max_f = max(max_f, p.second);\n\n                // dp[i][j] = number of partitions of j into i parts ( parts>=1 and <=D ) \n                dp[0][0] = 1;\n                for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                    for (int j=i; j<=n; j++) {\n                        // dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i] \n                        // but then subtract if j-i >= i*?

\n\n        Let me test n=2, D= distinct_count = 2, max_f=1 (since two distinct elements, each frequency=1) \n            Partitions of 2 with i=1: \n                j=1: i=1, j=1: dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[1][0] (j-i=0) -> dp[1][0] is 0? \n                dp[1][1] = 1.\n                j=2: \n                    dp[1][2] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][0] = 0+0 = 0.\n                then if j>=D+1=3, no.\n                i=2: \n                    j=2: \n                        dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = 1+0 = 1.\n                Then ans = for i from 1 to 2: i=1: dp[1][2]=0, i=2: dp[2][2]=1 -> ans=1.\n\n            But we expected 2 for n=2 with distinct array [1,2]: \n                multisets: {1,1} and {2} -> two.\n\n            What are the partitions of 2 with at least 1 part and each part at most 2: \n                [2] -> 1 part\n                [1,1] -> 2 parts\n                so two.\n\n            In the dp: \n                dp[1][2] should be 1 ( for [2] ) \n                dp[2][2] should be 1 ( for [1,1] )\n                so sum=2.\n\n            What's wrong in the recurrence for j=2, i=1: \n                dp[1][2] = dp[0][1] (which is 0) + dp[1][2-1] = dp[1][1] = 1 -> then dp[1][2]=1.\n            then for i=2, j=2: \n                dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = 1+0 = 1.\n            then ans=1+1=2.\n\n            So the recurrence is:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i] \n                and then if j>=D+1, subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1] \n\n            Why subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1]? \n\n            In the example: for i=1, j=2: \n                not j>=3, so no subtract.\n\n            for i=2, j=2: \n                not j>=3, so no subtract.\n\n            So it gives 2.\n\n            Test n=1, D=1, max_f=1:\n                i=1, j=1: \n                    dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[1][0] = 1+0 = 1.\n                ans=1.\n\n            Test n=3, D=1, array [1,1,1]: \n                distinct_count=1, max_f=3.\n                Partitions of 3 with at least 3 parts and each part at most 1: \n                    only [1,1,1] -> 1.\n                dp[3][3] = \n                    i=3, j=3: \n                        = dp[2][2] + dp[3][0] \n                    dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = (dp[0][0]+dp[1][0]) + 0 = 1.\n                    then dp[3][3] = 1 + 0 = 1.\n                then ans=1.\n\n            Test n=3, D=2, array [1,1,2]: distinct_count=2, max_f=2.\n                Partitions: \n                    [3] -> 1 part, but 1 part <2 -> not valid.\n                    [2,1] -> 2 parts: valid.\n                    [1,1,1] -> 3 parts: valid.\n                so two.\n\n                dp[2][3] = dp[1][2] + dp[2][1] \n                    dp[1][2] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][1] = 0+1 = 1.\n                    dp[2][1] = 0 because j=1 < i=2.\n                    so dp[2][3]=1.\n                dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + dp[3][0] = (dp[1][1]+dp[2][0]) + 0 = 1.\n                ans = dp[2][3] + dp[3][3] = 2.\n\n            So the recurrence seems to be: \n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i] \n                and then if j-i >= something, we subtract? \n\n            In the code above, they subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1] when j>=D+1. \n\n            Why? \n\n            Explanation: \n                The recurrence: \n                  Option1: add a part of size 1. This part is the smallest part. Then the remaining is a partition of j-1 into i-1 parts.\n                  Option2: increase every part by 1. This is valid if the resulting parts are at most D. \n                         But if in the partition of j-i, there is a part of size D, then after increasing, it becomes D+1, which is invalid. \n                         How many such partitions? \n                             They are the partitions of j-i that have at least one part of size D. \n                             To remove these, we consider: if we have a partition of j-i into i parts that has a part of size D, then we can remove one part of size D (and then we have a partition of j-i-D into i-1 parts), and then increase the rest by 1, and then add the part of size D+1? \n                         But note: in option2, we are increasing EVERY part by 1. So if there is a part of size D in the partition of j-i, then after increasing, it becomes D+1, which is invalid. \n                         The number of such partitions is the number of partitions of j-i into i parts that have at least one part of size D. \n                         = the number of partitions of j-i-D into i-1 parts ( because we remove one part of size D, and the rest is a partition of j-i-D into i-1 parts) \n\n                Therefore, we subtract dp[i-1][j-i-D] = dp[i-1][j-D-i] = dp[i-1][j-D-i] \n\n                But in the recurrence, they subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1]? \n\n            Let me see: \n                In the recurrence, they do:\n                  if (j>=D+1) {\n                      dp[i][j] -= dp[i-1][j-D-1];\n                  }\n\n            Why j-D-1? \n\n            In option1, we did: \n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-i]\n\n            then they subtract dp[i-1][j-D-1] \n\n            Note: j-D-1 = (j-1) - D.\n\n            So they are subtracting dp[i-1][ (j-1) - D ].\n\n            This is the number of partitions of j-1 into i-1 parts that have a part of size D+1? \n\n            But in option1, we are not doing the increase, we are only adding a part of size 1. \n\n            I think the recurrence is for a different formulation.\n\n        After checking, a known recurrence for the number of partitions of n into exactly k parts with no part exceeding D is: \n            p(n, k, D) = p(n-1, k-1, D) + p(n-k, k, D) - p(n-k, k, D-1) \n        but we don't have p(n-k, k, D-1)"
