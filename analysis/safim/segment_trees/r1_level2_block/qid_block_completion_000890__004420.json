Then print(r)\n\n          How does this simulation work? Example: n=6, m=2 initially. Iteration1:\n                m=2, n=6 -> m<n -> enter loop. r += 1 (clone) -> r=1.\n                swaps = min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2. m = 2+2 = 4.\n                r += 2 -> r=3.\n            Iteration2:\n                m=4, n=6 -> m<n -> enter loop. r += 1 -> r=4. swaps = min(4, 6-4)=min(4,2)=2. m = 4+2=6.\n                r += 2 -> r=6. Then break -> output 6 -> matches. Example: n=3, m=2:\n            Iteration1:\n                m=2, n=3 -> enter. r=1 (clone)\n                swaps = min(2, 1)=1.\n                m=3.\n                r=1+1=2 -> break -> output 2 -> matches. Example: n=5, m=2:\n            Iteration1:\n                clone: r=1, swaps=min(2,3)=2 -> m=4, r=3.\n            Iteration2:\n                clone: r=4, swaps=min(4,1)=1 -> m=5, r=5. So 5 operations. But with the formula: \n            k_min = (5-1)//2 = 4//2=2, then operations = 2 + (5-2)=5 -> matches. Therefore, we can do either:\n\n            Option1: use the formula: \n                if m==n: 0\n                else: (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n            Option2: simulate with a while loop. However, note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5. But the while loop might run at most O(log n) per test case? because m doubles? But worst-case: m starts at 1, then becomes 2, then 4, then 8, ... until it reaches n. So about O(log n) per test case. The total n over test cases is 10^5, but the sum of the number of iterations over test cases might be 10^5 * log(10^5) which is about 10^5 * 17 = 1.7e6 -> acceptable. But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current code uses three dictionaries: dic1, dic2, dic3.\n The idea is to count pairs that differ in exactly one position. We can break down the pairs into two types:\n   Type 1: The first character is the same, the second character is different.\n   Type 2: The second character is the same, the first character is different.\n\n However, note that the current code does:\n   For each string S (of two characters):\n      If the first character (S[0]) is in dic1, then it adds the current count of dic1[S[0]] to result and then increments dic1[S[0]].\n      Similarly for the second character (S[1]) in dic2.\n\n But then it subtracts twice the count of the entire string in dic3.\n\n Why subtract twice? Because a pair that has both characters different would be counted in both dic1 and dic2? Actually, note that the problem asks for exactly one position different.\n\n However, consider:\n   If two strings are identical, they are not counted (because they don't differ in any position) but they might be overcounted? Actually, identical strings are not counted in the desired pairs.\n\n But note: the current approach counts:\n   - For the first character: every time we see the same first character again, we add the count of previous strings with the same first character. This counts pairs that have the same first character (so the second character must be different? Actually, no: because the entire string might be the same? But then we subtract).\n\n Actually, the method is:\n   Let A = count of pairs that have the same first character (so they differ only in the second character? but note: if they are the same string, they don't differ at all) -> but we are going to subtract the pairs that are the same string? \n\n   Similarly, B = count of pairs that have the same second character.\n\n   Then we have counted pairs that have the same first character OR the same second character? But note: a pair that has both the same first and same second (i.e., identical) is counted in both A and B? Actually, no: because if two strings are identical, then they have the same first and same second. So they would be counted in A (because first same) and in B (because second same). But we don't want to count identical pairs at all? Actually, we want exactly one position different. So identical pairs (0 differences) are not desired.\n\n   Moreover, a pair that has both positions different is not counted in either A or B? So we don't count that? That's good because we only want one difference.\n\n   However, the problem: we have counted in A: pairs that have the same first character (so they might be identical or differ only in the second). Similarly for B.\n\n   But note: the pair that is identical is counted in both A and B. And we are going to subtract twice the count of identical pairs? Actually, the code subtracts twice the count of the entire string? \n\n   How? We have a dictionary dic3 that counts the entire string. When we see a string S that we have seen k times before, then we subtract 2*k? Why twice?\n\n   Actually, the identical string would have been counted in dic1 and dic2? But wait: when we process a string, we add to result from dic1 and dic2. Then we update dic3. Then when we see the same string again, we subtract 2 * (current count of that string in dic3) because the current count is the number of times we have seen that string so far (without including the current one). \n\n   Why twice? Because the identical string would have been counted in both dic1 and dic2? For each identical string, we have overcounted by 2? Actually, consider two identical strings: \n        S1 = \"aa\", S2 = \"aa\"\n   When we process S1: \n        dic1: 'a' -> not present -> then set to 1.\n        dic2: 'a' -> not present -> then set to 1.\n        dic3: \"aa\" -> not present -> set to 1.\n   When we process S2:\n        dic1: 'a' is present -> result += 1 (so now result=1) and then dic1['a'] becomes 2.\n        dic2: 'a' is present -> result += 1 (so now result=2) and then dic2['a'] becomes 2.\n        Then we see that \"aa\" is in dic3: current count is 1 -> so we subtract 2*1 = 2 -> result becomes 0.\n\n   So the identical pair is not counted. But what about a pair that is not identical? \n\n   Consider two strings that are not identical but have the same first character and different second? \n        S1 = \"ab\", S2 = \"ac\"\n   For S1: \n        dic1: 'a' -> set to 1.\n        dic2: 'b' -> set to 1.\n        dic3: \"ab\" -> set to 1.\n   For S2:\n        dic1: 'a' -> present -> result += 1 (from dic1: which is 1) -> result=1.\n        dic2: 'c' -> not present -> set to 1? \n        Then dic3: \"ac\" -> not present -> set to 1.\n\n   So we get 1 for the pair (S1, S2). That's correct.\n\n   Now consider two strings that are not identical and have the same second character and different first? \n        S1 = \"ab\", S2 = \"cb\"\n   Similarly, we get 1 from dic2.\n\n   Now consider a pair that has both different? \n        S1 = \"ab\", S2 = \"cd\"\n   Then for S2: \n        dic1: 'c' -> not present -> set to 1.\n        dic2: 'd' -> not present -> set to 1.\n        dic3: \"cd\" -> set to 1.\n        result remains 0.\n\n   So that's not counted.\n\n   However, what if we have a string that is the same as a previous one in the entire string? We subtract twice. But what if we have a string that is not the same as the current one, but we have seen the entire string? Actually, the subtraction is only for the same entire string? \n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        if S[0] in dic1:\n            result += dic1[S[0]]\n            dic1[S[0]] += 1\n        else:\n            dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\n        if S[1] in dic2:\n            result += dic2[S[1]]\n            dic2[S[1]] += 1\n        else:\n            # We are missing code for the else part for dic2.\n\n        if S in dic3:\n            result -= dic3[S] * 2\n            dic3[S] += 1\n        else:\n            dic3[S] = 1\n\n   The missing part is for the else branch of dic2. We should set dic2[S[1]] to 1.\n\n   So the missing code for program1.py is just one line: \n        dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: We are given an array a of n integers. We can do two operations:\n   1. Clone any existing array (so we get a new copy of that array).\n   2. Swap any two elements from any two arrays (or same array) at any positions.\n\n We want the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n Note: Initially we have one array.\n\n Example: \n   If the array is already all equal -> 0 operations.\n\n How to think?\n   We can do swaps to bring all occurrences of a particular value into one array. But note: we can also clone the array to have more copies to work with.\n\n   The operations:\n     Operation 1: clone (costs 1 operation) -> we get one more array.\n     Operation 2: swap (costs 1 operation) -> we can swap two elements.\n\n   We are free to do any sequence of operations.\n\n   We note that we can use multiple arrays to gather the same value. For example, we might want to gather all the x's (for some value x) into one array.\n\n   However, note: when we swap, we are moving elements between arrays. We can also create clones to have more arrays to use as temporary storage.\n\n   Insight: \n     Let the frequency of the most frequent element be m. Then we have m copies of that element. We want to have an array of n copies of that element? But note: we don't necessarily have to use the most frequent element? Actually, we can choose any element? \n\n     However, the minimal operations might be achieved by choosing the element with the highest frequency? Because we already have many of that element.\n\n     How many operations do we need?\n\n     We start with one array. We can do:\n\n        Operation 1: clone the array. Now we have two arrays.\n\n        Then we can swap elements between the two arrays to bring more of the same element into one array.\n\n        But note: each swap operation can fix one element? For example, if we have two arrays, we can swap an element that is not x from the first array with an element that is x from the second array. Then the first array gains one x and loses one non-x.\n\n        How many x's do we need to gather? We need n x's in one array. We already have m x's. So we need n - m more x's.\n\n        But note: we can also get x's from other arrays? However, we are allowed to do as many swaps as we want. But each swap costs one operation.\n\n        However, we can also create more clones to get more x's? Actually, we cannot create new x's. We can only rearrange the existing ones.\n\n        Therefore, we need to gather n - m x's from other arrays. But note: each swap can bring one x from another array? But we have to consider that we might need to free up space in the target array? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          We start with one array. We want to create a clone to have two arrays. Then we can swap: \n            In the target array (where we want all x's), we have some non-x's. We can swap a non-x from the target array with an x from another array. This swap moves one x into the target and moves the non-x out.\n\n          How many swaps? We need to bring n - m x's from other arrays. So we need n - m swaps? \n\n          But also we had to clone the array once? So total operations = 1 (clone) + (n - m) (swaps) = n - m + 1.\n\n        However, what if we need more than one clone? \n\n        Consider: we have m x's. We need n - m more. But we can only get one x per swap? And we can use multiple clones? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone -> now we have two arrays.\n          Then we can do k swaps? But note: we can also clone again? \n\n        But observe: we can use one clone as a temporary storage? Actually, we can do:\n\n          We can have multiple clones. However, the problem is that we have a fixed total number of x's. We have m x's. We need to put n of them in one array? But we only have m x's in total? \n\n        Wait: that doesn't make sense. We cannot put n x's in one array if we only have m x's? \n\n        Correction: we want an array of all x's. But we don't have to use the same x? Actually, we can use any value? \n\n        However, the problem: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. But we cannot change the multiset of each array? We can only rearrange. So the total number of x's in the entire system is fixed (m). Therefore, we cannot have an array of n x's if m < n? \n\n        But note: the example test case 2: \n            [0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 0] -> the most frequent element is 0? which appears twice. But the example did 6 operations and got an array of zeros? How? \n\n        Actually, the example did:\n          Step 1: clone -> 1 operation (now two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0])\n          Then they swapped two elements: \n                [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> how many swaps? They did 2 swaps? (because they swapped two pairs: the 1 and the 0, and then the 3 and the 0) -> but actually they did two swaps? \n          Then they cloned the first array -> 1 operation (now three copies: [0,0,0,3,7,0], [0,0,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3])\n          Then they swapped two more elements: \n                [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [3,7,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> that took two swaps.\n\n          Total operations: 1 (first clone) + 2 (first two swaps) + 1 (second clone) + 2 (next two swaps) = 6.\n\n        How did they get 6 zeros? They started with two zeros in the first array and two zeros in the second array? Then they moved two zeros from the second array to the first? Then they had four zeros in the first array? Then they cloned that first array (so now two arrays with four zeros) and then they swapped two non-zeros from the first array with two zeros from the second array? \n\n        Actually, the total zeros: initially 4 (because two arrays, each has two zeros). Then after the first two swaps: the first array has 4 zeros? and the second array has 0 zeros? Then they clone the first array (so now two arrays with 4 zeros). Then they swap two non-zeros (3 and 7) in the first array with two zeros from the second array? Then the first array becomes 6 zeros? \n\n        But wait: the total zeros is 4. How can we have 6 zeros? \n\n        This indicates that we are not limited by the total frequency? \n\n        Actually, note: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So the total number of zeros becomes doubled? \n\n        Therefore, we can create as many zeros as we want by cloning? \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"clone\" means we get a copy of the current state of an array. So if we have an array with two zeros, and we clone it, we get two arrays each with two zeros. Then we have a total of four zeros? \n\n        So the total number of zeros is not fixed? \n\n        Therefore, we can use cloning to multiply the number of zeros? \n\n        However, we cannot change the values? We can only swap. So if we have an array that has two zeros, and we clone it, we get two arrays each with two zeros. Then we can swap zeros from one array to another? \n\n        But note: if we swap a zero from array1 to array2, then array1 loses one zero and array2 gains one zero? The total zeros remains four. \n\n        How do we get an array of six zeros? \n\n        The example: \n          Initially: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> two zeros.\n          After cloning: two arrays, each [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> total zeros: 4.\n          Then they swapped: \n            Array1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] -> four zeros? \n            Array2: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> no zeros? \n          Then they cloned Array1: so now three arrays: \n            Array1: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> four zeros\n            Array2: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> no zeros\n            Array3: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> four zeros -> total zeros: 8.\n          Then they swapped two zeros from Array3 into Array1? \n            Array1: [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> six zeros? \n            Array3: [3,7,0,3,7,0] -> two zeros? \n\n          So total zeros: 6 (in Array1) + 0 (Array2) + 2 (Array3) = 8 -> which matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can use cloning to increase the total number of a particular element? \n\n        But note: we are not creating new elements, we are duplicating the entire array. So if we have an array that has k zeros, then when we clone it we get two arrays each with k zeros -> total zeros becomes 2k. \n\n        However, we can then swap zeros from one array to another? Then we can concentrate zeros in one array.\n\n        How many operations? \n\n        We want to have one array with n zeros. \n\n        Let m = the frequency of the most frequent element in the initial array.\n\n        We start with one array. We have m zeros (if we choose the element with frequency m) in the initial array.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone -> now two arrays, each with m zeros -> total zeros = 2m.\n          Then we can swap: we can take zeros from the second array and put them into the first array? But note: the first array has m zeros. We want to add n - m zeros? But we have m zeros in the second array? \n\n          However, we cannot take more than m zeros from the second array? because we don't want to break the zeros that are already in the first array? \n\n          Actually, we can take up to m zeros from the second array? Then the first array would have m + m = 2m zeros? \n\n          But we need n zeros? \n\n          If 2m < n, then we need more zeros? \n\n          Then we can clone again: \n            Operation 2: clone the first array? -> now we have three arrays: \n                Array1: m zeros (we haven't swapped yet) \n                Array2: m zeros\n                Array3: m zeros -> total zeros = 3m.\n\n          Then we can swap: we can take zeros from Array3 and put into Array1? Then Array1 becomes m + m = 2m? \n\n          But wait, we can also take from Array2? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            After the first clone (two arrays), we can swap zeros from Array2 to Array1? Then Array1 becomes 2m, and Array2 becomes 0? Then we clone Array1 (operation 2) -> now three arrays: Array1: 2m, Array2:0, Array3:2m -> total zeros=4m.\n\n          Then we can swap zeros from Array3 to Array1? Then Array1 becomes 3m? \n\n          But we need n. \n\n        We see that we can double the zeros by cloning and then swapping? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let k = number of clones (so total arrays = k+1). Then the total zeros = m * (k+1) (if we clone the initial array k times without swapping).\n\n          Then we can swap: we can take zeros from the other k arrays and put them into one array? \n\n          How many zeros can we put into one array? \n            We can take at most m from each of the other k arrays? So the maximum we can have in one array is m (initially) + k * m = m*(k+1).\n\n          But we need n? So we require m*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          How many operations? \n            We did k clone operations (each clone is one operation) and then we did (n - m) swaps? Because we start with m in the target array and we need n, so we need n-m swaps? \n\n          But wait: we can only take from the other arrays as long as they have zeros? Each other array initially has m zeros. We can take at most m from each? But we have k arrays, so we can take at most k * m zeros? \n\n          Therefore, we require: m + k * m >= n  => k >= ceil((n - m) / m) = ceil(n/m - 1).\n\n          Then the total operations = k (for clones) + (n - m) (for swaps) = k + n - m.\n\n          We want to minimize k + n - m, subject to k >= ceil((n-m)/m) and k>=0.\n\n          Since k must be at least ceil((n-m)/m) (which is (n-1)//m, because ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m) - 1? but note: if n-m is divisible by m, then ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m)/m, else (n-m)//m + 1).\n\n          Actually, we can write: k_min = ceil((n - m) / m) = (n - m + m - 1) // m = (n-1) // m? \n\n          But note: \n            ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n            But ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1? \n\n          Actually: \n            ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1.\n\n          Then ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1 = (n-1)//m.\n\n          So k_min = (n-1)//m? \n\n          Then total operations = (n-1)//m + n - m.\n\n        But let's test with the example: \n          Example 2: n=6, m=2 (for the element 0? but note: 0 appears twice, and 3 appears twice? actually the most frequent is 2? so m=2).\n          Then k_min = (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2.\n          Then operations = 2 + 6 - 2 = 6 -> matches.\n\n        What about the first example: \n          \"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal\" -> so m = n? \n          Then k_min = (n-1)//m = (n-1)//n = 0? \n          Then operations = 0 + n - n = 0 -> matches.\n\n        What about the third example? \n          The example says: \"the third test case, there are no pairs\" -> but that's for program1. For program2, we don't have an example? \n\n        However, consider a small example: \n          n=3, array = [1,2,2] -> m=2 (for 2).\n          Then k_min = (3-1)//2 = 2//2 = 1.\n          Then operations = 1 + 3 - 2 = 2.\n\n          How?\n            Start: [1,2,2] (m=2)\n            Operation1: clone -> now two arrays: [1,2,2] and [1,2,2] -> total 2's = 4.\n            Then we need to get one more 2 in the first array? \n            We swap: take a 2 from the second array and swap with the 1 in the first array? \n            Then first array becomes [2,2,2] -> done.\n            Operations: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2 -> matches.\n\n        But wait: we did one swap? and we had n-m = 1 swap? so total operations = 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2.\n\n        Therefore, the formula: \n          Let m = max frequency of any element in the initial array.\n          If m == n: then 0.\n          Else:\n            k_min = (n - m - 1) // m + 1?  -> wait, we had k_min = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m + m - 1) // m = (n-1)//m? \n            But note: \n                ceil(a) = (a + m - 1) // m? not exactly.\n\n          Actually, we can compute k_min = (n - m - 1) // m + 1? \n            Because: ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m + m - 1) // m = (n-1)//m? \n            But (n-1)//m is integer division. \n\n          Example: n=6, m=2 -> (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> correct.\n          n=3, m=2 -> (3-1)//2 = 2//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n          However, if n=5, m=2: \n            k_min = ceil((5-2)/2) = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2.\n            (5-1)//2 = 4//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal operations = k_min + (n - m) = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n        But note: we must use integer arithmetic? \n\n        However, what if (n-1) is not divisible by m? \n          Example: n=4, m=3 -> \n            k_min = ceil((4-3)/3) = ceil(1/3)=1.\n            (4-1)//3 = 3//3 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code for a test case:\n\n          Read n.\n          Read the array a of n integers.\n          Count the frequency of each element -> m = max frequency.\n\n          If m == n: \n              print(0)\n          Else:\n              k = (n-1) // m   # This is the minimal k (number of clones) such that m*(k+1) >= n? \n              But wait: we have k_min = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m + m - 1) // m = (n-1)//m? \n              However, note: \n                  We require: m*(k+1) >= n  -> k+1 >= ceil(n/m) -> k >= ceil(n/m)-1.\n                  And ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1? \n                  Then k_min = ceil(n/m)-1 = (n-1)//m? \n\n              So k_min = (n-1)//m? \n\n              Then total operations = k_min + (n - m) = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But wait: in the example n=6, m=2: (6-1)//2 = 2, then 2 + (6-2)=2+4=6 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: we might not need to do all the swaps? \n\n        Actually, we need to bring n-m copies of the element from the other arrays. Each swap brings one. So we need n-m swaps. And we need k_min clones? \n\n        Therefore, the answer for a test case is: \n            if m == n: 0\n            else: (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n        But wait: what if the most frequent element is not the one we choose? \n\n        Actually, we are free to choose any element? But we want to minimize the operations. So we choose the element with the highest frequency m. \n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n          for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # we are skipping the first two lines? Actually, the input: \n            # first line: t\n            # then for each test case: \n            #   first line: n\n            #   second line: the array\n\n          We are taking every second line starting from index 2 (0-indexed). So the first test case's array is at index 2, then next at index 4, etc.\n\n          Then we do:\n            n = len(a)   # but note: a is a string of the line split by spaces? \n            Actually, the line: \n                a = a.split()   # and then we set n = len(a) -> that's the n.\n\n          Then we compute m = max frequency of the array.\n\n          Then we have:\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # we are going to do something? \n\n          But we have a formula: \n            if m == n: 0\n            else: (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          However, the current code sets r=0 and then has a while loop: while m < n: ... \n\n          How to simulate? \n\n          Actually, we can break out of the loop? But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the while loop might run many times? \n\n          Alternatively, we can compute without a loop? \n\n          The intended solution might be:\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # We are going to do one clone operation? \n                # Then we can swap? \n                # How many swaps we can do? We can take at most m from the new clone? \n                # But note: we are going to do one clone: so we have two arrays? \n                # Then we can swap up to m times? but we don't need that many? \n\n                # Actually, we can do:\n                #   Let d = min(m, n - m)   # we can only take min(m, n-m) from the clone? \n                #   But wait: we can take up to m from the clone? and we need n-m? \n                #   So we take t = min(m, n-m) swaps? \n                #   Then we update: \n                #       m = m + t   # because we added t copies of the element to the target array.\n                #       r += 1 (for the clone) + t (for the swaps) \n                #   Then if m < n, we do again? \n\n                # But note: after the clone, we have two arrays. We can also use the original array? \n                # Actually, we can do multiple clones? \n\n                # Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n                #   Step: \n                #       r += 1   # for the clone\n                #       Then we can swap up to m times? but we only need n-m? \n                #       So we do: \n                #           swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                #           m += swaps\n                #           r += swaps\n\n                #   Then if m < n, we continue.\n\n            Then print(r)\n\n          How does this simulation work?\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2 initially.\n            Iteration1:\n                m=2, n=6 -> m<n -> enter loop.\n                r += 1 (clone) -> r=1.\n                swaps = min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2.\n                m = 2+2 = 4.\n                r += 2 -> r=3.\n            Iteration2:\n                m=4, n=6 -> m<n -> enter loop.\n                r += 1 -> r=4.\n                swaps = min(4, 6-4)=min(4,2)=2.\n                m = 4+2=6.\n                r += 2 -> r=6.\n            Then break -> output 6 -> matches.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=2:\n            Iteration1:\n                m=2, n=3 -> enter.\n                r=1 (clone)\n                swaps = min(2, 1)=1.\n                m=3.\n                r=1+1=2 -> break -> output 2 -> matches.\n\n          Example: n=5, m=2:\n            Iteration1:\n                clone: r=1, swaps=min(2,3)=2 -> m=4, r=3.\n            Iteration2:\n                clone: r=4, swaps=min(4,1)=1 -> m=5, r=5.\n            So 5 operations.\n\n          But with the formula: \n            k_min = (5-1)//2 = 4//2=2, then operations = 2 + (5-2)=5 -> matches.\n\n          Therefore, we can do either:\n\n            Option1: use the formula: \n                if m==n: 0\n                else: (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n            Option2: simulate with a while loop.\n\n          However, note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5. But the while loop might run at most O(log n) per test case? because m doubles? \n\n          But worst-case: m starts at 1, then becomes 2, then 4, then 8, ... until it reaches n. So about O(log n) per test case. The total n over test cases is 10^5, but the sum of the number of iterations over test cases might be 10^5 * log(10^5) which is about 10^5 * 17 = 1.7e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5? Actually, the constraint is: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". \n\n          However, note: the simulation per test case: the number of iterations is O(log n) and the total n is 10^5, but the total number of test cases t <= 10000? but the sum of n is 10^5, so the maximum n in a test case might be 10^5? \n\n          The while loop for one test case: \n            m starts at m0 (the max frequency) and then we do: \n                m = m + min(m, n-m)\n            How many iterations? \n                Worst-case: m0=1, then becomes 2, 4, 8, ... until m>=n. \n                So about log2(n) iterations.\n\n          Since n<=10^5, log2(10^5) is about 17, so worst-case 17 iterations per test case.\n\n          The total number of test cases: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 10000? However, the constraint on the sum of n is 10^5, so the maximum number of test cases is 10? because 10 test cases each with n=10000 would be 100000? \n\n          Actually, the constraint: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so the maximum number of test cases t is 10^5? but each test case has at least n=1, so the maximum t is 10^5? \n\n          However, the input says: \n            The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, and then a list of n integers.\n\n          And the total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n          Therefore, the total number of test cases t can be up to 10^5? but then each test case has n=1? \n\n          Then the while loop would run at most 17 iterations per test case? so total iterations 10^5 * 17 = 1.7e6 -> acceptable in Python? \n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, meaning the total length of the arrays is 10^5. The number of test cases t is the number of arrays? \n\n          Actually, the input: \n            t = number of test cases.\n            Then for each test case: \n                n\n                a1, a2, ..., an\n\n          And the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n          Therefore, the while loop over test cases: the total iterations (across all test cases) of the inner while loop would be at most 17 * (number of test cases) = 17 * (at most 10^5) = 1.7e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = len(a)   # but note: a is the string of the second line of the test case, split by spaces? \n                # Actually, we have: \n                #   a = a.split()   -> list of strings of the numbers? \n                #   Then we want to compute the frequency? \n                #   Then m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n                # But note: the array elements are integers? but the input is string. We don't need to convert to int? because we are only counting frequency? \n\n                # Then:\n                c = Counter(a)\n                m = max(c.values()) if a else 0   # if a is not empty\n                r = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    # We do one clone operation\n                    r += 1   # for the clone\n                    # How many swaps we can do? we can take at most m from the clone? \n                    swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += swaps\n                    m += swaps\n                print(r)\n\n          However, note: the example test case 1: \n                n=1, array = [5] -> m=1, n=1 -> skip the loop -> output 0 -> correct.\n\n          But what if the array has negative numbers? The frequency counting by string is okay? \n\n          Example: array = ['-1', '2', '3'] -> but the input: the integers are given as integers? \n\n          Actually, the input: \n                \"The second line of each test case contains n integers\"\n\n          So the numbers are separated by spaces. We split the string and we get the tokens. \n\n          But note: the tokens for negative numbers: they are strings that start with '-'. \n\n          The frequency: \n                Counter(['-1','2','-1']) -> counts: '-1' appears twice, '2' once -> m=2.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can complete program2.py with the while loop.\n\n        But note: the code already has:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to fill the while loop.\n\n        We do:\n\n            r += 1   # for the clone operation\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But note: we are updating m and then the loop condition will check the updated m.\n\n        However, the code in the while loop block must be indented? \n\n        We write:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the block inside the while loop.\n\n        However, the existing code has:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must replace the TODO with the three lines? \n\n        But note: the existing code has a comment at the end of the while line. We can remove the comment? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        We are to output the missing code for program1 and program2 in a JSON.\n\n        For program1, we found the missing line: \n            dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n        For program2, we found the missing block for the while loop:\n\n            r += 1\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But note: the existing code for program2 has:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO with the above block? \n\n        However, the TODO is on the same line as the while. We can write:\n\n            while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing line is: \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n        For program2, the missing block is:\n\n            r += 1\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But note: the indentation? \n\n        Since the while loop is already started, we need to indent the block by one level? \n\n        We output the block as a string with the necessary indentation? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we assume 4 spaces per level? \n\n        But the existing code in program2 uses 1 space? Actually, the code we see:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n             print(r)\n\n        The existing code uses one space for indentation? \n\n        Actually, the code we are given for program2 is:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n             print(r)\n\n        So the while loop body is missing. We need to add the body with the same indentation level as the for loop body? which is one space? \n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            r += 1\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But we must indent each line by one space? \n\n        Actually, the existing code has:\n\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\n        So the next line for the while loop is at the same indentation level? \n\n        We'll output:\n\n            program1: \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (with 4 spaces? but the existing program1 uses 4 spaces? Let me check program1:)\n\n        In program1:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                S=input()\n                if S[0] in dic1:\n                    ... (indented by 4 spaces)\n\n        So we use 4 spaces for program1.\n\n        For program2, the existing code uses 1 space? But that might be because it's a one-liner? \n\n        Actually, the for loop body is two lines: \n            n=len(a:=a.split()); ... \n            while ... \n\n        And the while loop body will be multiple lines. We should use the same indentation? \n\n        The problem does not specify, but we can use 4 spaces for both? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that would replace the TODO.\n\n        For program2, the TODO is at the end of the while line. We are going to replace the entire while loop? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill the block of the while loop.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (with 4 spaces at the beginning? but note: the existing code in the else branch for dic2 is at the same level as the if-else for dic1. The existing code for the else branch of dic2 is:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are to replace the TODO with the line \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\", and we remove the comment.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        We output the exact line that should be in the else branch for dic2 in program1.\n\n        Similarly, for program2, we output the block of code that should be the body of the while loop.\n\n        However, note: the while loop in program2 currently has a comment at the end. We are replacing that entire line? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill the block for the while loop. The existing while loop line is:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace that with:\n\n            while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But wait, that would change the condition? \n\n        Alternatively, we can leave the condition and then put the block? \n\n        The problem says: the missing block. So we only output the body? \n\n        But the TODO is on the same line. We can do:\n\n            We output for program2: the block of code that goes inside the while loop? \n\n        Since the while loop condition is already written, we only need the body.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n            \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n\n        with 4 spaces of indentation? But the existing code uses 1 space? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify, but we can use 4 spaces for clarity? \n\n        However, the existing code in program2 uses 1 space for the for loop body. So we use 1 space? \n\n        But the for loop body has two lines: \n            n=len(a:=a.split()); ... \n            while ... \n\n        and then the while loop body should be indented one more level? \n\n        We'll use one more space? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same style as the for loop body? \n\n        The for loop body is written as two separate lines? \n\n        Actually, the for loop body is:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\n        and then \n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        and then \n\n            print(r)\n\n        So the while loop is at the same indentation as the assignment to n, m, r. \n\n        The body of the while loop should be indented one level more? \n\n        How many spaces? The problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces for the body? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that goes in the body, and we assume the indentation is already set by the while loop? \n\n        Actually, we can output the code without worrying about the indentation? \n\n        But the problem expects the code to run. So we must output with the correct indentation.\n\n        Since the existing code uses 1 space for the outer indentation, we use 1 space for the inner? \n\n        Actually, the code we are given for program2 has:\n\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n             print(r)\n\n        The for loop body is indented by one space. The while loop is at the same level. The body of the while loop should be indented by two spaces? \n\n        But that would be inconsistent. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the code for the body with one more level of indentation, and we use 4 spaces? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing. \n\n        For program1, the missing line is exactly:\n\n            dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n        and it should be placed in the else branch of the second if. The existing else branch is:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            else:\n                dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n        But we are only to output the missing code: so we output \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\", and we assume the else and the colon are already there? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The missing part is the body of the else. \n\n        Similarly, for program2, the missing part is the body of the while loop.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, we output the string: \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning to align with the if branch above) \n\n        For program2, we output the string: \n            \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n\n        with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        But the existing code in program2 uses 1 space for the outer indentation? \n\n        We can use 4 spaces for the inner block? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify, but we can assume that the environment will adjust? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same indentation as the surrounding code? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we output:\n\n            For program1: \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (with 4 spaces at the beginning, because the if branch above has 4 spaces)\n\n            For program2: \n                We note that the while loop is at the same indentation as the for loop body (which is 1 space). The body of the while loop should be indented one more level. We'll use 4 spaces for the inner block? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that would be inserted at the TODO, and the system will adjust the indentation? \n\n        Actually, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the necessary indentation.\n\n        For program1, the else branch body should be indented one level more than the else. The else is at 4 spaces? Then the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n        But the if branch above is:\n\n            if S[1] in dic2:\n                ... (with 8 spaces)\n\n        So the else branch body should be at 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing code:\n\n            if S[1] in dic2:\n                result += dic2[S[1]]\n                dic2[S[1]] += 1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The if branch body is two lines at 8 spaces. The else branch currently has a comment at 8 spaces? \n\n        So we output: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (with 8 spaces) for program1? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the line that replaces the TODO, which is the line that goes at the same level as the comment. \n\n        Therefore, we output: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\" for program1 (with 8 spaces).\n\n        For program2, the while loop body should be indented one level more than the while loop line. The while loop line is at 1 space. So the body should be at 5 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output without extra indentation? \n\n        Actually, the problem expects the code to run. We must use the same indentation as the surrounding code. \n\n        Since we cannot be sure, we output:\n\n            program1: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (8 spaces)\n            program2: \n                We output four lines, each indented by 4 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code in program2 for the for loop body is at 1 space. The while loop is at 1 space. The body of the while loop should be at 1+4=5 spaces? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. \n\n        We decide to use 4 spaces for each level. \n\n        For program2, the while loop is at the first level of the for loop body. The for loop body is already at 1 space? Then the while loop body should be at 1+4=5 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the code without any extra indentation and let the existing structure handle it? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing, without the surrounding structure. \n\n        We output:\n\n            program1: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n            program2: \n                \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n\n        with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line for program2? \n\n        But note: the while loop line is:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing that line with:\n\n            while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But that changes the condition? \n\n        Alternatively, we can leave the condition and then put the body? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The block is the body of the while loop. \n\n        Therefore, we output for program2 the block that goes inside the while loop, and we assume the while loop condition is already there. \n\n        So we output the four lines of the body, each indented by one level. \n\n        We choose 4 spaces for the indentation of the body.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\",\n                \"program2\": \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the existing code in program2 has the while loop condition and then a comment. We are replacing the entire line? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is on the same line. We are to complete the block. \n\n        We decide to output the body of the while loop as a string with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        However, the existing code in program2 uses 1 space for the outer. We use 4 spaces for the inner? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            program2: \n                \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n\n        meaning each line of the body is prefixed by 4 spaces? \n\n        Then the entire program2 would look like:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n             print(r)\n\n        But the while loop body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the while loop line? \n\n        However, the while loop line is at 1 space, and the body is at 1+4=5 spaces? \n\n        But the print(r) is at 1 space? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body should be indented relative to the while loop. \n\n        We output the body with 4 spaces of indentation? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use 1 tab? \n\n        The problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\",\n                \"program2\": \"    r += 1\\n    swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += swaps\\n    m += swaps\"\n            }\n\n        But note: in program1, the line we output is exactly 8 spaces and then the code? \n\n        And in program2, each line of the block is 4 spaces? \n\n        We hope that when inserted, the code will run.\n\n        Let me test program1:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n                dic2[S[1]] = 1   # but wait, the existing else has a colon and then the comment. We are replacing the comment? \n\n        Actually, the existing code:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We want to replace the comment with the line. So we remove the comment and put the line.\n\n        Therefore, the else branch becomes:\n\n            else:\n                dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        For program2, we replace the line:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        with:\n\n            while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        But note: the while loop body must be indented. We are using 4 spaces for the body? \n\n        The existing while loop line is at 1 space. We break it into:\n\n            while m<n:\n                ... (4 spaces)\n\n        But the next line (print(r)) is at 1 space, so it is outside the while loop.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON as above."
