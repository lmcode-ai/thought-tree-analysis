But note: the stamp sets the color, it doesn't add. However, because we are working modulo 2 (and the initial state is white which we can consider as 0) and the operations are linear (XOR), we can model:\n\n            Let f_i be the variable (mod2) for the stamp at position i: \n                f_i = 0 -> we use orientation2 (which sets (i:0, i+1:1))\n                f_i = 1 -> we use orientation1 (which sets (i:1, i+1:0)) Then the color at cell i is:\n            color_i = f_{i-1} XOR f_i   ??? Why? The stamp at i-1: if f_{i-1}=1, then it sets cell i to 0? The stamp at i: if f_i=1, then it sets cell i to 1? But then the net effect: the last stamp that covers cell i?",

Example7: s=\"W\" -> the segment is empty -> valid. Example: s=\"RR\" (n=2) -> has no 'B' -> invalid -> \"NO\", which matches because we cannot have [R,R] in two cells. Example: s=\"RB\" -> valid. Example: s=\"R\" (n=1) -> invalid. Example: s=\"RRB\" -> has 'R' and 'B' -> valid. But wait, the example [RRB] is valid by this condition, and we were able to make it. Example: [R,R,B,B] -> has 'R' and 'B' -> valid. But we couldn't find a sequence? How to make [R,R,B,B]?",

Therefore, the code:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n          tot = a[0]\n\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              if tot < 0:\n                  break\n              elif tot == 0:\n                  if a[i] ! = 0:\n                      break\n              else:\n                  tot += a[i]\n          else:   # this else corresponds to the for loop: if we did not break\n              if tot == 0:\n                  print(\"Yes\")\n                  continue\n\n          print(\"No\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the array can have negative numbers? Let's test with the example: [2, -1, -1, 0]\n      tot = 2 (>=0, not zero) -> then tot += a[1] -> 2-1=1\n      i=2: tot=1 -> then tot += a[2] -> 1-1=0\n      i=3: tot=0 -> then check a[3]=0 -> so we do nothing? and then the loop ends? Then we check: tot==0 -> print \"Yes\"\n\n  Another example: [0,0] -> \n      tot = 0\n      i=1: tot==0 -> then check a[1]=0 -> so we don't break -> then the loop ends -> then check tot==0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  Example: [1,0] -> \n      tot = 1\n      i=1: tot=1 -> then tot += a[1] = 1+0=1 -> then loop ends -> then tot=1 ! =0 -> \"No\"\n\n  But the problem says: \n      \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" \n      -> So the first test case in the problem is: Input: \n              5\n              2\n              1 0\n              3\n              -1 1 0\n              4\n              0 1 2 0\n              4\n              -1 0 0 0\n              4\n              0 -1 0 0\n\n      The expected answers: \n          The first test case: [1,0] -> \"No\" (as above) -> correct. The second test case: [-1,1,0] -> \n          tot = -1 -> break -> \"No\" -> correct. The third: [0,1,2,0] -> \n          tot = 0 -> then at i=1: a[1]=1 -> then we break? because tot==0 and a[1]!=0 -> then \"No\". But the problem says the third test case is \"No\". The fourth: [-1,0,0,0] -> \n          tot = -1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n      The fifth: [0,-1,0,0] -> \n          tot=0 -> then at i=1: a[1]=-1 -> then we break? because tot==0 and a[1]!=0 -> but wait, the condition is: if tot==0 and a[i]!=0 -> break. So we break -> \"No\"\n\n  But what about the example in the note: [2,-1,-1,0] -> we did and it worked.",

Importantly, every time we leave an element (except the last one when moving forward and the first one when moving backward) we are going to come back? But note the operations are arbitrary.\n\nHowever, note the following:\n- The net effect on the array: \n  Let d_i be the number of times we move forward from i to i+1 minus the number of times we move backward from i+1 to i. Then:\n  a_1 = d_1   (because we start at 1 and every forward move from 1 adds 1, and we never come back to 1 after leaving until the end? But note: we can come back to 1 from 2? However, when we come back from 2 to 1, we subtract 1 from 2 and then move to 1. Then when we leave 1 again we add 1 again? So actually the value at 1 is the number of times we left 1 minus the number of times we arrived at 1 from 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the entire journey as a sequence of steps. The key is to note that the entire journey must end at the first element. Therefore, the net movement to the right must equal the net movement to the left.\n\nWe can use the following invariant:\nLet b_i be the net number of times we have passed from i to i+1 (forward) minus the net number of times we have passed from i+1 to i (backward). Then:\n  a_1 = b_1\n  a_2 = b_2 - b_1   (because every time we leave 2 to the left we subtract 1, and every time we come from 1 to 2 we add 1? Actually, the value at position i is the net number of times we have left i to the right minus the net number of times we have arrived at i from the right (i.e., from i+1). But note the operations: \n    - When we are at i and move to i+1: we add 1 to a_i and then move -> so that adds 1 to a_i and then we are at i+1.\n    - When we are at i+1 and move to i: we subtract 1 from a_{i+1} and then move to i -> so that subtracts 1 from a_{i+1} and then we are at i.\n\nBut actually, the value at a_i is the number of times we have left i to the right minus the number of times we have arrived at i from the right? However, note that we start at 1 and end at 1. Therefore, the entire journey is a sequence of moves that form a loop? Not exactly: we start at 1 and end at 1, so the net displacement is 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n  Let x_i = the number of times we moved from i to i+1 (forward)\n  Let y_i = the number of times we moved from i+1 to i (backward)\n\nThen:\n  a_1 = x_1 - y_1   (because we start at 1: every forward move from 1 adds 1, and every backward move from 2 to 1 subtracts 1? But note: when we move from 2 to 1, we are at 2 and then we subtract 1 from 2 and move to 1. So that operation does not directly affect a_1. However, when we are at 1 and move to 2: we add 1 to a_1 and then move. Similarly, when we are at 2 and move to 1: we subtract 1 from a_2 and then move to 1. Then if we then leave 1 again, we add 1 to a_1 again.\n\nActually, the value at a_i is:\n  a_1 = x_1 - y_1\n  a_2 = x_2 - y_2 - (x_1 - y_1)   ??? \n\nBut note the operations:\n  The value at position i is increased by 1 every time we leave i to the right (x_i) and decreased by 1 every time we leave i to the left (y_i). However, we can also arrive at i from the left (which would be a forward move from i-1 to i) and from the right (a backward move from i+1 to i). But note the operations: \n    - When we leave i to the right: we add 1 to a_i and then move to i+1.\n    - When we leave i to the left: we subtract 1 from a_i and then move to i-1.\n\nBut what about arrivals? The arrivals don't directly change a_i. So the net effect is:\n  a_i = x_i - y_i\n\nBut also, the net movement must be consistent: we start at 1 and end at 1. The net number of times we have moved from i to i+1 must equal the net number of times we have moved from i+1 to i? Actually, the entire journey is a walk that starts and ends at 1. Therefore, for every i from 1 to n-1, we must have:\n  x_i - y_i = x_{i+1} - y_{i+1}   ??? \n\nWait, the net flow: \n  The number of times we go from 1 to 2 must equal the number of times we go from 2 to 1? Actually, the entire journey is a walk that starts at 1 and ends at 1. Therefore, the net displacement to the right must be balanced by a net displacement to the left. Specifically, for the segment between i and i+1, the net number of times we have gone from i to i+1 must equal the net number of times we have gone from i+1 to i? Actually, that is true for every edge? \n\nBut note: we can define the net flow for the edge (i, i+1) as f_i = x_i - y_i. Then the condition for the entire walk to be closed (start and end at 1) is that the net flow for every edge must be zero? Actually, no: the net flow out of node 1 is f_1, and then for node 2: we have an inflow of f_1 from node 1 and then we have an outflow of f_2 to node 3? And then we have an inflow from node 3 to node 2 of y_2? Actually, we need to model the entire graph.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire journey must have the same number of moves to the right and to the left? But that is for the entire journey: the net displacement is zero. However, we can also consider the cumulative flow.\n\nActually, we can define:\n  Let d_i = x_i - y_i   (the net forward moves from i to i+1)\n\nThen the value at a_i is d_i.\n\nBut also, the condition for the walk to be closed is that the net moves from 1 to 2 must be balanced by the net moves from 2 to 1? Actually, the entire journey is a walk that starts and ends at 1. Therefore, the net flow for the entire graph must be zero? However, note that we are only moving between adjacent nodes.\n\nWe can model the walk as:\n  We start at 1. Then we do a sequence of moves. The net effect on the position: \n    position = 1 + (x_1 - y_1) - (x_2 - y_2) + ... ? \n\nActually, the net displacement is the sum of (forward moves) - (backward moves) in terms of edges. But we start at 1 and end at 1, so the net displacement is 0. Therefore, the total net moves to the right must equal the total net moves to the left? But that is for the entire journey, not per edge.\n\nHowever, we can also note that the net moves on the edge (i, i+1) must be the same as the net moves on the edge (i+1, i) but in opposite direction? Actually, the net moves on the edge (i, i+1) is d_i, and the net moves on the edge (i+1, i) is -d_i? \n\nBut the key is: the walk must be such that we never have a negative number of backward moves? Actually, we can simulate the process from left to right.\n\nWe know:\n  a_1 = d_1\n  a_2 = d_2 - d_1   ??? Why? \n    - The value at a_2: \n        It is increased by 1 every time we move from 2 to 3 (x_2) and decreased by 1 every time we move from 2 to 1 (y_2). But note: we also have to account for the moves that come from 1 to 2? Actually, the moves from 1 to 2 do not directly change a_2. They change a_1. Similarly, the moves from 3 to 2 change a_3? \n\nSo the direct operations at 2 are only the moves that leave 2: \n  a_2 = x_2 - y_2\n\nBut then what is the relation? \n\nActually, the entire journey must satisfy the condition that the net moves to the right from i must be at least the net moves to the left from i+1? \n\nAlternatively, we can simulate the process from left to right with a variable \"tot\" that represents the net moves that have been made from the current segment (i.e., the net moves that have passed from the current position to the next). \n\nWe start at the first element. The value at the first element is the net moves that left the first element (to the right) minus the net moves that arrived at the first element (from the right). But note: we start at the first element and end at the first element. Therefore, the net moves that leave the first element to the right must be at least the moves that come back? \n\nWe can use a greedy simulation:\n\n  Let tot = a[0]   (which is the net moves that left the first element: because we start at 1 and every time we leave 1 we add 1, and every time we come back to 1 we subtract 1? But note: when we come back to 1 from 2, we subtract 1 from a_2 and then move to 1. Then we are at 1. Then if we leave again, we add 1 to a_1. So the net a_1 = (number of times we left 1) - (number of times we arrived at 1 from 2). \n\n  Now, when we are at the second element, the net moves that have passed from 1 to 2 is tot. But the value at the second element is the net moves that left 2 (to the right and to the left) but note: \n      a_2 = (number of times we left 2 to the right) - (number of times we left 2 to the left)\n\n  However, the moves that leave 2 to the left (which go to 1) are exactly the moves that we will then have to account for in the first element? But we already accounted for the arrivals at 1? \n\n  Actually, the net moves that have passed from 1 to 2 is tot. Then at position 2, we have:\n      a_2 = (moves from 2 to 3) - (moves from 2 to 1)\n\n  But note: the moves from 2 to 1 are the same as the moves that we have already accounted for in the first element? And the moves from 1 to 2 are tot. However, the moves from 2 to 1 must be subtracted from the net moves that are available at 2? \n\n  Also, the net moves that leave 2 to the right (to 3) will be passed to the next. Therefore, the net moves that we have at 2 that are available to pass to the next is: \n      tot2 = (moves from 2 to 3) = a_2 + (moves from 2 to 1)\n\n  But we don't know the moves from 2 to 1? However, note that the moves from 2 to 1 are the same as the moves that we had to do to come back? But we have the constraint that the entire journey ends at 1. Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n      tot = a[0]   (net moves that left 1 to 2, and note that we must eventually have these moves come back? but not necessarily at the same time)\n\n  Then for i=1 to n-1:\n      We are at element i (0-indexed, so a[i] is the current element). The net moves that have arrived at i from the left is tot. Then the value at a[i] is:\n          a[i] = (moves from i to i+1) - (moves from i to i-1)\n\n      Therefore, the moves from i to i+1 = a[i] + (moves from i to i-1)\n\n      But the moves from i to i-1 are the moves that we are going to do? and we haven't done them yet? \n\n  Alternatively, we can think: \n      The net moves that leave i to the right (to i+1) must be: tot + a[i]? \n\n  Why? \n      The net moves that arrived at i from the left is tot. Then we have the value a[i] = (moves from i to i+1) - (moves from i to i-1). But note that the moves from i to i-1 are the same as the moves that we have already done? Actually, we are processing from left to right. \n\n  Actually, we can define:\n      Let tot_i be the net moves that have been passed from i to i+1 (so far). Then the value at i is:\n          a_i = tot_{i-1} - tot_i   ??? \n\n  But note: \n      a_1 = tot_0 - tot_1? \n      Actually, we can define tot_0 = 0? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n      a_0 = tot_0   (because there is no previous, so the net moves that leave 0 to 1 is tot_0, and the value at 0 is the net moves that left 0 to 1 minus the net moves that arrived at 0 from 1? But we start at 0, so we don't have any arrival at 0? So a_0 = tot_0.\n\n      Then for i>=1: \n          a_i = tot_i - tot_{i-1}   ??? \n\n  Why? \n      The value at i is increased by tot_i (the moves that leave i to i+1) and decreased by tot_{i-1} (the moves that leave i to i-1)? But note: the moves that leave i to i-1 are the same as the moves that we have already passed from i-1 to i? Actually, the moves that go from i to i-1 are the same as the moves that we passed from i-1 to i and then came back? \n\n  Actually, the net moves that have been passed from i to i+1 is tot_i, and the net moves that have been passed from i-1 to i is tot_{i-1}. Then the value at i is the net moves that left i to the right (tot_i) minus the net moves that left i to the left? But the moves that left i to the left are the same as the moves that we passed from i to i-1? And that is tot_{i-1}? \n\n  However, note: the moves that leave i to the left are not necessarily tot_{i-1}? Actually, the net moves that have been passed from i to i-1 is the same as the net moves that have been passed from i-1 to i? \n\n  But wait: the net moves from i to i-1 is the same as the net moves from i-1 to i? Actually, no: they are negatives? \n\n  Alternatively, we can define:\n      a_i = tot_i - tot_{i-1}\n\n  Then we have:\n      tot_i = a_i + tot_{i-1}\n\n  And we know tot_0 = a_0.\n\n  Then we can compute:\n      tot_0 = a_0\n      tot_1 = a_1 + tot_0 = a_1 + a_0\n      tot_2 = a_2 + tot_1 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2\n\n  But then the condition for the entire journey to end at the first element: we must have tot_{n-1} = 0? Because at the last element, we cannot leave to the right? Actually, we can never leave the last element to the right? So the net moves from the last element to the next must be 0? \n\n  Also, during the process, we must have tot_i >= 0? Because we cannot have negative moves? Actually, the moves are non-negative? But note: we are representing net moves. However, the tot_i as defined above is the cumulative sum? \n\n  But note: the problem says that we can have negative a_i? \n\n  Actually, the equation: \n      a_i = tot_i - tot_{i-1}\n\n  Then tot_i = tot_{i-1} + a_i.\n\n  However, we must also note that the moves that leave an element to the right must be nonnegative? And the moves that leave an element to the left must be nonnegative? But in our equation, tot_i is the net moves that have been passed from i to i+1. This must be nonnegative? \n\n  Also, the condition for the last element: we cannot leave the last element to the right? So we must have tot_{n-1} = 0? \n\n  But also, what about the moves that leave an element to the left? They are represented by tot_{i-1}? And we require that at every step i (from 0 to n-2) we have tot_i >= 0? \n\n  However, note that the equation for the last element: \n      tot_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + tot_{n-2} \n      and we require tot_{n-1} = 0.\n\n  Therefore, the conditions are:\n      1. tot_0 = a_0 >= 0? \n      2. For every i from 1 to n-1: tot_i = tot_{i-1} + a_i must be nonnegative? \n      3. tot_{n-1} = 0.\n\n  But wait: what if a_0 is negative? Then we break immediately? \n\n  However, note the example: \n      n=2, a = [0,0] -> then tot0 = 0, then tot1 = 0+0=0 -> then we require tot1=0 -> yes.\n\n      But what about a = [1, -1]? \n          tot0 = 1 (>=0) -> then tot1 = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> then condition 3 holds -> yes.\n\n      But what about a = [-1, 1]? \n          tot0 = -1 -> negative -> break -> no.\n\n  However, the example in the note: \n      The second test case: n=4, a = [2, -1, -1, 0] -> \n          tot0 = 2 (>=0)\n          tot1 = 2 + (-1) = 1 (>=0)\n          tot2 = 1 + (-1) = 0 (>=0)\n          tot3 = 0 + 0 = 0 -> then condition 3: tot3=0 -> yes.\n\n  But the note says: \n      \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" \n      -> So the first test case in the problem is: \n          Input: \n              5\n              2\n              1 0\n              3\n              -1 1 0\n              4\n              0 1 2 0\n              4\n              -1 0 0 0\n              4\n              0 -1 0 0\n\n          The expected answers: \n              No, No, No, No, No? \n          But the example in the note: \n              \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\" -> the second test case is n=4, a = [2, -1, -1, 0] -> which is not in the above list.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \n      \"The first test case\" (in the note) is the one with [2, -1, -1, 0] and it is possible.\n\n  But the provided code in program1.py has:\n\n      tot = a[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          if tot < 0:\n              break\n          elif tot == 0:\n              if a[i] != 0:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n          else:\n              tot += a[i]\n\n      Then if we break out of the loop we print \"No\", else if tot==0 then \"Yes\".\n\n  So the code is doing:\n\n      tot = a[0]\n      for i from 1 to n-1:\n          if tot < 0: break\n          elif tot == 0:\n              if a[i] != 0: then we do something? \n          else: \n              tot += a[i]\n\n      Then if we didn't break and tot==0 then \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n  What should we do in the case when tot==0 and a[i]!=0?\n\n  Consider: \n      If tot==0, that means the net moves that have been passed to the current element is 0. Then we are at the current element and we have no pending moves to pass? Then the value at the current element must be 0? Why?\n          Because the equation: a_i = tot_i - tot_{i-1} = tot_i - 0 = tot_i. But then we require that the net moves that leave the current element to the next must be a_i. However, we are at the current element and we have no pending moves? Then we cannot have a positive a_i? But note: we can do moves that go forward and then come back? \n\n  Actually, if tot==0 at step i, then we are effectively at the current element with no net moves to pass. Then we cannot leave the current element to the right without eventually coming back? But if we leave to the right and then come back, then the net moves passed to the next would be 0? And the value at the current element would be 0? \n\n  Therefore, if tot==0 and we are at element i, then we must have a_i=0? \n\n  But what if a_i is negative? \n      Then we would have: \n          tot_i = tot_{i-1} + a_i = 0 + a_i = negative -> which breaks the condition (nonnegative tot_i). \n\n  So in the case when tot==0 and a[i]!=0, we should break and output \"No\".\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in the TODO block is: \n        break\n\n  However, note that the code already breaks if tot<0. And if tot==0 and a[i]!=0, we break. Then we can write:\n\n        if tot == 0:\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                break\n\n  But note: the code structure:\n\n        elif tot == 0:\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can break in the TODO.\n\n  Also, what about the rest of the array? We break and then skip the rest.\n\n  Then after the loop, if we broke, we print \"No\", else if we did not break and tot==0 then \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n  But what about the condition for the last element? We require that at the last element, we have tot (which is the cumulative sum for the last element) must be 0? \n\n  However, in the loop we are updating tot for the entire array? \n\n  Actually, the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1. At the end of the loop, tot is the cumulative sum for the last element? \n\n  Then we check: if we did not break and tot==0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n  But what if we break in the middle? Then we print \"No\".\n\n  However, we must also break if at any point tot becomes negative? \n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n          tot = a[0]\n\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              if tot < 0:\n                  break\n              elif tot == 0:\n                  if a[i] != 0:\n                      break\n              else:\n                  tot += a[i]\n          else:   # this else corresponds to the for loop: if we did not break\n              if tot == 0:\n                  print(\"Yes\")\n                  continue\n\n          print(\"No\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the array can have negative numbers? \n\n  Let's test with the example: [2, -1, -1, 0]\n      tot = 2 (>=0, not zero) -> then tot += a[1] -> 2-1=1\n      i=2: tot=1 -> then tot += a[2] -> 1-1=0\n      i=3: tot=0 -> then check a[3]=0 -> so we do nothing? and then the loop ends? \n      Then we check: tot==0 -> print \"Yes\"\n\n  Another example: [0,0] -> \n      tot = 0\n      i=1: tot==0 -> then check a[1]=0 -> so we don't break -> then the loop ends -> then check tot==0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  Example: [1,0] -> \n      tot = 1\n      i=1: tot=1 -> then tot += a[1] = 1+0=1 -> then loop ends -> then tot=1 !=0 -> \"No\"\n\n  But the problem says: \n      \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" \n      -> So the first test case in the problem is: \n          Input: \n              5\n              2\n              1 0\n              3\n              -1 1 0\n              4\n              0 1 2 0\n              4\n              -1 0 0 0\n              4\n              0 -1 0 0\n\n      The expected answers: \n          The first test case: [1,0] -> \"No\" (as above) -> correct.\n\n      The second test case: [-1,1,0] -> \n          tot = -1 -> break -> \"No\" -> correct.\n\n      The third: [0,1,2,0] -> \n          tot = 0 -> then at i=1: a[1]=1 -> then we break? because tot==0 and a[1]!=0 -> then \"No\". \n          But the problem says the third test case is \"No\".\n\n      The fourth: [-1,0,0,0] -> \n          tot = -1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n      The fifth: [0,-1,0,0] -> \n          tot=0 -> then at i=1: a[1]=-1 -> then we break? because tot==0 and a[1]!=0 -> but wait, the condition is: if tot==0 and a[i]!=0 -> break. So we break -> \"No\"\n\n  But what about the example in the note: [2,-1,-1,0] -> we did and it worked.\n\n  However, the problem says: \n      \"The first test case\" in the note is [2,-1,-1,0] and it is possible.\n\n  But note: the problem says the first test case in the input has 5 test cases. The note example is a separate example.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n        break\n\n  But note: the code already has an else clause for the for loop? So we break and then skip the else.\n\n  So we write in the TODO: \n        break\n\n  However, we can also set tot to a negative value to force the break? But the break is sufficient.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \"break\"\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given a string s of length n, consisting of 'W', 'R', 'B'. We want to know if we can form the picture by stamping adjacent pairs (with either \"RB\" or \"BR\") any number of times (and the stamp must fit entirely on the board).\n\n  Important: \n      - The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n      - The stamp must cover two adjacent cells.\n\n  We note:\n      - A white cell means it has never been stamped? Or it has been stamped an even number of times? Because each stamp flips the color: \n          Initially: white.\n          First stamp: if we stamp a white cell, it becomes either red or blue? \n          Then if we stamp again, it flips again? \n\n      But note: the stamp always stamps two adjacent cells. The stamp has two colors: one red and one blue. The two cells under the stamp are colored in one operation: one becomes red and the other blue. \n\n      However, if we stamp the same cell twice, then the color flips? \n          The stamp has two possibilities: \n            Option1: left becomes R, right becomes B.\n            Option2: left becomes B, right becomes R.\n\n      So if we stamp the same cell twice, we can get:\n          First stamp: [R, B] (if we use option1 on two adjacent cells)\n          Then stamp again the same two cells with option1: \n              The left cell: R -> ? \n              How does the stamp work? It recolors both cells. The stamp sets the left to R and the right to B? Then if we do the same again: \n                  left becomes R again? \n              But wait: the stamp doesn't add, it sets. So if we stamp a cell that is already R with a stamp that sets it to R (if we use the same orientation) then it becomes R again? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So it sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. \n\n      Therefore, if we stamp the same pair twice with the same orientation, then the second stamp will set the same colors. So it doesn't change. \n\n      But if we stamp with the opposite orientation? \n          First: [R, B] (using option1 on two white cells: W W -> R B)\n          Then stamp the same two cells with option2: \n              Then the left becomes B and the right becomes R? \n          Then we get [B, R].\n\n      So we can flip the colors of the two cells by stamping twice? \n\n      Therefore, the operations are reversible? \n\n  How to solve?\n\n  Observation:\n      - The entire picture must be partitioned into contiguous segments of non-white cells. The white cells act as separators.\n\n      Why? Because the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. Therefore, if there is a white cell, then the two segments on either side are independent? \n\n      So we can split the string by 'W' and check each contiguous segment of non-white cells.\n\n  Conditions for a contiguous segment of non-white cells (say of length L):\n\n      - If the segment has length 1: then we cannot stamp because the stamp requires two adjacent cells. So it is impossible? -> then we return \"NO\".\n\n      - For a segment of length>=2:\n\n          We note that the stamping operations are linear? Actually, we can model the colors as a linear algebra problem? \n\n          Let the segment be s[0..L-1]. We can assign a variable for each stamping operation on each adjacent pair in the segment. But note: the stamping operations can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            The stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to either (R,B) or (B,R). \n\n            We can consider the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped? But note: the stamping operation sets the color, so the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it? \n\n          However, the problem does not require the exact sequence, only possibility.\n\n      Another idea:\n\n          We can consider the entire segment. Note that the stamping operation always sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. Therefore, in the final segment, we cannot have two adjacent cells with the same color? \n\n          But wait: we can stamp multiple times. For example, we can have:\n              \"RR\": \n                  How? \n                  Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B] (if we use option1 on the first two)\n                  Step2: stamp the second and third? but we don't have a third. \n                  Alternatively, we can stamp the same pair twice? \n                      First: [R, B] (on the two cells)\n                      Then stamp the same pair with the opposite orientation: [B, R] -> then we get \"BR\" -> but that is not \"RR\".\n\n          Actually, we cannot get two adjacent reds? \n\n          But note: we can also stamp overlapping. \n              Example for three cells: \n                  We want \"RRB\": \n                  Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W] -> then we have \"R B W\"\n                  Step2: stamp the second and third: we can stamp the second and third as \"BR\": then the second becomes B (from B) to R? and the third becomes B? -> then we get \"R R B\". \n\n          How? \n              In step2: we stamp the second and third: \n                  The stamp sets the second to R and the third to B? \n                  But the second was B. Then we set it to R? \n                  So we get: [R, R, B].\n\n          Therefore, we can have two adjacent reds? \n\n      Actually, the key is: the last stamp on a cell determines its color. \n\n      Therefore, we can have any color pattern? \n\n      But note: the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n      Why? \n          Because the stamp always sets one red and one blue. And if we stamp an even number of times on a cell, then the color flips? Actually, no: the stamp sets the color. \n\n      However, consider: \n          We start with two white cells: [W, W]\n          We stamp once: we get either [R, B] or [B, R]. So we have one red and one blue.\n\n          Now, if we stamp again the same two cells with the same orientation: we get [R, B] again? \n          Or with the opposite: [B, R]. \n\n          So we can only have two possibilities: either the first is R and the second B, or the first is B and the second R.\n\n          Now, if we have three cells: \n              We can stamp the first two: [R, B, W] \n              Then stamp the last two: [R, R, B] -> because we set the second to R and the third to B? \n              But wait: the second was B. Then we set it to R? \n\n          So the second cell is stamped twice: first as B (from the first stamp) and then as R (from the second stamp). \n\n          Therefore, the final color of the second cell is R.\n\n      So we can have two adjacent reds? \n\n      But what about the entire segment? \n\n      We note that the parity of the number of times a cell is stamped matters? \n          Let x_i be the number of times the stamp covers cell i (from the left edge of the stamp: the stamp covers i and i+1). Then the color of cell i is determined by the net effect of the stamps that cover it? \n\n          Specifically, if a cell is covered by an odd number of stamps, then the last stamp determines the color? But actually, the stamp sets the color. However, if we stamp the same cell multiple times, the color alternates? \n\n          Actually, the stamp sets the color to either R or B. The two orientations are fixed. \n\n          How to model? \n            Let the segment be of length L. We have L-1 possible stamp positions (from index0 to index L-2). \n\n          We can assign a variable for each stamp position: \n              f_i = 1 if we use the stamp at position i (covering i and i+1) in the orientation that sets i to R and i+1 to B, and 0 if we use the opposite? Actually, we can use the stamp multiple times? \n\n          But note: the problem does not restrict the number of times. However, the effect modulo 2? \n\n          Because if we stamp the same pair twice, it is equivalent to not stamping? \n\n          Therefore, we can consider the operations modulo 2.\n\n          Then the color at cell i is:\n            color_i = initial_color (which is white) XOR ... ?\n\n          Actually, we can model:\n            Let the stamping operation at position i (covering i and i+1) in orientation1: \n                sets cell i to R and cell i+1 to B.\n            In orientation2: \n                sets cell i to B and cell i+1 to R.\n\n          But if we do the same stamp twice, it cancels? \n\n          Therefore, we can model the entire segment as a system of linear equations modulo 2? \n\n          However, note: the initial state is white. We want to achieve a state that is non-white? \n\n          Actually, the problem: we start with white, and we stamp. The stamp sets the two cells to either (R,B) or (B,R). \n\n          How does the stamp affect the state? \n            We can assign: \n                R = 1, B = 0? \n            But then the stamp at position i in orientation1: \n                sets cell i to 1, cell i+1 to 0.\n            In orientation2: \n                sets cell i to 0, cell i+1 to 1.\n\n          But note: if we stamp the same pair twice, we can get:\n            orientation1 twice: \n                cell i: 1 then 1 -> 1? \n                cell i+1: 0 then 0 -> 0.\n            orientation1 then orientation2: \n                cell i: 1 then 0 -> 0\n                cell i+1: 0 then 1 -> 1.\n\n          So the effect is additive modulo 2? \n\n          Therefore, we can model the entire segment as:\n\n            Let x_i be the number of times (mod2) we use the stamp at position i in orientation1? \n            Then the effect on cell i:\n                cell0: only affected by stamp0? \n                    color0 = x_0   (if we use orientation1 at stamp0, then cell0 becomes 1; if we use orientation2, then we don't use orientation1, so x_0=0 and then we use orientation2 which is equivalent to x_0=0? but we can also model orientation2 as x_0=0? \n\n          Actually, we can define:\n            For stamp at position i, we have two choices: \n                orientation1: which sets (i:1, i+1:0)\n                orientation2: which sets (i:0, i+1:1)\n\n          But note: we can also do both? Then the net effect: \n                (1,0) + (0,1) = (1,1) mod2? \n\n          However, the problem: the stamping operations are independent and we can do any number of times. Therefore, the effect at cell i is the XOR of the contributions from the stamps that cover it.\n\n          Specifically, the stamp at position i-1 (if exists) covers cell i-1 and i: \n              if we use orientation1 for stamp i-1: then it sets cell i to 0? \n              if we use orientation2 for stamp i-1: then it sets cell i to 1? \n          And the stamp at position i (if exists) covers cell i and i+1:\n              if we use orientation1 for stamp i: then it sets cell i to 1? \n              if we use orientation2 for stamp i: then it sets cell i to 0? \n\n          But note: the stamp sets the color, it doesn't add. However, because we are working modulo 2 (and the initial state is white which we can consider as 0) and the operations are linear (XOR), we can model:\n\n            Let f_i be the variable (mod2) for the stamp at position i: \n                f_i = 0 -> we use orientation2 (which sets (i:0, i+1:1))\n                f_i = 1 -> we use orientation1 (which sets (i:1, i+1:0))\n\n          Then the color at cell i is:\n            color_i = f_{i-1} XOR f_i   ??? \n\n          Why? \n            The stamp at i-1: if f_{i-1}=1, then it sets cell i to 0? \n            The stamp at i: if f_i=1, then it sets cell i to 1? \n            But then the net effect: the last stamp that covers cell i? \n\n          Actually, the stamps are applied arbitrarily and the last one wins? \n\n          However, the problem says we can do any number of times. And the effect is that the color is the XOR of the contributions? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the effect on cell i is the XOR of:\n            - The stamp at i-1: if we used orientation1 (f_{i-1}=1) then it sets cell i to 0? But that doesn't look additive.\n\n      Another approach: \n\n          We note that the entire segment must have an even number of red and blue? \n\n          Actually, the stamp always stamps one red and one blue. Therefore, the entire segment must have the same number of red and blue? \n\n          But wait: \n              Example: two cells: one red and one blue -> matches.\n              Example: three cells: we had \"RRB\": two reds and one blue -> not the same.\n\n          Therefore, that condition is not sufficient.\n\n      Insight:\n\n          The problem is equivalent to: can we assign the entire segment to a sequence of operations that form a valid tiling? \n\n          We can use a greedy check:\n\n          Conditions for a contiguous segment (without white) of length L:\n\n            1. The length must be at least 2? Actually, if L==0, skip. If L==1, then impossible.\n\n            2. The entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n                Why? Because if we have all reds, then we must have an even number of reds? \n                But consider: \n                    Two cells: we can get [R,B] or [B,R] -> so we cannot get [R,R]? \n                    How to get [R,R]? \n                        We start with two white: [W,W]\n                        Step1: stamp with orientation1: [R, B]\n                        Step2: stamp the same pair with orientation2: [B, R] -> then we get [B,R] -> not [R,R].\n                        Step3: stamp the first two again: [R, B] -> we are back.\n\n                Actually, we can never get two adjacent reds? \n\n          But wait: we did get [R,R] in a three-cell example: \n              [W,W,W] \n              Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W]\n              Step2: stamp the second and third: [R, R, B] -> so we have two adjacent reds.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not that the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n      Another idea: \n\n          We can use dynamic programming? But the constraints: the total n over test cases is 10^5.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note:\n\n          The operations are reversible? So the necessary and sufficient condition is that the entire segment has an even number of cells? \n\n          But the example: two cells: even -> possible. \n          three cells: odd -> but we did an example that worked.\n\n      Actually, the key is: the entire segment must be colorable such that the pattern is consistent with the stamping? \n\n      We can traverse the segment and check:\n\n          We note that the first cell can be either R or B. Then the next cell must be the opposite? But then the next cell must be the opposite of the second? \n\n          But wait: the stamping operations can overlap arbitrarily. \n\n          Actually, the entire segment must be bipartite? \n\n          We can form a graph: \n              Each cell is a node. \n              Each stamping operation on two adjacent cells creates an edge: and the two cells must be different colors. \n\n          Therefore, the entire segment must be bipartite? \n\n          But the segment is a contiguous line -> which is bipartite. \n\n          However, the problem is: we are given the colors. We need to check if there is a way to assign the stamps so that the colors are as given? \n\n          Actually, the condition: \n              The entire segment must be 2-colorable? \n\n          But note: the stamping operation forces the two adjacent cells to be different? \n\n          However, the given segment might have two adjacent same colors? \n\n          Example: [R, R] in a two-cell segment: \n              We cannot get [R,R]? \n              Because the stamp always sets two adjacent cells to different colors. \n\n          Therefore, the condition: \n              In the segment, there must be no two adjacent cells with the same color? \n\n          But wait: we had [R,R] in a three-cell segment? \n              The segment was [R, R, B]: \n                  The adjacent pairs: \n                      (R,R) -> same -> but that is adjacent? \n\n          So we must have no two adjacent cells with the same color? \n\n          However, the example [R, R, B] has two adjacent reds -> which is adjacent same? \n\n          Therefore, that example should be impossible? \n\n          But the problem states that it is possible? \n\n          How? \n              Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W]\n              Step2: stamp the second and third: [R, R, B] -> \n                  How? \n                  In step2: we stamp the second and third: \n                      The stamp sets the second to R and the third to B? \n                  But the second was B. Then we set it to R? \n\n          So the second cell is set to R in the last stamp. \n\n          Therefore, the last stamp sets the second to R and the third to B. \n\n          But then the first cell is R and the second is R: they are adjacent? \n\n          The problem does not require that the stamping operations set the entire segment to the same pattern? \n\n          However, the final picture is [R, R, B]. \n\n          And the condition: the stamping operations must be applied arbitrarily? \n\n          But note: the stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. However, after the last stamp, the entire segment must be [R, R, B]. \n\n          How can two adjacent cells be the same? \n\n          The problem does not say that the stamping operations must set the two cells to two different colors and then we cannot change them? \n\n          Actually, the stamping operation sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. Therefore, if we stamp the second and third, we set the second to R and the third to B. Then the first cell remains R. \n\n          So we have [R, R, B]. \n\n          Therefore, two adjacent cells can be the same? \n\n          But note: the stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. However, the entire segment is built by multiple stamps. \n\n          The condition: the last stamp on a cell determines its color. \n\n          Therefore, we can have two adjacent cells that are the same color if they are set by different stamps? \n\n          How? \n              The first cell is set by a stamp that covers the first and second: set to R. \n              Then the second cell is set by a later stamp that covers the second and third: set to R. \n\n          So the second cell was first set to B (by the first stamp) and then set to R (by the second stamp). \n\n          Therefore, the final color of the second cell is R. \n\n          And the first cell remains R. \n\n          So we have two adjacent R's. \n\n      Therefore, the condition is not that adjacent cells must be different. \n\n      What is the necessary and sufficient condition?\n\n          We note that the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n          Why? \n              Because the stamp always stamps one red and one blue. Therefore, if we stamp at least once, we have at least one red and one blue. \n              But what if we never stamp? Then the segment is all white? But we are in a non-white segment. \n\n          However, the segment is non-white by definition. \n\n          But what if the segment is all red? \n              Example: two cells: we cannot get [R,R]? \n              Example: three cells: we can get [R,R,B] -> which has one blue. \n\n          How about four cells: [R,R,R,R]? \n              We can do:\n                  Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W, W]\n                  Step2: stamp the third and fourth: [R, B, R, B] -> not all red.\n                  Step3: stamp the second and third: \n                         The second is B, we set it to R and the third to B -> [R, R, B, B]\n                  Step4: stamp the third and fourth: set the third to R and the fourth to B -> [R, R, R, B] -> not all red.\n\n          How to get [R,R,R,R]? \n              We need to set each cell to R. \n              But each stamp sets one R and one B. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of R's must equal the total number of B's? \n\n          But wait: \n              In the entire segment, each stamping operation adds one R and one B. \n              But note: a cell can be stamped multiple times. \n\n          However, the net effect: \n              Each stamping operation adds one R and one B to the entire segment? \n\n          But the segment is isolated. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of R's must equal the total number of B's? \n\n          Example: [R,R,B] has two R's and one B -> not equal -> but we did an example that worked? \n\n          Contradiction? \n\n          Let me recount: \n              [R,R,B]: \n                  R: two, B: one -> not equal.\n\n          But how did we get it? \n              We stamped the first two: that's one R and one B.\n              Then we stamped the second and third: that's one R and one B.\n              Total: two R's and two B's? \n              But the segment has three cells: \n                  cell1: R -> one R\n                  cell2: R -> one R\n                  cell3: B -> one B\n              So total: two R's and one B.\n\n          Where is the extra B? \n\n          The extra B is not in the segment? \n\n          Therefore, the condition is not on the entire segment but on the whole picture? \n\n          But the segment is independent. \n\n          Actually, the stamping operation always affects two cells. It doesn't matter if they are in the segment or not? \n\n          But the segment is contiguous and we are only looking at the segment. \n\n          Therefore, the condition: the number of R's must equal the number of B's in the segment? \n\n          But then [R,R,B] has two R's and one B -> not equal -> impossible. \n\n          But the example in the problem says it is possible? \n\n          The example in the problem for three cells: \n              \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> BRB -> then we get BRB\"\n\n          But the fifth test case: \n              n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> \n                  B: two, R: one -> not equal? \n\n          And the sixth test case: \n              n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> \n                  R:1, B:2 -> not equal.\n\n          And the seventh: s=\"R\" -> but n=1 -> impossible? \n\n          The problem says for the fifth test case: \n              \"WWW\" -> stamp the last two: \"W\" + \"RB\" -> \"WRB\"\n              then stamp the first two: \"BR\" + \"B\" -> \"BRB\"\n\n          So s=\"BRB\": \n              cell0: 'B'\n              cell1: 'R'\n              cell2: 'B'\n\n          Count: B:2, R:1 -> not equal.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not that the number of R's equals the number of B's.\n\n      Another idea: \n\n          We can consider the positions modulo 2. \n\n          Let's assign: \n              R = 1, B = 0.\n\n          Then the stamping operation at position i: \n              orientation1: sets (i:1, i+1:0)\n              orientation2: sets (i:0, i+1:1)\n\n          But then the net effect on the entire segment: \n              The XOR of all the cells: \n                  orientation1: 1 XOR 0 = 1\n                  orientation2: 0 XOR 1 = 1\n\n          Therefore, the XOR of the entire segment must be 1? \n\n          Example: [R,R,B]: \n              R=1, R=1, B=0 -> 1 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 0 -> not 1.\n\n          Example: [B,R,B]: \n              B=0, R=1, B=0 -> 0 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n          Example: [R,B]: \n              1 XOR 0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n          Example: [B,R]: \n              0 XOR 1 = 1 -> matches.\n\n          Example: [R,R]: \n              1 XOR 1 = 0 -> not 1.\n\n          Example: [B,B]: \n              0 XOR 0 = 0 -> not 1.\n\n          Example: [R]: \n              1 -> matches? but n=1 is impossible.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions for a segment:\n\n            1. If the segment has length 1: impossible.\n            2. If the segment has length>=2: \n                 a. The XOR of the entire segment (with R=1, B=0) must be 1? \n                 b. Also, the segment must not be all zeros? \n\n          But wait: all zeros would be all B: XOR=0 -> not 1 -> so it would be rejected.\n\n          Example: [R,B,B]: \n              R=1, B=0, B=0 -> 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1 -> matches.\n              But is it possible? \n                  We can do:\n                    Start: [W,W,W]\n                    Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W]\n                    Step2: stamp the last two: [R, B, R] -> wait, we wanted [R,B,B]? \n                    How to get [R,B,B]? \n                      Step1: stamp the last two: [W, R, B] \n                      Step2: stamp the first two: [B, R, B] -> not [R,B,B].\n\n                  Alternatively:\n                      Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W]\n                      Step2: stamp the first two again with the opposite orientation: [B, R, W]\n                      Step3: stamp the last two: [B, R, R] -> not [R,B,B].\n\n          How about:\n                      Step1: stamp the first two: [R, B, W]\n                      Step2: stamp the first two with orientation1: [R, B, W] -> no change? \n                      Step3: stamp the last two: [R, B, R] -> not [R,B,B].\n\n          It seems difficult. \n\n          Alternatively, the condition might be that the segment has at least one R and one B? \n\n          [R,B,B] has one R and two B's -> has both.\n\n          But then [B,B,B] would be rejected? \n\n          [B,B,B]: \n              We can do:\n                  Step1: stamp the first two: [B, R, W]\n                  Step2: stamp the last two: [B, R, R] -> not [B,B,B].\n\n          So [B,B,B] is impossible.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions for a segment:\n\n            1.

\n                      else: check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n\n            But the code already has:\n\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n            The print statement: \n                if b=0, then it prints 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> 'YES' (taking every other character: index0, index2, index4 -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\")\n                if b=1, then it prints 'YNEOS '[1::2] -> 'N','O' -> \"NO\"\n\n            So we want to set b=1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                if i != '':   # non-empty segment\n                    if len(i)==1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                            b = 1\n                            break\n\n            But note: there might be multiple segments. We only need one invalid segment to make the whole test case invalid.\n\n            However, the for loop breaks at the first invalid segment.\n\n            But what if there are multiple segments? We must check all? \n\n            The known solution breaks at the first invalid segment.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But note: the condition: \n                if the segment is non-empty and (either its length is 1 or it is missing at least one color) -> invalid.\n\n            However, we can write:\n\n                if i != '':\n                    if len(i)==1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But we can combine:\n\n                if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n            However, if the segment has length 1, then it will not have both 'R' and 'B'? \n                Because it has only one character, so it has either 'R' or 'B' but not both.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n                if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            This covers:\n                - if the segment has only one character: then it has only one letter, so either 'R' is not in it (if it is 'B') or 'B' is not in it (if it is 'R') -> so condition holds.\n                - if the segment has more than one character but only one color: then either 'R' is not in it (if it is all 'B') or 'B' is not in it (if it is all 'R') -> condition holds.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n          But note: the segment might be empty? \n              s.split(\"W\") can yield empty strings. We skip if i is empty.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n  However, note: the condition 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i is equivalent to: not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)\n\n  So we can also write:\n\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n  But the above is the same.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"break\"\n      program2: \n          if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i): \n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  But note: the code in program2.py is:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must write the code in the TODO.\n\n  However, the variable 's' in the outer loop is a string of the picture, and then we split it by 'W'. The inner variable i is a string of contiguous non-white characters.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      if i and ( 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i ):\n          b = 1\n          break\n\n  But note: the condition might be evaluated as: \n      if i is non-empty and (either there's no 'R' in i or there's no 'B' in i) then set b=1 and break.\n\n  This is the condition for an invalid segment.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n            break\n\n  But note: the problem says the string s in the test case has newline? \n      We have: s in [*open(0)][2::2] -> and then we do s[:-1] to remove the newline? \n\n  And then we split by \"W\". \n\n  This should be fine.\n\n  Let's test with a small example: \n      Input: \n          1\n          2\n          RB\n\n      Then s = \"RB\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"RB\" -> split by \"W\" -> ['RB'] -> then i='RB': \n          i is non-empty -> check: 'R' in 'RB' -> True, 'B' in 'RB' -> True -> so condition fails -> b remains 0.\n\n  Example: \n      Input: \n          1\n          1\n          R\n\n      Then s = \"R\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"R\" -> split by \"W\" -> ['R'] -> \n          i='R' -> non-empty -> 'R' in 'R' -> True, 'B' in 'R' -> False -> condition: 'R' not in i? False, 'B' not in i? True -> so True -> set b=1.\n\n  Example: \n      Input: \n          1\n          2\n          WW\n\n      Then s = \"WW\\n\" -> s[:-1] = \"WW\" -> split by \"W\" -> ['','',''] -> then we skip.\n\n  Therefore, it works.\n\n  Final answer:\n\n      program1: \"break\"\n      program2: \n          if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py the missing code is only the TODO block, which is one line.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is the entire block inside the for loop.\n\n  However, the TODO block in program2.py is the entire for loop body? \n\n  We are to output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"}\n\n  But note: the program2.py code has:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must replace the TODO with the code.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  And the output format is JSON.\n\n  We write:\n\n      {\n          \"program1\": \"break\",\n          \"program2\": \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\\n            break\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the indentation in program2.py: the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. The TODO is at the same level. So the code we put should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can use 4 spaces for the body. But the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use one tab? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  Since the existing code in program1.py uses 4 spaces, we use 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n            break\n\n  But in the JSON string, we must escape newlines and quotes? \n\n  Actually, the problem does not require that, but we are writing a JSON string.\n\n  We can write the string with newlines.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      \"program1\": \"break\",\n      \"program2\": \"    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n  But wait, the existing code in program2.py has 8 spaces of indentation for the for loop body? \n\n  Actually, the for loop is already indented by 4 spaces (from the outer for loop). Then the TODO is at 8 spaces. Then the code we put should be at 8 spaces? \n\n  But the condition and break should be at 8 and 12? \n\n  Alternatively, we can output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n  The TODO is at one level of indentation (4 spaces) inside the for loop. So the if statement should be at 4 spaces (relative to the for loop) and the break at 8? \n\n  But the existing code in program2.py:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for loop for i is at 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\n  We want:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n                  break\n\n  So the if statement is at 8 spaces, and the break is at 12.\n\n  But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces, but it must run. We can use:\n\n          if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n              b = 1\n              break\n\n  with 4 spaces for the if and 8 for the break? \n\n  Actually, in the program, the for loop body is one level. We can use 4 spaces for the if and 8 for the break? \n\n  But the existing code in the same block (the for loop body) is the TODO comment, which is at 8 spaces. \n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program2: \n          \"    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n  But this has 4 spaces at the beginning of the if line (making it 8 in total) and 8 spaces for the break (making it 12 in total). \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without extra leading spaces and let the existing indentation absorb it? \n\n  Since the TODO is at the correct indentation level, we only need to put the code at the same level.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n  Then when inserted at the TODO, it becomes:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n                  break\n\n  The for loop body is at 4 spaces, then the if is at 4+4=8, and the break is at 4+4+4=12? \n\n  But the existing for loop body is already at 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the for loop is:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              ...   # this is at 8 spaces\n\n  So if we put:\n\n      \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n  then the code becomes:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n                  break\n\n  The if is at 8 spaces (because the for loop body is at 8) and the break is at 12.\n\n  That is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"break\"\n      program2: \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n  But note: the program2.py code uses 4 spaces per indent. So the break should be indented by 4 more spaces.\n\n  We write the string with a newline and then the code.\n\n  However, to be safe, we can output the exact code as it would be inserted.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify, we use the above.\n\n  Let me write the JSON:\n\n      {\n          \"program1\": \"break\",\n          \"program2\": \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the condition uses single quotes. In JSON, we use double quotes for the entire string, so we must escape the double quotes inside? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the condition inside the string? \n\n  The condition: \n      'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\n\n  We can use single quotes in the string.\n\n  But the JSON string must be in double quotes. And the condition has single quotes, which are allowed in a JSON string.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"}\n\n  This should work."
