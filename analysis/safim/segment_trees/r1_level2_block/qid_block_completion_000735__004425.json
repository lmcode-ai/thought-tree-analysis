    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code is almost complete. We are missing the condition for Division 2 (which is when the rating is between 1600 and 1899). The current condition for Division 2 is:\n    elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe just need to print \"Division 2\" in that block.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of operations to get a copy of the array where all elements are equal.\n\nThe provided code in program2.py:\n    from collections import Counter\n    for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        n=len(li:=li.split());\n        m = max(Counter(li).values())\n        ans =n-m\n        while(m<n):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print(ans)\n\nWe note that the note in the problem says that the answer for the first test case (all equal) is 0, and the second test case requires 6 operations.\n\nThe idea is:\n- We are counting the frequency of each element. Let m be the maximum frequency of any element in the array.\n- The initial ans is set to n - m (which is the number of elements that are not the most frequent). But the example shows that we need more operations.\n\nThe operations allowed are:\n1. Clone an array (so we can have multiple copies).\n2. Swap any two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\nThe goal is to have at least one copy that has all elements equal.\n\nWe can think greedily:\n- We start with one copy. If the array is already all equal, we are done (0 operations).\n- Otherwise, we can use the following strategy:\n\nIn the provided code, the initial ans is set to n - m. Then there is a while loop that runs while m < n.\n\nThe note in the problem example: \n  Initially: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6, m=2 because 0 and 3 appear twice? Actually, 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice, so m=2).\n  Then they do 6 operations.\n\nHow do we compute the operations?\nWe can simulate the process:\n\nOperation 1: clone the array -> now we have two copies.\n\nThen we can do swaps to bring all the zeros (for example) into one array. But note that we are allowed to swap arbitrarily.\n\nThe minimal operations can be computed by:\n\nLet m be the maximum frequency. We want to have one copy with all the same element (say x that appears m times). We can use the following steps:\n\n1. We start with one copy. We need to collect at least n copies of the element x? Actually, we want one array to have n copies of x.\n\nBut note: we can only swap, we cannot create new elements. So we must gather all the x's from the copies we have.\n\nHowever, the problem allows us to create clones and then swap arbitrarily.\n\nThe known solution for this problem is:\n\n  if m == n:\n      print(0)\n  else:\n      operations = 0\n      current = m   # current number of the target element in the copy we are building\n      while current < n:\n          operations += 1   # for the clone operation? But note the example: \n          # Actually, we can do:\n          # Step 1: clone the current best copy (which has at least current copies of the target)\n          # Then we can swap: we can take up to current copies of the target from the new clone and swap them with non-target in the original?\n          # But note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily between any two arrays.\n\n          # The idea: \n          # In one operation of cloning, we get a new copy. Then we can do multiple swaps? But the problem counts each swap as one operation? \n          # Actually, the problem says: two types of operations: \n          #   Type1: clone (counts as one op)\n          #   Type2: swap (counts as one op per swap)\n\n          # However, the example did 6 operations: \n          #   Operation1: clone (1 op) -> two copies\n          #   Then they did two swaps (so 2 ops) to get two zeros in the first copy? Actually, they did two swaps? \n          #   Then they cloned again (3rd op) to get a third copy? \n          #   Then they did two more swaps (5th and 6th) to get the first copy to all zeros.\n\n          # But the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n          #   ans = 0\n          #   while m < n:\n          #       ans += 1   # this accounts for the clone operation\n          #       # Then we can swap: we can double the number of the target element in the copy we are building? \n          #       # But note: we can only swap one element per swap operation? However, the problem does not require to count the swaps individually? \n          #       # Actually, the known solution does not count the swaps? Why?\n\n          # Rethink the known solution:\n\n          #   Let m = max frequency.\n          #   ans = 0\n          #   while m < n:\n          #       ans += 1   # this is for cloning\n          #       # Then we can use the clone to swap: we can take up to m of the target element from the clone and swap them with non-target in the original?\n          #       # But then the original would then have m (from the original) + m (from the clone) = 2*m? \n          #       # However, we are limited by the number of non-target elements in the original? Actually, the original has n - m non-targets.\n\n          #   But note: after cloning, we have two arrays. Then we can swap as many as we want?

Then we can swap: we can take up to k of the target from the second array and swap them with non-targets in the first array. Then the first array will have k (original) + k (from the second) = 2*k? \n          #       But note: we can only take as many as the non-targets we have in the first array? Actually, the first array has n - k non-targets. So we can only swap min(k, n-k) in one go? \n\n          #   However, the example: \n          #       Initially, k=2. We clone (op1). Then we can swap up to min(2, 4) = 2 non-targets in the first array? so we swap two non-targets (the 1 and the 3) in the first array with two zeros from the second array. Then the first array becomes [0,0,0,0,7,0]? no, wait: the first array originally has two zeros and four non-zeros? Actually, no: the first array has two zeros and four non-zeros? but we swapped two non-zeros (positions 1 and 2) with two zeros from the second array. Then the first array becomes: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> that's three zeros? Actually, we added two zeros? so now the first array has 2+2=4 zeros? but wait, we swapped two non-zeros (which were in the first array) for two zeros (from the second array). So the first array now has 2 (original) + 2 (swapped in) = 4 zeros? and the non-zeros are now two (the 3 and 7) in the first array? \n\n          #   Then we clone the first array again (op3). Now we have two arrays with 4 zeros and two non-zeros. Then we can swap the two non-zeros in the first array with two zeros from the second array? Then the first array becomes 4+2=6 zeros? and that took two swaps (op4 and op5). Then we are done? total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n          #   But note: the first clone operation is one op, then two swaps (two ops) -> total 3 so far. Then the second clone is op4, then two swaps (op5 and op6) -> total 6.\n\n          # How to compute without simulation?\n\n          # We note:\n          #   We start with k = m (max frequency). \n          #   We want to get k to n.\n          #   In one \"round\":\n          #       We do one clone (1 op) and then we can swap up to k non-targets in the target array with targets from the clone? and then the target array will have k (original) + k (from the clone) = 2*k? \n          #   But wait: we can only swap as many as the non-targets we have in the target array? which is (n - k). So we can only swap min(k, n-k) per round? \n\n          #   However, the example: \n          #       Round1: \n          #           k0 = 2\n          #           We do one clone -> cost 1\n          #           Then we swap min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2 -> then the target array now has 2+2=4 zeros? and we used 2 swaps -> cost 2 for swaps -> total cost for the round: 3\n          #           Then k becomes 4.\n          #       Round2:\n          #           k=4\n          #           We do one clone -> cost 1 (total 4)\n          #           Then we swap min(4, 6-4)=min(4,2)=2 -> then the target array becomes 4+2=6 -> done.
