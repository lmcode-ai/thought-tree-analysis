So we output for program2.py: \"            L = mid\" (which is 12 spaces). But note: the existing code in the if branch is written as:\n\n                  R = mid\n\n  which is 12 spaces (because 3 indents: function -> while -> if). So the else branch should be:\n\n                  L = mid\n\n  Therefore, the JSON becomes:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in the program1.py, the for loop is at the top level, so the body should be at 4 spaces.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is to output the division for each rating in the input.\nWe have a helper function `div(n)` that returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the rating.\nWe are to read the number of test cases, then for each test case, read the rating and output the division.\n\nThe missing code in program1.py is the body of the loop that reads the rating and prints the division.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The process is:\n- Initially, all vertices are healthy.\n- Each second: \n  1. Spreading: For each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can infect at most one additional child (of our choice).\n  2. Injection: We can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. The input for each test case:\n  - n: number of vertices\n  - n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn, where p_i is the parent of vertex i (vertex 1 is the root).\n\nWe have a function `solve(a)` that is intended to compute the minimal seconds for one test case.\nThe provided code in program2.py does:\n  - It uses a defaultdict `counter` to count the number of children for each parent? Actually, note that the input gives the parent of each vertex from 2 to n. So we can build the children count for each node.\n\nHowever, note that the root (vertex 1) is not included in the input as a parent? Actually, the input has n-1 integers: for vertex 2, parent is p2; for vertex 3, parent is p3, etc.\n\nThe current code in `solve`:\n  - It iterates over the list `a` (which are the parent indices for vertices 2 to n) and counts the frequency of each parent. This gives the number of direct children for each node? But note: the root (1) might not appear in the list if it has no children? Actually, the root will appear as the parent of some nodes.\n\nBut note: the root has no parent, so the root is not in the list of `a`? However, the root might be a parent of some nodes. So the counter counts the frequency of each parent index. Then we get the list `count` of the frequencies (which are the number of children for each node that has at least one child).\n\nHowever, note that the root must be considered. The root is vertex 1 and it is the only node without a parent. The problem states that the tree has n vertices and the root is 1.\n\nBut the current code does not account for the root having children? Actually, it does: the root will be in the list `a` if it is the parent of any vertex. For example, if vertex 2 has parent 1, then 1 will be in `a`.\n\nBut note: the root itself is not represented in the list of parents? The list `a` has the parents for vertices 2 to n. So the root (1) might appear multiple times.\n\nHowever, the current approach is to count the frequency of each parent. Then we get a list `count` of the frequencies (the number of children for each node that is a parent). But note: the root is included? Yes.\n\nBut what about nodes that are leaves? They don't appear as parents, so they are not in the counter. That's okay because we are only concerned with the nodes that have children.\n\nThe current code then:\n  - Sorts the `count` list (which is the list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? Actually, note: the counter counts every occurrence of a parent. So if a node appears 3 times as a parent, it has 3 children.\n\nThen, for each index i in the sorted list, it does:\n   count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\nWhat does this do? And then we do a binary search on a variable `k`? \n\nActually, the problem is known and there is a known solution:\n\nThe known solution for this problem (from similar problems in Codeforces) is:\n\n  Steps:\n  1. We note that initially, we must inject the root (or we can start by injecting the root? Actually, the problem says we can choose any healthy vertex for injection. We can start by injecting the root at second 0? But note: the process starts at second 1? Actually, the problem says \"each second\" we do two operations: spreading then injection.\n\n  However, note: the problem states that initially all are healthy. Then we start at second 1.\n\n  Known approach:\n  - We can model the infection as starting at the root (by an injection at second 0? but then we haven't started the seconds). Alternatively, we can think:\n\n  We start with an injection at the root at time 0? Then at time 1, we can do spreading and then an injection.\n\n  Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Tree Infection\" (Codeforces Round #781) is:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict\n      import sys\n\n      t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n          parents = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n          children = [0] * (n+1)\n          for p in parents:\n              children[p] += 1\n\n          # The root (1) is included? The parents list has the parents of vertices 2..n, so the root (1) might be in the list? \n          # But note: the root is vertex 1, and it is the parent of some nodes? So we have children[1] = number of direct children of root.\n\n          # We also note that the root must be infected. We start by infecting the root? That would be an injection at time 0? \n          # Actually, the problem says we can choose any healthy vertex for injection. We can choose the root at the first injection.\n\n          # We are going to consider the nodes that have children. We have a list of the counts of children for each node that has at least one child? \n          # But note: the root is included.\n\n          # We also note that the infection spreads: \n          #   - Initially, we have the root infected (if we inject it at time 0? but the problem says the process repeats each second, so the first injection is at second 1?).\n\n          # Actually, the problem says: \n          #   Each second: \n          #      Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, then we can infect at most one additional child (of our choice).\n          #      Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\n          # We are free to choose the order.\n\n          # Known solution:\n          #   Step 1: We collect the children counts for each node that has children. We also note that the root must be infected first? \n          #   Actually, we can start by injecting the root at second 1? Then at second 1, after the injection, the root is infected. Then at second 2, we can do spreading: for the root, we can spread to one of its children? and then we can inject another node.\n\n          # The known solution in many submissions is:\n\n          #   children = [0]*(n+1)\n          #   for i in range(2, n+1):\n          #       children[parent[i]] += 1\n\n          #   # We also note that the root has no parent, so we start by having the root as infected? \n          #   # We create a list of the children counts for nodes that have at least one child? and then we add the root? Actually, the root is included.\n\n          #   # We are going to consider that for each node with children, we need to infect its children. The infection of the children can be done by:\n          #   #   - Injection: we can inject one child at a time (but that would be slow)\n          #   #   - Spreading: once one child is infected, then in the next second we can spread to one more child (if we have multiple children, we can spread one per second per node).\n\n          #   # The known solution is to use a greedy and binary search.\n\n          #   # Steps:\n          #   #   Let f(x) be the number of nodes that we can infect by spreading by time x? \n          #   #   Actually, we can simulate the time.\n\n          #   # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          #   #   We start at time 0: we have 0 infected.\n          #   #   At time 1: we inject the root -> infected: 1.\n\n          #   #   Then we have a list of nodes that have children. For each node, the infection of its children: \n          #   #      We can inject one child at a time, and then use spreading for the rest? \n\n          #   # Actually, the known solution:\n\n          #   #   Step 1: We have an array \"arr\" of the children counts for each node that has children. But note: the root is included? and also, we must account for the fact that the root is infected at time 1? \n\n          #   #   Then we do:\n\n          #   arr = [children[i] for i in range(1, n+1) if children[i] > 0]\n          #   arr.sort(reverse=True)\n\n          #   # Then we note that we can also inject the nodes? \n\n          #   # Actually, we can consider that the infection of the children of a node v: \n          #   #   - The first child must be infected by injection (or by spreading from the parent? but note: the parent is infected, so once the parent is infected, then in the next spreading phase we can spread to one child? but then we can also use injection for other children?).\n\n          #   # However, the known solution from the sample code:\n\n          #   #   We start by having an array of the children counts. Then we do:\n\n          #   #   time = 0\n          #   #   We have a priority queue? \n\n          #   # But note the constraints: the total n over test cases is 200,000.\n\n          #   # Another known solution:\n\n          #   #   Let f(t) be the number of nodes that we can infect by time t. \n          #   #   We can use binary search on t.\n\n          #   # However, the provided code in program2.py already has a structure:\n\n          #   #   counter = defaultdict(int)\n          #   #   for ai in a: counter[ai] += 1   -> this counts the frequency of each parent (which is the number of children for that parent)\n\n          #   #   Then we get a list `count` of the values (the children counts) and sort it.\n\n          #   #   Then for i in range(len(count)):\n          #   #       count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          #   #   Then we set L=0, R = max(count) and then do binary search on k? \n\n          #   #   Then the answer is num_level + 1 + R? \n\n          #   # This is not standard. \n\n  After checking known problems (like Codeforces Round #781, Problem C), the known solution is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          deg = [0] * (n+1)\n          for i in range(2, n+1):\n              deg[p[i-2]] += 1   # because the list p has the parent of vertex 2 at index0, vertex3 at index1, ... vertex n at index n-2.\n\n          # Now, we have deg[i] = number of children of i?

At time 0, we have 0 infected.\n          #   #   At time 1: we inject the root -> infected: 1.\n\n          #   #   Then, for a node v that has deg[v] children, we can assign:\n          #   #      We can use injections for some of the children? and then the rest by spreading? \n\n          #   #   But note: the spreading for node v can only start after at least one child of v is infected (by injection or by spreading from a deeper node? but note: the infection goes from the root downward?).\n\n          #   #   Actually, the infection can be done in any order? \n\n          #   # Known solution:\n\n          #   #   We start by having the root infected at time 0? (if we allow time 0 for the first injection) but the problem says the process starts at second 1.\n\n          #   #   Instead, we consider:\n\n          #   #   Let f(t) = the maximum number of nodes that can be infected by time t.\n\n          #   #   Alternatively, we can use a greedy: \n\n          #   #   Step 1: We note that we must inject the root at time 1. Then we have the root infected.\n\n          #   #   Then, for each node, we have a \"waiting\" time until we can start spreading? \n\n          #   #   Actually, we can simulate:\n\n          #   #   We have an array \"rem\" for each node: the number of children that are not yet infected? \n\n          #   #   But note: the problem is solved by:\n\n          #   #       arr = [0]*(n+1)\n          #   #       for i in range(1, n+1):\n          #   #           arr[i] = deg[i]\n          #   #       arr[0] = 1   # because we start by infecting the root? \n\n          #   #       Then we sort arr in descending order.\n\n          #   #       Then we let time = 0\n          #   #       Then we use a priority queue: we want to simulate the time when each node can start spreading? \n\n          #   #   Actually, a known solution:\n\n          #   #       # We have an array of the children counts, and we also account for the root as a node that we infected at time 0? \n          #   #       arr = [1]   # because we start by infecting the root at time 0? \n          #   #       for i in range(1, n+1):\n          #   #           if deg[i] > 0:\n          #   #               arr.append(deg[i])\n          #   #       arr.sort(reverse=True)\n\n          #   #       # Then we do:\n          #   #       t = 0\n          #   #       # We have a heap? \n          #   #       # Instead, we can do: \n          #   #       #   We consider that for each node, the time when it becomes infected is important.\n\n          #   #   Another known solution from a submission:\n\n          #   #       from collections import deque\n          #   #       deg = [0]*(n+1)\n          #   #       for i in parents: deg[i] += 1\n          #   #       deg = sorted(deg, reverse=True)\n          #   #       # Then we do:\n          #   #       ans = 0\n          #   #       q = deque()\n          #   #       for i in range(n+1):\n          #   #           if deg[i] > 0:\n          #   #               q.append(deg[i])\n          #   #       # Then we start with time = 0, and we have the root infected? \n          #   #       # Actually, we start by infecting the root at time 0? \n          #   #       time = 0\n          #   #       while q:\n          #   #           time += 1\n          #   #           new_q = deque()\n          #   #           while q:\n          #   #               x = q.popleft()\n          #   #               if x-1 > 0:\n          #   #                   new_q.append(x-1)\n          #   #           # Then we also do injection? \n          #   #           # This doesn't seem to match.\n\n          #   #   Actually, the known solution that matches the structure of the provided code is:\n\n          #   #       We have:\n          #   #         counter = defaultdict(int)\n          #   #         for parent in the list: counter[parent] += 1   -> this gives the children count for each parent.\n\n          #   #         Then we have a list `a` = list(counter.values())\n          #   #         a.sort()\n          #   #         # Then we do:\n          #   #         for i in range(len(a)):\n          #   #             a[i] = a[i] - i - 1   # ? \n\n          #   #   But the provided code does: \n          #   #         for i in range(num_level):\n          #   #             count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          #   #   Why -2? \n\n  After re\u2010examining the provided code in program2.py, it has:\n\n      counter = defaultdict(int)\n      for ai in a:   # a is the list of parents (for vertices 2 to n)\n          counter[ai] += 1\n\n      count = list(counter.values())\n      num_level = len(count)   # number of nodes that have at least one child? \n      count.sort()   # sorts in increasing order? \n\n      for i in range(num_level):\n          count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n      Then we set L=0, R = max(count) and then do binary search on k? \n\n      Then we have a function check(k) that does:\n          b = count.copy()\n          for i in range(len(b)):\n              b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n          if sum(b) <= k:\n              return True\n          return False\n\n      Then we do binary search for the minimal k such that check(k) is True.\n\n      Then the answer is: num_level + 1 + R   (where R is the minimal k found)\n\n  Why?\n\n  Explanation:\n\n  We start by noting that the root is infected at time 0? But the problem says we start with all healthy.\n\n  Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Tree Infection\" is:\n\n      Step 1: We have an array `freq` for the children counts for each parent.\n\n      Step 2: We note that we must also account for the root. The root is not in the list of parents? Actually, the root is vertex 1 and it is the parent of some nodes, so it is in the list? \n\n      But note: the provided code does not explicitly add the root. The list `a` contains the parents of vertices 2 to n, so the root (1) will appear if it has children.\n\n      However, what about the root itself? The root must be infected. How is that accounted for?\n\n      The known solution from a known submission:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              cnt = [0] * (n+1)\n              for i in p:\n                  cnt[i] += 1\n              cnt = sorted([x for x in cnt if x > 0], reverse=True)\n\n              # Now, we have the children counts for nodes that have children.\n\n              # We also note that we start by infecting the root? \n              # We create an array `time` for each node: the time when it becomes infected.\n\n              # Instead, we do:\n\n              #   Let T = 0. We start by having the root infected at time 0? but the problem says we start at time 1.\n\n              #   Actually, we can consider that we have an initial set of infected nodes: we start by injecting the root at time 1.\n\n              #   Then, for a node with c children, we can infect its children by:\n              #       - We can inject some children (one per second) and then use spreading (one per second per node) for the rest.\n\n              #   But note: the spreading can only start after the node is infected and at least one child is infected.\n\n              #   The known solution:\n\n              #       # We have an array `arr` of the children counts, and we also account for the root as being infected at time 0? \n              #       # We do:\n\n              #       arr = [1]   # because we start by infecting the root at time 0? \n              #       for x in cnt:\n              #           arr.append(x)\n\n              #       arr.sort(reverse=True)\n\n              #       # Then we do a binary search on the total time.\n\n              #   Alternatively, a known solution without binary search:\n\n              #       # We simulate backwards: \n              #       #   Let ans = 0\n              #       #   We have a list of events: for each node, the time when it becomes infected and then the time when it can start spreading.\n\n              #   But the provided code uses binary search.\n\n  However, the provided code in program2.py does not account for the root being infected? \n\n  Let me read the code again:\n\n      for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n          counter.clear()\n          res = solve(a.split())\n\n      The input is read: the first line is t, then for each test case, the first line is n, the second line is the list of n-1 parents.\n\n      In the function solve(a): \n          a is the list of strings (the parents for vertices 2 to n)\n\n      Then we count the frequency of each parent.\n\n      Then we get a list `count` of the frequencies (the number of children for each parent that appears).\n\n      Then we set `num_level = len(count)`: this is the number of nodes that have at least one child.\n\n      Then we sort `count` (in increasing order? because sort() without reverse).\n\n      Then we do: for i in range(num_level):\n          count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n      Why i-2? \n\n      Example: \n          Suppose we have a tree with root (1) and two children: [1, 1] for vertices 2 and 3.\n          Then counter[1] = 2, so count = [2]\n          Then for i=0: count[0] = max(2 - 0 - 2, 0) = 0.\n\n      Then L=0, R = max(count)=0 -> then if R==0, we return num_level+1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n      But what is the minimal seconds for this tree?\n          n=3: \n          Time 1: inject the root -> infected: {1}\n          Time 2: \n                Spreading: for the root, it has two children. Since one child is not infected (none is infected) -> we cannot spread? \n                Then we do injection: we can inject one child, say vertex2 -> infected: {1,2}\n          Time 3:\n                Spreading: for the root, now one child (vertex2) is infected, so we can spread to vertex3.\n                Then we don't need an injection? -> infected: {1,2,3}\n          So total time = 3.\n\n      But the code returns 2? \n\n      So there is a mistake.\n\n  After checking known solutions for \"Tree Infection\", a known solution is:\n\n      import sys\n      from collections import defaultdict\n\n      input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          children = [0] * (n+1)\n          for x in a:\n              if x <= n:\n                  children[x] += 1\n\n          # We also include the root? \n          children[1] += 1   # because the root is vertex1, and it is not in the list a? but the list a has the parents of vertices 2..n, so the root might appear? \n\n          # Actually, we want to count the number of children for each node. The root might appear in the list a? \n          # But the root is 1, and if a vertex has parent 1, then 1 is in the list a.\n\n          # So we don't need to add 1 for the root? \n\n          # But note: the root itself is a node that we must infect. How do we account for it?\n\n          # We create an array of the children counts for each node that has children? \n          # But we also note that every node (except the leaves) will have a positive children count.\n\n          # The known solution:\n\n          #   arr = sorted(children[1:], reverse=True)\n          #   # Then we remove zeros?\n          #   arr = [x for x in arr if x>0]\n\n          #   # Then we do:\n          #   #   Let t = 0\n          #   #   We have a list of events: for each node, the time when it becomes available for spreading.\n\n          #   # Instead, we do:\n\n          #   #   We start by infecting the root at time 1.\n          #   #   Then, for a node with c children, we can infect its children in at least c seconds? \n\n          #   #   But we can also use injections for other nodes.\n\n          #   #   The known solution from a submission:\n\n          #   #       ans = 0\n          #   #       q = []\n          #   #       for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          #   #           if x>0:\n          #   #               heapq.heappush(q, - (x + i + 1))   # why?\n\n          #   #       t = 0\n          #   #       while q:\n          #   #           v = -heapq.heappop(q)\n          #   #           if v > t:\n          #   #               # we need to inject until v is reduced?\n          #   #               heapq.heappush(q, - (v-1))\n          #   #               t += 1\n\n          #   #       ans = t\n\n          #   #   This is not matching.\n\n  Another known solution from an editorial:\n\n      Let's denote by $a_i$ the number of children of node $i$. We also include the root.\n\n      We start by infecting the root at time 1.\n\n      Then, we can consider that for a node $i$, the infection of its children will require at least $a_i$ seconds? but we can do spreading.\n\n      The minimal time is at least the number of nodes that have children (because we must inject at least one child for each node to start the spreading) and then the remaining children can be spread.\n\n      But note: we can also use injections for any node.\n\n      The editorial solution:\n\n          We let $f(t)$ be the number of nodes that can be infected by time $t$.\n\n          We start at time 0: 0 infected.\n          At time 1: we inject the root -> infected count=1.\n\n          Then, for each node $i$ with $a_i$ children, we can infect its children by:\n             - We must have at least one child infected (by injection) to start the spreading for that node.\n             - Then, after that, we can infect one child per second by spreading.\n\n          So the time to infect all children of node $i$ is: \n             Let $t_i$ be the time when we inject the first child of node $i$. Then the last child will be infected at time $t_i + a_i$.\n\n          But note: we can inject only one node per second (globally). \n\n          So the problem reduces to: \n             We have several tasks (one for each node i). For task i, we choose a time $t_i$ (when we inject one of its children) and then the last child is infected at $t_i + a_i$. We want to minimize the overall time when the entire tree is infected.\n\n          We also note that we can inject the first child of node i at any time (as long as by that time the node i is already infected).\n\n          Since the node i is infected at some time (which is at most the time when we inject it, or earlier if it is the root), and the root is infected at time 1, then for a non-root node i, we must have its parent infected before it can be considered for injection? \n\n          Actually, the infection of a node i (non-root) can be done by injection at any time, but then the parent must be infected before we can spread to its siblings? \n\n          This is complex.\n\n  After reading a known submission (from a high-rated user) for the problem \"C. Tree Infection\", we see:\n\n      t = int(input())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input())\n          p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          cnt = [0] * (n+1)\n          for i in p:\n              cnt[i] += 1\n          cnt = [x for x in cnt if x > 0]\n          cnt.sort(reverse=True)\n\n          # We also need to account for the root being infected? \n          # We inject the root at time 0? \n          # Instead, we do:\n          #   Let ans = 0\n          #   We have a list of events: for each group (node), the time when the group is finished.\n\n          #   We start by having the root infected at time 0? \n          #   Then for a group with size s, we can inject one at time t0, and then the spreading will do one per second, so the last one will be at t0 + s.\n\n          #   But we can inject only one per second.\n\n          #   We can use a greedy: \n          #       We inject the largest groups first.\n\n          #   Specifically, we do:\n\n          #       time = 0\n          #       heap = []\n          #       for s in cnt:\n          #           # We can inject the first in this group at time 'time', and then the last will be at time + s\n          #           # But we can also do spreading in parallel.\n          #           # Instead, we push the current finish time for the group: time + s\n          #           heapq.heappush(heap, -(time + s))\n          #           time += 1\n\n          #       # But then we also have the spreading in other groups happening in parallel? \n\n          #   This is not enough.\n\n          #   Known submission:\n\n          #       t = int(input())\n          #       for _ in range(t):\n          #           n = int(input())\n          #           a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          #           cnt = [0]*(n+2)\n          #           for x in a:\n          #               cnt[x] += 1\n          #           cnt = [x for x in cnt if x > 0]\n          #           cnt.sort(reverse=True)\n          #           k = len(cnt)\n          #           # We want to find the minimal T such that we can finish within T seconds.\n          #           # We have two types of actions: injections and spreadings.\n          #           # We start at time 0.\n          #           # At time 0, we inject the root? -> then at time 0+1, the root is infected.\n          #           # Actually, we inject the root at time 0, so it becomes infected at time 0? \n          #           # But the process: \n          #           #   Each second: spreading then injection.\n          #           #   So at time 1: \n          #           #       spreading: for the root (infected at time 0) -> we can spread to one child.\n          #           #       injection: we can inject one more node.\n\n          #           # Let f(T) = the number of injections we have done by time T is T (one per second) and the number of spreadings is also T (one per second per node that has at least one child infected).\n\n          #           # For a group i with size s_i, the number of spreadings it gets is T - t_i, where t_i is the time when the first child in the group is injected (and the node is infected) -> then we can spread to the remaining s_i - 1 - (T - t_i) ? \n\n          #           # Actually, the condition for group i: \n          #           #   We inject one child at time t_i (which is >= the time when the node i is infected) and then we can spread to at most T - t_i - 1 children? (because the spreading in the second after the injection)\n\n          #           # So the total infected in group i: 1 (injected) + min(s_i - 1, T - t_i) >= s_i\n\n          #           # Also, the node i itself must be infected by time t_i - 1? \n\n          #           # This is complex.\n\n          #   A known solution that passed:\n\n          #       def solve():\n          #           n = int(input().strip())\n          #           arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          #           count = [0] * (n+1)\n          #           for a in arr:\n          #               count[a] += 1\n          #           count = sorted([x for x in count if x > 0], reverse=True)\n          #           # include the root? the root is node 1, and it is not in the list arr? \n          #           # But the list arr has the parents of vertices 2..n, so the parent of vertex2 might be 1, so count[1] might be at least 1.\n\n          #           # We also need to infect the non-leaf nodes themselves? \n          #           # We have to infect all nodes. The count array only has the children counts.\n\n          #           # We create an array of events for the groups.\n\n          #           # Let ans = 0\n          #           # We simulate the time in two parts: \n          #           #   Part1: we inject one node in each group. This takes len(count) seconds.\n          #           #   Part2: then we have to infect the remaining children by spreading.\n\n          #           # But note: the spreading can happen in parallel for different groups.\n\n          #           # Specifically, after we inject the first node in a group i at time t_i, then in the following seconds, we can spread one more node in group i per second.\n\n          #           # The spreading for group i can happen in the seconds after t_i.\n\n          #           # The number of seconds needed for group i to finish is: t_i + 1 + (s_i - 1)  [because at time t_i we inject, then at time t_i+1 we can spread one, then at time t_i+2 we can spread another, ... until we have s_i nodes] -> but this would be t_i + s_i, and the maximum over i might be the answer.\n\n          #           # But we can choose the order of injection for the first node in each group.\n\n          #           # We want to minimize the overall time = max_i (t_i + s_i)\n\n          #           # However, we also have to account for the spreading happening in the same second for multiple groups? \n\n          #           # Actually, the spreading in one second: we can spread one per group that has at least one child infected.\n\n          #           # So the spreading for group i: we can only spread one per second, but we can do spreading for multiple groups in the same second.\n\n          #           # Therefore, the spreading for group i: the number of spread actions it gets is the number of seconds from time t_i+1 to time T.\n\n          #           # So the condition for group i: \n          #           #   1 (injected) + (T - t_i) >= s_i   =>   T >= t_i + s_i - 1\n\n          #           # But also, the injections: we can only inject one per second, so the time to inject the first node in each group: we have to inject k groups (k = len(count)), so the last group will be injected at time k.\n\n          #           # Therefore, for group i, we have t_i <= k (and we can choose the order).\n\n          #           # To minimize the overall T, we can schedule the groups with larger s_i to be injected earlier.\n\n          #           # So we sort count in descending order.\n\n          #           # Then for group i (0-indexed), we inject it at time i+1 (because we start at time 1 for the first injection after the root? but wait, we haven't accounted for the root).\n\n          #           # Actually, we must infect the root first. The root is not in the groups? \n\n          #           # We must account for the root: the root is infected at time 1 (by injection at time 1).\n\n          #           # Then for the groups (the non-root nodes that have children), we inject one in each group in the following seconds.\n\n          #           # But note: the groups are for nodes that have children. The node with children might be the root or any other node.\n\n          #           # The root is already accounted for? \n\n          #           # In the count array, the root is included if it has children.\n\n          #           # So we have to infect the root and also schedule the groups.\n\n          #           # How about: \n          #           #   We have to infect the root at time 1.\n          #           #   Then the groups: we have to inject one in each group. The groups are the nodes that have children? but the root is already infected, so we don't need to inject the root again.\n\n          #           #   Actually, the groups are defined by the node's children count. The node itself might be the root or a non-root node. The node itself must be infected before its children can be spread? \n\n          #           #   For a non-root node, how is the node itself infected? \n          #           #        - It can be by injection or by spreading from its parent? \n          #           #   But note: the spreading only infects children from a parent that is infected. So to infect a non-root node, we can either inject it or wait until its parent infects it by spreading? \n\n          #           #   However, the spreading operation: \n          #           #        for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, then we can spread to at most one other child.\n          #           #   This does not infect the parent. It only infects the children.\n\n          #           #   So to infect a non-root node, we must use an injection for it, or wait until its parent infects it by spreading? -> but the spreading is only for children, not for parents.\n\n          #           #   Therefore, non-root nodes must be infected by injection.\n\n          #           #   So we have to inject every node? \n\n          #           #   But note: the root is injected. For a non-root node, we can inject it at any second.\n\n          #           #   Therefore, the groups are independent: each group (node with children) will have the node itself infected by injection (at some time) and then its children can be infected by injection (one to start) and then spreading for the rest.\n\n          #           #   So the time for group i: \n          #           #        Let t_i be the time when the node i is infected (by injection).\n          #           #        Then we inject one of its children at some time >= t_i+1.\n          #           #        Then the spreading for the children: we can spread to one child per second after the first child is infected.\n          #           #        So the last child is infected at time: t_i + 1 + (s_i - 1) = t_i + s_i.\n\n          #           #   But note: we can choose to inject the first child of node i at any time after node i is infected.\n\n          #           #   However, we can also inject the first child in the same second as we inject node i? \n          #           #        - No, because in one second we can only inject one node.\n\n          #           #   Therefore, the earliest we can inject the first child of node i is at time t_i+1.\n\n          #           #   Then the spreading for the remaining s_i-1 children will take s_i-1 seconds, so the last child is at time t_i+1 + s_i-1 = t_i + s_i.\n\n          #           #   So the condition for group i: T >= t_i + s_i.\n\n          #           #   And we have to inject the node i and also inject one of its children.\n\n          #           #   Therefore, for group i, we use two injections: one for the node itself and one for one of its children.\n\n          #           #   But wait, the node i might be the child of another node? \n\n          #           #   This is getting very complex.\n\n  Given the complexity, and that the provided code in program2.py has a specific structure, I will complete the missing part as it is, and hope that the binary search is correct.\n\n  The provided code in program2.py has a binary search and then returns `num_level + 1 + R`.\n\n  The missing part in the binary search is the else branch.\n\n  The binary search:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  In binary search, if the condition `check(mid)` is False, then we need to search in the upper half, so we set L = mid.\n\n  So the missing line is: L = mid\n\n  Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is the body of the loop. We need to read the rating and then print the division.\n\n  The rating is read by: \n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            rating = int(input().strip())\n            d = div(rating)\n            print(f\"Division {d}\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the input has t test cases, and for each test case, one integer.\n\n  So the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n        rating = int(input().strip())\n        d = div(rating)\n        print(f\"Division {d}\")\n\n  However, note that the function `div` is already defined.\n\n  But wait, the function `div` returns 1,2,3,4, and the problem requires output in the format \"Division X\".\n\n  So we can do:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            rating = int(input())\n            if rating >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif rating >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif rating >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n  But the problem says we have a helper function `div` that does exactly that.\n\n  So we can use the function.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        rating = int(input())\n        division = div(rating)\n        print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n  But note: the function `div` is defined, so we can use it.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py, the missing code is the body of the loop.\n\n  So we output:\n\n        rating = int(input())\n        d = div(rating)\n        print(f\"Division {d}\")\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n        {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  We must output in JSON.\n\n  However, the string for program1.py might be multiple lines. We can use a string with newline escapes? or just a string that spans multiple lines.\n\n  But the specification says: Output only the missing code.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop, which is three lines.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is one line: \"L = mid\"\n\n  So the JSON would be:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the indentation in program1.py: the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. The existing code has:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we need to indent the body by 4 spaces.\n\n  For program2.py, the existing code has:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the missing line should be indented by 8 spaces (because inside the else, which is inside the while loop, which is inside the function).\n\n  But the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent, so:\n\n        while ...:\n            ...   # 4 spaces\n            if ...:\n                ...   # 8 spaces\n            else:\n                ...   # 8 spaces\n\n  So the missing line should be 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that should be placed in the TODO, without the surrounding code.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is the single line: \"L = mid\", and it should be at the same indentation level as the \"R = mid\" in the if branch.\n\n  So we output \"L = mid\" for program2.py.\n\n  But note: the if branch has \"R = mid\", which is at 8 spaces of indentation (relative to the while). So the else branch should also be at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n      }\n\n  However, the program1.py might have a different indentation? The existing code has 4 spaces for the loop body.\n\n  We'll output the three lines for program1.py with 4 spaces of indentation each.\n\n  But note: the existing line in program1.py has:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at 4 spaces. So the body we put should be at 4 spaces.\n\n  So the three lines should be at 4 spaces.\n\n  But the first line is already at 4 spaces, so we output:\n\n        rating = int(input())\n        d = div(rating)\n        print(f\"Division {d}\")\n\n  with each line having 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n  Actually, in the JSON string, we will represent it as:\n\n        \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\"\n\n  This has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n  For program2.py, the existing code inside the while loop is at 4 spaces of indentation, and the if and else are at 4 spaces, and the bodies of the if and else are at 8 spaces.\n\n  So the line \"L = mid\" should be at 8 spaces. We output it as 8 spaces.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code exactly as it should appear.\n\n  However, the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with 8 spaces and then \"L = mid\".\n\n  So the missing code for program2.py is: \"            L = mid\" (12 spaces? or 8 spaces? Let me count)\n\n  The existing code in the if branch: \"R = mid\" is at 8 spaces (relative to the while). The while is at 4 spaces, then the body of the while is indented by 4 more, so 8 in total.\n\n  So the line \"R = mid\" is at 8 spaces. Similarly, the else branch should have \"L = mid\" at 8 spaces.\n\n  But the else branch is at the same level as the if, so the body of the else should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"        L = mid\" with 8 spaces? \n\n  However, the existing code in the if branch is written as:\n\n                R = mid\n\n  in the provided code, the if branch has 8 spaces? \n\n  Let me count the spaces in the provided code for program2.py:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The while loop body is indented by 4 spaces (the while is at 0, then the body is 4). Then the if and else are at 4 spaces, and the bodies of the if and else are at 8 spaces.\n\n  So the provided code has:\n\n        while ...:\n            mid = ...   # 4 spaces\n            if ...:      # 4 spaces\n                R = mid   # 8 spaces\n            else:        # 4 spaces\n                ...       # 8 spaces for the body of else\n\n  Therefore, the missing line should be 8 spaces: \"        L = mid\" (8 spaces).\n\n  But in the string, we represent it as 8 spaces.\n\n  However, the provided code in the problem statement for program2.py uses 4-space indentation consistently.\n\n  So we output for program2.py: \"        L = mid\"\n\n  But note: the existing code in the if branch is \"R = mid\", which is 8 spaces. So we match.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"        L = mid\"\n      }\n\n  However, wait: the function in program2.py is `solve`, and the binary search is inside it. The existing code has:\n\n      def solve(a):\n          ... \n          while R - L > 1:\n              mid = (R + L) // 2\n              if(check(mid)):\n                  R = mid\n              else:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The while loop is already indented by 4 spaces (because inside the function). Then the body of the while is indented by 4 more (so 8 in total). Then the if and else are at 8 spaces, and their bodies are at 12 spaces? \n\n  Let me count:\n\n      def solve(a):\n          ...   # 4 spaces for the body of solve\n          while R - L > 1:   # 4 spaces\n              mid = (R + L) // 2   # 8 spaces\n              if(check(mid)):   # 8 spaces\n                  R = mid   # 12 spaces\n              else:   # 8 spaces\n                  ...   # 12 spaces for the body of else\n\n  So the body of the else should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  But the provided code in the problem statement for program2.py has:\n\n      def solve(a):\n          for ai in a:\n              counter[ai] += 1\n          count = list(counter.values())\n          num_level = len(count)\n          count.sort()\n\n          for i in range(num_level):\n              count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n          if R == 0:\n              return num_level + 1\n\n          def check(k):\n              b = count.copy()\n              for i in range(len(b)):\n                  b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n              if sum(b) <= k:\n                  return True\n              return False\n\n          while R - L > 1:\n              mid = (R + L) // 2\n              if(check(mid)):\n                  R = mid\n              else:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          return num_level + 1 + R\n\n  The while loop is at 4 spaces, then the body of the while is at 8 spaces (mid = ...), then the if and else are at 8 spaces, and the bodies of the if and else should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  So the existing line \"R = mid\" in the if branch is at 12 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py should be at 12 spaces: \"            L = mid\" (12 spaces).\n\n  How many spaces? 12.\n\n  So we output for program2.py: \"            L = mid\" (which is 12 spaces).\n\n  But note: the existing code in the if branch is written as:\n\n                  R = mid\n\n  which is 12 spaces (because 3 indents: function -> while -> if).\n\n  So the else branch should be:\n\n                  L = mid\n\n  Therefore, the JSON becomes:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    d = div(rating)\\n    print(f\\\"Division {d}\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n      }\n\n  But note: in the program1.py, the for loop is at the top level, so the body should be at 4 spaces.\n\n  We are confident.\n\n  Let's write the JSON."
