But note: the example in the problem statement for the doll problem has: Input: \n            n = 1\n            a0 = 2, a1 = 1. The expected answer is 5.\n\n   How to get 5?\n\n   Let me try: \n        We need to compute:\n            C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n            C(1+1,1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n            total=3. What if we do not break at a[i]==0? But the problem says: for i>n, a_i=0, so we break at the first zero? Actually, the condition in the known solution breaks at a[i]==0.\n\n   Alternatively, the formula might be:\n\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n+1): if a[i] > 0:\n                ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i)) % MOD   # note: i instead of i+1\n\n        Then: \n            i=0: C(2,0)=1\n            i=1: C(2,1)=2 -> total=3 -> still not 5. Or:\n\n        for i in range(n+1):\n            ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i)) % MOD\n\n        Then: \n            i=0: C(2,0)=1\n            i=1: C(1+1,1)=C(2,1)=2 -> total=3. Or:\n\n        for i in range(n+1):\n            ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i+1, i+1)) % MOD\n\n        Then: \n            i=0: C(3,1)=3\n            i=1: C(3,2)=3 -> total=6. Or:\n\n        for i in range(n+1):\n            ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i+1)) % MOD   # as before -> 3. But note: the example in the note has 5 operations. After reading the sample explanation: \n        The state transitions:\n\n        Step0: (0,0):1\n        Step1: remove (0,0) -> (0,1) and (1,0) -> state: (0,1):1, (1,0):1. Step2: remove (0,1) -> (0,2) and (1,1) -> state: (1,0):1, (0,2):1, (1,1):1.\n        Step3: remove (1,0) -> (1,1) and (2,0) -> state: (0,2):1, (1,1):2, (2,0):1.\n        Step4: remove (1,1) -> (1,2) and (2,1) -> state: (0,2):1, (1,1):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):1, (2,1):1.\n        Step5: remove (1,1) -> (1,2) and (2,1) -> state: (0,2):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,1):2.\n\n        Now check white cells:\n          (0,0):0 -> ok (but note: initially (0,0) is white, but now has 0)\n          (0,1):0 -> ok\n          (1,0):0 -> ok\n          (1,1):0 -> ok? but wait, (1,1) is black because a1=1 -> only y<1, so y=0 is white, y=1 is black. So (1,1) is black and we don't care. Similarly, (0,2) is black, (2,0) is black (because row2: a2=0, so no white in row2) and (1,2) and (2,1) are black. So after 5 operations, all white cells have 0 dolls.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given the first line as n (the last index of the given sequence) and then a list of n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an (and for i>n, a_i=0).\n The problem is about counting the minimum number of operations to remove all dolls from white cells. The grid is defined by the non-increasing sequence a: \n   cell (x, y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise.\n\n Initially, there is one doll at (0,0). The operation: remove a doll at (x,y) and place one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y).\n\n The key insight is to use generating functions and combinatorial identities. The known solution in the note uses:\n   ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i + i, i+1)\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: n=1, a = [2,1] \n   Then the answer is 5.\n\n Let's compute with the formula: \n   i=0: C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1) = 2\n   i=1: C(1+1, 1+1) = C(2,2) = 1\n   total = 3, but expected is 5.\n\n So the formula in the code is: \n   ans = sum_{i} C(a_i + i, i+1)\n\n But that gives 3 for the example, which is not 5.\n\n Alternatively, note that the example in the note has 5 operations.\n\n After reading known similar problems (like CodeForces 1606E), we know that the problem is similar to \"Ayoub and Lost Array\" and others.\n\n Actually, the known solution for this problem (from known submissions) is:\n\n   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n   using namespace std;\n   typedef long long ll;\n   const int N = 400000;\n   const int MOD = 1e9+7;\n   ll fact[N+5], invf[N+5];\n\n   ll C(int n, int k) {\n        if (k < 0 || k > n) return 0;\n        return fact[n] * invf[k] % MOD * invf[n-k] % MOD;\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n        fact[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD;\n        invf[N] = pow(fact[N], MOD-2, MOD); // but note: in C++ we use modular exponentiation\n        // ... actually, we precompute invf for all from 0 to N.\n\n        int n; cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(n+1);\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n\n        ll ans = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] == 0) break;\n            ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i+1)) % MOD;\n        }\n        cout << ans << endl;\n   }\n\n But wait, the example: \n   n=1, a = [2,1]\n   i=0: C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n   i=1: C(1+1,1+1)=C(2,2)=1 -> total=3, but expected 5.\n\n So what's the issue?\n\n Actually, the known problem is \"CF1605D - Treelabeling\" but that's not it.\n\n After rethinking: \n\n The problem is known as \"Jina the Doll\" and the solution is:\n\n   ans = 0\n   for i in range(n+1):\n        if a[i] > 0:\n            ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i+1)) % MOD\n        else:\n            break\n\n But the example in the note: \n   Input: \n        1\n        2 1\n\n   Then the code would compute:\n        i=0: a[0]=2 -> C(2+0, 1) = C(2,1)=2\n        i=1: a[1]=1 -> C(1+1,2)=C(2,2)=1\n        total=3, but expected 5.\n\n So the formula must be different.\n\n Alternatively, note that the example in the note has 5 operations. How do we get 5?\n\n Another known solution from CodeForces for the same problem (problem name: ???) is:\n\n   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n   using namespace std;\n   const int mod = 1e9+7;\n   const int maxn = 400010;\n   int fac[maxn], inv[maxn];\n   int C(int n, int k) {\n        if (k < 0 || k > n) return 0;\n        return 1LL * fac[n] * inv[k] % mod * inv[n-k] % mod;\n   }\n   int main() {\n        fac[0] = 1;\n        for (int i=1; i<maxn; i++) fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n        inv[maxn-1] = pow(fac[maxn-1], mod-2, mod); // but we need to compute all inv\n        // ... actually, we compute inv for all from maxn-1 down to 0.\n\n        int n; cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(n+1);\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n\n        long long ans = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] == 0) break;\n            ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n        }\n        cout << ans << endl;\n        return 0;\n   }\n\n But again, that gives 3 for the example.\n\n After reading the note: \n   The example has 5 operations. How do we get 5?\n\n Let me try with the formula: \n   We are to compute the sum for i from 0 to n of C(a_i + i, i+1) but that gives 3.\n\n However, note that the example input is:\n        t = 1\n        n = 1\n        a0 = 2, a1 = 1.\n\n But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 10^5. And the example has one test case.\n\n The known solution for the problem (from known submissions in CodeForces) for problem \"D: Jina the Doll\" is:\n\n   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n   using namespace std;\n   const int N = 400000;\n   const int mod = 1e9+7;\n   int fac[N+10], invfac[N+10];\n   int C(int n, int m) {\n        if (m < 0 || m > n) return 0;\n        return 1LL * fac[n] * invfac[m] % mod * invfac[n-m] % mod;\n   }\n   int main() {\n        fac[0] = 1;\n        for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n        invfac[N] = ... // compute inverse for fac[N] and then backwards\n\n        int n; cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(n+1);\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\n        long long ans = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] == 0) break;\n            ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n        }\n        printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n   }\n\n But that gives 3 for the example.\n\n However, I recall that the example in the note has 5 operations. \n\n Let me reexamine the example: \n   The grid: \n        row0: a0=2 -> white for y=0 and y=1 (so (0,0) and (0,1) are white, (0,2) and beyond are black)\n        row1: a1=1 -> white for y=0 only (so (1,0) is white, (1,1) and beyond are black)\n\n   The initial state: (0,0) has one doll.\n\n   The operations are described as 5 steps.\n\n How does the combinatorial formula relate?\n\n There is a known combinatorial interpretation: \n   Each operation can be seen as a path in the grid. The generating function approach: \n        The number of ways to get a doll to (x,y) is C(x+y, x) (if we start at (0,0) and each operation splits a doll at (x,y) into (x+1,y) and (x,y+1)).\n\n   But we want to remove dolls from white cells. The goal is to have 0 dolls in every white cell.\n\n   The key is to use the inclusion-exclusion or a generating function that counts the \"excess\" that must be removed.\n\n   Actually, the known solution for the problem (from CodeForces submissions) is:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        #define ll long long\n        const int N = 400000;\n        const int mod = 1e9+7;\n\n        ll fac[N+5], inv[N+5];\n        ll power(ll a, ll b) {\n            ... // fast exponentiation\n        }\n\n        ll nCr(ll n, ll r) {\n            if (r < 0 || r > n) return 0;\n            return fac[n] * inv[r] % mod * inv[n-r] % mod;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            fac[0] = 1;\n            for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) fac[i] = fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n            inv[N] = power(fac[N], mod-2, mod);\n            for (int i=N-1; i>=0; i--) inv[i] = inv[i+1] * (i+1) % mod;\n\n            int n; cin >> n;\n            vector<int> a;\n            for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                int x; cin >> x;\n                a.push_back(x);\n            }\n\n            ll ans = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                ans = (ans + nCr(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n            }\n            cout << ans << endl;\n        }\n\n   But again, 3 for [2,1].\n\n   However, note that the example in the problem statement has 5 operations.\n\n   After reading the note: \n        \"For the first test case the pairs ...\" -> that note is for a different problem? \n\n   Actually, the problem statement says: \n        \"Given n strings, each of length 2, ...\" \n\n   But the code we are completing is for the doll problem.\n\n   The problem statement for the doll problem: \n        \"Description: ...\"\n\n   And the example: \n        Input: \n            t (number of test cases) \n            then for each test case: \n                n \n                then n strings of length 2.\n\n   But wait, the code we are given for program1.py is:\n\n        N = 4 * 10**5 + 5\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n        fact = [1]\n        invf = [1]\n\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            fact.append(fact[i-1] * i % MOD)\n            invf.append(pow(fact[-1], MOD-2, MOD))   # This line is incorrect: we are appending the inverse of the last fact, but we need the inverse for all factorials.\n\n        def C(m, n):\n            if n < 0 or m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        ans = sum(C(v+i, i+1) for i, v in enumerate(a)) % MOD\n        print(ans)\n\n   The issue: \n        The combinatorial formula as written does not yield 5 for [2,1]. \n\n   But note: the example in the problem statement for the doll problem has:\n        Input: \n            n = 1\n            a0 = 2, a1 = 1.\n\n        The expected answer is 5.\n\n   How to get 5?\n\n   Let me try: \n        We need to compute:\n            C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n            C(1+1,1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n            total=3.\n\n   What if we do not break at a[i]==0? \n        But the problem says: for i>n, a_i=0, so we break at the first zero?

Similarly, (0,2) is black, (2,0) is black (because row2: a2=0, so no white in row2) and (1,2) and (2,1) are black.\n\n        So after 5 operations, all white cells have 0 dolls.\n\n        How does the combinatorial formula account for 5?\n\n   Insight: \n        The total number of operations is the total number of dolls ever created minus one (because we start with one and each operation adds one doll: remove one and add two -> net +1). \n        But we end with 4 dolls? (0,2):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,1):2 -> total 6 dolls? \n\n        Actually, we start with 1, then after k operations we have 1+k dolls? \n          Operation 1: 1->2\n          Operation 2: 2->3\n          Operation 3: 3->4\n          Operation 4: 4->5\n          Operation 5: 5->6\n\n        So we have 6 dolls at the end. But we only care about white cells. The white cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and they have 0 dolls. The rest are black and can have any number.\n\n        The generating function: \n          The number of ways to have a doll at (x,y) after k operations is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in the grid of moves (each move: (x,y) -> (x+1,y) and (x,y+1)), and the doll is created at step (x+y) and then propagated? \n\n        Actually, the doll at (x,y) must have been created by exactly (x+y) operations from the initial doll at (0,0). And the number of distinct paths from (0,0) to (x,y) is C(x+y, x). But note, we are not counting distinct paths for one doll, because the process branches.\n\n        However, the entire process is a binary tree of operations. Each operation on a doll at (x,y) produces two children: one at (x+1,y) and one at (x,y+1). The total number of dolls at (x,y) is the number of paths from the root (0,0) to (x,y) in this tree.\n\n        And the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) is C(x+y, x). \n\n        Therefore, the total number of dolls that ever passed through (x,y) is the number of times we had to have a doll at (x,y) to do an operation? But we are counting the final state? \n\n        Actually, the final state has dolls at every black cell that is reachable? \n\n        But note: we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily. The goal is to have 0 dolls in every white cell. \n\n        The minimal number of operations is the total number of dolls that ever appeared in a white cell (because we have to remove them from the white cell by an operation). \n\n        How to count the total number of dolls that ever passed through a white cell? \n\n        However, note that the initial doll is at (0,0) which is white. Then we remove it and create two. Then we remove the doll at (0,1) (which is white) and create two, and so on.\n\n        The key is: every time a doll is on a white cell, we must eventually remove it (by an operation). And when we remove it, we create two new dolls. \n\n        Therefore, the total number of operations is the total number of times we had a doll in a white cell (except that the initial doll is already there, and then we remove it, and then the new ones might be in white cells and we remove them, etc).\n\n        But note: the initial doll is counted once. Then when we remove it, we count that operation and then we have two dolls. Then if any of those two is in a white cell, we remove it, and so on.\n\n        The total number of operations is the total number of dolls that ever were present in white cells (because each operation is triggered by one doll in a white cell).\n\n        So we need to compute: \n            S = sum_{all white cells (x,y)} (number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y))\n\n        But note: a doll might pass through multiple white cells? Actually, each doll is at one cell at a time. And when we remove it, it is replaced by two new dolls. The entire history is a tree.\n\n        However, the generating function for the total number of dolls that ever were at a white cell is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y). \n\n        But note: the same doll might appear in multiple white cells along its path? Actually, a doll moves? No, the process: \n            We start with (0,0). Then we remove (0,0) and create (0,1) and (1,0). Then we might remove (0,1) and create (0,2) and (1,1), and remove (1,0) and create (1,1) and (2,0). \n\n        Each doll is at one cell and then is removed and replaced by two. So the entire history is a tree: \n            Root: (0,0) at time0.\n            Then at time1: two children: (0,1) and (1,0).\n            Then at time2: from (0,1): (0,2) and (1,1); from (1,0): (1,1) and (2,0).\n\n        The total number of white cells visited: \n            (0,0): white -> count=1\n            (0,1): white -> count=1\n            (1,0): white -> count=1\n            (0,2): black? -> no, because a0=2 -> y<2, so y=0,1 are white, y=2 is black -> so (0,2) is black -> skip.\n            (1,1): black (because a1=1 -> y<1, so only y=0 is white) -> skip.\n            (1,1) again: black -> skip.\n            (2,0): black? -> row2: a2=0 (since we are given a0, a1, and for i>1, a_i=0) -> so no white cell in row2 -> skip.\n\n        So total white cell visits: 3. But we did 5 operations? \n\n        How do we get 5? \n\n        We must count every time a doll is placed on a white cell. \n            Operation0: we start with (0,0) -> count=1.\n            Operation1: we remove (0,0) and then we place (0,1) and (1,0). Now we have two dolls: both on white cells -> count +=2 -> 3.\n            Operation2: we remove (0,1) -> then we place (0,2) [black] and (1,1) [black]. Now we have: (1,0) [white] and the two new ones (black). Then we count the removal of (0,1) (which was placed in op1 and now removed) and the new placements? But the problem counts the operation on a white cell, and the new placements might be white or black.\n\n        However, the count of operations is 5, but the count of white cell placements is:\n            op0: (0,0) placed -> count=1\n            op1: placed (0,1) and (1,0) -> count +=2 -> 3\n            op2: we remove (0,1) (which was placed at op1) and then we place (0,2) and (1,1) -> these are black, so no additional white placements? \n            op3: we remove (1,0) (placed at op1) -> then we place (1,1) and (2,0) -> both black -> no white placements.\n            op4: we remove (1,1) (which was placed at op2) -> then we place (1,2) and (2,1) -> both black -> no white placements.\n            op5: we remove (1,1) (which was placed at op3) -> then we place (1,2) and (2,1) -> both black.\n\n        So total white placements: 3. But then why 5 operations? \n\n        The catch: the operation is counted whenever we remove a doll from a white cell. The removal happens exactly when the doll is on a white cell. So we count the removal of a doll from a white cell. How many times did we remove a doll from a white cell? \n            Operation1: remove (0,0) -> white cell -> count=1.\n            Operation2: remove (0,1) -> white cell -> count=2.\n            Operation3: remove (1,0) -> white cell -> count=3.\n            Operation4: remove (1,1) -> black cell? -> skip.\n            Operation5: remove (1,1) -> black cell -> skip.\n\n        So we have 3 removals on white cells. But the example says 5 operations. \n\n        The example says: \n            \"minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal\"\n\n        And the goal is achieved after 5 operations. \n\n        The operations are:\n            Operation1: remove (0,0) -> count=1\n            Operation2: remove (0,1) -> count=2\n            Operation3: remove (1,0) -> count=3\n            Operation4: remove (1,1) -> count=4   -> but (1,1) is black, so why remove it? \n            Operation5: remove (1,1) -> count=5\n\n        Why do we remove the black cell dolls? Because even though they are black, they might be ancestors of dolls that end up in white cells? But note the goal is only about white cells. \n\n        However, observe: after operation3, we have:\n            (0,2):1, (1,1):1 (from op2) and (1,1):1 (from op3) and (2,0):1 -> total 4 dolls.\n            The white cells: (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (1,0):0 -> already 0. \n            So why continue?\n\n        The problem says: \"all white cells contain 0 dolls\". But note that the white cells are only (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). They are already 0. So we are done at operation3? \n\n        But the example says we did 5 operations.\n\n        Let me read the sample explanation: \n            \"Now all white cells contain 0 dolls, so we have achieved the goal with 5 operations.\"\n\n        And the state after 5 operations: \n            (0,2):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,1):2.\n\n        So the white cells are indeed 0. \n\n        How did we get there? \n            We had to remove the two dolls at (1,1) even though (1,1) is black? \n\n        Why? Because the goal is: every white cell has 0 dolls. The black cells can have any number. So why remove the black cell dolls? \n\n        The catch: the problem does not require the black cells to be zero. It only requires the white cells to be zero. \n\n        Therefore, we could have stopped at operation3? \n\n        But the sample explanation says we did 5. \n\n        Re-read the sample explanation: \n            Step0: (0,0,1)\n            Step1: (1,0,1), (0,1,1)\n            Step2: (1,0,1), (1,1,1), (0,2,1)\n            Step3: (1,1,2), (0,2,1), (2,0,1)\n            Step4: (1,1,1), (0,2,1), (2,0,1), (1,2,1), (2,1,1)\n            Step5: (0,2,1), (2,0,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,2)\n\n        After step3: \n            (1,1,2) -> but (1,1) is black, so we don't care. \n            (0,2,1) -> black.\n            (2,0,1) -> black.\n\n        So white cells are: \n            (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (1,0):0 -> done.\n\n        Why step4 and step5? \n\n        The problem says: \"You can do the following operation. Select one doll on (x,y). Remove it and place a doll on (x,y+1) and a doll on (x+1,y).\"\n\n        It does not say you cannot remove a doll from a black cell. You can remove any doll. \n\n        But the goal is only about white cells. So we can leave the black cells with any number of dolls. \n\n        Therefore, we could have stopped at step3. \n\n        However, the sample says we did 5 steps. \n\n        The problem says: \"minimum number of operations\". \n\n        So the minimum is 3? \n\n        But the sample says 5. \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"Your goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls.\"\n\n        In the state after step3, the white cells contain 0 dolls. \n\n        Why then 5? \n\n        The sample explanation says: \"Now all white cells contain 0 dolls\" after step5. \n\n        But they also contain 0 at step3. \n\n        The catch: the problem might require that we never have a doll in a white cell at any time? No, the goal is the final state.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem requires that we remove every doll that ever was in a white cell? But that is not what the problem says.\n\n        The problem: \"make all white cells contain 0 dolls\" in the final state.\n\n        In the state after step3, the white cells are empty. \n\n        Therefore, the minimum number of operations is 3.\n\n        But the sample output is 5.\n\n        This indicates the combinatorial formula might be different.\n\n        After checking known problems: \n          This problem is from a CodeForces contest: CodeForces Round #FF (Div. 1) A. DZY Loves Sequences, but that's not it.\n\n        Actually, the problem is \"Jina the Doll\" and it is from a contest in CodeForces: \n          https://codeforces.com/contest/1606/problem/E\n\n        But 1606E is about heroes and damage, not dolls.\n\n        Alternatively, it might be from a different contest.\n\n        I recall a problem that matches: \n          https://codeforces.com/contest/1605/problem/D\n\n        But 1605D is about tree labeling.\n\n        Another: \n          https://codeforces.com/contest/1605/problem/E\n\n        E. Arena\n\n        The problem: \n          There are n heroes. Each hero has health. Each round, every hero does damage to every other hero. Then, we remove heroes with health<=0. Then, we can add new heroes. \n\n        Not matching.\n\n        After research, the problem is from CodeForces: \n          Problem name: Jina the Doll\n          Contest: CodeForces Round #FF (Div. 1) A, but not matching.\n\n        Alternatively, the intended solution is: \n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(len(a)):\n              if a[i] > 0:\n                  ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i)) % MOD   # but then for [2,1]: C(2,0)=1, C(1+1,1)=2 -> 3.\n\n        or \n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(len(a)):\n              if a[i] > 0:\n                  ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i+1, i+1)) % MOD   # then [2,1]: C(3,1)=3, C(2,2)=1 -> 4.\n\n        or \n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(len(a)):\n              if a[i] > 0:\n                  ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i+1)) % MOD   # 2+1=3\n\n        None gives 5.\n\n        But note: the example has n=1, but the input has two numbers: a0 and a1. So the for loop runs for i=0 and i=1.\n\n        What if we do not break at a[i]==0? \n          Then for i=0: a0=2 -> C(2+0,1)=2\n          i=1: a1=1 -> C(1+1,2)=1\n          i>=2: a_i=0 -> C(0+2,3)=0, C(0+3,4)=0, ... -> still 3.\n\n        What if the formula is: \n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(0, n+1):\n              if a[i] > 0:\n                  ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i)) % MOD\n              else:\n                  ans = (ans + C(i, a[i]+1)) % MOD   # but a[i]=0, then C(i,1) -> for i=2: C(2,1)=2, then i=3: C(3,1)=3, ... \n\n        This would be: \n          i=0: a0=2 -> C(2,0)=1\n          i=1: a1=1 -> C(2,1)=2\n          i=2: a2=0 -> C(2,1)=2 -> total=5.\n\n        So for the example: \n            n=1, but the input has a0 and a1, and then for i>=2, a_i=0. \n            We are to consider i from 0 to ... until when? \n            The problem: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 10^5, but here n=1, so we have a0 and a1.\n\n        In the code: \n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))   # a has n+1 elements.\n\n        Then we iterate i from 0 to n (inclusive) because a has indices 0..n.\n\n        And for i>n, we don't have a[i] because the list has only n+1 elements.\n\n        So in the example, we only have i=0 and i=1.\n\n        But the above formula for i=0:1, i=1:2 -> total=3.\n\n        However, if we consider i=2: a[2] is not provided. \n\n        The problem says: for i>n, a_i=0. But our list a has only n+1 elements (0..n). So we cannot access a[2] if n=1.\n\n        Therefore, we only have i in [0, n].\n\n        So for the example, i=0 and i=1.\n\n        How to get 5? \n\n        Another idea: \n          The total number of operations is the sum over i>=0 of the number of dolls that ever were at (i, a_i) or something else.\n\n        Known solution in C++ from a trusted source for the same problem (from an AC submission on CodeForces for problem \"E.

In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n        This means: \n            a0 must be at least 2 (because (0,0) and (0,1) are white) -> a0>=2.\n            a1 must be at least 2? because (1,0) and (1,1) are white -> a1>=2.\n\n        So the example input might be: \n            n=1\n            a0=2, a1=2   [because if a1=2, then (1,0) and (1,1) are white]\n\n        Then the combinatorial formula: \n            i=0: C(2+0,1)=2\n            i=1: C(2+1,2)=C(3,2)=3\n            total=5.\n\n        So the example input is: \n            1\n            2\n            2 2   ? \n\n        But the input format: \n            first integer n, then n+1 integers.\n\n        So for n=1, we have two integers: a0 and a1.\n\n        If a0=2, a1=2, then the formula gives 2+3=5.\n\n        Therefore, the example input is not [2,1] but [2,2].\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\n        But wait, the doll problem input is: \n            t (number of test cases)\n            then for each test case:\n                n\n                then a0, a1, ..., a_n   (n+1 integers)\n\n        However, the example in the note for the doll problem says: \n            \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n        which implies a0>=2 and a1>=2.\n\n        So the example input is: \n            n=1\n            a0=2, a1=2.\n\n        Then the answer is 5.\n\n        Therefore, the code we have is correct for the example [2,2].\n\n        Why then the sample input in the problem statement says \"2 1\" in the example? \n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"The first line of input contains one integer t (1<=t<=100).

\n\n        The problem for program2.py: \n            Given n strings, each of length 2, count the number of pairs (i,j) (i<j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n        Example: \n            Input: \n                3\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n            Output: 3\n\n        How to count? \n            We can group by the first letter and the second letter.\n\n        The pairs that differ in exactly one position are:\n            - differ in the first letter: then the second letter is the same.\n            - differ in the second letter: then the first letter is the same.\n\n        So we can use two dictionaries: \n            dict1: count of strings with a given first letter and any second letter? \n            dict2: count of strings with a given second letter and any first letter?\n\n        But then we might double count? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            For a string \"xy\", the pairs that differ only in the first letter: \n                all strings that have second letter 'y' and first letter not 'x' (and not 'x' but we will iterate over c != 'x').\n\n            Similarly, for the second letter: \n                all strings that have first letter 'x' and second letter not 'y'.\n\n        But note: if we do:\n\n            for each string s = \"xy\":\n                for each letter c in ak (which is from 'a' to 'k') that is not 'x':\n                    if there is any string with first letter c and second letter 'y', then we add the count of such strings.\n\n                for each letter c in ak that is not 'y':\n                    if there is any string with first letter 'x' and second letter c, then we add the count of such strings.\n\n        However, the current code does:\n\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c + s[1]] > 0:   # d is a defaultdict(int) that counts the frequency of each string of length 2\n                        # then we want to add the count of the string (c, s[1]) that we have seen so far.\n                        count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n                if c != s[1]:\n                    if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                        count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n            then we do d[s] += 1\n\n        But note: the string (c, s[1]) might appear multiple times, and we are adding the frequency.\n\n        However, this counts every occurrence of (c, s[1]) that appeared before the current string.\n\n        But then we also do the same for the second letter.\n\n        But wait, this counts for the current string s, the number of strings that are in the dictionary (already processed) that differ in the first letter (by having the same second letter and a different first letter) and also the ones that differ in the second letter (same first letter and different second letter).\n\n        However, note that a pair (i,j) is counted when we process the later string. \n\n        Example: \n            Strings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\"\n\n            Process \"ab\": \n                d is empty -> no count.\n                then d[\"ab\"] = 1.\n\n            Process \"cb\":\n                For the first part: \n                    c in ak: \n                        c!='c' -> skip for the first if? \n                        Actually, s=\"cb\", so s[0]='c'. \n                        for c in ak: \n                            if c != 'c': \n                                then check d[c+'b'] -> for c='a': d[\"ab\"]=1 -> count +=1\n                                for c='b' to 'k' (except 'c'): no \"ab\" is only one, and we don't have others.\n                For the second part:\n                    if c != 'b': \n                        then check d[\"c\" + c] -> for c='a': d[\"ca\"]=0, ... -> no count.\n                Then d[\"cb\"] = 1.\n\n                count=1.\n\n            Process \"db\":\n                First part: \n                    c != 'd': \n                        c='a': d[\"ab\"]=1 -> count +=1\n                        c='b': d[\"bb\"]=0\n                        c='c': d[\"cb\"]=1 -> count +=1\n                        ... \n                count becomes 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n                Then d[\"db\"]=1.\n\n            Output: 3.\n\n        But the expected output for the sample is 3.\n\n        However, the sample in the problem statement for the string problem says:\n\n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\"\n\n        That sample has 5 pairs.\n\n        Input for that sample: \n            t=1\n            n=3\n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n\n        But our count for that sample is 3.\n\n        What's the issue? \n\n        The sample input in the problem statement for the string problem has 3 strings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", and then the expected pairs are 5? \n\n        But the sample says: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"): differ in first letter -> count=1\n            (\"ab\", \"db\"): differ in first letter -> count=2\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\"): but \"aa\" is not in the list? \n            (\"cb\", \"db\"): differ in first letter -> count=3\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\"): \"cc\" is not in the list.\n\n        So only two pairs: (ab,cb), (ab,db), (cb,db) -> 3.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\"\n\n        This implies the input has more than 3 strings? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\n        Then n lines of strings.\n\n        For the first test case, n must be at least 4? \n\n        But the example input in the problem statement for the string problem is not provided. \n\n        The note says: \n            \"For the first test case ...\"\n\n        and then lists 5 pairs, which involve the strings \"aa\", \"cc\", so the test case must have at least the strings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\". \n\n        So n=5.\n\n        How would our code work for n=5 with strings: \n            s0: \"ab\"\n            s1: \"cb\"\n            s2: \"db\"\n            s3: \"aa\"\n            s4: \"cc\"\n\n        We want to count 5 pairs.\n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n        d = defaultdict(int), count=0\n\n        s0 = \"ab\"\n          for c in ak (except 'a'): \n              c from 'b' to 'k': \n                  check d[c+'b'] -> initially 0 for all.\n          for c in ak (except 'b'):\n              check d['a'+c] -> initially 0.\n          then d[\"ab\"] = 1.\n\n        s1 = \"cb\"\n          for c in ak (except 'c'): \n              c='a': d['a'+'b'] = 1 -> count +=1  -> count=1   [because \"ab\" and \"cb\" differ in first letter]\n              c='b': skip because 'b'!='c' -> but then check d['b'+'b'] -> 0.\n              ... \n          for c in ak (except 'b'): \n              check d['c'+c] -> 0.\n          then d[\"cb\"] = 1.\n\n        s2 = \"db\"\n          for c in ak (except 'd'):\n              c='a': d['a'+'b']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=2   [pair: (\"ab\",\"db\")]\n              c='b': d['b'+'b']=0\n              c='c': d['c'+'b']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=3   [pair: (\"cb\",\"db\")]\n              ...\n          for c in ak (except 'b'): \n              d['d'+c] = 0.\n          d[\"db\"]=1.\n\n        s3 = \"aa\"\n          for c in ak (except 'a'): \n              check d[c+'a'] -> \n                 c='b': d['ba']=0\n                 ... \n          for c in ak (except 'a'):\n              check d['a'+c] -> \n                 c='b': d['ab']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=4   [pair: (\"ab\",\"aa\") because they differ in the second letter: 'a' vs 'b'?

\n\n        But the TODO is in the first if-block. The current code has:\n\n            if c != s[0]:\n                if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We should replace the TODO with:\n\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        And similarly, the second part already has:\n\n            if c != s[1]:\n                if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                    count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n        But wait, the second part is already there. Only the first part has a TODO.\n\n        So for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        But note: the second part already has the same without the if? \n\n        Actually, the second part has:\n\n            if c != s[1]:\n                if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                    count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n        We can also remove the if (d[...]>0) because if the string is not present, d returns 0. So we can do:\n\n            count += d[c+s[1]]\n\n        without the inner if.\n\n        But the TODO is inside the inner if. We can do:\n\n            count += d[c+s[1]]\n\n        and remove the inner if? \n\n        However, the code is:\n\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here   -> we put: count += d[c+s[1]]\n\n        But then we are only adding when d[c+s[1]]>0, which is the same as adding d[c+s[1]] (because if 0, then adding 0).\n\n        Alternatively, we can remove the inner if and just do:\n\n            if c != s[0]:\n                count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        But the TODO is only for the block inside the inner if.\n\n        Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we output the line that should be in the TODO.\n\n        So for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        And for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            return 0\n\n        But wait, in program1.py, the function C(m, n) has:\n\n            if n < 0 or m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n        We should return 0 in that case.\n\n        However, note that the combinatorial function should return 0 when n<0 or m<n.\n\n        So we write: \n\n            return 0\n\n        But the code for program1.py also has an issue in the factorial inversion.\n\n        The current code for program1.py:\n\n            fact = [1]\n            invf = [1]\n\n            for i in range(1, N):\n                fact.append(fact[i-1] * i % MOD)\n                invf.append(pow(fact[-1], MOD-2, MOD))\n\n        This is inefficient and also the inversion is computed for each factorial individually, which is O(N log MOD) and might be slow, but N=400000, and log MOD is about 30, so 12e6 operations, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n        But note: the standard way is to compute the factorial array and then the inverse factorial array in reverse to avoid pow for each.\n\n        However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases is at most 10^5, and we are precomputing factorials up to 400000, so it's one-time.\n\n        And the pow(fact[-1], MOD-2, MOD) for each i is not necessary. We only need the inverse for the last factorial? \n\n        Actually, we need the inverse for all factorials. The current code computes:\n\n            invf[i] = pow(fact[i], MOD-2, MOD)\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the function C(m, n) uses invf[n] and invf[m-n]. We have precomputed factorials and invf for indices up to N-1 (which is 400000). \n\n        However, the range in the loop for factorials is from 0 to N-1 (because we do range(1, N) -> indices 1 to N-1, so we have fact[0..N-1] and invf[0..N-1]).\n\n        But N = 4 * 10**5 + 5 = 400005.\n\n        And the maximum argument in C is: \n            m = a_i + i, and a_i up to 200000, i up to 200000 (since the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, but n per test case can be up to 10^5, and we iterate i from 0 to n, so i up to 10^5, and a_i up to 200000, so m up to 300000, which is < 400005.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is \"return 0\".\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is \"count += d[c + s[1]]\".\n\n        But note: the TODO in program2.py is only for the first inner if. The second inner if is already complete.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        return 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n            }\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the format: \n            { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n        We output the exact code that is missing.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is one line: \"return 0\", but note the indentation: it is inside the function and inside the if. The current code has:\n\n            if n < 0 or m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            return ... \n\n        We replace the TODO line with \"return 0\", and we must indent properly.\n\n        The current code has 4 spaces per indent. The function C is defined with def, so the body is indented. The if is indented by 4, then the return is at the same level.\n\n        We want:\n\n            if n < 0 or m < n:\n                return 0\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is the line \"return 0\", and it should be at the same indentation as the comment.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the missing code is the line \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", and it should be at the same indentation as the comment.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            program1: \"        return 0\"   (with 8 spaces: 4 for the function, 4 for the if)\n\n        But the existing code has:\n\n            def C(m, n):\n                if n < 0 or m < n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n        We replace the TODO line with \"return 0\", so:\n\n            def C(m, n):\n                if n < 0 or m < n:\n                    return 0\n                return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n        The indentation for the return 0 is 8 spaces (if the function body is 4 and the if is 8, then the return 0 should be 8).\n\n        But the comment is at 8 spaces, so we output \"        return 0\".\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO line with \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", at the same indentation level (which is 12 spaces: 4 for the for, 4 for the first if, 4 for the inner if).\n\n        So we output: \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        But note: the next line is:\n\n                if c != s[1]:\n                    if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                        count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n        And then we have:\n\n                d[s] += 1\n\n        So the code for program2.py after filling:\n\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                        count += d[c + s[1]]\n                if c != s[1]:\n                    if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                        count += d[s[0] + c]\n            d[s] += 1\n\n        But we can also remove the inner if conditions? \n\n        However, the problem says: output only the missing code. We are only to fill the TODO.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        return 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n            }\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the TODO is only in the first inner if. The second inner if is already complete.\n\n        However, the second inner if has:\n\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n        We can also change that to without the if, but that is not the TODO.\n\n        We only do the TODO.\n\n        Let me write the exact string for program2.py: \n            The current line with TODO is at 12 spaces of indentation, and we want to replace the comment with:\n\n                count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        So the line is: \n\n            \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        (24 characters of space? Actually, the code has 4*3=12 spaces at the beginning of the line, then the code. But the TODO line is:\n\n            \"                        # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        We replace that with:\n\n            \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        So the string is: \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        But we can count the spaces: 24 spaces? \n\n        The original:\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n                count = 0\n                d = defaultdict(int)\n                n = int(input())\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s = input()\n                    for c in ak:\n                        if c != s[0]:\n                            if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                        if c != s[1]:\n                            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                                count += d[s[0] + c]\n                    d[s] += 1\n                print(count)\n\n        The TODO line is at the innermost of three loops, and the ifs. The indentation:\n\n            for: 4\n            for: 8\n            for: 12\n            if: 16\n            if: 20\n            then: 24\n\n        So 24 spaces.\n\n        But the code we are to output is the line that replaces the TODO comment, so we output 24 spaces and then \"count += d[c + s[1]]\".\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing, which is the line that goes in that spot.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            program1: \"        return 0\"\n            program2: \"                        count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the line we are replacing is a comment, and we are replacing it with a code line. We do not output the entire block.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
