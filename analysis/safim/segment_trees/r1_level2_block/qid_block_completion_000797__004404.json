Then we define a function check(k) that for each element in count, subtracts k and then if the element is positive, we set it to max(0, element - k). Then we check if the sum of the remaining is <= k. Then we do a binary search for the minimal k such that check(k) is true.

Then the code does the initial subtraction: count[i] = count[i] - i - 2. What if we change the initial subtraction to: count[i] = count[i] - i - 1?\n\n            Then for the example [1,3] (sorted as [1,3]):\n\n                i=0: 1-0-1 = 0\n                i=1: 3-1-1 = 1\n                then R = 1. Then we do binary search on R in [0,1] (initially L=0, R=1). check(0): \n                b = [0,1] -> then for i in range(2): \n                    b[0]=0, b[1]=max(1-0,0)=1\n                sum(b)=1, then 1<=0? -> False.\n            check(1):\n                b[0]=0, b[1]=max(1-1,0)=0, sum=0<=1 -> True.\n            then R=1. then answer = num_level+1+R = 2+1+1 = 4. This matches. Therefore, the initial subtraction should be: count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 1, 0) But the code currently has: count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (l and r) and two accumulators (a for Alice and b for Bob). The code is incomplete in the part where Bob eats.\n\nWe note:\n- The code initializes a, b, l, f to 0, and r to the last index.\n- The loop runs while l <= r.\n- If a <= b, then Alice eats the next candy (at index l) and we move l to the right.\n- Else (meaning b < a), we should have Bob eat. But the code is missing in the elif block.\n\nThe goal is to update b by adding the candy at r and then decrement r (move right pointer to the left). Also, we must check if a becomes equal to b, then update f (which stores the maximum total candies eaten so far when the sums are equal).\n\nHowever, note that the condition for updating f is outside the if-elif, so we check after every addition.\n\nBut the current code for the elif block is missing. We should fill:\n\n    elif b<a:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop is \"while l<=r\", and we are updating l and r accordingly.\n\nAlso, note that the variable f is updated only when a==b. The update is: f = len(n) - r + l - 1.\n\nLet's break down: \n  - Initially, the entire array has len(n) candies.\n  - The candies that have been eaten are from the left up to (but not including) l, and from the right up to (but not including) r+1. \n  - The number of candies eaten by Alice is l (because she started at 0 and now l is the next available on the left, so she has eaten from index0 to index l-1 -> l candies).\n  - Similarly, Bob has eaten from the right: from index len(n)-1 down to r+1 -> that's (len(n)-1 - r) candies? Actually, the total eaten is l + (len(n)-1 - r). \n  - But note: the expression in the code is: len(n) - r + l - 1 = l + (len(n) - r - 1). \n    Since the total number of candies is len(n), the uneaten candies are from l to r (inclusive). So the eaten candies are: \n        left part: l (from 0 to l-1) \n        right part: (len(n)-1 - r) (from r+1 to len(n)-1)\n    Total eaten = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + len(n) - r - 1.\n\nSo the expression is correct.\n\nBut note: the code initializes f=4? Actually, it initializes f=0 (because [0]*4 gives [0,0,0,0] and then we assign to the fourth variable? Actually, the line is:\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4\n\nThis sets a=0, b=0, l=0, f=0.\n\nSo if no equal sum is found, f remains 0, which is the answer (as in the third test case).\n\nHowever, we must note that the condition for Bob is missing. We must add:\n\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut also, we must note that after updating Bob, we might have l<=r still, and then we check if a==b? The check is outside the if-elif, so it will be checked.\n\nBut what if after updating Bob, we break the condition l<=r? Then we break the loop and the last update (which made l>r) is not checked for a==b? Actually, the update of l or r is done and then we check a==b. But if we decrement r and then l>r, we break the loop in the next iteration. But the check for a==b is still done in the current iteration.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" in the elif block. We replace that with the two lines.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The process each second:\n  - Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, you can infect at most one additional child (of your choice) of v.\n  - Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. The code structure:\n\n  - We have a defaultdict `counter` that is global? Actually, it is defined outside the function and then cleared for each test case.\n\n  - The function `solve(a)` takes a list `a` which is the list of ancestors for vertices 2 to n.\n\n  - The first step: for each ai in a (which are the ancestors of vertices 2..n), we increment the counter for that ai. This counts the number of children for each node? But note: the root (vertex 1) is not in the list? Actually, the list has n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn. So the root (vertex 1) will appear as an ancestor of some vertices. However, note that the root has no parent, so we are counting the direct children? Actually, the input gives the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n). So the counter counts the number of children for each node? But note: a node might appear multiple times as a parent? Yes, so counter[ai] is the number of children of node ai.\n\n  - Then we get the list `count` of the values of the counter (the frequencies). Then we sort this list.\n\n  - Then we do: for i in range(num_level): count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n    Why? The variable `num_level` is the number of distinct nodes that have children? Actually, it's the number of keys in the counter? But note: the root (1) is included? Yes. However, the problem states that the root is vertex 1 and we have n-1 edges.\n\n    The idea: \n        We start by having the root infected at time 0? Actually, the process starts at second 0? But note: initially all are healthy. Then we do operations each second.\n\n    However, the approach in the code is:\n\n        We are going to simulate the infection process. The infection starts by injecting the root? Actually, we can choose the injections arbitrarily.\n\n    The known solution for this problem:\n\n        Step 1: We note that the root must be infected at some point. We can start by injecting the root at time 0? Then at time 0, we have one injection (the root). Then at the next second, we can spread to one child? But the problem says: each second we do spreading first and then injection.\n\n        Actually, the known solution:\n\n          - We start with an initial set of infected nodes: we must inject the root at time 0? But note: we can choose any vertex for injection. However, the root is special because it has no parent. But we can start by infecting the root? \n\n        However, the problem does not require starting at the root. But the root is the only one without a parent, so if we don't start at the root, then we cannot spread to the root? Actually, the spreading operation requires that the parent is infected? No, the spreading operation: for a vertex v, if at least one child is infected, then we can spread to at most one other child. So the parent must be infected to spread to a child? Actually, no: the spreading operation is defined on the parent: if the parent v has at least one child infected, then we can spread to one more child. But note: the parent v must be infected? Actually, the problem does not say that. It says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected\" -> then we can spread to one more child. So the parent v doesn't have to be infected? But then how does the infection spread from the child to the parent? It doesn't. The infection spreads from the parent to the child? Actually, the operation is: we can choose to infect one child of v (if at least one child is already infected). So the parent v must be infected? Actually, no: the condition is only on the children. However, the parent being healthy would not be able to spread? But the operation is: for each vertex v (regardless of whether v is infected or not) we look at its children. However, the problem states: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected\" -> then we can spread to at most one other child. \n\n        But note: the infection can only spread from an infected child to a healthy child? Actually, we are infecting a healthy child. So the parent v doesn't need to be infected? However, the problem does not require the parent to be infected to spread to a child? That seems odd. \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice.\"\n\n        This means that if a vertex v has at least one child infected (by whatever means: injection or previous spreading) then we can choose to infect one more child of v. So the parent v does not need to be infected? \n\n        However, the known solutions for this problem (like the one in the code) assume that we start by infecting the root and then the infection spreads. \n\n        Actually, the minimal time is computed by:\n\n          - We consider the root: we start by injecting the root at time 0? Then at time 0, the root is infected.\n\n          - Then at time 1: \n                Spreading: for the root, since it has at least one child infected? Actually, at time 0, only the root is infected. The root's children are not infected. So we cannot spread from the root. Then we do an injection: we can inject one more node (say one child of the root). Then at time 1, we have two infected nodes.\n\n          - Then at time 2: \n                Spreading: for the root, now it has one child infected, so we can spread to one more child (if exists). And for the newly infected child (at time 1), it has no infected children? So we can only spread from the root. Then we spread to one more child of the root. Then we do injection: we can inject a node that is not a child of the root? Or we can inject a child of the child? \n\n        The known solution:\n\n          - We build an array `deg` for the degree of each node? Actually, the number of children? Then we note that the root must be injected? Actually, we can start by injecting the root at time 0.\n\n          - Then we consider the children of the root: we can spread to one child per second? But we can also use injections.\n\n        The solution in the code:\n\n          - We count the children for each node. Then we note that the root (which is node 1) must be considered. But in the input, the root is not listed? Actually, the input gives the parent of each node from 2 to n. So the root (1) will appear as a parent. We count the children for each node.\n\n          - Then we set: \n                count = list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? Actually, we have the counter for every node that is a parent. But note: the root is included? Yes.\n\n          - Then we add the root? Actually, the root is not infected initially. We must account for the root? The known solution: we start by having the root as infected at time 0? Then we consider the children of the root.\n\n          - The code then does:\n\n                count.sort()\n                for i in range(num_level):\n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          Why? \n\n          Explanation from known similar problems (like Codeforces Round #748 (Div. 3) G): \n\n          Steps:\n\n            1. We start by having the root infected at time 0. Then we consider the children of each node.\n\n            2. We note that for a node with c children, the infection of the children can be done in two ways: by injection or by spreading.\n\n            3. The spreading operation for a node v: we can only spread one child per second (if at least one child is already infected). So the time to infect all children of v is: \n                  - The first child must be infected by injection (or by spreading from the child? but the child is a leaf? no, the child might have its own children). Actually, we are considering the entire tree.\n\n          Alternate known solution:\n\n            We do:\n\n                deg[0] = 1   # the root has one child? Actually, the root has no parent, but we consider the root as having an initial \"bonus\" infection? \n\n            Actually, the known solution:\n\n                Let a = sorted([deg[i] for i in range(n)] or something similar.\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if a[i] > ans:\n                        ans += 1\n\n            But that is not exactly.\n\n          After reading known solutions for the problem (which is a common one), the solution is:\n\n            We start by having the root infected at time 0. Then we consider the children of each node. The infection process:\n\n              - At time 0: root is infected (by injection at time 0? but the problem says initially all are healthy, so we must inject the root at time 0?).\n\n              - Then we have a list of the number of children for each node. But we also note that the root is infected at time 0, so the children of the root are not infected. We can start by injecting one child of the root at time 1? Then at time 1, we have two infected: root and that child.\n\n              - Then at time 2: we can spread from the root to one more child (because one child is already infected) and we can also inject a node? But note: the spreading operation happens first, then injection.\n\n          The known solution steps:\n\n            Step 1: We create an array `children` for each node. The root is node 1. We set the root as infected at time 0.\n\n            Step 2: We create an array `dp` for the time when a node becomes infected? Actually, we don't do that.\n\n          Another known solution (from a known problem \"Tree Infection\"):\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                deg = [0] * (n+1)\n                for i in range(2, n+1):\n                    deg[p[i-2]] += 1   # note: the input has n-1 numbers, starting from p2 to pn, so the index of the parent for vertex i (where i from 2 to n) is given.\n\n                # Count the children for each node. The root is node 1, so we start from 1 to n.\n                # But note: the root might not be in the list of p? Actually, the root (1) will appear in p if any vertex has parent 1.\n\n                # We create a list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? Actually, we want the counts for every node that has children.\n                # Also, we note that the root must be infected at time 0.\n\n                # We create a list `a` of the children counts for nodes that have at least one child? Actually, we take all non-zero? But the root might have children? Yes.\n\n                # But note: the root is not in the list of p? Actually, we have the parent for vertices 2..n, so the root (1) will appear as a parent. So we have deg[1] at least.\n\n                # Then we do:\n                a = []\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    if deg[i] > 0:\n                        a.append(deg[i])\n\n                # Then we sort in descending order? Actually, the known solution sorts in descending order and then uses a greedy with a priority queue? \n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                # We start by having the root infected at time 0. Then we consider the children of the root: we can only infect one child per second? But we can use injections and spreading.\n\n                # We note that for a node with k children, we can infect one child per second (by spreading) after the first child is infected (by injection). So the time to infect all children of a node is: \n                #   time = (time to infect the first child) + (k - 1)   [because then we spread to the remaining k-1 at one per second]\n\n                # But the problem is that multiple nodes are being processed at the same time.\n\n                # Known solution:\n\n                #   Let f(x) be the number of nodes that are infected by time x. We want the minimal x such that f(x) >= n.\n\n                #   We can use binary search? \n\n                # But the provided code uses a different method.\n\n          The provided code:\n\n            counter = defaultdict(int)\n            for ai in a:   # a is the list of ancestors? Actually, the input for a test case is the list of n-1 parents (for vertices 2..n). Then we count the frequency of each parent -> that gives the number of children for that parent.\n\n            Then we get the list `count` of the values (the number of children for each node that is a parent). Then we sort it.\n\n            Then we do:\n                for i in range(num_level):\n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            Then we set L=0, R = max(count). Then if R==0, we return num_level+1.\n\n            Then we define a function check(k) that for each element in count, subtracts k and then if the element is positive, we set it to max(0, element - k). Then we check if the sum of the remaining is <= k.\n\n            Then we do a binary search for the minimal k such that check(k) is true.\n\n            Then the answer is: num_level + 1 + R   (where R is the minimal k that satisfies the condition).\n\n          What does this mean?\n\n          Explanation:\n\n            - The variable `num_level` is the number of nodes that have children (the distinct parents that appear, but note: the root is included and we have counted the children for each).\n\n            - The initial step: we must infect the root (at time 0). Then we have to deal with the children of each node.\n\n            - The idea is that for each node that has children, we can break the infection of its children into two parts:\n\n                  Part 1: We can use injections and spreading to reduce the burden.\n\n            - The known solution:\n\n                  Step 1: We note that we can inject one node per second (in the injection phase). Also, we can spread one child per node per second (if the node has at least one child already infected).\n\n                  Step 2: We start at time 0: the root is infected (injected at time 0).\n\n                  Step 3: For each node with children, we can schedule:\n\n                         - At time 1, we inject one child of the root? \n                         - Then at time 2, we can spread to one more child of the root? and also inject a child of another node? \n\n                  The total time is at least the number of nodes that have children (because each such node must have at least one child infected by injection? or not?).\n\n            Actually, the known solution from the code:\n\n                We sort the list of children counts (for the nodes that have children). Then we subtract an amount that represents the time that has passed? \n\n                Specifically: \n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                Why i+2? \n\n                Explanation:\n\n                  - The index i (from 0 to num_level-1) represents the node. We sort the counts in increasing order? Actually, the code sorts without reversing.\n\n                  - Then we subtract (i+2) from each count? \n\n                  - The idea: \n                      - The root (which is the first node we consider) has count[0] children. \n                      - We start at time 0: the root is infected.\n                      - Then at time 1: we can inject one child of the root? and also we can start spreading? \n\n                  Actually, the known solution in a similar problem:\n\n                    We have an array `a` of the children counts (for nodes that have children). We also include the root? \n\n                    Then we set:\n\n                         a.sort()\n                         # We are going to simulate the time. We start at time 0: the root is infected.\n\n                         # Then for each node (in increasing order of the number of children? or by the node id? we sort by the count) we do:\n\n                         #   The time at which we start infecting the children of this node is at least the index (i) plus 1? \n\n                    Actually, the time when we inject the first child of a node v is at least (the time when the node v became infected) + 1.\n\n                    How did the node v become infected? \n\n                      - If v is the root: it was infected at time 0.\n                      - If v is not the root: it was infected by its parent? Actually, no: the infection of a node can be by injection or by spreading from the parent? \n\n                    But note: the problem does not require the parent to be infected to spread to the child? Actually, the spreading operation is defined per vertex: if a vertex v has at least one child infected, then we can spread to one more. So the parent v doesn't need to be infected? \n\n                    However, the parent v must be infected to be able to have the spreading operation? Actually, the operation is independent of the parent's infection? But then how do we get the first child infected? We must inject it? \n\n                    So for a node v (that is not the root), we must inject one of its children? But we can also have the node v infected by injection? \n\n                    Actually, the problem does not require the parent to be infected to spread to the child? But without the parent being infected, we can still spread to the child? That doesn't make sense because the spreading operation is defined for the vertex v: if at least one child of v is infected, then we can spread to one more. So the vertex v doesn't need to be infected? \n\n                    However, the problem does not say that the vertex v must be infected. So we can have:\n\n                      - At time 0: we inject a leaf? Then at time 1: we can spread to its parent? But the spreading operation: for the parent v, we see that one child (the leaf) is infected, so we can spread to one more child of v? \n\n                    But note: the spreading operation infects a child, not the parent. So we cannot infect the parent by spreading from the child? \n\n                    Therefore, the parent must be infected by injection? \n\n                    So the infection of the parent is independent? \n\n                    This leads to a different approach.\n\n          After reading known solutions for the problem \"Tree Infection\", the solution is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))\n                children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n                for i in range(2, n+1):\n                    children[p[i]].append(i)\n\n                a = []\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    if children[i]:\n                        a.append(len(children[i]))\n\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                a.insert(0, 1)   # for the root? because the root must be infected at time 0? \n\n                # Then we do:\n                q = []\n                for i, x in enumerate(a):\n                    if x > 0:\n                        q.append(x - i)   # why subtract i? \n\n                # Then we set t = 0\n                # and while there is still positive in q, we do: \n                #   t += 1\n                #   we subtract 1 from every element? but that is expensive.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                #   Let extra = max(q)   # but then we need to distribute the extra over time? \n\n                # Actually, known solution:\n\n                #   t0 = len(a)   # because we have to inject one for each group? \n                #   Then we have to account for the spreading: the extra time needed is the maximum over the groups of (remaining children after the first injection) and then we can spread one per second? \n\n                #   Then we do:\n\n                #        ans = t0\n                #        rem = 0\n                #        for x in a:\n                #            rem += max(0, x - t0)\n                #        ans += (rem + 1) // 2   # because we can spread one per second? and also inject one per second? \n\n                # But that is not exactly.\n\n          Another known solution (from a known AC code):\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                cnt = [0] * (n+1)\n                for x in a:\n                    cnt[x] += 1\n                cnt = [x for x in cnt if x > 0]\n                cnt.sort(reverse=True)\n                k = len(cnt)\n                # We start by injecting the root?

The number of injections we can do after the first k seconds is: mid - k? \n                        #   Then we can assign these extra injections arbitrarily to the groups.\n\n                        # So the condition: \n                        #   The total number of injections we can do for group i is: 1 (the first one at time i) + (the extra injections we assign to group i) \n                        #   And the spreading: we can spread one per second in the group after the first injection? \n\n                        # Actually, after the first injection in group i (at time i), we can spread for free one child per second? But note: the spreading operation is per node (the parent) and we can only spread one child per parent per second. \n\n                        # However, the problem states: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v\". So per parent, we can only spread one child per second. \n\n                        # Therefore, for group i (which is the children of a particular parent), we can spread at most (mid - i) children? because we start at time i (the first injection) and then from time i+1 to mid, we have (mid - i) seconds to spread.\n\n                        # So the total infected in group i is: 1 (injection) + (mid - i) (spreading) \n                        #   and we need that to be at least cnt[i].\n\n                        # But wait, what if we do additional injections in the same group? We can! So we can also inject more than one in the same group. \n\n                        # Therefore, the total infected in group i is: \n                        #   (number of injections in group i) + min( (mid - i), ... )? \n\n                        # Actually, the spreading is limited by the time: we can spread at most (mid - i) children in group i. Then the rest must be injected.\n\n                        # So the number of injections needed for group i is: \n                        #   max(0, cnt[i] - (mid - i) - 1)   [because we already did one injection at time i]\n\n                        # Then the total extra injections needed is the sum over i of max(0, cnt[i] - (mid - i) - 1). And we have (mid - k) extra injections available (because we used k injections for the first in each group, and we have mid total seconds, so the total injections we can do is mid, and we used k for the first, so we have mid - k left).\n\n                        # Therefore, we require:\n                        #   sum_i max(0, cnt[i] - (mid - i) - 1) <= mid - k\n\n                    extra = 0\n                    for i in range(k):\n                        extra += max(0, cnt[i] - (mid - i) - 1)\n                    if extra <= mid - k:\n                        hi = mid\n                    else:\n                        lo = mid+1\n\n                print(lo)\n\n          But note: the provided code in program2.py does not use this method. It uses:\n\n            count = list(counter.values())\n            num_level = len(count)\n            count.sort()\n            for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            Then it does a binary search on a value R (which represents extra time?) and then returns num_level+1+R.\n\n          How does this relate?\n\n          Let me try to map:\n\n            In the known solution above, we have:\n\n                k = len(count)   [which is the number of groups, i.e., nodes that have children]\n\n                Then we do: \n                    for i in range(k):\n                        count[i] = max(count[i] - (mid - i) - 1, 0)   -> but wait, in the known solution we did: max(0, cnt[i] - (mid - i) - 1)\n\n            But in the provided code, we do:\n\n                for i in range(num_level):\n                    count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            This is independent of mid. Then we set R = max(count) initially? and then we do a binary search on k? \n\n          Actually, the provided code does:\n\n            L = 0; R = max(count)   [after subtracting i+2]\n\n            Then if R==0, we return num_level+1.\n\n            Then we define check(k): \n                b = count.copy()\n                for i in range(len(b)):\n                    b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                if sum(b) <= k:\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n            Then we do binary search for the minimal R such that check(R) is true.\n\n            Then the answer is: num_level + 1 + R.\n\n          What is the meaning of this?\n\n          Explanation:\n\n            - The initial subtraction: count[i] = count[i] - i - 2. \n                This might be: \n                  i+2 = (i+1) + 1 -> where i+1 might be the time when we start infecting this group? and then we have one injection at that time? \n\n            - Then the remaining count[i] is the number of children that still need to be infected beyond the initial one? \n\n            - Then we need to cover these remaining children with extra injections and spreading? \n\n            - The variable R represents the extra time? \n\n            - The function check(k): if we have k extra seconds, then we can reduce each group's remaining children by k (because we can do one injection per second? and then the spreading will cover one per second per group? but note: the spreading is limited to one per group per second, so we cannot reduce more than k per group? Actually, the check subtracts k from each group's remaining children? \n\n            But that is not per second per group, but a global k? \n\n          Let me try with the example: n=14, tree: \n            The first test case in the problem? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.\"\n\n          We don't have the image, but the first test case has n=5, and the parents: [1,1,1,2]\n\n          So the tree: \n            root: 1\n            children of 1: 2,3,4\n            children of 2: 5\n\n          Then the groups (nodes with children): \n            node1: 3 children\n            node2: 1 child\n\n          Then count = [3, 1] -> sorted: [1,3]? or [3,1]? the code sorts without reversing -> [1,3]\n\n          Then for i in range(2):\n            i=0: count[0] = max(1 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(-1,0)=0\n            i=1: count[1] = max(3-1-2,0)=0\n\n          Then R = max(count)=0 -> then we return num_level+1 = 2+1 = 3.\n\n          But the minimal seconds for n=5 is 4 seconds? \n\n          How:\n\n            Second 0: inject root (1) -> infected: {1}\n            Second 1: \n                spreading: for node1, it has no infected child? -> no spreading.\n                injection: inject node2 -> infected: {1,2}\n            Second 2:\n                spreading: for node1, now it has one child (node2) infected -> we can spread to one more child of node1, say node3 -> infected: {1,2,3}\n                injection: inject node5 -> infected: {1,2,3,5}\n            Second 3:\n                spreading: for node1, it has two children infected (2 and 3) -> we can spread to node4. For node2, it has no infected child? (node5 is infected, but node5 is a child of node2) -> so we can spread from node2? but node2 is infected and has one child (node5) infected, so we can spread to one more? but there is none. \n                    -> so we spread node4 from node1.\n                injection: inject node? but all are infected? \n            But wait, at second 3 we infect node4 by spreading, and then we are done? \n\n          So total seconds: 4.\n\n          But the code returns 3? \n\n          This indicates the provided code might be flawed? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree\", and the provided example image might show 4 seconds.\n\n          But the known solution using the binary search on mid (as described above) for this test case:\n\n            groups: [3,1] -> we sort in descending order: [3,1] (or ascending? the known solution I described sorted in descending order for the children counts) -> but the known solution that uses binary search:\n\n                k = 2 (number of groups)\n                We consider mid as the total seconds.\n\n                We try mid=0: not enough.\n                mid=1: \n                    for group0 (count=3): extra = max(0, 3 - (1-0) - 1) = max(0,3-1-1)=1\n                    for group1 (count=1): extra = max(0,1 - (1-1) - 1)=max(0,1-0-1)=0\n                    total extra = 1, and available extra injections = 1 - 2 = -1 -> not enough.\n                mid=2: \n                    group0: 3 - (2-0) - 1 = 3-2-1=0 -> extra=0\n                    group1: 1 - (2-1) - 1 = 1-1-1 = -1 -> 0\n                    total extra=0, available=2-2=0 -> works? then answer=2? \n                But we have only infected the groups? what about the leaves that are not in any group? \n\n          Actually, the groups are the nodes that have children, but we also have the leaves. The leaves are not in the groups because they have no children. However, the leaves must be infected. \n\n          In the known solution using binary search, we also account for the leaves? \n\n          The known solution that uses binary search on mid (as described) does not work on the groups of children counts, but on the entire tree? \n\n          The known solution that is correct for the first test case (n=5) is 4 seconds.\n\n          Given the provided code in program2.py does not match the known solution, and the example we tried (n=5) gives 3 but expected 4, we must fix the code.\n\n          However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is <= 200000, and the provided code structure is given. We must complete the missing part.\n\n          The missing part in program2.py is in the binary search loop:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We should set L = mid? because if check(mid) is false, then we need a larger mid, so we set L = mid.\n\n          But the binary search is for the minimal R such that check(R) is true. The loop condition is while R-L>1, and initially L=0, R = max(count) (which is the maximum of the list after subtracting i+2).\n\n          The binary search is:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (L+R)//2\n                if check(mid):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    L = mid\n\n          Then after the loop, we return num_level+1+R.\n\n          But in the example n=5, we had count after the initial subtraction = [0,0] -> then R=0, so we skip the binary search and return num_level+1 = 3.\n\n          But the expected answer is 4.\n\n          Therefore, the provided method might be flawed.\n\n          Let me read the note in the problem: \n            \"The image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.\"\n\n          And the sample tree with n=5 vertices.\n\n          The provided example in the problem states: \n            \"The first test case during each second\"\n\n          But we don't have the image, but the minimal seconds is 4.\n\n          How can we reconcile?\n\n          The known solution from an AC submission for the problem \"Tree Infection\" (from a recent contest) is:\n\n            import sys\n            from collections import defaultdict\n\n            t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n                p = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n                children = [0] * (n+2)\n                for parent in p:\n                    children[parent] += 1\n\n                # We have children[1] = number of children of the root, etc.\n                # We only care about nodes that have children.\n                a = []\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    if children[i] > 0:\n                        a.append(children[i])\n\n                a.sort(reverse=True)\n                # We also need to include the root as infected at time 0? \n                # But the root is not in the list? because the list is for nodes that have children, and the root has children, so it is included.\n\n                # Then we do:\n                #   Let t0 = 0\n                #   We want to schedule the first injection for each group.

So the spreading for a group with count c will take c-1 seconds after the first injection.\n\n                #   Therefore, the total time for that group is injection time + (c-1) = i+1 + c - 1 = i+c.\n\n                #   Then we take the maximum over i: ans = max(i+c) for i from 0 to len(a)-1.\n\n                #   But then we also have the root? and the spreading might be limited by the global time.\n\n                #   However, we can also do extra injections in the same group? \n\n                #   This solution does not account for extra injections.\n\n                #   Example: n=5, a = [3,1] (sorted descending)\n                #       i=0: 0+3 = 3\n                #       i=1: 1+1 = 2\n                #       ans = 3, then we add 1 for the root? -> 4? \n\n                #   But the root is already accounted for? because the group for the root is the first group (count=3) and its injection time is i+1 = 1? and then the spreading takes 2 seconds, so the last child in the root group is infected at time 3. Then the group for node2: first injection at time 2, and then spreading for its child (none needed) -> so the child (node5) is injected at time 2, and then at time 3 we infect the last child of the root? \n\n                #   But wait, the root is infected at time 0. The first injection for the root group (which is the children of the root) is at time 1? That is, we inject one child of the root at time 1. Then at time 2, we inject node2 (which is a child of the root) -> but node2 is in the root group? \n\n                #   Actually, the groups are defined by the node that is the parent. The root group is node1, which has count=3 (vertices 2,3,4). The group for node2 has count=1 (vertex5).\n\n                #   Schedule:\n\n                #       time0: inject root (node1) -> infected: {1}\n                #       time1: inject node2 (which is in the root group) -> infected: {1,2}\n                #       time2: \n                #           spreading: for node1, it has one child (node2) infected, so we can spread to node3 or node4.

We count the frequency of each parent.\n\n            But the root (which is '1') will appear, but also the parent of the parent might appear? \n\n            However, the provided Note: \n                \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n ... The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers p2, p3, ... , pn\"\n\n            So the parents are given as integers. We are counting the number of children for each node.\n\n            Then the code does the initial subtraction: count[i] = count[i] - i - 2.\n\n            What if we change the initial subtraction to: count[i] = count[i] - i - 1?\n\n            Then for the example [1,3] (sorted as [1,3]):\n\n                i=0: 1-0-1 = 0\n                i=1: 3-1-1 = 1\n                then R = 1.\n            Then we do binary search on R in [0,1] (initially L=0, R=1).\n\n            check(0): \n                b = [0,1] -> then for i in range(2): \n                    b[0]=0, b[1]=max(1-0,0)=1\n                sum(b)=1, then 1<=0? -> False.\n            check(1):\n                b[0]=0, b[1]=max(1-1,0)=0, sum=0<=1 -> True.\n            then R=1.\n            then answer = num_level+1+R = 2+1+1 = 4.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the initial subtraction should be: count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 1, 0)\n\n          But the code currently has: count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          However, we are not allowed to change that because the TODO is only in the else branch.\n\n          Given the instructions, we are only to output the missing code, not to change existing code.\n\n          But the TODO is in program2.py in the else branch, and also in program1.py in the elif branch.\n\n          And the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", but in program2.py the initial processing might be provided as is.\n\n          How do we then get the example to work? \n\n          The only hope is that the binary search might be for a different purpose.\n\n          Let me try the example with the original code (with -2) and see what the binary search does if we set the else branch to L=mid.\n\n          For the example [0,0]: we skip the binary search and return 3.\n\n          For the example that becomes [0,1] (if we change the subtraction to -1) then we return 4.\n\n          Since the problem says the first test case (n=5) should be 4, and the provided code with -2 gives 3, it is likely that the intended initial subtraction is -1.\n\n          But we cannot change that.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might have intended to include the root in a different way.\n\n          Another possibility: the code should have done:\n\n            count = [0] * (n+1)   # but it doesn't.\n\n          Given the constraints, and that the sum of n is 200000, and the provided code structure, we must output the missing code as instructed.\n\n          For program1.py: the missing code is two lines in the elif block.\n\n          For program2.py: the missing code is one line in the else branch of the binary search.\n\n          For program2.py, the else branch should be: L = mid\n\n          Let me write the missing code for both.\n\n          program1.py:\n\n            elif b<a:\n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n          program2.py:\n\n            else:\n                L = mid\n\n          But note: the code in program2.py has:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with: L = mid\n\n          Then the binary search will work as a standard binary search for the minimal R such that check is true.\n\n          Even though the example n=5 might not work due to the initial subtraction being -2, we are not allowed to change that.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n              \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n            }\n\n          However, the example program2.py might have the initial subtraction as -2, which is likely a typo and should be -1. But the problem does not allow us to change that.\n\n          But the fourth example in the problem: \n            \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n          For program1.py, let's simulate the fourth test case.\n\n          We are not given the weights, but from the example: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> from the left\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> from the right\n\n          So the array: [7, 3, 20, ... , 10, 8, 11, 1] and the middle is not eaten.\n\n          The array must be: [7, 3, 20, x, 10, 8, 11, 1] but the ... might be anything that is not eaten.\n\n          The total number of candies eaten is 3+4=7.\n\n          How does the code work?\n\n            We start: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=7 (if there are 8 candies).\n\n            We are not given the weights, but let's assume the array is: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n            Step1: a<=b (0<=0) -> a=7, l=1.\n            Step2: a(7)<=b(0) is false, so b=1, r=6.\n            Step3: a(7) and b(1) -> a<=b? no, so b=1+11=12, r=5.\n            Step4: a(7)<=b(12)? yes, so a=7+3=10, l=2.\n            Step5: a(10)<=b(12)? yes, so a=10+20=30, l=3.\n            Step6: a(30)<=b(12)? no, so b=12+8=20, r=4.\n            Step7: a(30)<=b(20)? no, so b=20+10=30, r=3.\n            Now l=3, r=3: l<=r -> true.\n            Then we check: a==b (30==30) -> true, so f = len(n) - r + l - 1 = 8 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 7.\n            Then we break? not yet, we then do: \n                a<=b? 30<=30 -> true, so a = 30 + n[3] = 30+5=35, l=4 -> now l=4, r=3 -> break.\n            Then we print f=7.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we trust program1.py.\n\n          For program2.py, we hope that the initial subtraction is intended to be -1, but the code has -2. Since the problem says the first test case (n=5) should be 4, and the code with -2 returns 3, it is likely an error in the provided code. \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          And we are only to output the missing code.\n\n          So we output the two missing parts as described.\n\n          Note: the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n            for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          We cannot change that.\n\n          But the problem also has a note: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so the code might be acceptable for the intended test cases? \n\n          Or the intended solution might be different.\n\n          Given the instructions, we output the missing code.\n\n          Summary:\n\n            program1: in the elif block, add two lines: \n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n            program2: in the else branch of the binary search, add one line:\n                L = mid\n\n          We output in the required JSON format."
