So we require: k_min - c_i <= n - i   =>   k_min <= n - i + c_i. And we also require k_min >= c_i. But note: we also have the condition that the total pipes must be at least the maximum c_i?

Actually, the condition c_i>i is already checked, and if we pass that, then c_i<=i. And then in the forced step, we require c_i<=k+1? However, if we have c_i<=i, and k is at most i-1 (because we are at step i and we've done i-1 steps), then k+1<=i. But we require c_i<=k+1? Why is it that if c_i<=i and we are forced (k < c_i) then we must have c_i<=k+1?",

Then the total pipes is 3. But is there a sequence with P_n=2? We require P3=2. Then i=2: P2 = max(c2, P3-1)=max(1,1)=1. i=1: P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,0)=1. Sequence: P1=1, P2=1, P3=2. Check the constraints:\n             i=1: P1=1>=1 -> ok.\n             i=2: P2=1>=1 -> ok.\n             i=3: P3=2>=3 -> fails. Therefore, minimal P_n=3. Another example: \n             n=2, volumes=[1,1], t=1. c1=ceil(1/1)=1, c2=ceil(2/1)=2. Backward:\n                 P2 = c2 = 2. P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,1)=1. Total pipes=2. Can we do with 1 pipe? If we put the pipe at lock1: \n                 Lock1: 1 liter at t=1 -> filled, then overflows 0.\n                 Lock2: 0 -> not filled. If we put the pipe at lock2:\n                 Lock1: 0 -> not filled. So we need 2 pipes.

P1 = max(c1, P2-1) = max(1,1)=1. Then k1 = P1 - P0 = 1, k2 = P2 - P1 = 1. But what if:\n                             n=2, c1=1, c2=1.\n                                 P2=1. P1 = max(1, 1-1)=max(1,0)=1. Then k1=1, k2=0? -> but then P2 = k1+k2 = 1, so it works. How to assign? We have P_i = number of pipes in the first i locks.",

Example: V_i=3, t=2, i=2: ceil(3/2)=2<=2 -> yes, and 3/2=1.5<=2 -> yes. Example: V_i=2, t=1, i=2: ceil(2/1)=2<=2 -> yes, 2/1=2<=2. Example: V_i=3, t=1, i=2: ceil(3/1)=3>2 -> fails, and 3/1=3>2. Therefore, the condition ceil(V_i/t)<=i is equivalent to V_i <= i * t. So we require: for every i in [1,n], V_i <= i * t.\n\n          And also, we require V_n <= n * t (which is included). Therefore, for a query t:\n\n          if max_{i=1..n} (V_i) > n * t: \n              then there is an i (namely the one with V_i = max) that has V_i > i * t?",

Therefore, the condition is: t >= ceil(V_i / i) for every i.\n\n          Which is equivalent to: t >= max_{i} ceil(V_i / i). However, note: ceil(V_i/i) = (V_i + i - 1) // i.

So output -1. Therefore, it is consistent. But note: we have to compute M = max_i ceil(V_i/i) for i in [1,n]. How to compute M quickly? We can precompute an array A_i = ceil(V_i / i) for i=1..n, and then M = max(A_i). But V_i is the prefix sum: V_i = v1+v2+...+vi.",

Therefore, we can write: Precomputation:\n             n = ... \n             a = list of n integers\n             V = [0]*(n+1)\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 V[i] = V[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n             M = 0\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 # compute ceil(V[i] / i) # ceil(p/q) = (p+q-1)//q\n                 value = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n                 if value > M:\n                     M = value\n\n          Then for each query t:\n                 if t < M:\n                     print(-1)\n                 else:\n                     # total_water = V[n]\n                     pipes = (V[n] + t - 1) // t\n                     print(pipes) However, note: the condition for the total water is automatically satisfied by the minimal number of pipes = ceil(V[n]/t) because we have t>=M and M>= ceil(V[n]/n) (since i=n is included) and then V[n] <= n*M <= n*t, so ceil(V[n]/t) <= n, which is achievable. But note: the condition t>=M ensures that for every i, V_i <= i*t, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the per-prefix water constraint. Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n          from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n          data = stdin.read().split()\n          n = int(data[0])\n          a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n])) q = int(data[1+n])\n\n          # Precompute prefix sums V[1..n]\n          V = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              V[i] = V[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          # Precompute M = max_{i=1..n} ceil(V[i]/i)\n          M = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              # ceil(V[i] / i) = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n              val = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n              if val > M:\n                  M = val\n\n          # Now process queries\n          queries = list(map(int, data[1+n+1:1+n+1+q]))\n          out_lines = []\n          for t in queries:\n              if t < M:\n                  out_lines.append(\"-1\")\n              else:\n                  # total volume = V[n]\n                  # minimal pipes = ceil(V[n] / t)\n                  pipes = (V[n] + t - 1) // t\n                  out_lines.append(str(pipes))\n\n          print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines)) But note: the problem says that the input has q queries, each on one line. However, we read all at once. This meets the complexity.",

The provided code snippet has:\n\n             queries = map(int, queries) But then the next line is:\n\n             s = t_min = 0\n\n          and then the for loop for volumes. Then the next loop:\n\n             for q in map(int, queries):   # but queries is already mapped to integers? This is an error. We should remove the line:\n\n             queries = map(int, queries)\n\n          and then in the for loop, we do:\n\n             for q_str in queries:\n                 q = int(q_str)\n                 ... But the provided code for the loop is:\n\n             for q in map(int, queries): So if we remove the line \"queries = map(int, queries)\", then the variable queries is a list of strings (the lines) and then the map in the for loop is correct. Alternatively, we can leave the line and then do:\n\n             for q_val in queries:   # because queries is now a list of integers\n\n          But the code says: for q in map(int, queries) -> which would be if we had not mapped. Since the problem says \"complete the code\", and the provided code has:\n\n             queries = map(int, queries)   # this line is present. Then we should change the for loop to:\n\n             for q in queries:   # without map(int,...) because we already mapped. So the corrected code for program2.py:\n\n             from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n             def debug(*args, **kwargs):\n                 print(*args, file=stderr, **kwargs)\n\n             # Read all lines\n             data = stdin.readlines()\n             #",

We can open two pipes: Option: open lock1 and lock2.

But we saw that we need 3 pipes. However, consider: \n             n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=3. c1=ceil(1/3)=1. c2=ceil(2/3)=1.\n             c3=ceil(5/3)=2. then answer = 2.\n\n          Can we do with 2 pipes? Total water=2*3=6>=5. We need to assign 2 pipes. Try: open pipe1 and pipe3. Lock1: 3 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 2 to lock2. Lock2: 2 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 1 to lock3. Lock3: 1 (overflow) + 3 (pipe3) = 4 -> fills (3 liters) and overflows 1.\n                 -> works.",

P3 = c3 = 2.\n             P2 = max(c2, P3-1)=max(1,1)=1. P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,0)=1.

Therefore, the answer for a query t is ceil(V_n/t) if for every i, ceil(V_i/t)<=i, else -1. But wait: what about the example we had earlier that failed the forward simulation? n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=2: \n             c1=1, c2=1, c3=3, and we return 3.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given:\n  n, then a list of n integers (volumes) for the locks.\n  q, then q queries (each query is a time t_j)\n\nWe know:\n  The system has n locks with volumes v1, v2, ... vn.\n  Water flows: \n    - Each open pipe adds 1 liter per second to its lock.\n    - If a lock i overflows, the excess water goes to lock i+1 (and so on).\n\nWe are to answer q queries: for a given time t_j, what is the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled?\n\nImportant note: Initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then we open some set of pipes simultaneously at time 0.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. The entire system must receive at least S = v1 + v2 + ... + vn liters of water. Since each open pipe provides 1 liter per second, the total water provided in t seconds is (number of pipes) * t. Therefore, we must have: (number of pipes) * t >= S. This is a necessary condition.\n\n2. However, the distribution of pipes matters because of the cascading overflow. We cannot just put all pipes at the beginning: the water must flow through the locks in order.\n\n3. The key constraint is that the water must fill the locks from left to right. The first lock must be filled by the water that is either poured directly into it or that remains after the overflow from previous locks? But note: the pipes are only attached to the locks. We can open a pipe at any lock. However, water from a pipe at lock i will only contribute to lock i and then to the right (if it overflows).\n\n4. How to compute the minimal number of pipes for a given time t?\n\nLet k be the number of pipes we open. We have the constraint: k * t >= S (total water). But we also have constraints per lock.\n\nConsider the locks from left to right. The first lock must be filled. The water that fills the first lock can come from any pipe at or to the right of lock 1. However, note that water from a pipe at lock j (j>=1) will first fill lock j and then overflow to the right. But to fill lock 1, we must have enough water that ends up in lock 1. How much water must pass through lock 1? Exactly v1. Similarly, the water that passes through lock 2 must be at least v1+v2? Actually, the water that flows through lock 1 must be at least v1, and the water that flows through lock 2 must be at least v1+v2? Not exactly: because the water that goes to lock 1 doesn't necessarily go through lock 2.\n\nBut note: the water that fills lock 1 must come from pipes at lock 1 or to the right? Actually, water from a pipe at lock 1 goes directly to lock 1. Water from a pipe at lock 2 will first go to lock 2, and if lock 2 overflows, then the excess goes to lock 3? It does not go backward to lock 1. Therefore, lock 1 can only be filled by the pipe at lock 1? \n\nWait: the problem states that water exceeding the volume of a lock is transferred to the next lock (to the right). So water from a pipe at lock 2 does not help lock 1. Similarly, water from lock 3 only goes to lock 4 and beyond. Therefore, each lock i must be filled by the water that is poured into the system at lock i and the overflow from lock i-1? But note: the overflow from lock i-1 goes to lock i. So:\n\n  - Lock 1: must get at least v1 liters. This can come from:\n        - The pipe at lock 1 (if open) and the overflow from the left? But there is no left. So only from the pipe at lock 1 and any overflow from the left? There is no left. Therefore, the water for lock 1 must come entirely from the pipe at lock 1? \n\n  - Lock 2: gets water from:\n        - The pipe at lock 2 (if open) and the overflow from lock 1.\n\nBut note: the overflow from lock 1 is the excess water that was poured into lock 1 beyond v1. However, if we have a pipe at lock 1, we can control how much we pour there. But we are going to run for t seconds. The pipe at lock 1 will pour t liters (if open) and then the excess beyond v1 goes to lock 2.\n\nSimilarly, the pipe at lock 2 will pour t liters (if open) and then the water from lock 1 (if any) plus the water from lock 2 (if open) that exceeds v2 will go to lock 3.\n\nTherefore, the water that ends up in lock i is:\n  - The overflow from lock i-1 (which is the total water that entered lock i-1 minus v_{i-1}) plus the water from the pipe at lock i (if open) for t seconds.\n\nBut note: the water that enters lock i-1 is the overflow from lock i-2 plus the pipe at lock i-1 (if open) for t seconds.\n\nWe can define:\n  Let w_i = the total water that enters lock i (from the pipe at i and from the overflow from lock i-1).\n\nThen:\n  w_1 = (1 if pipe at 1 is open) * t\n  w_2 = (overflow from lock 1) + (1 if pipe at 2 is open) * t\n        = max(0, w_1 - v1) + (1 if pipe at 2 is open)*t\n\nBut note: the overflow from lock 1 is w_1 - v1, but we cannot have negative overflow.\n\nWe require that the water that enters lock i is at least v_i (to fill it). However, if we have more than v_i, the excess goes to the next.\n\nBut note: we require that at time t, each lock is filled. So we require:\n  w_i >= v_i   for every i.\n\nBut also, the water that enters lock i must be at least v_i, and the overflow is w_i - v_i.\n\nWe can write for lock 1:\n  w_1 = k1 * t   (where k1 is 1 if pipe1 is open, 0 otherwise) \n  and we require w_1 >= v1  => k1 * t >= v1.\n\nFor lock 2:\n  w_2 = max(0, w_1 - v1) + k2 * t\n       = max(0, k1*t - v1) + k2 * t\n  and we require w_2 >= v2.\n\nSimilarly, for lock 3:\n  w_3 = max(0, w_2 - v2) + k3 * t\n       = max(0, max(0, k1*t - v1) + k2*t - v2) + k3*t\n\nThis becomes complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe note that the entire system must get S = v1+...+vn. And we have k pipes, so total water is k*t. Therefore, k*t >= S is necessary.\n\nBut is it sufficient? Not necessarily: because of the sequential constraints.\n\nConsider the locks from left to right. The water that flows through lock i must be at least the cumulative sum up to i: V_i = v1+v2+...+vi.\n\nWhy? Because the water that flows through lock i must fill locks 1 to i. Therefore, we must have:\n\n  k1*t + k2*t + ... + k_i*t >= V_i   for every i.\n\nBut note: the water that flows through lock i is the total water that has been poured into locks 1 to i (because water doesn't skip a lock: it goes through lock 1, then lock 2, etc.). However, the water poured into a lock j (with j<=i) might not all pass through lock i? Actually, it does: because the water that is poured into lock j will eventually flow to lock j+1, then j+2, ... until it either gets stuck in a lock or overflows to the next. But the water that is poured into lock j and that is in excess of the volume of lock j will go to lock j+1, and then if lock j+1 overflows, it goes to j+2, etc. Therefore, the entire water poured into locks 1 to i (which is (k1+k2+...+ki)*t) must be at least the total volume of locks 1 to i (V_i). However, note: water poured into a lock beyond i does not help locks 1 to i.\n\nTherefore, we have for every i from 1 to n:\n\n   (k1 + k2 + ... + ki) * t >= V_i   [where V_i = v1+v2+...+vi]\n\nAnd also, the total water: (k1+...+kn)*t >= S.\n\nBut note: the condition for i=n is the same as the total water condition.\n\nSo the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n   For every i in [1, n]: (k1+...+ki) * t >= V_i.\n\nWe are to find the minimum k (the total number of pipes) such that there exists a binary assignment (k1, k2, ..., kn) in {0,1}^n with k1+...+kn = k and satisfying the above.\n\nHow to assign the pipes optimally? We want to minimize the total number of pipes. We can use a greedy idea: we want to cover the constraints with as few pipes as possible. The constraints are:\n\n   k1 + k2 + ... + ki >= ceil(V_i / t)   for each i.\n\nBut note: the left-hand side is the prefix sum of the pipe indicators. We want the entire sequence of prefix sums to be at least the values: c_i = ceil(V_i / t).\n\nHowever, note: we cannot assign fractional pipes. And the condition is:\n\n   P_i = k1+...+ki >= ceil(V_i / t)   [if V_i is not divisible by t, then we need at least floor(V_i/t)+1? Actually, we require P_i * t >= V_i, so P_i >= ceil(V_i/t).]\n\nBut note: if V_i/t is an integer, then ceil(V_i/t) = V_i/t.\n\nSo we require:\n\n   P_i >= ceil(V_i / t)   for every i.\n\nAnd we want to minimize P_n.\n\nThis is a classic problem: we have constraints on the prefix sums and we want to minimize the last prefix sum. Moreover, the constraints are:\n\n   P_1 >= c1\n   P_2 >= c2\n   ...\n   P_n >= cn\n\nand we also have that the sequence P is non-decreasing and P_i - P_{i-1} is either 0 or 1 (because each k_i is 0 or 1).\n\nBut note: actually, the k_i are 0/1, so P_i is non-decreasing and increases by at most 1 at each step.\n\nWe can solve by:\n\n   Let c_i = ceil(V_i / t) for i=1,...,n.\n\nWe require:\n   P_1 >= c1\n   P_2 >= c2\n   ...\n   P_n >= cn\n\nand we want the minimal possible P_n.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to set the k_i arbitrarily (we can choose which positions to put the pipes). We want to minimize the total number of pipes (which is P_n).\n\nHow to assign the pipes optimally? We can use a greedy algorithm that goes from right to left. However, note the constraints: n and q up to 200,000.\n\nBut note: we are going to have to answer q queries (each with a different t). So we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, we can note:\n\n   The minimal total number of pipes k_min must be at least max(ceil(V_i/(t)) for i in [1,n])? Not exactly: because the constraints are on the prefix sums. Actually, we require:\n\n      k_min >= max( ceil(V_1/t), ceil(V_2/t), ..., ceil(V_n/t) )\n\nBut is that sufficient? Consider: if we set k_min = max_i(ceil(V_i/t)), then we can set the prefix sums to be at least the required c_i? However, we must also satisfy the condition that the prefix sums are non-decreasing and increase by at most 1. \n\nBut note: if we set k_min = M, then we can set the prefix sums to be M at every position from some index onward. However, we must have:\n\n   P_1 >= c1, P_2>=c2, ... and P_n = M.\n\nWe can set the pipes arbitrarily. The minimal M that satisfies:\n\n   M >= c_i for every i, and also M must be at least ceil(S/t) (which is the same as c_n) so that condition is included.\n\nBut wait: is that sufficient? Consider:\n\n   We set k_min = M = max_i(ceil(V_i/t)).\n\n   Now, we need to assign the pipes so that the prefix sum at position i is at least c_i. Since M is at least every c_i, we can set the prefix sums to be non-decreasing and increasing by at most 1, and we can make sure that at each step i, P_i >= c_i. How?\n\n   We can start from the left: we need P_1 >= c1. Since M>=c1, we can set k1=1 if c1>0. But note: if c1=0, then we don't need a pipe at 1? However, v1>=1 so V1>=1, so c1 = ceil(v1/t) >= 1 (if t>=1). So c1>=1.\n\n   Actually, v_i>=1 and t>=1, so c_i>=1.\n\n   We can try to assign the pipes as early as possible? Actually, we want to minimize the total pipes, but we are going to use exactly M pipes. We can assign the pipes to the positions that are most critical? \n\n   However, note: the condition for the prefix sums: we require P_i >= c_i. The minimal way to achieve the prefix constraints is to put the pipes as far to the right as possible? Actually, no: we want to cover the constraints as they come. We can do:\n\n      Let P0=0.\n      For i from 1 to n:\n          We require P_i >= c_i and P_i >= P_{i-1} and P_i <= P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          So the minimal P_i we can have is max(P_{i-1}, c_i) but we cannot exceed P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          Therefore, we must have:\n             P_i = max(P_{i-1}+1, c_i)   ??? Not exactly: we can choose to put a pipe at i or not.\n\n          Actually, we can set:\n             If we do not put a pipe at i, then P_i = P_{i-1}.\n             If we put a pipe at i, then P_i = P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          So we require:\n             We must have P_i >= c_i.\n\n          Therefore, if P_{i-1} >= c_i, then we can set P_i = P_{i-1} (by not putting a pipe at i).\n          If P_{i-1} < c_i, then we must put a pipe at i, so P_i = P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          But note: if P_{i-1}+1 < c_i, then we cannot satisfy the constraint? \n\n      Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for a fixed M (which will be the total pipes) is that we can form a non-decreasing sequence P (with P_0=0, P_i in {P_{i-1}, P_{i-1}+1) such that P_i>=c_i for all i, and P_n = M.\n\n      We can simulate the greedy:\n\n          P0 = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              if P_{i-1} < c_i:\n                  P_i = P_{i-1} + 1\n              else:\n                  P_i = P_{i-1}\n\n          Then the total pipes is P_n.\n\n      But note: we are free to choose the positions? Actually, the above greedy assignment uses the minimal number of pipes to satisfy the constraints: we only put a pipe when forced. Therefore, the minimal total pipes for the given constraints is the P_n computed by:\n\n          P0 = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              P_i = max(P_{i-1}, c_i)   # but note: we can only increase by at most 1? \n\n      However, the above greedy does not account for the constraint that we can only add at most one per step. It is actually:\n\n          P_i = max(P_{i-1}, min(P_{i-1}+1, c_i))   -> no.\n\n      Actually, if c_i <= P_{i-1}, then we can set P_i = P_{i-1} (by not adding a pipe).\n      If c_i > P_{i-1}, then we must set P_i = P_{i-1}+1 (because we can only add one, and we need at least c_i, but note: if c_i > P_{i-1}+1, then we cannot achieve it?).\n\n      Therefore, the condition is that we require c_i <= P_{i-1}+1 for every i? \n\n      Actually, if c_i > P_{i-1}+1, then even if we put a pipe at i, we get P_i = P_{i-1}+1, which is less than c_i -> fails.\n\n      So the necessary condition is that for every i: c_i <= i (because the prefix sum at i cannot exceed i) and also the greedy must not get stuck. But note: we are going to set M = the result of the greedy? Actually, we are trying to compute the minimal M that can be achieved? \n\n      Alternatively, we can note: the minimal total pipes required is:\n\n          k_min = max( max_{i} (c_i - i + 1), ceil(S/t) )   ??? \n\n      Actually, consider: we require at position i: P_i >= c_i. The minimal total pipes must be at least c_n (which is ceil(S/t)) and also at least the maximum over i of (c_i - (i-1))? Why? Because at step i, we have at most i-1 pipes in the first i-1 positions, so we can have at most i-1 + 1 = i at step i. But if c_i > i, then we cannot achieve it. \n\n      However, note: we can have more than one pipe in the first i positions? Actually, we can have up to i pipes. So if c_i > i, then we require at least c_i pipes? But then at step i we have at most i pipes, so if c_i > i, then we cannot satisfy the constraint at i. Therefore, we must have c_i <= i for every i? \n\n      But note: the volumes can be large. For example, if t=1 and v1=1000, then c1 = ceil(1000/1)=1000. Then we require at step 1: P1>=1000. But we can only have at most 1 pipe at the first lock? So we cannot have 1000 pipes at the first lock. \n\n      Therefore, we must have: the constraint at lock i: c_i = ceil(V_i/t) must be at most i? \n\n      Actually, no: because we can have multiple pipes at the same lock? The problem does not say we can have multiple pipes at the same lock. The problem says: we can open pipes at some locks. Each lock has one pipe. So we can open the pipe at a lock at most once. Therefore, the maximum prefix sum at step i is i (because we can have at most i pipes in the first i locks). \n\n      Therefore, the condition for lock i: ceil(V_i/t) <= i   must hold? Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n      Similarly, we must have ceil(S/t) <= n? \n\n      But note: the problem says if it is impossible, print -1.\n\n      Therefore, for a given t, we must check:\n\n          If there exists an i such that ceil(V_i/t) > i, then it's impossible -> output -1.\n\n          Also, if ceil(S/t) > n, then it's impossible? But note: the condition for i=n is ceil(S/t) <= n, so if ceil(S/t) > n, then we output -1.\n\n      However, note: the condition for i=n is the same as the total condition. So we only need to check for every i: ceil(V_i/t) <= i? \n\n      But note: if we have an i such that ceil(V_i/t) > i, then we cannot satisfy the constraint at i.\n\n      Then, if it is possible, what is the minimal k? \n\n      We can use the greedy simulation:\n\n          P0 = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              if P_{i-1} < ceil(V_i/t):\n                  # then we must put a pipe at i\n                  P_i = P_{i-1} + 1\n              else:\n                  P_i = P_{i-1}\n\n          Then k_min = P_n.\n\n      However, note: we are free to choose the pipes arbitrarily? The greedy above uses the minimal number of pipes: we only put a pipe when forced. Therefore, the minimal total pipes is P_n.\n\n      But note: we must also satisfy the total water condition: k_min * t >= S. However, by the condition for i=n, we have P_n >= ceil(S/t), so k_min * t >= S is automatically satisfied.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm for a query t is:\n\n          Step 1: Precomputation: we have the prefix sums V_i for i=1..n (V_i = v1+...+vi).\n\n          Step 2: For i from 1 to n:\n                   c_i = ceil(V_i / t)   = (V_i + t - 1) // t   (if we use integer arithmetic)\n\n          Step 3: Check for any i: if c_i > i, then output -1.\n\n          Step 4: Otherwise, simulate:\n                   P = 0\n                   for i in range(1, n+1):\n                       if P < c_i:\n                           P = P + 1\n                       # else: P remains\n                   output P.\n\n      However, note: the constraints: n, q up to 200,000. For each query, we would do an O(n) simulation -> total O(n*q) = 200,000 * 200,000 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\n      We need a faster way.\n\n      How can we compute the greedy result without iterating for each i?\n\n      We note: the greedy assignment is:\n\n          We start with P0=0.\n          Then we traverse i=1 to n, and we set:\n             P_i = max(P_{i-1}, min(P_{i-1}+1, ...)) -> but actually we only add one when forced.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note: the minimal total pipes is the number of indices i for which the condition \"P_{i-1} < c_i\" holds.\n\n          But note: P_i is non-decreasing and we only add one when forced. Therefore, the total pipes is the number of indices i such that the condition holds.\n\n          However, what is P_{i-1}? It is the number of indices j in [1, i-1] for which the condition \"P_{j-1} < c_j\" held.\n\n          This is recursive.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note: the condition for forcing a pipe at i is that at step i, the required c_i is greater than the current count of pipes we have so far (which is the number of forced pipes in the first i-1 steps). \n\n      How about: we require that the number of pipes we have put in the first i-1 steps (call it k_{i-1}) is less than c_i. Then we put a pipe at i.\n\n      Therefore, the total pipes is the number of indices i for which:\n\n          (number of j in [1, i-1] for which we put a pipe) < c_i\n\n      But note: the number of pipes in [1, i-1] is exactly the count of forced pipes in [1, i-1]. And the condition for j in [1, i-1] is itself defined by the same rule.\n\n      This is a bit circular.\n\n      We can reframe: we are going to put a pipe at i if and only if the number of pipes we have put in the first i-1 steps is less than c_i.\n\n      Let f(i) = 1 if we put a pipe at i, else 0.\n\n      Then the condition for i: \n          sum_{j=1}^{i-1} f(j) < c_i   => then f(i)=1.\n\n      Otherwise, f(i)=0.\n\n      Then the total pipes = sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i).\n\n      How to compute this fast? \n\n      Note: c_i = ceil(V_i/t). \n\n      We can try to iterate i from 1 to n, but that is O(n) per query.\n\n      We need to precompute something? \n\n      Alternatively, note that the condition for i: \n          if the number of pipes we have put in the first i-1 steps is less than c_i, then we put one at i.\n\n      This is similar to a greedy covering. \n\n      We can note: the minimal total pipes is the maximum over i of (c_i - (i - (the number of pipes we put from i+1 to n))? Not obvious.\n\n      Another idea: the minimal total pipes k_min is the maximum over i of (c_i - (i - k_min))? \n\n      Actually, at position i, we have k_min - (number of pipes after i) = number of pipes in [1,i]. And we require that number >= c_i.\n\n      Therefore: k_min - (number of pipes after i) >= c_i   =>   number of pipes after i <= k_min - c_i.\n\n      But the number of pipes after i is at most n - i.\n\n      So we require: k_min - c_i <= n - i   =>   k_min <= n - i + c_i.\n\n      And we also require k_min >= c_i.\n\n      But note: we also have the condition that the total pipes must be at least the maximum c_i? \n\n      Actually, we have: the number of pipes in [1,i] = k_min - (pipes in [i+1, n]) >= c_i.\n\n      Since the pipes in [i+1, n] are at most n-i, we have:\n\n          k_min - (n-i) >= c_i   =>   k_min >= c_i + (n-i) - (n-i) ??? \n\n      Actually: \n          pipes_in_[1,i] = k_min - pipes_in_[i+1, n] >= c_i\n          => k_min - (n-i) <= pipes_in_[1,i] <= k_min   -> not helpful.\n\n      Alternatively, we can rearrange:\n\n          k_min >= c_i + pipes_in_[i+1, n]   -> but we don't know pipes_in_[i+1, n].\n\n      This seems difficult.\n\n      Let's try to compute k_min by scanning i from 1 to n, but we want to avoid O(n) per query.\n\n      We note: the condition for putting a pipe at i is that the current count (which is the number of pipes we have already put in the first i-1) is less than c_i. \n\n      Therefore, we put a pipe at i if and only if the number of pipes in the first i-1 is less than c_i.\n\n      How many pipes are in the first i-1? It is the number of j in [1, i-1] for which the same condition held.\n\n      This is a recursive definition that we can express as:\n\n          f(i) = 1   if   sum_{j=1}^{i-1} f(j) < c_i\n                 = 0   otherwise.\n\n      Then k_min = sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i).\n\n      This is similar to a classic problem: \"minimum number of 1's in a binary array such that the prefix sum at i is at least c_i\".\n\n      And we know that the greedy assignment (put a 1 only when forced) yields the minimal total ones.\n\n      How to compute the sum without iterating? \n\n      Notice that the sequence f(i) is non-decreasing? Actually, no: if we have a large c_i, we put a pipe, then the next c_{i+1} might be small and we don't put.\n\n      But note: the condition for i+1: \n          if the current count (which is the count up to i) is at least c_{i+1}, then we don't put.\n\n      However, the count up to i is at least the count up to i-1 (which was less than c_i, so we put at i) so the count up to i is the count up to i-1 + 1. \n\n      But c_{i+1} might be very large? \n\n      Actually, we have the condition that c_i <= i (for feasibility). \n\n      We can use binary search on k_min? \n\n      How? \n\n      We know that k_min must be at least max_i(c_i) and at most n.\n\n      But note: the condition for the entire array: we require that the prefix sums (which we denote by P_i) satisfy P_i >= c_i and P_i is non-decreasing and increases by at most 1, and P_n = k_min.\n\n      We can check for a fixed k_min: is there an assignment of pipes (a binary sequence) such that the prefix sums P_i (which are non-decreasing, P_i in [0, k_min], and P_i <= P_{i-1}+1) and P_i>=c_i for all i?\n\n      How to check for a fixed k_min? \n\n          We can simulate from left to right:\n\n             P0 = 0\n             for i from 1 to n:\n                 # The maximum we can have at i is min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min)   [because we can add at most one and we cannot exceed k_min]\n                 # But we require P_i >= c_i.\n\n                 P_i = max(c_i, P_{i-1})   # but we cannot exceed min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min)\n\n                 if P_i > min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min):\n                     then k_min is too small.\n\n          Then we require that at the end P_n <= k_min (which is automatically satisfied if we set P_i = min(max(c_i, P_{i-1}), min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min))? \n\n          Actually, we can set:\n\n             P_i = min( min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min), max(c_i, P_{i-1}) )   -> no.\n\n          Actually, we must have:\n\n             P_i must be at least max(c_i, P_{i-1]) and at most min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min). \n\n          Therefore, we require:\n\n             max(c_i, P_{i-1}) <= min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min)\n\n          Then we set P_i = max(c_i, P_{i-1])   (because we can always choose to not add a pipe if we are already above c_i, or add if we are forced and it is allowed).\n\n          But note: if we are forced (c_i > P_{i-1}) then we must set P_i = P_{i-1}+1, provided that P_{i-1}+1 <= k_min. But if c_i > P_{i-1}+1, then we cannot.\n\n          So the condition for step i is: c_i <= P_{i-1}+1 and also c_i <= k_min? \n\n          Actually, we require:\n\n             c_i <= min(P_{i-1}+1, k_min)   [if we are forced to set P_i to at least c_i, and we can only set it to at most P_{i-1}+1 and at most k_min].\n\n          But note: if c_i <= P_{i-1}, then we don't need to increase, so we set P_i = P_{i-1] (which is at least c_i) and that is valid.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for step i is:\n\n             if c_i > P_{i-1} then we require c_i <= P_{i-1}+1 and c_i <= k_min? \n\n          Actually, if c_i > P_{i-1}, then we must set P_i = P_{i-1}+1, so we require P_{i-1}+1 >= c_i and also P_{i-1}+1 <= k_min. But note: if c_i > k_min, then we fail.\n\n          So the condition for step i is:\n\n             c_i <= k_min   and   if c_i > P_{i-1] then we require c_i <= P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          But note: if c_i > P_{i-1}, then we set P_i = P_{i-1}+1, and then we require P_i = P_{i-1}+1 >= c_i, so we require P_{i-1}+1 >= c_i. \n\n          Therefore, the condition for step i is:\n\n             c_i <= min(k_min, P_{i-1}+1)\n\n          Then we set:\n\n             P_i = \n                 if c_i <= P_{i-1}: then P_i = P_{i-1]\n                 else: P_i = P_{i-1}+1\n\n          But note: if c_i > P_{i-1} and c_i <= P_{i-1}+1, then we set P_i = P_{i-1}+1.\n\n          And if c_i > P_{i-1}+1, then we fail.\n\n          However, we already have the global condition that c_i <= i (for feasibility) and since P_{i-1} is at most i-1, then P_{i-1}+1 = i, and we have c_i <= i (by the feasibility condition), so c_i <= i = (i-1)+1 = P_{max possible at i-1}+1. But note: P_{i-1} might be less than i-1? \n\n          Actually, the maximum P_{i-1} is min(k_min, i-1). So if k_min >= i, then P_{i-1} can be up to i-1, so P_{i-1}+1 = i, and we have c_i<=i, so it's okay.\n\n          But if k_min < i, then P_{i-1} is at most k_min, so P_{i-1}+1 <= k_min+1. And we require c_i <= k_min+1? \n\n          However, we also have the condition that c_i <= i, but if k_min+1 < c_i <= i, then we fail.\n\n          Therefore, the feasibility condition per i is: c_i <= min(i, k_min+ ? ) -> actually from the global we have c_i<=i, but now we require additionally for the simulation: c_i <= k_min+1? \n\n          But note: in the simulation, we require c_i <= P_{i-1}+1, and P_{i-1} is at most min(i-1, k_min). So the condition is c_i <= min(i, k_min+1). \n\n          And we already have the global condition c_i<=i, so the additional constraint is c_i <= k_min+1.\n\n          Therefore, for a fixed k_min, the simulation will fail if there exists an i such that c_i > k_min+1.\n\n          But note: if k_min+1 >= i, then since c_i<=i, we have c_i<=i<=k_min+1, so it's okay. Therefore, the only problematic i are those for which i > k_min+1. For such i, we require c_i <= k_min+1.\n\n          So the condition for feasibility of k_min is:\n\n             for all i: c_i <= min(i, k_min+1)\n\n          But note: we already have the global condition that c_i<=i (which is the same as min(i, k_min+1) when i<=k_min+1). For i>k_min+1, we require c_i<=k_min+1.\n\n          Therefore, we require:\n\n             max_{i: i>k_min+1} c_i <= k_min+1.\n\n          And also, we require that the simulation doesn't fail? Actually, the simulation will also fail if at some step i we have c_i > P_{i-1}+1, but if we have the condition c_i<=k_min+1 and also we have the global c_i<=i, then in the simulation:\n\n             P_{i-1} is at least the number of indices j in [1, i-1] for which c_j > P_{j-1} (which forced a pipe) and also P_{i-1} is at most min(i-1, k_min). \n\n          But note: we are not guaranteed that P_{i-1} is at least c_i-1? \n\n          However, we have the condition that for any i, the minimal prefix sum we can achieve at i is the number of indices j in [1,i] for which c_j > (the count of pipes in [1,j-1]). \n\n          This is complex.\n\n      Given the complexity and the constraints, we need an efficient solution.\n\n      Let's go back to the greedy simulation:\n\n          k_min = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              if k_min < c_i:\n                  k_min += 1\n\n          Then output k_min.\n\n      Why is this valid? \n\n          We maintain k_min as the current number of pipes. At step i, if the current number of pipes (which is the number of pipes we have already placed in the first i-1 locks) is less than c_i, then we are forced to put a pipe at i, so we increment.\n\n          This is exactly the greedy simulation.\n\n      But note: the condition for feasibility is that at the moment we put the pipe at i, we require c_i <= k_min+1? Because we are going to set k_min = k_min+1, and before the increment k_min (the current count) is less than c_i, and after the increment we have k_min = old_k_min+1, and we require that this is at least c_i? \n\n          We have: old_k_min < c_i, and then we set new_k_min = old_k_min+1, so we require new_k_min >= c_i? \n\n          But note: we only put a pipe if old_k_min < c_i, and then new_k_min = old_k_min+1. So we require old_k_min+1 >= c_i? \n\n          But we don't check that. We only check old_k_min < c_i. \n\n          Therefore, if c_i = old_k_min+2, then we put a pipe and then new_k_min = old_k_min+1 = c_i-1, which is still less than c_i -> fails.\n\n          So we must have the condition that when we are forced (old_k_min < c_i), then we require old_k_min+1 >= c_i? \n\n          But note: we have the global condition that c_i <= i. And at step i, we have old_k_min <= i-1. And we are going to set new_k_min = old_k_min+1 <= i. And c_i<=i. But if c_i = i, then we require old_k_min < i and then we set new_k_min = old_k_min+1, which might be less than i? \n\n          Example: i=3, c_i=3, and old_k_min=1 -> then we put a pipe, new_k_min=2, which is less than 3 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, we must have the condition that c_i <= old_k_min+1. But if we are forced (old_k_min < c_i) and c_i > old_k_min+1, then it's impossible.\n\n          But wait: we already have the global condition that c_i<=i. And we also have the condition that for the greedy to work, we require that at step i: c_i <= old_k_min+1.\n\n          How is old_k_min related to i? old_k_min is the number of pipes we have put in the first i-1 steps, which is at most i-1. And we require c_i <= old_k_min+1 <= i.\n\n          But if c_i = i, then we require old_k_min+1 >= i, which means old_k_min >= i-1. But old_k_min is at most i-1, so we require old_k_min = i-1. \n\n          How can we have old_k_min = i-1? That means we put a pipe at every lock from 1 to i-1. Then at lock i, we have old_k_min = i-1, and we require c_i = i, so we must put a pipe at i -> then new_k_min = i, which is >= i -> works.\n\n          But what if we didn't put a pipe at one of the first i-1? Then old_k_min < i-1, and then if c_i = i, we have old_k_min < i and we put a pipe, then new_k_min = old_k_min+1 <= i-1+1 = i, but we require new_k_min>=c_i=i, so we require old_k_min+1>=i -> old_k_min>=i-1. Therefore, we must have put a pipe at every lock from 1 to i-1.\n\n          Therefore, the greedy simulation works if we have the global condition that c_i<=i for every i. And then the simulation:\n\n             k_min = 0\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 if k_min < c_i:\n                     # then we must put a pipe at i\n                     if c_i > k_min+1:\n                         # then even after putting, we have k_min+1 < c_i -> fail\n                         break   # and then we would output -1 for the query\n                     k_min += 1\n\n          But note: if we break, then we output -1. Otherwise, after the loop, we output k_min.\n\n          However, we already have the global condition that c_i<=i, and note that k_min+1 is at least 1 and increases by at most 1 per step. At step i, k_min (before updating) is at most i-1, so k_min+1 is at most i. And c_i<=i. But we require c_i<=k_min+1? \n\n          Actually, we don't have that. We only know c_i<=i. \n\n          Therefore, we must check at each forced step: is c_i <= k_min+1? \n\n          But if c_i > k_min+1, then even after putting a pipe, we get k_min+1 which is < c_i -> fails.\n\n          So the algorithm per query:\n\n             total = 0\n             current_pipes = 0\n             V = [0]  # we will compute prefix sums on the fly? Actually, we have the prefix sums V_i.\n\n             # Precomputation: we have the array of prefix sums V_prefix[0..n]: \n             #   V_prefix[0]=0, V_prefix[i] = v1+...+vi.\n\n             # For i from 1 to n:\n             #   c_i = ceil(V_prefix[i] / t)   # but note: V_prefix[i] = V_i\n\n             # But we can compute the prefix sums once for the entire program.\n\n             # However, note: we have q queries, so we cannot precompute for each query the entire list of c_i (which is O(n)) for each query -> 200000*200000 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\n          Therefore, we need to avoid iterating over i for each query.\n\n      How to avoid iterating over i for each query?\n\n      We note: the greedy simulation is:\n\n          k = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              c_i = (V_i + t - 1) // t   # integer ceil\n              if c_i > i: \n                  # we break and output -1 for the entire query? \n                  # But note: we have to check for every i? \n                  # Actually, we can break as soon as we find one i with c_i>i, then output -1.\n              if k < c_i:\n                  if c_i > k+1:\n                      # impossible at step i\n                      k = -1\n                      break\n                  k += 1\n\n          Then output k.\n\n      But note: we also have to check the global condition that c_i<=i? Actually, the condition c_i>i is already checked, and if we pass that, then c_i<=i. And then in the forced step, we require c_i<=k+1? \n\n      However, if we have c_i<=i, and k is at most i-1 (because we are at step i and we've done i-1 steps), then k+1<=i. But we require c_i<=k+1? \n\n      Why is it that if c_i<=i and we are forced (k < c_i) then we must have c_i<=k+1? \n\n          Because k is the number of pipes we have put in the first i-1 steps, and we know that the minimal number of pipes required in the first i-1 steps is at least the number of indices j in [1, i-1] for which the condition held. But note: we have the condition that for j in [1, i-1]: c_j<=j. And we are simulating the greedy. \n\n          However, it is possible that k (the count) is less than c_i, but c_i might be greater than k+1? \n\n          Example: \n             n=3, t=1, volumes = [1, 1, 3]\n             V1 = 1 -> c1 = ceil(1/1)=1\n             V2 = 2 -> c2 = 2\n             V3 = 5 -> c3 = 5 -> but 5>3 -> so we break at i=3 and output -1.\n\n          But what if we have:\n             n=3, t=2, volumes = [1,1,3]\n             V1=1 -> c1 = ceil(1/2)=1\n             V2=2 -> c2 = ceil(2/2)=1\n             V3=5 -> c3 = ceil(5/2)=3\n\n          Now, check: c1=1<=1 -> ok, c2=1<=2 -> ok, c3=3<=3 -> ok.\n\n          Now simulate:\n             i=1: k=0, c1=1 -> 0<1 -> then we check: 1<=0+1 -> 1<=1 -> ok, so k=1.\n             i=2: k=1, c2=1 -> 1>=1 -> skip, k remains 1.\n             i=3: k=1, c3=3 -> 1<3 -> then check: 3<=1+1? -> 3<=2 -> false -> fail.\n\n          Therefore, we output -1.\n\n          But is it really impossible? \n             We require at lock 3: 3 liters. \n             Total water needed = 5 liters. \n             We have t=2 seconds, so we need at least ceil(5/2)=3 pipes? \n             But we only have 3 locks, so we can open 3 pipes. \n             Then total water = 3*2 = 6 >=5.\n\n          Now, check the prefix constraints:\n\n             i=1: P1 = k1 (pipe at 1) -> must be at least 1 -> if we open pipe1, then at t=2, we have 2 liters in lock1 -> fills lock1 and overflows 1 liter to lock2.\n             i=2: P2 = (overflow from lock1: 1 liter) + (pipe2 if open) \n                   if we open pipe2: then we add 2 liters to lock2 -> total in lock2: 1+2=3, but lock2 only has volume 1 -> so it fills lock2 and overflows 3-1 = 2 liters to lock3.\n             i=3: P3 = (overflow from lock2: 2 liters) + (pipe3 if open: 2 liters) -> total 4 liters, which is more than 3.\n\n          But wait: we have 3 pipes: open at 1,2,3. Then:\n\n             Lock1: gets 2 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 1 liter to lock2.\n             Lock2: gets 1 (overflow) + 2 (from pipe) = 3 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 2 liters to lock3.\n             Lock3: gets 2 (overflow) + 2 (from pipe) = 4 liters -> fills (3 liters) and 1 liter overflows.\n\n          So it works. Why did our greedy simulation fail?\n\n          The greedy simulation only puts a pipe when forced. But we are allowed to put extra pipes. However, the problem asks for the minimal number of pipes. \n\n          In this example, the minimal number of pipes is 3? But we have to use 3 pipes? \n\n          However, note: the total water requirement: 5 liters, and 3 pipes * 2 seconds = 6>=5, so 3 is acceptable. But is there a way with 2 pipes?\n\n          Try with 2 pipes:\n\n             Option1: open pipe1 and pipe2:\n                 Lock1: 2 liters -> fills and overflows 1 to lock2.\n                 Lock2: 1 (overflow) + 2 (pipe2) = 3 -> fills and overflows 2 to lock3.\n                 Lock3: 2 liters -> but needs 3 -> not filled.\n\n             Option2: open pipe1 and pipe3:\n                 Lock1: 2 liters -> fills and overflows 1 to lock2.\n                 Lock2: 1 liter -> not filled (needs 1, so it is filled) -> then overflows 0 to lock3.\n                 Lock3: 2 liters -> not filled (needs 3).\n\n             Option3: open pipe2 and pipe3:\n                 Lock1: 0 -> not filled.\n\n          Therefore, we need 3 pipes.\n\n          But our greedy simulation for minimal pipes should output 3? \n\n          How does the greedy simulation work for this example?\n\n             i=1: c1=ceil(1/2)=1 -> k=0<1 -> and 1<=0+1 (which is 1) -> so k=1.\n             i=2: c2=ceil(2/2)=1 -> k=1>=1 -> skip.\n             i=3: c3=ceil(5/2)=3 -> k=1<3 -> then check: 3<=1+1? -> 3<=2 -> false -> output -1.\n\n          This is a problem.\n\n      What is the issue? \n\n          The greedy simulation we described is for the assignment that minimizes the number of pipes, but it assumes that we can achieve the prefix constraints by only putting a pipe when forced. However, in this example, we are forced at i=1 and i=3, but not at i=2. But then at i=3, we are forced and we cannot put a pipe because it would only bring the count to 2, which is less than 3? \n\n          But note: we can put a pipe at i=2 even if we are not forced? \n\n          The greedy simulation we described is the minimal assignment: it only puts a pipe when forced. But in this example, the minimal assignment (which puts pipes at 1 and 3) does not work because then the prefix constraint at i=3 fails: \n             P1 = 1 (pipe at 1) -> satisfies c1=1.\n             P2 = 1 (only pipe at 1) -> satisfies c2=1.\n             P3 = 2 (pipes at 1 and 3) -> but we require 3.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal assignment (using only 2 pipes) does not work. We need 3 pipes.\n\n          How to find the minimal number of pipes? We must use at least the number of pipes that the greedy simulation would use if we were allowed to put pipes even when not forced? \n\n          But note: the problem is to minimize the total number of pipes. The greedy simulation we did (only when forced) gives a lower bound, but it might not be achievable. We then need to increase the number of pipes.\n\n      Revised approach:\n\n          We know that the minimal number of pipes k_min must satisfy:\n             k_min >= ceil(S/t)   [total water]\n             and for every i: k_min >= ceil(V_i/t)   [because the water that flows through lock i is at least V_i, and it is at most k_min * t, so k_min * t >= V_i -> k_min>=ceil(V_i/t)].\n\n          But wait: the water that flows through lock i is the total water from the first i pipes? No, it is the total water from the pipes in the first i locks. And there are at most i pipes in the first i locks, but the total water from those pipes is (number of pipes in the first i locks) * t.\n\n          And we require that to be at least V_i. Therefore, the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(V_i/t). \n\n          Therefore, the entire sequence of prefix sums of the pipe indicators (P_i) must be at least c_i = ceil(V_i/t).\n\n          And we want to minimize the total pipes P_n.\n\n          This is a problem of finding the minimal P_n such that there is a non-decreasing sequence (P_i) with P_i in [0, P_n], P_i<=P_{i-1}+1, and P_i>=c_i for all i.\n\n          We can compute the minimal P_n by:\n\n             P0 = 0\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 P_i = max( P_{i-1}, c_i, P_n - (n-i) )   -> no, because we don't know P_n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy that goes backwards:\n\n             Let P_n = c_n.\n             For i from n-1 down to 1:\n                 P_i = max( c_i, P_{i+1}-1 )\n\n          Then the total pipes is P_n.\n\n          But is this valid? \n\n          We require P_i >= c_i and P_i >= P_{i-1} and P_i <= P_{i-1}+1. \n\n          In the backward pass, we ensure:\n             P_i >= c_i\n             P_i >= P_{i+1}-1   [which means P_{i+1} <= P_i+1]\n\n          And we set the total pipes to P_n.\n\n          Then we can set the pipe at i to be 1 if P_i > P_{i-1} (with P0=0). \n\n          But note: we haven't defined P0 in the backward pass.\n\n          Example: \n             n=3, t=2, volumes = [1,1,3] -> \n                 V1=1, c1=ceil(1/2)=1\n                 V2=2, c2=ceil(2/2)=1\n                 V3=5, c3=ceil(5/2)=3\n\n             Start: P3 = c3 = 3.\n             i=2: P2 = max(c2, P3-1) = max(1, 2) = 2.\n             i=1: P1 = max(c1, P2-1) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\n          Then the sequence: P1=1, P2=2, P3=3.\n          This is non-decreasing and increases by at most 1. \n          And we can achieve it by putting a pipe at every lock.\n\n          Then the total pipes is 3.\n\n          But is there a sequence with P_n=2? \n             We require P3=2.\n             Then i=2: P2 = max(c2, P3-1)=max(1,1)=1.\n             i=1: P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,0)=1.\n             Sequence: P1=1, P2=1, P3=2.\n          Check the constraints:\n             i=1: P1=1>=1 -> ok.\n             i=2: P2=1>=1 -> ok.\n             i=3: P3=2>=3 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, minimal P_n=3.\n\n          Another example: \n             n=2, volumes=[1,1], t=1.\n             c1=ceil(1/1)=1, c2=ceil(2/1)=2.\n             Backward:\n                 P2 = c2 = 2.\n                 P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,1)=1.\n             Total pipes=2.\n\n          Can we do with 1 pipe? \n             If we put the pipe at lock1: \n                 Lock1: 1 liter at t=1 -> filled, then overflows 0.\n                 Lock2: 0 -> not filled.\n             If we put the pipe at lock2:\n                 Lock1: 0 -> not filled.\n             So we need 2 pipes.\n\n          Therefore, the backward greedy gives the minimal P_n.\n\n          Algorithm for a query t:\n\n             Step 1: Compute the prefix sums V_i for i=1..n.\n             Step 2: Check for any i in [1,n]: if ceil(V_i/t) > i, then output -1.\n             Step 3: Set an array P of length n+1 (0-indexed: we need P[0]..P[n]).\n                     P[n] = c_n = ceil(V_n/t)\n                     for i from n-1 down to 0 (for i from n-1 to 0, but note our c_i is defined for i>=1) -> \n                     Actually, we only need P for i=1..n.\n\n                     Let P[i] for i=n, n-1, ..., 1:\n                         if i==n: P[i] = c_n\n                         else: P[i] = max(c_i, P[i+1]-1)\n\n             Step 4: The minimal total pipes is P[1]? \n\n                     But note: P[1] is the prefix sum at lock1. The total pipes is P[n] (the prefix sum at lock n).\n\n                     However, in the backward pass, we set P[n]=c_n, and then we compute P[n-1]=max(c_{n-1}, P[n]-1), and so on. The total pipes is the final P[n] we set at the beginning? \n\n                     But then we are not changing P[n]. \n\n                     Actually, the total pipes is P_n = P[n] (which is c_n) might not be the minimal? \n\n                     In the example above: \n                         n=3, we set P[3]=3, then P[2]=max(1,3-1)=2, P[1]=max(1,2-1)=1.\n                         Then the total pipes is P[3]=3.\n\n                     But could we have a sequence with P[3]=3, but then the total pipes is 3.\n\n                     However, note: the backward pass ensures that we have a non-decreasing sequence with increases by at most 1, and we start with P[n]=c_n. But is c_n the minimal possible P_n? \n\n                     We know that P_n must be at least c_n. So we set it to c_n, and then we work backwards. This gives a valid sequence. And it is minimal in the total pipes because we set P_n to the minimal possible value (c_n).\n\n                     But is it always sufficient? \n\n                     Consider: \n                         We require for i: P_i>=c_i and P_{i}>=P_{i+1}-1.\n                         We set P_n = c_n.\n                         Then P_{n-1} = max(c_{n-1}, c_n-1).\n                         This is the minimal possible for P_{n-1} given that we want P_n=c_n.\n\n                     Therefore, the total pipes is c_n.\n\n                     However, wait: the total water condition: we require P_n * t >= V_n, which is exactly c_n = ceil(V_n/t) -> so it's satisfied.\n\n                     And for the other constraints: \n                         For i=n-1: P_{n-1} = max(c_{n-1}, c_n-1) >= c_{n-1} -> ok.\n                         And for i=n-2: similarly.\n\n                     But is it possible that by setting P_n = c_n, we cannot assign the pipes to satisfy the prefix constraints? \n\n                         The backward pass constructs a valid sequence: \n                             P_i = max(c_i, P_{i+1}-1)\n\n                         Then we have P_i >= c_i and P_{i+1} <= P_i+1.\n\n                         And we can achieve the sequence by a binary assignment: \n                             Let k_i = P_i - P_{i-1] for i>=1 (with P0=0), then k_i is either 0 or 1.\n\n                         Why? \n                             P_i >= P_{i-1} (because P_i = max(c_i, P_{i+1}-1) and we are going backwards, but note: we need to ensure non-decreasing? Actually, we have P_i >= P_{i+1}-1, but going backwards we have P_i might be greater than P_{i+1}? \n\n                         Example: \n                             n=2: \n                                 P2 = c2 = 2.\n                                 P1 = max(c1, P2-1) = max(1,1)=1.\n                             Then k1 = P1 - P0 = 1, k2 = P2 - P1 = 1.\n\n                         But what if:\n                             n=2, c1=1, c2=1.\n                                 P2=1.\n                                 P1 = max(1, 1-1)=max(1,0)=1.\n                             Then k1=1, k2=0? -> but then P2 = k1+k2 = 1, so it works.\n\n                         How to assign? \n                             We have P_i = number of pipes in the first i locks.\n\n                             We can recover the assignment at lock i: \n                                 k_i = 1 if P_i > P_{i-1}, else 0.\n\n                         In the example: \n                             P0=0, P1=1 -> k1=1.\n                             P2=1 -> k2 = P2 - P1 = 0.\n\n                         This is valid.\n\n                     Therefore, the minimal total pipes is c_n = ceil(V_n/t) and then we do the backward pass to get a valid sequence. But note: the backward pass might force some earlier P_i to be larger than c_i, but that is allowed.\n\n                     However, wait: the total pipes is P_n = c_n, but the backward pass might show that we need a larger value at an earlier position, but that doesn't increase the total pipes.\n\n                     Therefore, the answer for a query t is:\n\n                         if there exists i such that ceil(V_i/t) > i: \n                             return -1\n                         else:\n                             return ceil(V_n/t)\n\n          But is that true? \n\n          Example: n=2, volumes=[2,1], t=2.\n             V1=2, c1=ceil(2/2)=1.\n             V2=3, c2=ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n             Check: c1=1<=1 (i=1) -> ok, c2=2<=2 -> ok.\n\n             Then answer = c2=2.\n\n          But can we do with 2 pipes? \n             We can open two pipes: \n                 Option: open lock1 and lock2.\n                 Lock1: 2 liters (from pipe1) -> fills (volume2) and overflows 0.\n                 Lock2: 2 liters (from pipe2) -> fills (volume1) and overflows 1.\n                 -> works.\n\n          Example: n=2, volumes=[2,1], t=1.\n             c1=ceil(2/1)=2 -> but 2>1 (i=1) -> output -1.\n\n          But is it possible? \n             Total water needed=3, and we have at most 2 pipes * 1 second = 2 < 3 -> impossible.\n\n          Example: n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=2: \n             c1=ceil(1/2)=1<=1 -> ok.\n             c2=ceil(2/2)=1<=2 -> ok.\n             c3=ceil(5/2)=3<=3 -> ok.\n             then answer = c3=3.\n\n          But we saw that we need 3 pipes.\n\n          However, consider: \n             n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=3.\n             c1=ceil(1/3)=1.\n             c2=ceil(2/3)=1.\n             c3=ceil(5/3)=2.\n             then answer = 2.\n\n          Can we do with 2 pipes?\n             Total water=2*3=6>=5.\n             We need to assign 2 pipes.\n\n             Try: open pipe1 and pipe3.\n                 Lock1: 3 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 2 to lock2.\n                 Lock2: 2 liters -> fills (1 liter) and overflows 1 to lock3.\n                 Lock3: 1 (overflow) + 3 (pipe3) = 4 -> fills (3 liters) and overflows 1.\n                 -> works.\n\n          How does the backward pass work for this example?\n             P3 = c3 = 2.\n             P2 = max(c2, P3-1)=max(1,1)=1.\n             P1 = max(c1, P2-1)=max(1,0)=1.\n             Then the assignment: \n                 k1 = P1 - P0 = 1-0 = 1.\n                 k2 = P2 - P1 = 1-1 = 0.\n                 k3 = P3 - P2 = 2-1 = 1.\n             So pipes at 1 and 3.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for a query t is ceil(V_n/t) if for every i, ceil(V_i/t)<=i, else -1.\n\n      But wait: what about the example we had earlier that failed the forward simulation? \n          n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=2: \n             c1=1, c2=1, c3=3, and we return 3.\n\n      However, consider a different example:\n          n=3, volumes=[3,1,1], t=2.\n          V1=3, c1=ceil(3/2)=2.\n          V2=4, c2=ceil(4/2)=2.\n          V3=5, c3=ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n          Check: \n             i=1: c1=2>1 -> fails, so output -1.\n\n          But is it really impossible? \n             Total water=5, and we have 3 pipes * 2 seconds = 6>=5.\n             However, the constraint for lock1: we need 3 liters. \n                 The only way to get water to lock1 is from a pipe at lock1. \n                 We must open at least ceil(3/2)=2 pipes at lock1? But we can only open one pipe per lock.\n\n          Therefore, we must have at least 2 pipes in the first lock? But there is only one lock1. \n\n          So it is impossible.\n\n      Therefore, the solution for a query t is:\n\n          S = total volume = V_n\n          if ceil(S/t) > n: \n              return -1   # because we only have n locks, so at most n pipes, and n*t < S -> impossible, but note: ceil(S/t)>n means S/t > n -> S>n*t -> impossible.\n\n          Also, for i from 1 to n:\n              if ceil(V_i/t) > i:\n                  return -1\n\n          Otherwise, return ceil(S/t)\n\n      But note: the condition ceil(S/t)>n is already included in the condition for i=n: ceil(V_n/t) > n. So we can just do:\n\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              c_i = (V_i + t - 1) // t\n              if c_i > i:\n                  print(-1)\n                  break\n          else:\n              c_n = (S + t - 1) // t   # which is the same as the last c_i, so we can use c_i for i=n.\n              print(c_n)\n\n      However, note: we have to do this for each query, and n and q up to 200,000 -> 200000*200000 = 40e9 iterations, which is too slow.\n\n      We need to avoid iterating over i for each query.\n\n      How to check for every i: ceil(V_i/t) <= i, without iterating over i?\n\n          We require: for all i, ceil(V_i/t) <= i   <==>   for all i, V_i/t <= i   (because ceil(V_i/t) is the smallest integer >= V_i/t, and if V_i/t > i, then ceil(V_i/t) > i; and if V_i/t<=i, then ceil(V_i/t)<=i).\n\n          But wait: ceil(V_i/t) could be an integer and equal to i, then V_i/t could be in (i-1, i]? \n\n          Actually: ceil(V_i/t) <= i   if and only if V_i/t <= i   ??? \n\n          Example: V_i=3, t=2, i=2: ceil(3/2)=2<=2 -> yes, and 3/2=1.5<=2 -> yes.\n\n          Example: V_i=2, t=1, i=2: ceil(2/1)=2<=2 -> yes, 2/1=2<=2.\n\n          Example: V_i=3, t=1, i=2: ceil(3/1)=3>2 -> fails, and 3/1=3>2.\n\n          Therefore, the condition ceil(V_i/t)<=i is equivalent to V_i <= i * t.\n\n          So we require: for every i in [1,n], V_i <= i * t.\n\n          And also, we require V_n <= n * t (which is included).\n\n      Therefore, for a query t:\n\n          if max_{i=1..n} (V_i) > n * t: \n              then there is an i (namely the one with V_i = max) that has V_i > i * t? Not necessarily: because i is the index, and the maximum might occur at a large i.\n\n          Actually, we require for every i: V_i <= i * t.\n\n          So we need: M = max_{i=1..n} (V_i / i)  [but note: we want V_i <= i * t  <=>  V_i / i <= t]\n\n          Then the condition is: M <= t.\n\n          But note: V_i is the prefix sum, not the individual volume. \n\n          Example: volumes = [3,1,1] -> \n             V1=3, V2=4, V3=5.\n             Then we require:\n                 i=1: 3<=1*t -> t>=3.\n                 i=2: 4<=2*t -> t>=2.\n                 i=3: 5<=3*t -> t>= ceil(5/3)=2.\n\n             The most stringent is i=1: t>=3.\n\n          Therefore, for a given t, we require:\n\n             t >= max_{i=1..n} ( ceil(V_i / i) )? \n\n          But note: ceil(V_i/i) might not be the right thing. We require V_i <= i * t, which is equivalent to t >= ceil(V_i / i) ? \n\n          Actually: \n             V_i <= i * t   <==>  t >= V_i / i.\n\n          But t is an integer, so we require t >= ceil(V_i / i) ? \n\n          Example: V_i=3, i=2: then we require t>= ceil(3/2)=2. \n             If t=2, then 3<=2*2 -> 3<=4 -> true.\n             If t=1, then 3<=2 -> false.\n\n          But ceil(3/2)=2, so t>=2 is required.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: t >= ceil(V_i / i) for every i.\n\n          Which is equivalent to: t >= max_{i} ceil(V_i / i).\n\n          However, note: ceil(V_i/i) = (V_i + i - 1) // i.\n\n      Therefore, for a query t:\n\n          condition1: t >= max_i ( ceil(V_i / i) ) \n          condition2: t >= ceil(S / n)   [for the total water? but note: condition for i=n: V_n <= n*t, which is the same as condition1 for i=n, and condition1 for i=n is ceil(V_n/n) <= t, which is the same as V_n <= n*t, which is necessary for the total water? but note: the total water condition is V_n <= (number of pipes)*t, and the number of pipes is at most n, so if V_n <= n*t, then it is possible to have enough total water. However, we also have the per-prefix constraint which is stronger? \n\n          But note: the per-prefix constraint for i=n is V_n <= n*t, which is the same as condition1 for i=n. And the total water condition is automatically satisfied if we have at least ceil(V_n/t) pipes, and we are going to use ceil(V_n/t) which is at most n (because V_n<=n*t -> ceil(V_n/t)<=n).\n\n          Therefore, we only need condition1.\n\n      So algorithm for a query t:\n\n          Let M = max_{i=1..n} ceil(V_i / i)   [but note: V_i is the prefix sum up to i]\n\n          If t < M:\n              print(-1)\n          else:\n              print(ceil(V_n / t))\n\n      But note: ceil(V_n/t) might be fractional, and we use integer ceil.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the condition for the total water is that the total water from the pipes (which is (number of pipes)*t) must be at least V_n. The minimal number of pipes is ceil(V_n/t).\n\n      Example: n=1, volume=[5], t=3 -> ceil(5/3)=2.\n\n      But does it pass the condition? \n          M = ceil(V_1/1)=ceil(5/1)=5.\n          t=3<5 -> output -1? \n\n      But wait: for i=1: V_1=5, and we require 5<=1*t=3 -> fails. So output -1.\n\n      Therefore, it is consistent.\n\n      But note: we have to compute M = max_i ceil(V_i/i) for i in [1,n]. \n\n      How to compute M quickly? \n\n          We can precompute an array A_i = ceil(V_i / i) for i=1..n, and then M = max(A_i).\n\n          But V_i is the prefix sum: V_i = v1+v2+...+vi.\n\n          We can precompute the prefix sums V[1..n] at the beginning.\n\n          Then for each i, A_i = (V[i] + i - 1) // i   [integer ceil division]\n\n          Then M = max(A_i for i in [1,n])\n\n          Precomputation: O(n).\n\n      Then for each query t:\n\n          if t < M:\n              print(-1)\n          else:\n              print( (V[n] + t - 1) // t )\n\n      Note: V[n] is the total volume.\n\n      Complexity: O(n) for precomputation and O(1) per query -> total O(n+q).\n\n      Let's test with the examples:\n\n          Example1: n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=2.\n             V1=1 -> A1 = ceil(1/1)=1.\n             V2=2 -> A2 = ceil(2/2)=1.\n             V3=5 -> A3 = ceil(5/3)= ceil(1.66)=2.\n             M = max(1,1,2)=2.\n             t=2>=2 -> then output ceil(5/2)= (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2=3.\n\n          Example2: n=3, volumes=[1,1,3], t=3.\n             M=2 (as above), t=3>=2 -> output ceil(5/3)= (5+3-1)//3 = 7//3 = 2.\n\n          Example3: n=3, volumes=[3,1,1], t=2.\n             V1=3 -> A1=ceil(3/1)=3.\n             V2=4 -> A2=ceil(4/2)=2.\n             V3=5 -> A3=ceil(5/3)=2.\n             M=3.\n             t=2<3 -> output -1.\n\n      Therefore, we can write:\n\n          Precomputation:\n             n = ... \n             a = list of n integers\n             V = [0]*(n+1)\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 V[i] = V[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n             M = 0\n             for i in range(1, n+1):\n                 # compute ceil(V[i] / i)\n                 # ceil(p/q) = (p+q-1)//q\n                 value = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n                 if value > M:\n                     M = value\n\n          Then for each query t:\n                 if t < M:\n                     print(-1)\n                 else:\n                     # total_water = V[n]\n                     pipes = (V[n] + t - 1) // t\n                     print(pipes)\n\n      However, note: the condition for the total water is automatically satisfied by the minimal number of pipes = ceil(V[n]/t) because we have t>=M and M>= ceil(V[n]/n) (since i=n is included) and then V[n] <= n*M <= n*t, so ceil(V[n]/t) <= n, which is achievable.\n\n      But note: the condition t>=M ensures that for every i, V_i <= i*t, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the per-prefix water constraint.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n          from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n          data = stdin.read().split()\n          n = int(data[0])\n          a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n          q = int(data[1+n])\n\n          # Precompute prefix sums V[1..n]\n          V = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              V[i] = V[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          # Precompute M = max_{i=1..n} ceil(V[i]/i)\n          M = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              # ceil(V[i] / i) = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n              val = (V[i] + i - 1) // i\n              if val > M:\n                  M = val\n\n          # Now process queries\n          queries = list(map(int, data[1+n+1:1+n+1+q]))\n          out_lines = []\n          for t in queries:\n              if t < M:\n                  out_lines.append(\"-1\")\n              else:\n                  # total volume = V[n]\n                  # minimal pipes = ceil(V[n] / t)\n                  pipes = (V[n] + t - 1) // t\n                  out_lines.append(str(pipes))\n\n          print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n      But note: the problem says that the input has q queries, each on one line.\n\n      However, we read all at once.\n\n      This meets the complexity.\n\n      However, note: the problem constraints: n, q up to 200,000, and V[i] up to 10^9, so the computation of M is O(n) and the queries are O(q), which is acceptable.\n\n      Let's run the provided example in the note:\n\n          \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1, 3, 4 the answer is -1. ... \"\n\n          The example input is not provided in the problem statement, but the sample input is:\n\n          Input: \n             5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             3 2\n             4 2\n             3 1\n             2 1\n             2 2\n\n          But wait, that is for program1.py.\n\n      We are given program2.py separately.\n\n      The sample for program2.py is:\n\n          Input Specification: \n             The first lines contains one integer n \n             The second lines contains n integers \n             The third line contains one integer q \n             Each of the next q lines contains one integer t_j\n\n          Example: \n             n=3, volumes = [1, 1, 3], q=2, queries = [2, 3]\n\n          Output: \n             For t=2: -1? (because M=2, t=2>=2 -> then pipes = ceil(5/2)=3) -> but the example says in the note for the first example test (which we don't have) that queries 1,3,4 are -1, and the sixth query is 3.\n\n          But we don't have the example input.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4.\" -> so the sixth query is not -1.\n\n      We'll assume our solution is correct.\n\n      Therefore, we complete program2.py as above.\n\n      But note: the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n          _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n          volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n          queries = map(int, queries)\n\n          s = t_min = 0\n          for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n              s += v\n              div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n              t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n          res = []\n          for q in map(int, queries):\n              if q < t_min:\n                  ans = -1\n              else:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              res.append(ans)\n\n          print('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))\n\n      We see that the provided code already computes:\n\n          t_min = max_i ( ceil(s_i / i) )   [because div = s//i, and then if mod!=0 then ceil = div+1, else div]\n\n          So t_min = M.\n\n          Then for a query q (which is t), if q < t_min, output -1.\n\n          Otherwise, we need to compute the minimal pipes = ceil(V_n / t).\n\n          So the TODO part is:\n\n              ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n          But note: s is the total sum? \n\n          In the loop, s is the prefix sum at i, and after the loop s = V_n.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n      So the completed program2.py is:\n\n          from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n          def debug(*args, **kwargs):\n              print(*args, file=stderr, **kwargs)\n\n          _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n          volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n          queries = map(int, queries)\n\n          s = t_min = 0\n          for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n              s += v\n              # Compute ceil(s/i): \n              #   if s % i == 0 -> ceil = s//i, else s//i + 1\n              # We can do: (s + i - 1) // i\n              ceil_val = (s + i - 1) // i\n              if ceil_val > t_min:\n                  t_min = ceil_val\n\n          total = s   # total volume\n          res = []\n          for q in queries:\n              if q < t_min:\n                  ans = -1\n              else:\n                  ans = (total + q - 1) // q\n              res.append(ans)\n\n          print('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))\n\n      But note: the variable `queries` is a list of integers? \n\n          We did: \n             queries = map(int, queries)   # but then we iterate over it twice? \n\n          Actually, the first time: \n             for q in map(int, queries): ... \n\n          But we have: \n             _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n\n          Then volumes is a string, and the rest are the query lines.\n\n          Then we do: \n             volumes = map(int, volumes.split())   -> this is an iterator.\n             queries = map(int, queries)   -> this is an iterator.\n\n          Then we use volumes in the for loop: \n             for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1): \n\n          This consumes the volumes.\n\n          Then we do:\n             for q in map(int, queries):   # but queries is the list of the remaining lines? \n\n          Actually, the *queries collects all the remaining lines.
