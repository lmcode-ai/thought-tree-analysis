But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the work per test case is O(n^3), so the total work = sum_{test case} (n_i^3). The worst-case is one test case with n=200000, which is 8e15, too slow. But the condition on the total n over test cases is the sum of the n_i, not the sum of the cubes. However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n_i is 200000, so the worst-case total work is (200000)^3 = 8e15, which is not feasible.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given the number of test cases t, but note: the input specification says the first line is t, then for each test case we have n and the matrix.\n However, the provided code reads only one test case. The problem states: \"The first line contains an integer t (1<=t<=10000)\" and then the test cases.\n\n But note: the note says the total n over test cases <= 200000, so we must handle multiple test cases.\n\n The provided code does not have a loop for t. We must fix that.\n\n Also, the 2D prefix sum calculation seems incomplete and incorrect.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem:\n\n We are building a binary tree such that for any node, all left descendants have smaller indices and right descendants have larger indices (like a BST).\n\n The cost is defined as: for each pair (i, j), we have c_ij * d_ij, where d_ij is the distance in the tree.\n\n We are to output the parent of each node (from 1 to n) with 0 for the root.\n\n The provided code uses a DP approach for optimal BST? But note: the cost function is defined over all pairs, and the problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" for the case when the cost is the sum over all pairs? Actually, it is similar to the problem of building a tree to minimize the total weighted distance (which is the same as the problem of building a Huffman tree? but with BST constraints). \n\n However, note the constraints: n up to 200,000? But wait: the input says the total n over test cases <= 200,000. So we can have multiple test cases but the total n is bounded.\n\n Actually, the problem is known as the \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" but for the case when the cost is defined by the entire matrix of pairwise communications. \n\n There is a known solution using dynamic programming in O(n^3) with Knuth optimization? But note: n can be up to 200,000? That is too high.\n\n However, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can have up to 10 test cases (since t<=10000, but total n<=200000) so the worst-case t could be 10000 but each n=20, then total n=200000. But 10000 test cases of n=20 would be 10000*20=200000. So we can have up to 10000 test cases? But the constraint on the total n is 200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 10 (if each n=20000) but actually the constraint is the sum of n, so we can have 10000 test cases each of n=20.\n\n But the DP in the provided code is O(n^3) per test case. For n=20, 20^3=8000, and 10000 test cases would be 80000000 operations which might be acceptable in Pyton? But 80e6 in Pyton might be borderline in Pyton in C++ but in Python it might be too slow.\n\n However, the provided code does:\n\n   for i in range(b, e):   # O(n) per state\n   and the state is (b, e) with O(n^2) states -> total O(n^3) per test case.\n\n But the total n over test cases is 200000, but note: the DP is per test case and the n per test case can be up to 200000? Actually, the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, meaning the sum of the n's for each test case is <=200000.\n\n However, the DP state is over intervals of the array of size n, so the number of states for one test case is O(n^2). For one test case with n=2000, the states would be about 2000^2 = 4e6 states, and then the inner loop 2000 -> 8e9 operations which is too high.\n\n Therefore, the provided code is not efficient enough.\n\n We need a different approach.\n\n Actually, the problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" for the case when the cost is defined by the entire matrix? But note: the cost function is:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{i<j} c_ij * d_ij\n\n And note that the distance d_ij in the BST is the depth of i (from the root) + depth of j (from the root) - 2 * depth(lca(i,j)).\n\n However, there is a known fact: the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n   total_cost = sum_i (w_i * (depth(i)+1))   ??? \n\n Actually, we can reframe: the cost for a pair (i,j) is c_ij * (d_i + d_j - 2 * d_lca) = c_ij * (d_i) + c_ij * (d_j) - 2 * c_ij * d_lca.\n\n But note: the entire cost over all pairs:\n\n   = sum_{i<j} c_ij * (d_i + d_j - 2 * d_lca(i,j))\n\n However, we can also express:\n\n   = sum_i d_i * (sum_{j != i} c_ij) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * d_lca(i,j)\n\n This doesn't seem to simplify to a form that we know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the entire cost is independent of the tree? Actually no.\n\n There is a known approach: the Garsia-Wachs algorithm? But that is for minimum cost when the cost is the sum of the depths of each node multiplied by a weight? Here we have pairwise weights.\n\n Actually, the problem is known as the \"quadrangle inequality\" DP optimization? But note the constraint on the total n is 200000, but the DP state is O(n^2) which is too high.\n\n Alternatively, note: the problem says the tree must be a BST with the in-order traversal being the sorted order by the index (which is 1..n). So the tree structure is constrained: the root must be one of the numbers, and the left subtree is a contiguous segment of numbers less than the root, and the right subtree is a contiguous segment of numbers greater.\n\n Therefore, we can use DP with state (l, r) meaning the optimal cost for the subtree containing the candies from l to r (inclusive). But the cost function is defined over all pairs? How to compute the cost for a subtree?\n\n We can use the following recurrence:\n\n   Let f(l, r) = minimum total cost for the subtree that contains the candies in the sorted order from l to r.\n\n   Then we choose a root k (l<=k<=r). The root will be at depth 0 in its subtree. The left subtree will be [l, k-1] and the right subtree [k+1, r].\n\n   The cost of the tree is:\n        f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) + additional cost\n\n   What is the additional cost? \n\n   The depth of every node in the left and right subtrees increases by 1. Therefore, the cost for any pair (i,j) that are both in the left subtree will have their distance increased by 2 (because both are one deeper, and then the path between them is increased by 2? Actually, no: the entire path from i to j is within the left subtree, so the entire path is increased by 2? Actually, the distance from i to j is the same as before? because the entire subtree is one level deeper, but the relative distances remain the same? \n\n   However, the cost for a pair (i,j) is the distance in the entire tree. The distance from i to j is the sum of the distances from i to the root of the subtree and from j to the root of the subtree? Actually, no: the distance from i to j is the distance from i to the root of the subtree plus the distance from j to the root of the subtree? But that would be if they are in different subtrees? Actually, if they are in the same subtree, the LCA is the root of that subtree? \n\n   Actually, the entire cost can be broken down by the contribution of edges. Each edge is traversed by all pairs that have the two nodes in different subtrees of that edge? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following known identity:\n\n        total_cost = sum_{edges} (weight of the edge) * (number of pairs that use that edge)\n\n   But note: in our tree, every edge is traversed by a pair (i,j) if and only if the edge is on the path from i to j. And the weight of each edge is 1. So the total cost is the sum over all pairs (i,j) of the distance, multiplied by c_ij? \n\n   And the distance is the number of edges on the path. So total_cost = sum_{i<j} c_ij * d_ij.\n\n   Now, if we break by edges: each edge (u, v) (where v is a child of u) is traversed by exactly the pairs (i,j) such that the path from i to j goes through that edge. This is the number of pairs that have one node in the subtree rooted at v and the other outside that subtree? Actually, no: the edge is traversed if one of the nodes is in the subtree of v and the other is not in the subtree of v? \n\n   Therefore, the total cost can be written as:\n\n        total_cost = sum_{v} [ (sum_{i in T_v} sum_{j not in T_v} c_ij) ]\n\n   where T_v is the subtree rooted at v (excluding the parent's part). But note: the edge from v to its parent is traversed exactly by pairs that have one endpoint in T_v and the other not in T_v.\n\n   Therefore, if we let W(T_v) = sum_{i in T_v, j not in T_v} c_ij, then the total cost is the sum of W(T_v) for every node v (except the root? because the root has no parent edge). Actually, the root has no parent edge, so we sum for every non-root node.\n\n   Now, when we build the tree recursively, for a subtree [l, r], if we choose root k, then:\n\n        total_cost = f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) + W(l, k-1) + W(k+1, r)\n\n   Why? Because the left subtree T_left = [l, k-1] and the right subtree T_right = [k+1, r] will each have an edge from the root k to the left and to the right. The cost for the edge from k to the left subtree is W(T_left) = sum_{i in [l,k-1]} sum_{j in [l,k-1]^c} c_ij.\n\n   But note: the entire set is [0, n-1] (if we index from 0). For the subtree [l, r], the complement is [0, l-1] U [r+1, n-1]. However, in the recurrence, the entire set we are considering is [l, r]. But wait: the problem is over the entire set? \n\n   Actually, the entire set of candies is fixed. The matrix c_ij is given for all pairs. So for the entire tree, the cost for the edge from the root to the left subtree is the sum of c_ij for every i in the left subtree and j not in the left subtree? But note: the entire set is [0, n-1]. However, in the DP state [l, r] we are building a subtree that contains exactly the candies in [l, r]. Therefore, the complement of T_left (the left subtree) in the entire set is [0, l-1] U [k] U [k+1, r] U [r+1, n-1]? Actually, the left subtree is [l, k-1]. The entire set is [0, n-1]. So the complement is [0, l-1] U [k, n-1]. \n\n   Therefore, W(T_left) = sum_{i in [l, k-1]} sum_{j in [0, l-1] U [k, n-1]} c_ij.\n\n   Similarly, for the right subtree [k+1, r]: W(T_right) = sum_{i in [k+1, r]} sum_{j in [0, k] U [r+1, n-1]} c_ij.\n\n   But note: the root k is not in the left subtree, so it is in the complement of the left subtree. Similarly, the root k is in the complement of the right subtree.\n\n   How to compute W(T_left) quickly? We can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix? But note: the constraints say the total n (over test cases) is <=200000, but the matrix is n x n. The total n over test cases is the sum of the n's, but each test case has a matrix of size n x n. The total n (the sum of the individual n's) is 200000, but the matrix for one test case with n=2000 would be 4e6 elements, which is acceptable? But if we have 100 test cases each with n=2000, then total n=200000, but the total matrix size would be 100 * (2000^2) = 40000000000, which is 40e9 elements, which is too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid storing the entire matrix for each test case? Actually, the problem says the total n (the sum of the n's) is <=200000. But note: the matrix for one test case has n^2 elements. The maximum n per test case can be 200000? Then the matrix would be 40e9 elements which is too big. But the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, meaning the sum of the n's for each test case is <=200000. So the maximum n for a test case can be 200000? Then the matrix would be 200000^2 = 40e9 elements, which is too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must use a different approach.\n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5\". So the total n (the sum of the n's) is <=200000. But note: the matrix for one test case has n rows and n columns. The total memory for one test case would be n^2. If one test case has n=200000, then n^2 = 40e9, which is 40 GB of memory? That is not feasible.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid storing the entire matrix? How?\n\n   We note that the recurrence for the cost of a split only requires the sum of c_ij for i in a contiguous set and j in the complement? We can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix? But that requires the entire matrix.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute a 1D prefix sum for the rows? But then we need to sum over a contiguous set of rows and a contiguous set of columns? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the total n (the sum of the n's) is <=200000. This means that the total number of candies in all test cases is <=200000. Therefore, we can have at most one test case? Because if n is the number of candies in one test case, then the total n is the sum of the n's for each test case. So if we have one test case with n=200000, then total n=200000. If we have two test cases, each with n=100000, then total n=200000.\n\n   But the matrix for one test case with n=100000 would be 10e10 elements (10 billion) which is 40 GB? That is too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must use a different approach to compute the cost without storing the entire matrix.\n\n   We note that the cost for a split for a segment [l, r] when choosing root k is:\n\n        cost = f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) + \n               (sum_{i=l}^{k-1} [ sum_{j=0}^{l-1} c_ij + sum_{j=k}^{n-1} c_ij ]) \n               + (sum_{i=k+1}^{r} [ sum_{j=0}^{k} c_ij + sum_{j=r+1}^{n-1} c_ij ])\n\n   But note: the entire matrix is symmetric. We can precompute:\n\n        row_prefix[i] = prefix sums for row i: so that we can get sum_{j=a}^{b} c_ij quickly.\n\n   However, if we precompute row_prefix for each row, then for one test case we have n rows, and each row has n elements -> total n^2, which is too big.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute a 2D prefix sum array for the entire matrix, but that is also n^2.\n\n   How about we precompute the following:\n\n        Let T = the entire matrix.\n\n        Let R[i] = the sum of the i-th row.\n\n        Then, for the left subtree [l, k-1]:\n            sum_{i=l}^{k-1} [ sum_{j=0}^{l-1} c_ij + sum_{j=k}^{n-1} c_ij ] \n            = sum_{i=l}^{k-1} [ (sum_{j=0}^{l-1} c_ij) + (sum_{j=k}^{n-1} c_ij) ]\n\n        But note: we don't have the entire matrix stored. However, we are given the matrix as input. But if we try to store it for one test case with n=200000, we need 200000*200000*4 bytes? That is 40 GB.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid storing the entire matrix.\n\n   We need to compute the cost without storing the entire matrix. \n\n   Another idea: the cost for the edge from the root to the left subtree is the total communication from the left subtree to the outside (which is the entire set excluding the left subtree). Similarly for the right.\n\n   We can precompute a global 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix? But then we need O(1) per query. However, the memory is O(n^2) which is too high.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the total cost for a set can be computed if we have the row sums and the interactions within a set? \n\n   Let:\n\n        total_set = [0, n-1]\n        For a set A, let S_A = sum_{i in A} (sum_{j in complement of A} c_ij) \n                = sum_{i in A} [ (total row sum for i) - (sum_{j in A} c_ij) ]\n\n        = (sum_{i in A} R[i]) - (sum_{i in A} sum_{j in A} c_ij)\n\n   But note: we also need the internal sum for A? \n\n   However, if we precompute the entire matrix, we can compute the row sums R[i] for each row i. And we can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix to compute the sum over a submatrix quickly? But that requires storing the entire matrix and building a 2D prefix sum array, which is O(n^2) per test case.\n\n   Given the constraint on the total n (sum of n over test cases) is 200000, the worst-case test case has n=200000, which requires 40e9 integers, which is too much.\n\n   Therefore, we must find a different approach.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. This means that the total number of candies in all test cases is 200000. So we can have at most 10 test cases if each has 20000, but 20000^2 = 400e6 per test case, which is acceptable for 10 test cases? 10 * 400e6 = 4e9 integers, which is 16 GB? That might be borderline in C++ but in Python it is not feasible.\n\n   But the problem says the total n (the sum of the n's) is 200000. So the maximum n for a test case can be 200000, which is too big.\n\n   We need an O(n^2) per test case algorithm that works for n up to 2000? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so the number of test cases t = 200000 / n. For n=2000, t=100. Then the total operations would be 100 * (2000^3) = 8000000000, which is 8e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n   Therefore, we need a more efficient algorithm.\n\n   There is a known algorithm for this problem: it is called the \"Garsia-Wachs\" algorithm? But Garsia-Wachs is for when the cost is the sum of the depth of each node multiplied by a weight. Here we have pairwise weights.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality and use Knuth optimization. The classical optimal BST (with weights on the nodes) can be solved in O(n^2) using Knuth. But here the cost function is different.\n\n   However, note: the cost for a subtree [l, r] can be expressed in terms of the cost for [l, k-1] and [k+1, r] plus a term that is the sum of the row sums for the left subtree (minus the internal edges) and similarly for the right subtree, but also including the cross terms? \n\n   But the term for the left subtree is:\n\n        W(l, k-1) = (sum_{i=l}^{k-1} R[i]) - (sum_{i=l}^{k-1} sum_{j=l}^{k-1} c_ij)\n\n   Similarly, for the right subtree:\n\n        W(k+1, r) = (sum_{i=k+1}^{r} R[i]) - (sum_{i=k+1}^{r} sum_{j=k+1}^{r} c_ij)\n\n   And the cost for the entire subtree [l, r] in the bigger tree will also have an additional cost from the root edge? Actually, in our recurrence, we are adding W(l, k-1) and W(k+1, r) for the edges from the root to the left and right subtrees.\n\n   But note: the internal sum for the left subtree (the sum_{i=l}^{k-1} sum_{j=l}^{k-1} c_ij) is not used in the cost for the entire tree? Actually, it is used in the row sum part: because the row sum R[i] = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_ij.\n\n   However, the cost for the entire tree is the sum over edges. The edge from the root to the left subtree carries the cost of all communication from the left subtree to the outside of the left subtree. This outside includes the right subtree and the rest of the tree (which is outside [l, r]) and also the root k.\n\n   But in the recurrence, we are building the tree for [l, r], and the outside of [l, r] is fixed and does not change. \n\n   How to compute the row sums R[i]? We can do:\n\n        R[i] = sum_{j} c_ij\n\n   But we are not storing the entire matrix. We can compute R[i] as we read the matrix? But then we still need the internal sums for the submatrices.\n\n   We can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix for one test case, but the memory is O(n^2) which is too high for n=200000.\n\n   Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, it seems that the intended solution uses a different insight.\n\n   Insight: the cost for a pair (i,j) is the distance in the tree. The distance in the tree is the depth of i + depth of j - 2 * depth(lca(i,j)). But if we fix the tree, then the total cost is:\n\n        sum_{i} depth(i) * (sum_{j} c_ij) + sum_{j} depth(j) * (sum_{i} c_ij) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(lca(i,j))\n\n        = 2 * sum_{i} depth(i) * R[i] - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(lca(i,j))\n\n   But this doesn't seem to help.\n\n   Another known approach: the problem is equivalent to building a BST to minimize the total access time for the given pairwise frequencies? There is a known dynamic programming solution that runs in O(n^3) per test case, and with Knuth optimization in O(n^2) per test case. But O(n^2) per test case for n=2000 and 100 test cases would be 100 * (2000^2) = 40000000, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   However, the total n over test cases is 200000, but the DP for one test case with n=2000 has states O(n^2)=4e6 states, and with Knuth optimization we can reduce the inner loop to O(n) per state? Actually, the Knuth optimization for optimal BST reduces the inner loop to O( (r-l) ) per state, but the total becomes O(n^2). \n\n   But note: the classical optimal BST has cost = sum_{i} depth(i)*freq(i). Here we have pairwise weights. \n\n   There is a generalization: the cost = sum_{i} depth(i) * R[i] - 2 * something. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence for the cost of a subtree [l, r] (which is the same as in the provided code):\n\n        f(l, r) = min_{l<=k<=r} [ f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) + weight(l, k-1) + weight(k+1, r) ]\n\n   where weight(l, r) for a segment [l, r] is the cost of the edge that would be attached to the parent of this subtree, which is:\n\n        weight(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - internal_sum(l, r)\n\n   and internal_sum(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij.\n\n   But note: in the recurrence, the cost for the edge from the parent to the root of the subtree [l, r] is weight(l, r). However, in our recurrence for f(l, r), we are not including the cost for the edge above the root of [l, r] because that will be added by the parent. So for the entire tree, the root has no edge above, so we don't add anything for the root.\n\n   But in the recurrence above, when we are at the top level, we choose a root k for [0, n-1], and then we add weight(0, k-1) and weight(k+1, n-1) for the edges from the root to its children.\n\n   Now, how to compute internal_sum(l, r) quickly? We can use a 2D prefix sum for the matrix. But we cannot store the entire matrix.\n\n   However, note: the total n over test cases is 200000, but the matrix for one test case is n x n. We can avoid storing the entire matrix by only storing the row sums and also the values for the submatrices that we need? But the number of submatrices is O(n^2) per test case, and we would need to query O(n^2) times, each in O(1) time, so we need a 2D prefix sum array.\n\n   Therefore, for one test case, we must have a 2D prefix sum array for the matrix. The memory is O(n^2). The total n over test cases is 200000, but the total memory for all test cases would be the sum over test cases of n_i^2. \n\n   Let T be the number of test cases, and n_1, n_2, ..., n_T the sizes. We know sum_{i} n_i <= 200000.\n\n   The total memory = sum_{i} (n_i^2). \n\n   By Cauchy-Schwarz, the sum of squares is minimized when the n_i are equal, but we want the maximum possible sum of squares. The maximum sum of squares occurs when one test case has n=200000 and the others have 0. Then total memory = 200000^2 = 40e9 integers = 40 GB, which is too much.\n\n   Therefore, we must find a different approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the internal_sum(l, r) without storing the entire matrix by using the following:\n\n        internal_sum(l, r) = (1/2) * [ (sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i]) + (sum_{j=l}^{r} C[j]) - total_sum ]\n\n   But wait, the matrix is symmetric, so the sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] = sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j} c_ij.\n\n   And the sum_{j} C[j] (if C[j] = sum_{i} c_ij) is the same as sum_{i} R[i] because the matrix is symmetric.\n\n   And total_sum = sum_{i} R[i].\n\n   But then:\n\n        internal_sum(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij = ?\n\n   We can use inclusion-exclusion with a 2D array, but we don't have it.\n\n   We can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the matrix, but then we need to store it.\n\n   Given the complexity, and that the total sum of n_i is 200000, the maximum n_i might be small in practice? But the problem says up to 200000.\n\n   However, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5\". This means that the total number of candies in all test cases is at most 200000. So the largest test case has n<=200000, but the number of test cases t can be up to 200000 only if each n_i=1. In that case, the matrices are 1x1, which is fine.\n\n   But the worst-case for the sum of squares is when one test case has n=200000 and the others have n=0, but n>=1. So the worst-case is one test case with n=200000, then the next test cases must have n=0, but n>=1, so we have only one test case. Therefore, the total memory for the matrix would be (200000)^2 = 40e9 integers, which is 160 GB? That is not feasible.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid storing the entire matrix.\n\n   How about we compute the internal_sum(l, r) on the fly using a precomputed 2D prefix array but only for the current test case, and then discard it? But the memory for one test case is O(n^2), and for n=200000, it is 40e9 integers, which is too much.\n\n   We need an O(n^2) time and O(n) space algorithm for the DP. \n\n   There is a known result: for the optimal BST with pairwise weights, there is an O(n^2) algorithm if the weight matrix is given in a compressed form? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        weight(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - internal_sum(l, r)\n\n        = sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - (sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij)\n\n   But note: the term internal_sum(l, r) is the sum of a submatrix. We can compute it if we have a 2D array, but we don't.\n\n   We can precompute the row sums R[i] and also the matrix in a 1D array? \n\n   Another idea: the entire cost for the edge incident to the subtree [l, r] is:\n\n        weight(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - internal_sum(l, r)\n\n   = sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - (sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij)\n\n   = sum_{i=l}^{r} [ R[i] - sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij ]\n\n   = sum_{i=l}^{r} [ sum_{j=0}^{l-1} c_ij + sum_{j=r+1}^{n-1} c_ij ]\n\n   So weight(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} [ prefix_row[i][l-1] + (R[i] - prefix_row[i][r]) ] \n\n   where prefix_row[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{j} c_ik.\n\n   But to compute this, we need the row i and the values for columns 0..l-1 and r+1..n-1. \n\n   If we had the matrix stored by rows, we could use a Fenwick tree or segment tree for each row to do range queries, but building one for each row would be O(n^2) memory.\n\n   Given the time constraints, and since the total n over test cases is 200000, the intended solution might be to assume that the maximum n per test case is not too large. But the problem says n can be up to 200000.\n\n   Alternatively, there is a known simpler solution: \n\n        https://codeforces.com/contest/1490/problem/F\n\n   But that is a different problem.\n\n   After research, this problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" for the case of minimizing the total distance for pairwise requests. It is a classic problem and can be solved in O(n^3) with Knuth optimization to O(n^2). But the memory is O(n^2) for the DP states.\n\n   However, the total n over test cases is 200000, but the sum of the squares of n_i might be large.\n\n   Let's compute the worst-case sum of squares: the sum of n_i is 200000. The maximum sum of squares is when one n_i=200000, then sum of squares = 200000^2 = 40000000000, which is 40e9, which is too big.\n\n   Therefore, we must have an O(n^2) time and O(n) space algorithm, or an O(n^2) time per test case and hope that the test cases have small n.\n\n   But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n per test case is 200000, so there is only one test case. So we only have to solve one test case with n=200000.\n\n   But 200000^2 = 40e9 states for the DP, which is too many.\n\n   There must be a more efficient algorithm.\n\n   Another approach: the tree is a BST, so the structure is determined by the choice of the root. The cost can be computed recursively. \n\n   We can use a greedy or divide and conquer with a different cost.\n\n   Insight from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garsia%E2%80%93Wachs_algorithm\n\n   The Garsia-Wachs algorithm is for when the cost is the sum of the depth of each node multiplied by its weight. Here we have pairwise weights. \n\n   But note: we can define for each node i a weight: let a_i = R[i] = sum_{j} c_ij.\n\n   Then the cost = sum_{i} a_i * depth(i) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(lca(i,j)).\n\n   The first term is the classical cost. The second term is new.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write the cost as:\n\n        cost = sum_{i} a_i * depth(i) - 2 * cost_lca\n\n   where cost_lca = sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(lca(i,j)).\n\n   And cost_lca can be computed as: for each node, the depth of the node times the sum of c_ij for all pairs (i,j) that have this node as their lca.\n\n   For a node k, the pairs (i,j) that have lca = k are the pairs with i in the left subtree of k and j in the right subtree of k? Actually, no: it could be any pair that has k as the lowest common ancestor, which means one in the left and one in the right, or one is k and the other in the left or right? \n\n   Actually, if i and j are in different subtrees of k, then lca(i,j)=k. Also, if i=k and j is in one of the subtrees, then lca(i,j)=k. But note: the pair (i,i) is not considered (i<j). \n\n   So for a node k, the cost_lca contributed by k is:\n\n        depth(k) * [ (sum_{i in left} c_{k i}) + (sum_{i in right} c_{k i}) + (sum_{i in left, j in right} c_{ij}) ]\n\n   = depth(k) * [ (sum_{i in left} c_{k i}) + (sum_{i in right} c_{k i}) + (sum_{i in left} sum_{j in right} c_{ij}) ]\n\n   But note: the communication between left and right is also carried by the edge at k? \n\n   This is getting complicated.\n\n Given the complexity of the problem and the high constraints, and that the provided code in the question is for one test case and uses a O(n^3) DP, it is likely that the intended solution uses the following:\n\n   - Only for small n per test case: because the total n is 200000, but the test cases can be up to 10000, so the maximum n per test case is 200000/10000 = 20.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the provided code with a loop for test cases, and for each test case, we do the O(n^3) DP.\n\n   Why? For n<=20, 20^3 = 8000, and 10000 test cases would be 80000000, which is 80e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   So the catch: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n per test case might be as low as 20 (if there are 10000 test cases) or as high as 200000 (if there is one test case). But 200000 for one test case would make the O(n^3) DP have 8e15 operations, which is not feasible.\n\n   However, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5\". This means that the total number of candies in all test cases is <=200000. So if there is one test case, n<=200000. If there are two, n1+n2<=200000, etc.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum number of test cases is 200000 (each with n=1). \n\n   For a test case with n=1, the DP is O(1).\n\n   For a test case with n=2, the DP will have states: [0,2) -> then we try 0 and 1 as roots, so 2 states, and each state has O(n) in the loop, so O(n^3) for a test case is O(n^3) per test case.\n\n   The total work = sum_{test case} (n_i^3).\n\n   The maximum sum of n_i^3 given sum n_i = 200000 is when one test case has n=200000, then work=200000^3 = 8e15, which is too high.\n\n   Therefore, we must have an efficient algorithm for larger n.\n\n   But note: the provided code in the question has a 2D prefix sum array for the matrix S, and then does a DP. The memory is O(n^2) per test case, and time O(n^3) per test case.\n\n   However, the total sum of n_i is 200000, but the total sum of n_i^3 might be very large.\n\n   We need to optimize the DP with Knuth optimization. In the classical optimal BST, if the cost function satisfies the conditions, we can reduce to O(n^2) per test case.\n\n   In our recurrence:\n\n        f(l, r) = min_{l<=k<=r} [ f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) ] + weight(l, r, k)\n\n   where weight(l, r, k) = weight(l, k-1) + weight(k+1, r)\n\n   = [ (sum_{i=l}^{k-1} R[i] - internal_sum(l, k-1) ] + [ (sum_{i=k+1}^{r} R[i] - internal_sum(k+1, r) ]\n\n   = [sum_{i=l}^{k-1} R[i] + sum_{i=k+1}^{r} R[i]] - [internal_sum(l, k-1) + internal_sum(k+1, r)]\n\n   = [sum_{i=l}^{r} R[i] - R[k]] - [internal_sum(l, k-1) + internal_sum(k+1, r)]\n\n   But internal_sum(l, r) = sum_{i=l}^{r} sum_{j=l}^{r} c_ij.\n\n   Note: internal_sum(l, r) = internal_sum(l, k-1) + internal_sum(k+1, r) + cross_term, where cross_term = sum_{i=l}^{k-1} sum_{j=k+1}^{r} c_ij + sum_{i=l}^{k-1} c_{i,k} + sum_{j=k+1}^{r} c_{k,j} \n\n   This is messy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can see that the weight(l, r, k) might not be decomposable as a function that is independent of k in a separable way.\n\n   Given the time, and since the total n_i is 200000, the intended solution might be to use the following:\n\n   - For each test case, if n is small (<=200), use the O(n^3) DP. If n is large, use an O(n^2) DP with Knuth optimization.\n\n   But the condition for Knuth optimization is that the weight function satisfies the quadrangle inequality and the monotonicity of the root.\n\n   In our case, the weight for the entire subtree [l, r] is not even defined in the recurrence as a function of l and r only, because it depends on the split k.\n\n   Therefore, we must use the provided code for small n, and hope that n is small.\n\n   But the total n_i is 200000, and if one test case has n=200000, we cannot do O(n^3) or O(n^2).\n\n   There is a known solution in C++ for this problem: \n        https://codeforces.com/contest/1490/submission/1072317\n\n   But that is for a different problem.\n\n   After thinking, I found a paper: \"Optimal Binary Search Trees with costs based on access and distance\" by ... \n\n   Given the complexity, and since the provided code in the question is for one test case and has a 2D prefix sum, and the note says the total n over test cases is 200000, it is likely that the test cases are small. In fact, the sample test cases have n=2, n=4, n=5.\n\n   Therefore, we will assume that the maximum n per test case is not too large (<= 200) so that O(n^3) is acceptable.\n\n   Steps for one test case:\n\n        1. Read n.\n        2. Read the matrix.\n        3. Precompute a 2D prefix sum for the matrix for this test case.\n           Let's define:\n                S[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} c_{xy}\n\n           But note: the matrix is for candies 0..n-1.\n\n        4. Then, the function acc(i1, i2, j1, j2) as in the provided code should be:\n\n                if i1>i2 or j1>j2: return 0\n                else: \n                    a = S[i2][j2]\n                    b = S[i2][j1-1] if j1>0 else 0\n                    c = S[i1-1][j2] if i1>0 else 0\n                    d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1>0 and j1>0 else 0\n                    return a - b - c + d\n\n        5. But the provided code has a nested loop to build S as a 2D prefix sum. However, the provided code has a bug: it does:\n\n               for i in range(n):\n                 for j in range(n):\n                     if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                         S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                     elif i > 0:\n                         # TODO: Your code here\n                     elif j > 0:\n                         S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n           This is for in-place 2D prefix sum. The TODO should be:\n\n               elif i > 0:\n                   S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\n           But note: the matrix is read in row-major. We start with S[i][j] = c[i][j].\n\n           The standard 2D prefix sum:\n\n               for i in range(n):\n                 for j in range(n):\n                     if i>0:\n                         S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                     if j>0:\n                         S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n                     if i>0 and j>0:\n                         S[i][j] -= S[i-1][j-1]\n\n           But the provided code does it in a different order. Let's fix the provided code.\n\n        6. The provided code then defines:\n\n               def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\n                   if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\n                       return 0\n                   a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n                   b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1 > 0 else 0\n                   c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1 > 0 else 0\n                   d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1 > 0 and j1 > 0 else 0\n                   return a - b - c + d\n\n           This is for a 0-indexed prefix sum array S that has the cumulative sum from (0,0) to (i,j) at S[i][j].\n\n           But note: the indices in the function acc: it uses i1, i2, j1, j2. The submatrix from row i1 to i2-1 and column j1 to j2-1.\n\n           So to get the sum for [i1, i2-1] x [j1, j2-1], we use:\n\n               S[i2-1][j2-1] - S[i2-1][j1-1] - S[i1-1][j2-1] + S[i1-1][j1-1]\n\n           This is correct.\n\n        7. In the recurrence, the cost for a split at k in [b, e) is:\n\n               s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n                   + acc(0, b, b, i)   # sum_{rows=0}^{b-1} and cols=b}^{i-1} ? \n                   + acc(b, i, i, n)   # sum_{rows=b}^{i-1} and cols=i}^{n-1} \n                   + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) # sum_{rows=0}^{i} and cols=i+1}^{e-1} \n                   + acc(i+1, e, e, n)   # sum_{rows=i+1}^{e-1} and cols=e}^{n-1} \n\n           This seems to be the cost for the edges incident to the left and right subtrees.\n\n           Let me try with a small example: n=2, b=0, e=2, and we try i=0 and i=1.\n\n           For i=0 (root at 0):\n                left: [0,0) -> empty\n                right: [1,2) -> [1]\n\n                cost added = \n                   acc(0,0,0,0) = 0\n                   acc(0,0,0, n=2) = acc(0,0,0,2) = ? \n                      = S[-1][1] - S[-1][-1] - ... -> let's compute indices.\n\n                Instead, let's redefine the acc function to be for [i1, i2) and [j1, j2) in the matrix.\n\n                The matrix is for rows 0..n-1 and cols 0..n-1.\n\n                acc(0, b, b, i) = acc(0,0,0,0) = 0.\n                acc(b, i, i, n) = acc(0,0,0,2) = sum_{rows=0}^{-1} (empty) and cols=0..1 -> 0.\n                acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) = acc(0,1,1,2) = the submatrix: rows [0,1) i.e., row0, and cols [1,2) i.e., col1.\n                   = c[0][1]\n                acc(i+1, e, e, n) = acc(1,2,2,2) = 0.\n\n                So total added = c[0][1].\n\n           For i=1 (root at 1):\n                left: [0,1) = [0], right: [2,2) = empty.\n                added cost = \n                   acc(0,0,0,1) = 0\n                   acc(0,1,1,2) = c[0][1]   [rows=0..0, cols=1..1]\n                   acc(0,2,2,2) = 0\n                   acc(2,2,2,2) = 0\n                so added cost = c[0][1]\n\n           So for both roots, the added cost is c[0][1]. \n\n           But the cost for the tree should be the cost of the edge from the root to the child. In the tree with root 0 and right child 1, the edge from 0 to 1 will carry the cost for the pair (0,1) -> one edge, so cost = c[0][1] * 1.\n           In the tree with root 1 and left child 0, the edge from 1 to 0 will also carry the cost for the pair (0,1) -> cost = c[0][1] * 1.\n\n           Additionally, the cost for the entire tree is also the cost for the edge from the root to the child, because the pair (0,1) uses that edge.\n\n           But note: the recurrence also includes the cost from the subtrees. For the size-1 subtrees, the cost is 0.\n\n           So the total cost for the tree is the added cost = c[0][1]. \n\n           However, the sample: \n                Input: \n                  2\n                  0 1\n                  1 0\n\n                Output: 2 (the number of candies eaten, but the cost in our DP is 1, and the number of candies eaten is 2, but the problem asks for the tree structure, not the cost.\n\n           The provided code then uses the DP to find the minimum cost, but then it builds the tree structure and outputs the parent array.\n\n           The sample in the note: \n                Input: \n                  2\n                  0 566\n                  566 0\n\n                Output: 2\n\n                But the cost in our DP for the only possible trees is 566.\n\n           The problem asks for the maximum number of candies eaten, which is always n, but the sample output is 2.\n\n           Actually, the problem says: \"print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\"\n\n           In the sample, they eat 2 candies.\n\n           But the provided code outputs the parent array, not the number of candies. \n\n           The provided code at the end does:\n\n                sol = [\"\" for _ in range(n)]\n                def label(b, e, p):\n                    if e - b == 1:\n                        sol[b] = str(p)\n                        return\n                    elif e - b == 0:\n                        return\n                    i = P[b][e-1]\n                    sol[i] = str(p)\n                    label(b, i, i+1)\n                    label(i+1, e, i+1)\n\n                label(0, n, 0)\n                print(\" \".join(sol))\n\n           This outputs the parent array.\n\n           For the sample n=2, with the matrix:\n                [ [0, 566],\n                  [566,0] ]\n\n           The cost for root=0: \n                added cost = 566.\n                f(0,0)=0, f(1,2)=0, so total cost=566.\n           for root=1: cost=566.\n\n           So both are the same. The code will choose one arbitrarily.\n\n           If it chooses root=0, then:\n                label(0,2,0): \n                    i = P[0][1] = 0? \n                    sol[0] = \"0\" (meaning parent of 0 is 0? but then it should be 0 for the root? but the root's parent is 0 in the output meaning no parent? \n                then label(0,0,1): does nothing because e-b=0.\n                label(1,2,1): \n                    e-b=1, so sol[1] = \"1\" (parent is 1? but 1 is the root in this case? \n\n           This doesn't match.\n\n           The parent array should be for node 0 and node 1.\n\n           In the tree with root=0 and right child=1, then:\n                node0: parent = 0 (meaning no parent) -> but the code uses 0 for the root.\n                node1: parent = 0+1 = 1? -> but the code calls label(1,2,1) and then for node1 (index1) sets sol[1] = \"1\", which would be the parent is node1? that is not right.\n\n           The label function: \n                for the root (0,2,0): \n                    i = P[0][1] = 0 (if we chose root0)\n                    sol[0] = \"0\" -> parent of node0 is 0? \n                    then label(0,0,1): b=0, e=0 -> returns.\n                    label(1,2,1): \n                         e-b=1, so sol[1] = \"1\" -> parent of node1 is 1? \n\n           This is not correct.\n\n           The parameters in the label function: \n                label(b, e, p): builds the tree for the segment [b, e), and the parent of the root of this subtree is p.\n\n           For the root of the entire tree, p=0.\n\n           For the left subtree [b, i), the parent of its root should be the current root (which is i+1? or i?).\n\n           In the code: \n                label(b, i, i+1)   # the parent of the root of the left subtree is set to i+1? \n                label(i+1, e, i+1) # the parent of the root of the right subtree is set to i+1?\n\n           But the current root is i. So the parent of the left subtree's root should be i, and similarly for the right.\n\n           Why i+1? \n\n           The nodes are indexed from 0 to n-1. The current root is i. The left subtree is [b, i) and the right is [i+1, e). The root of the left subtree is the node that will be chosen as the root of [b,i), and similarly for the right.\n\n           In the label function, when we are at a node i, we set sol[i] = str(p), meaning the parent of node i is p.\n\n           For the left subtree, we call label(b, i, i+1): meaning the parent of the root of the left subtree should be i+1? \n\n           But i+1 might be out of bounds? \n\n           Let me see: for the left subtree [b, i), the root will be some node in [b, i), say k. We will set sol[k] = i+1.\n\n           But i+1 is the index of the root of the right subtree? or the current root? \n\n           Actually, the current root is i. So the parent of the left child should be i, and the parent of the right child should be i.\n\n           So the calls should be:\n\n                label(b, i, i+1)  -> parent = i+1? \n                label(i+1, e, i+1) -> parent = i+1?\n\n           This sets the parent of both children to i+1, which is not the current node i.\n\n           It should be:\n\n                sol[i] = p   # the current node i has parent p.\n                label(b, i, i)   # the parent of the root of the left subtree should be i (the current node)\n                label(i+1, e, i)   # the parent of the root of the right subtree should be i.\n\n           But the code uses i+1 for the parent in the recursive call.\n\n           Why i+1? \n\n           The sample: \n                n=2, root=0.\n                Then for the left subtree [0,0): empty, so skip.\n                For the right subtree [1,2): one node, index1.\n                We call label(1,2, 0+1) = label(1,2,1). \n                In label(1,2,1): \n                    e-b=1, so it sets sol[1] = \"1\", meaning the parent of node1 is 1.\n\n           This is not right. The parent of node1 should be 0.\n\n           So the code has a bug in the labeling.\n\n           Let me read the provided code: \n                sol[i] = str(p)\n                label(b, i, i+1)\n                label(i+1, e, i+1)\n\n           This sets the parent of the current root i to p, and then for the left and right subtrees, it sets the parent of their roots to i+1.\n\n           But i+1 might not be the current node's index? \n\n           The current node is i, so the parent of the left and right child should be i.\n\n           Therefore, the fix is to change the recursive calls to:\n\n                label(b, i, i)   # parent of the root of the left subtree is i\n                label(i+1, e, i)   # parent of the root of the right subtree is i\n\n           But then in the sample: \n                root=0: \n                   sol[0] = 0 (parent of 0 is 0, which means it's the root)\n                   label(0,0,0): empty, so skip.\n                   label(1,2,0): \n                         i = P[1][1] is not defined? because the state is (1,2) -> [1,2) has one node.\n\n           In the DP state, we have M and P for [b, e) with e exclusive.\n\n           In the function solve(b,e) builds the tree for the segment [b,e). The root is chosen as P[b][e-1].\n\n           In the sample, for [0,2): \n                P[0][1] = 0 or 1? whichever gives lower cost.\n\n           Then in label(0,2,0):\n                i = P[0][1] = 0 (say)\n                sol[0] = \"0\"\n                then label(0,0,0): does nothing (because e-b=0)\n                label(1,2,0): \n                    now we are in the state (1,2): \n                         i = P[1][1] = ? \n\n           We only computed states for [0,2) and [0,0) and [1,2) are leaves.\n\n           In the DP, for [1,2): \n                solve(1,2): \n                    e-b=1 -> M[1][1] = 0, and we return 0.\n\n           So P[1][1] is not set. We only set P for states that have e-b>=2.\n\n           In the label function, for [1,2): \n                e-b=1, so we do: sol[1] = str(p) = \"0\"\n\n           So then the parent of node1 is 0.\n\n           This is correct.\n\n           Therefore, the only change in the label function is to use 'i' (the current root) as the parent for the children, not i+1.\n\n           So we change the recursive calls to:\n\n                label(b, i, i+1)   to label(b, i, i)\n                label(i+1, e, i+1) to label(i+1, e, i)\n\n           But wait, the third parameter is the parent to be set for the root of the subtree. For the left subtree [b,i), the root will have parent = i.\n           For the right subtree [i+1,e), the root will have parent = i.\n\n           However, in the current code, the parent is passed as i+1. We change to i.\n\n           But note: the nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1. The current root is i. The parent of the left and right child should be i.\n\n           But the parent of the current root is p. We set sol[i] = p.\n\n           So the corrected labeling:\n\n                sol[i] = str(p)   # the current node i has parent p (if p is 0, then it's the root)\n                label(b, i, i)   # for the left subtree, the parent of its root should be i\n                label(i+1, e, i) # for the right subtree, the parent of its root should be i\n\n           However, in the sample with n=2 and root=0:\n                label(0,2,0): \n                    i = 0\n                    sol[0] = \"0\"\n                    label(0,0,0): skip\n                    label(1,2,0): \n                         in the function label(1,2,0): \n                             since e-b=1, set sol[1] = \"0\"\n\n           This gives: \n                node0: parent 0 -> root\n                node1: parent 0\n\n           So the tree has root 0, and node1 as the right child.\n\n           This is correct.\n\n           For root=1:\n                label(0,2,0):\n                    i = 1\n                    sol[1] = \"0\"\n                    label(0,1,1): \n                         e-b=1, so set sol[0] = \"1\"\n                    label(2,2,1): skip\n\n           This gives: \n                node0: parent 1\n                node1: parent 0 (root)\n\n           So the tree has root 1, and node0 as the left child.\n\n           Therefore, we change the recursive calls to use 'i' as the parent.\n\n        8. The provided code has a bug in the 2D prefix sum for the case when i>0 and j>0: it does:\n\n               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n\n           This is correct for the cell (i,j). But then for the cases:\n\n               elif i>0: \n                   # TODO: Your code here\n\n           We should do:\n\n               S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\n           and for j>0 and i==0:\n\n               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n           But the provided code already has:\n\n               elif j>0:\n                   S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n           and the TODO is for i>0 and j==0.\n\n           So we do:\n\n               elif i>0:\n                   S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\n        9. The provided code does not have a loop for test cases. We must add it.\n\n   Therefore, the plan:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            # read the matrix\n            S = ... # the matrix for the test case, and then we build a 2D prefix sum\n\n            # Precompute 2D prefix sum for the matrix: we'll create a new 2D array for the prefix sum, same size as the matrix.\n\n            # But note: the matrix is n x n.\n\n            # Step 1: Read the matrix.\n            c = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                row = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                c.append(row)\n\n            # Step 2: Build a 2D prefix sum array for c.\n            # Let's create a new 2D list 'pref' of size n x n.\n            # But we can use S from the provided code.\n            # We'll use a new array 'pref' to avoid overwriting.\n            # However, the provided code uses S as the prefix sum array.\n\n            # We'll do:\n            #   pref[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} c[x][y]\n\n            # Initialize pref with zeros or with c, then do in-place.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            pref = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    pref[i][j] = c[i][j]\n                    if i>0:\n                        pref[i][j] += pref[i-1][j]\n                    if j>0:\n                        pref[i][j] += pref[i][j-1]\n                    if i>0 and j>0:\n                        pref[i][j] -= pref[i-1][j-1]\n\n            # But the provided code uses a different indexing in the acc function.\n\n            # The acc function in the provided code is for [i1, i2) and [j1, j2) -> the sum of the submatrix rows [i1, i2-1] and columns [j1, j2-1].\n\n            # We can compute that with the 'pref' array:\n\n            def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\n                if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\n                    return 0\n                # We want: rows [i1, i2-1] and columns [j1, j2-1]\n                # total = pref[i2-1][j2-1]\n                total = pref[i2-1][j2-1]\n                if j1 > 0:\n                    total -= pref[i2-1][j1-1]\n                if i1 > 0:\n                    total -= pref[i1-1][j2-1]\n                if i1>0 and j1>0:\n                    total += pref[i1-1][j1-1]\n                return total\n\n            # But note: the provided code in the question has a different 'acc' function that uses a global S that was built in a different way.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use the provided code's method to build S in-place.\n\n            # The provided code's method:\n\n            #   S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n            #   for i in range(n):\n            #       for j, c_val in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):\n            #           S[i][j] = c_val\n            #\n            #   for i in range(n):\n            #       for j in range(n):\n            #           if i > 0 and j > 0:\n            #               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n            #           elif i > 0:\n            #               S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n            #           elif j > 0:\n            #               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n            # This builds the same as our 'pref' array.\n\n            # Then the acc function in the provided code is:\n\n            #   def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\n            #       if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\n            #           return 0\n            #       a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n            #       b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1 > 0 else 0\n            #       c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1 > 0 else 0\n            #       d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1 > 0 and j1 > 0 else 0\n            #       return a - b - c + d\n\n            # This is the same as our acc function above.\n\n            # So we can use either.\n\n        10. The provided code then does:\n\n                M = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n                P = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n\n            But note: the state is (b, e) where the subtree is [b, e) (e exclusive). The state is stored in M[b][e-1] and P[b][e-1].\n\n            The function solve(b,e) is defined.\n\n            We then call solve(0, n)\n\n            Then we build the parent array.\n\n        11. We must change the recursive calls in the label function to use 'i' as the parent for the children.\n\n        12. Also, the provided code has a bug in the 2D prefix sum initialization: it does not handle the first row and first column correctly in the in-place update. We fixed the TODO.\n\n   Given the complexity and the constraints, we hope that the test cases have small n (<=200) so that the O(n^3) per test case is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the work per test case is O(n^3), so the total work = sum_{test case} (n_i^3).\n\n   The worst-case is one test case with n=200000, which is 8e15, too slow.\n\n   But the condition on the total n over test cases is the sum of the n_i, not the sum of the cubes.\n\n   However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n_i is 200000, so the worst-case total work is (200000)^3 = 8e15, which is not feasible.\n\n   Therefore, we must use a more efficient algorithm for large n_i.\n\n   But the sample test cases are small.\n\n   Since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and if we assume that the maximum n_i is 200, then the largest test case has n_i=200, and the work is 200^3 = 8e6, and the total work is at most (200000/200) * 8e6 = 1000 * 8e6 = 8e9, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline.\n\n   But 8e9 operations in Python is about 80 seconds, which is too slow.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use Knuth optimization if the cost function satisfies the conditions.\n\n   The conditions for Knuth optimization in optimal BST are:\n\n        - The cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality.\n        - The root function is monotonic: the root for [i, j] is between the root for [i, j-1] and [i+1, j].\n\n   In our recurrence, the cost for a state [l, r] is:\n\n        f(l, r) = min_{k \\in [l, r]} { f(l, k-1) + f(k+1, r) } + w(l, r, k)\n\n   where w(l, r, k) = acc(0, l, l, k) + acc(l, k, k, n) + acc(0, k+1, k+1, r) + acc(k+1, r, r, n)\n\n   = [sum_{i=0}^{l-1} sum_{j=l}^{k-1} c_ij] + [sum_{i=l}^{k-1} sum_{j=k}^{n-1} c_ij] + [sum_{i=0}^{k} sum_{j=k+1}^{r-1} c_ij] + [sum_{i=k+1}^{r-1} sum_{j=r}^{n-1} c_ij]\n\n   This cost function is not a function of (l, r) only, and it depends on k. Therefore, it does not fit the classical Knuth optimization.\n\n   Given the time, and since the sample test cases are small, and the total n_i is 200000, we hope that the test cases have n_i small (<= 200) and are many, so that the sum of n_i^3 is acceptable.\n\n   If not, we might need to output the code and hope.\n\n   Therefore, the final code for the test cases is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            # read the matrix\n            if n == 0:\n                # print nothing? \n                # But the output for each test case is a parent array of length n.\n                # So if n==0, output nothing? \n                # But the next test case...\n                # We'll skip.\n                # But we must output a parent array for each test case.\n                # For n=0, output nothing? or a blank line?\n                # The problem: for each test case, print a single integer? \n                # Actually, the output is: for each team member from 1 to n output the parent.

What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\"\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            4\n            2\n            0 566\n            566 0\n            4\n            0 1 1 1\n            1 0 1 1\n            1 1 0 1\n            1 1 1 0\n            5\n            0 1 1 1 1\n            1 "
