Therefore, we must have: For i from 0 to n-2: b_i >= 0   (because r_i = b_i >=0) For i from 1 to n-1: l_i = b_{i-1} (from the pattern: l_1 = b0, l_2 = b1, ... l_{n-1} = b_{n-2}) and we require l_i>=0 -> so b_{i-1}>=0 for i from 1 to n-1, which is the same as b_j>=0 for j from 0 to n-2.

Moreover, we must have that the partial sums from 0 to n-2 are non-negative, and the last element a_{n-1} must be the negative of the partial sum at n-2. But note: what about the condition for the last cell? We have l_{n-1} = b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1} and we require l_{n-1}>=0 -> so -a_{n-1}>=0 -> a_{n-1}<=0.

But wait: when we have popped the last two elements, then the current g is b_{m-2}. Then we are about to pop a_{m-2}. Then we check: if g <= c[-1]? What is the meaning? Consider the element at position m-2: \n            We have: \n                a_{m-2} = r_{m-2} - l_{m-2} \n                and the flow condition: \n                    r_{m-3} + l_{m-1} = r_{m-2} + l_{m-2} But we have: \n                l_{m-1} = b_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> which is g (before we pop a_{m-2}). r_{m-2} = b_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> which is g.\n\n            Then the equation: \n                r_{m-3} + g = g + l_{m-2}   -> so r_{m-3} = l_{m-2}. Then a_{m-2} = r_{m-2} - l_{m-2} = g - l_{m-2} = g - r_{m-3}. But we also have: \n                b_{m-3} = r_{m-3} = l_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> so a_{m-2} = g - b_{m-3}. But note: b_{m-3} = b_{m-2} - a_{m-2} = g - a_{m-2}. Then: a_{m-2} = g - (g - a_{m-2}) = a_{m-2} -> tautology. So what is the constraint? Actually, we have the constraint that the moves are non-negative: \n            r_{m-2} = g >=0 -> which we have because we require the partial sums to be non-negative? \n            l_{m-2} = r_{m-3} = b_{m-3} = g - a_{m-2} >=0 -> so we require g - a_{m-2} > =0 -> a_{m-2} <= g.\n\n        Therefore, we must have a_{m-2} <= g (which is the current value of g, which is the partial sum at m-2). Similarly, for the next element: \n            After popping a_{m-2}, we update g = g - a_{m-2} = b_{m-3} (which must be non-negative) and then we check the next element: a_{m-3} must be <= g (which is now b_{m-3})? But wait: the condition for a_{m-3} is: \n            l_{m-2} = b_{m-3} = g (after the update) and then the constraint: \n                a_{m-3} = r_{m-3} - l_{m-3} = b_{m-3} - l_{m-3} \n            and the flow condition: \n                r_{m-4} + l_{m-2} = r_{m-3} + l_{m-3} \n            -> r_{m-4} + g = b_{m-3} + l_{m-3} = g + l_{m-3}   (since b_{m-3}=g) \n            -> r_{m-4} = l_{m-3} \n            -> then a_{m-3} = g - l_{m-3} = g - r_{m-4} = g - b_{m-4} \n            and we also have: \n                b_{m-4} = b_{m-3} - a_{m-3} = g - a_{m-3} so a_{m-3} = g - (g - a_{m-3}) = a_{m-3} -> tautology. The constraint: l_{m-3} = r_{m-4} = b_{m-4} = g - a_{m-3} >=0 -> so a_{m-3} <= g.\n\n        Therefore, at every step (except the last one) we must have that the current last element is <= the current value of g.\n\n        But note: the current g is the partial sum at the next segment?",

Then we are inside when g<=c[-1]. But we want to set k=0 when g < c[-1]? That doesn't make sense because we are inside the if only when g<=c[-1]. Actually, we want to set k=0 whenever we have c[-1] > g, but note: the condition `g<=c[-1]` is true when g<=c[-1] and false when g>c[-1]. And when g>c[-1], we don't set k=0?

But wait: we require c[-1] <= g? so if g>c[-1], then it is allowed? Therefore, we only set k=0 when we have g < c[-1]? But note: the condition g>c[-1] is allowed? So the TODO is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is only possible if the outer if condition `g<=c[-1]` is true? Actually, no: if g<=c[-1] is true, then g<c[-1] is one case. But if g>c[-1], then we don't enter the outer if. Therefore, we can also set k=0 when we don't enter the outer if? Actually, no: because if g>c[-1], then we don't set k=0? and that is correct. So we only set k=0 when we have g < c[-1]? But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is the same as `c[-1] > g`, which is the invalid condition. Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside when g<=c[-1]. Then we check if g is strictly less than c[-1]? Alternatively, we can do: if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        without an if? Actually, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        and it will be executed only when g<=c[-1]? But no: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside that block. Then we check if g < c[-1]? So:\n\n            if g<=c[-1]: if g < c[-1]:\n                    k = 0\n\n        But note: if g==c[-1], we do nothing. However, we can also do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        without the outer if? But we cannot remove the outer if? Alternatively, we can change the logic: \n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        and remove the outer if? But the problem says: we must fill the TODO.",

However, we can also write: if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        which is equivalent. But the problem: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside that block. Then if we set k=0 when c[-1]>g, that is always true inside the block? because if we are inside, then g<=c[-1] and then c[-1]>=g. So c[-1]>g is the same as g < c[-1]. Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0 So the code for program1.py becomes:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):\n                n=int(input())\n                c=[int(j) for j in input().split()]\n                k=1 if [0]*n==c:\n                    print('Yes')\n                else:\n                    g=0\n                    while c[-1]==0:\n                        c.pop()\n                    while len(c)-1:\n                        if g<=c[-1]: if g < c[-1]:\n                                k = 0\n                        g=g-c.pop()\n                    print(['No','Yes'][g==c[0] and k])\n\n        But wait, what if the array becomes of length 1 during the popping?",

Then:\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1 (which is 3>1 -> true) if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip the if block. then g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: now c=[2,-1]\n            then while: 2>1 -> true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 1<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 1 - (-1) = 2\n                pop: c=[2]\n            then break. then check: g==c[0] -> 2==2 -> true, and k=1 -> \"Yes\". But wait: the example says it is possible? However, we never set k=0? Now test with an invalid example: [1, 0] -> remove trailing zero: becomes [1]. Then skip the while loop? then g=0, c[0]=1 -> 0==1 false -> \"No\". Correct. Another invalid: [3, -1] -> \n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: c=[3]\n            then check: g==3? 1==3 -> false -> \"No\". Correct. But what about [1, -2]? Remove trailing zeros? [1,-2] -> last is -2, non-zero. g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-2 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-2) = 2\n                pop: c=[1]\n            then check: 2==1 -> false -> \"No\". But is it valid? We require: \n                    a0=1, a1=-2. Conditions: \n                    total sum: 1-2 = -1 ! =0 -> invalid. So it should be \"No\". Correct. Now a valid one: [1, -1] -> \n            Remove trailing zeros: [1,-1]\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: c=[1]\n            then check: 1==1 -> true -> \"Yes\". Correct. Now an invalid one that fails the condition: [0, 1] -> \n            First condition: [0,1] is not all zeros -> skip. Remove trailing zeros: [0,1] -> last is 1, so we don't pop? Then c=[0,1]\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=1 -> true -> then we check: if 0<1 -> true -> set k=0. then g = 0 - 1 = -1\n                pop: c=[0]\n            then check: g==0? -1==0 -> false, and k=0 -> false -> \"No\". Correct. But note: [0,1] is invalid because the total sum is 1 (not 0) and also the partial sum at the first element is 0, then the next element 1: then the partial sum at the first element must be non-negative (0 is non-negative) but then the last element must be -0=0? but it is 1. Therefore, the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: we are inside the outer if `if g<=c[-1]` and then we check if g is strictly less? Alternatively, we can write: if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        But the problem: we are to output only the missing code? So for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the code has an indentation.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are processing t test cases. For each test case, we have an array `c` of length n.\nThe goal is to determine if we can obtain the array `a` (stored in `c`) with the operations described and end with the pointer at the first element.\n\nThe provided code does:\n1. If the array is all zeros, print \"Yes\".\n2. Otherwise, it removes trailing zeros (because they don't affect the operations since the pointer must end at the first element and we can only move left from non-first and right from non-last).\n3. Then it processes the array from the end. We have a variable `g` that starts at 0 and a flag `k` that is initially 1 (but note: the provided code has `k=1` at the beginning, but then we see `k` is used only in the print at the end).\n\nHowever, the provided code has a while loop that runs while the length of `c` is greater than 1 (i.e., `while len(c)-1` which is equivalent to `while len(c)>1`). Inside, we have:\n   if g <= c[-1]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n   g = g - c.pop()\n\nAnd then after the loop, we print \"Yes\" if `g == c[0]` and `k` is truthy, else \"No\".\n\nBut note: the condition `if g<=c[-1]` is already there, and we have to fill the TODO.\n\nLet's analyze the problem:\n\nWe start at the first element (all zeros) and the pointer at index0.\nWe can do:\n  Operation1: if not last, increase current by 1 and move right.\n  Operation2: if not first, decrease current by 1 and move left.\n\nAnd we must end at the first element.\n\nWe can think of the operations as building a path. Notice that every time we move right we add 1 to the current element and then move, and every time we move left we subtract 1 and then move.\n\nWe can model the entire process as a sequence of moves. Let the array be a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}. We start at index0 and end at index0.\n\nConsider the effect on the array:\n\nLet d_i be the net number of times we cross the edge from i to i+1 (going right) minus the number of times we cross from i+1 to i (going left). Then:\n\nThe value at index0: we start at 0. Then every time we leave index0 to the right (which adds 1) and every time we come back from index1 to index0 (which subtracts 1) and then we leave again? Actually, note:\n\n- When we are at index0 and we do a right move: we add 1 to a0 and move to a1. \n- When we are at index1 and we do a left move: we subtract 1 from a1 and then move to a0.\n\nBut note: the operations do not directly add to a0 when we come back from a1. Instead, the operation that moves left from a1 subtracts 1 from a1 and then moves to a0.\n\nSo the value at a0 is the number of times we left a0 to the right minus the number of times we came back to a0 from the left? Actually, we never come back to a0 from the left because there is no left of a0. So the only operations that affect a0 are the right moves from a0. But note: we can also have a sequence that leaves a0, then comes back, then leaves again? \n\nActually, the net effect:\n\nLet r_i = number of times we move right from i to i+1.\nLet l_i = number of times we move left from i to i-1.\n\nThen the value at index i is:\n  a_i = r_i - l_i   (because every right move from i adds 1, and every left move from i subtracts 1)\n\nBut note: the moves are constrained by the path. The path must start at 0 and end at 0.\n\nThe movement:\n  We start at 0. Then we have:\n      r_0: moves from 0 to 1.\n      Then at 1, we can have moves: r_1 (to 2) and l_1 (back to 0).\n      Similarly, at 2: r_2 and l_2, etc.\n\nThe net moves must satisfy:\n  The number of times we enter a state i must equal the number of times we leave, except for the start and end (which are both 0).\n\nSpecifically, for i=0:\n  We start at 0, so we leave without having entered? Actually, we have:\n      The first move: we leave 0 (right) -> that's one leave.\n      Then we might come back to 0 (from 1) and then leave again? \n  The net: \n      The number of times we leave 0 (r_0) must be one more than the number of times we enter 0 (which is l_1, because we enter 0 only from 1) because we start at 0 and end at 0? \n\nBut note: we end at 0. So the last move must be an entry to 0? Actually, we end at 0 without leaving? \n\nAlternatively, we can model the entire path as a sequence of steps. The net displacement must be zero (because we start and end at 0). \n\nBut note: the operations are constrained by the edges. We can also note:\n\n  The net number of right moves from 0 to 1 must be one more than the left moves from 1 to 0? Actually, the entire path is a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\nThe condition for the walk to be valid is:\n\n  For the starting cell 0:\n      r_0 = l_1 + 1   (because we start at 0: we leave 0 once more than we enter 0? Actually, we start at 0 and then we leave, and then we might come back and leave again, but at the end we are at 0 so the last step must be an entry to 0. Therefore, the number of leaves from 0 is the same as the number of entries to 0? \n\nWait, we start at 0 and end at 0. So the net moves: \n  We leave 0: r_0 times.\n  We enter 0: l_1 times (from 1).\n\nAnd the condition: \n  The first move is a leave (so we have one leave without an entry) and the last move is an entry (so we have one entry without a leave). Therefore, the total leaves from 0 (r_0) must equal the total entries to 0 (l_1). But wait, that would be for a cycle? \n\nActually, we have:\n  Start at 0: so the first move is a right move (leaving 0) -> that counts as one leave without a prior entry.\n  Then at the end, we are at 0: the last move must be a left move from 1 to 0 -> that counts as one entry without a subsequent leave.\n\nTherefore, the entire path has:\n  r_0 = l_1   ??? \n\nBut consider: \n  We start at 0: we do a right move: r_0 becomes 1, then we are at 1. Then we do a left move: l_1 becomes 1, then we are at 0. Then we stop. Then a0 = r_0 - l_0? But note: we never left 0 by a left move? Actually, we cannot leave 0 to the left. So l_0 = 0. Then a0 = 1 - 0 = 1. And a1 = r_1 - l_1 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nBut the condition: we have r_0 = 1 and l_1 = 1 -> so r_0 = l_1.\n\nIn fact, for the entire array:\n\n  For i=0: \n      a0 = r_0 - l_0 = r_0   (since l_0=0, because we can't leave 0 to the left)\n      But also, the net flow: we start at 0 and then we leave and then we come back. The net flow condition: \n          r_0 = l_1   ... (1)\n\n  For i=1 to n-2:\n      The net flow: the number of times we enter i must equal the number of times we leave i. \n          l_i + r_{i-1} ??? Actually, we enter i from i-1 (by a right move) and from i+1 (by a left move). And we leave i by a right move (to i+1) or a left move (to i-1). \n      Actually, the net flow at i (for i from 1 to n-2) is:\n          (r_{i-1} + l_{i+1}) = (l_i + r_i)   ??? \n\nBut note: the walk passes through each cell arbitrarily. The conservation at cell i (for i not 0 and not the last) is:\n      (number of times we enter i) = (number of times we leave i)\n      We enter i from i-1 (via a right move: that's r_{i-1}) and from i+1 (via a left move: that's l_{i+1}? Actually, no: when we are at i+1 and move left, we leave i+1 and enter i: that is l_{i+1}? But note: the move from i+1 to i is a left move at i+1, so it is l_{i+1}. Then the entry to i from i+1 is l_{i+1}. Similarly, the entry to i from i-1 is a right move from i-1: that is r_{i-1}. \n      We leave i by a right move (r_i) or a left move (l_i). \n      Therefore: r_{i-1} + l_{i+1} = r_i + l_i   ... (2)\n\n  For the last cell (n-1):\n      We cannot leave it to the right? So r_{n-1}=0.\n      Then the net flow: \n          We enter the last cell from n-2 (by a right move: r_{n-2}) and from ...? Actually, we cannot enter from the right because there is no cell beyond. So we only enter from n-2. And we leave by left moves? But we can leave by a left move? However, the problem says the pointer must end at the first element, so we cannot be at the last element at the end. Therefore, we must leave the last cell by a left move? But note: we can leave the last cell only by a left move? And then we come back? \n      Actually, the last cell: \n          a_{n-1} = r_{n-1} - l_{n-1} = 0 - l_{n-1} = -l_{n-1}\n      And the flow: \n          We enter the last cell: r_{n-2} (from the left) and we leave the last cell: l_{n-1} (to the left). \n          But we start at 0 and end at 0, so we must leave the last cell as many times as we enter? \n          Therefore: r_{n-2} = l_{n-1}   ... (3)\n\nNow, we have the array a_i = r_i - l_i for every i.\n\nWe can express the flow conditions in terms of a_i and the flows.\n\nBut note: we have the following:\n\n  a0 = r_0 - l_0 = r_0   (since l_0=0) -> r_0 = a0.\n\nFrom (1): r_0 = l_1 -> l_1 = a0.\n\nThen for i=1: \n      a1 = r_1 - l_1 = r_1 - a0.\n\nFrom (2) for i=1: \n      r_0 + l_2 = r_1 + l_1\n      => a0 + l_2 = r_1 + a0   => l_2 = r_1.\n\nBut we have a1 = r_1 - a0 -> r_1 = a1 + a0.\n\nThen l_2 = a1 + a0.\n\nThen for i=2:\n      a2 = r_2 - l_2 = r_2 - (a0+a1)\n\nFrom (2) for i=2:\n      r_1 + l_3 = r_2 + l_2\n      => (a0+a1) + l_3 = r_2 + (a0+a1)   => l_3 = r_2.\n\nThen a2 = r_2 - (a0+a1) -> r_2 = a0+a1+a2.\n\nAnd then l_3 = a0+a1+a2.\n\nWe see a pattern: \n  Let b_i = a0 + a1 + ... + a_i.\n\nThen for i (from 0 to n-2): \n      r_i = b_i   (because r_0 = a0 = b0, r_1 = a0+a1 = b1, r_2 = a0+a1+a2 = b2, ...)\n\nBut wait, for i=0: r_0 = a0 = b0 -> correct.\nfor i=1: r_1 = a0+a1 = b1 -> correct.\n\nAnd for the last cell (n-1): \n      a_{n-1} = r_{n-1} - l_{n-1} = 0 - l_{n-1} -> l_{n-1} = -a_{n-1}.\n      From (3): r_{n-2} = l_{n-1} -> so we have: \n          b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1}   ... (4)\n\nBut note: we also have the flow condition for the last cell? Actually, we have the condition (3) and the expression for a_{n-1}.\n\nMoreover, we must have non-negative moves: \n      r_i >= 0 and l_i >= 0 for every i.\n\nTherefore, we must have:\n      For i from 0 to n-2: b_i >= 0   (because r_i = b_i >=0) \n      For i from 1 to n-1: l_i = b_{i-1} (from the pattern: l_1 = b0, l_2 = b1, ... l_{n-1} = b_{n-2}) and we require l_i>=0 -> so b_{i-1}>=0 for i from 1 to n-1, which is the same as b_j>=0 for j from 0 to n-2.\n\nAdditionally, for the last cell: we have condition (4): b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1}.\n\nBut note: we also have the entire array: \n      The total sum of the array: \n          b_{n-1} = a0+a1+...+a_{n-1} = b_{n-2} + a_{n-1} = -a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nSo the total sum must be 0.\n\nMoreover, we must have that the partial sums from 0 to n-2 are non-negative, and the last element a_{n-1} must be the negative of the partial sum at n-2.\n\nBut note: what about the condition for the last cell? We have l_{n-1} = b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1} and we require l_{n-1}>=0 -> so -a_{n-1}>=0 -> a_{n-1}<=0. But also from condition (4): b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1} and we already have b_{n-2}>=0 -> so a_{n-1} must be non-positive and then -a_{n-1} is non-negative, which is consistent.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require the entire array to be non-negative? The array can have negative values.\n\nBut the constraints we have so far:\n  1. The total sum of the array must be 0.\n  2. The partial sums from index0 to index i (for i from 0 to n-2) must be non-negative.\n  3. The last element a_{n-1} must be the negative of the partial sum at n-2: i.e., a_{n-1} = -b_{n-2}.\n\nBut wait, we also have the condition for the last cell: we cannot leave the last cell to the right? So we must have that the last cell is only left by left moves? And we have l_{n-1} = b_{n-2} and that must be non-negative -> which we have.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says we remove trailing zeros. Why? Because if the last element is zero, then we pop until the last element is non-zero? Actually, the code does:\n\n      while c[-1]==0:\n          c.pop()\n\nSo we remove the zeros at the end until we hit a non-zero.\n\nBut then we process the array from the end. The provided code:\n\n      g = 0\n      while len(c)-1:   # meaning while len(c) > 1\n          if g <= c[-1]:\n              # TODO\n          g = g - c.pop()\n\nAnd then after the loop, we check if g == c[0] and k (which is initially 1) is truthy.\n\nWhat is the meaning of `g`? \n\nLet's try to relate to our conditions:\n\nWe have the condition: \n      b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1}   ... (4)\n\nBut note: if we remove trailing zeros, then the last element is non-zero. Then we start from the end.\n\nIn the code, we have an array `c` that we are popping from the end. We start with the last element (which is non-zero). We set `g=0`. Then:\n\n  Step 1: \n      if g (0) <= c[-1] (the last element) -> then we do something? \n      Then we set g = g - c.pop() = 0 - a_{n-1} = -a_{n-1}.\n\nBut from condition (4): we require -a_{n-1} = b_{n-2}. So now g becomes b_{n-2}? \n\nThen we move to the next to last: which is a_{n-2}. Then we check: if g (which is b_{n-2}) <= a_{n-2}? \n\nBut note: we have the condition that the partial sums must be non-negative. However, we are processing backwards. \n\nActually, the condition we have for the next to last element: \n      The partial sum at n-2: b_{n-2} = a0+a1+...+a_{n-2} must be non-negative? \n\nBut wait, we don't have the entire array? We have removed the trailing zeros. The array now is [a0, a1, ..., a_k] where a_k !=0 and k<=n-1.\n\nBut note: the condition (4) applies to the last element of the original array? But we have removed the trailing zeros. Actually, the problem says: we remove the zeros at the end until the last element is non-zero. Then we process the array without those zeros. \n\nBut the condition (4) must hold for the last non-zero element? Actually, the zeros at the end are not affecting the partial sums? \n\nHowever, consider: if we have an array that ends with zeros, then the last non-zero element must be negative? Because if it were positive, then the partial sum at that position would be positive and then we would have to have the next zeros? But condition (4) only applies to the last element? Actually, the last element of the original array must be the negative of the partial sum at the second last? But if we have zeros at the end, then the last non-zero element must be negative? \n\nBut note: the condition (4) is for the last element of the entire array. However, if we remove the trailing zeros, then the last element of the remaining array is the last non-zero element. Then we must have:\n\n      Let the remaining array be a0, a1, ..., a_m (with a_m !=0). Then the condition (4) for the entire array would require that the partial sum at m-1 (if m is the last index) must be -a_m? \n\nBut wait, the zeros we removed: they are at the end. So the last non-zero element is at position m. Then the original array has a_m, then zeros. Then the last element of the original array is 0. But condition (4) would require that the partial sum at the second last of the entire array (which is the last element of the non-removed array? because the zeros are at the end) must be 0? \n\nActually, condition (4) for the entire array: \n      Let the entire array be a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then we require:\n          b_{n-2} = -a_{n-1}.\n\nBut if a_{n-1}=0, then we require b_{n-2}=0. Then we can remove the last zero? Then the new last element is a_{n-2}. Then we require for the new last element: \n          b_{n-3} = -a_{n-2}? \n\nBut wait, if we remove one trailing zero, then the new last element is a_{n-2}. Then the condition for the entire array (if we consider the array without the last zero) would be: \n          The last element of the entire array was 0, so we had b_{n-2}=0. Then the new last element is a_{n-2}. Then we require for the entire array without the last zero: \n          The condition for the last element of the new array (which is a_{n-2}) would be: \n          b_{n-3} = -a_{n-2}? \n\nBut note: we have b_{n-2} = b_{n-3} + a_{n-2} = 0 -> so b_{n-3} = -a_{n-2}. \n\nTherefore, when we remove a trailing zero, we then require that the new last element must be the negative of the partial sum at the new last but one? \n\nSo the process: \n   We remove all trailing zeros. Then the last element must be negative? because the partial sum at the previous to last must be non-negative and then the last element must be the negative of that partial sum? \n\nBut note: the partial sum at the previous to last (of the entire array) must be non-negative? and then the last element (which is zero) must be the negative of that partial sum? which forces the partial sum to be zero. Then we remove that zero and then the new last element must be the negative of the partial sum at the new last but one? \n\nSo in the non-removed array (with no trailing zeros), the last element must be negative? \n\nNow, the code:\n\n   We remove trailing zeros -> so the last element is non-zero and must be negative? \n\n   Then we set g=0.\n   Then we start popping the last element and updating g = g - last_element.\n\n   But note: the condition (4) for the last element: we require g (after the first pop) becomes -a_m (if a_m is the last element) and that must equal the partial sum at the previous to last? \n\n   Then for the next element (which is the new last, i.e., the previous to last originally): \n        We require that the partial sum at the previous to last (which is the sum of all elements from 0 to m-1) must be non-negative? \n\n   But note: the partial sum at m-1 is the same as the value we have in g (which is -a_m) and we also have the condition: \n        a_m = - (partial sum at m-1)   -> so partial sum at m-1 = -a_m = g (after the first pop).\n\n   Then we pop the next element (a_{m-1}) and update g = g - a_{m-1} = (-a_m) - a_{m-1}.\n\n   But what should we check? \n\n   We have the condition for the element a_{m-1}: \n        The partial sum at m-2 must be non-negative? and also the flow condition for the edge between m-2 and m-1? \n\n   Actually, the condition for the entire array without the last two elements: \n        The partial sum at m-2 = (a0+...+a_{m-2}) = (a0+...+a_{m-1}) - a_{m-1} = (partial sum at m-1) - a_{m-1} = (-a_m) - a_{m-1} = g (after the second pop).\n\n   And we require that to be non-negative? \n\n   But also, we have the condition for the element a_{m-1}: \n        The flow condition: the partial sum at m-2 must be non-negative? \n\n   However, the code has an if condition: \n        if g <= c[-1]: \n            # TODO\n\n   What should we do in the TODO? \n\n   We note that the partial sum at the current last element (which is the next to pop) must be non-negative? But we are processing backwards and g is becoming the partial sum at the previous segment? \n\n   Actually, the value g after popping the last element becomes the partial sum for the segment ending at the new last element? \n\n   But we have a problem: the condition we require is that the partial sums (from the front) are non-negative. However, we are building the partial sums from the back? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: \n\n        Let s_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{m-1} + a_m? \n\n   But note: the total sum is 0: so the partial sum from the front to i is the negative of the partial sum from i+1 to the end? \n\n   Actually, the condition we have is that the partial sums from the front (b_i) are non-negative for i from 0 to m-1 (where m is the last index of the non-removed array). \n\n   And we have: \n        b_i = a0+a1+...+a_i.\n\n   And the total sum: b_{m} = 0.\n\n   Then the partial sum from the back: \n        Let t_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_m = - (b_{i-1})? \n\n   Actually, because b_{i-1} + t_i = 0.\n\n   But we don't have the entire array? \n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate backwards:\n\n        We require that the partial sums from the front (b_i) are non-negative for i=0,...,m-1, and b_{m}=0.\n\n        And we have: \n            b_{m} = b_{m-1} + a_m = 0 -> b_{m-1} = -a_m.\n\n        Then b_{m-2} = b_{m-1} - a_{m-1} = -a_m - a_{m-1}.\n\n        Then b_{m-3} = b_{m-2} - a_{m-2} = -a_m - a_{m-1} - a_{m-2}.\n\n        So in general, when processing backwards, the partial sum from the front at position i is: \n            b_i = - (a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + ... + a_m)\n\n        And we require b_i>=0 for i from 0 to m-1.\n\n        But note: the array we have is from 0 to m. \n\n        Therefore, when we process backwards, we can compute the partial sum from the front at the current starting index by accumulating the negative of the sum from the back? \n\n        Actually, the code is doing:\n\n            g = 0\n            while the array has more than one element:\n                if g <= c[-1]:   # but what if not?\n                    ... \n                g = g - c.pop()\n\n        Then at the end, we check if g equals the first element.\n\n        What is g? \n\n        After popping the last element (a_m): \n            g = 0 - a_m = -a_m = b_{m-1}   (which must be non-negative? and we know it is because we require b_{m-1}>=0).\n\n        Then we pop the next element (a_{m-1}): \n            g = g - a_{m-1} = -a_m - a_{m-1} = b_{m-2}.\n\n        Then we pop a_{m-2}:\n            g = g - a_{m-2} = -a_m - a_{m-1} - a_{m-2} = b_{m-3}.\n\n        So g is the partial sum from the front at the index that is the previous to the last popped? \n\n        And we require that at every step, the partial sum (which is g) is non-negative? \n\n        But note: the condition in the code is:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]: \n\n        Why? \n\n        Actually, we have an additional constraint: the moves must be non-negative. But note: we also have the condition that the partial sums from the front must be non-negative? \n\n        However, the condition we have is that the partial sums (b_i) must be non-negative. And g is exactly b_i for the index i that is the current last element? \n\n        But wait: when we have popped the last two elements, then the current g is b_{m-2}. Then we are about to pop a_{m-2}. Then we check: if g <= c[-1]? \n\n        What is the meaning? \n\n        Consider the element at position m-2: \n            We have: \n                a_{m-2} = r_{m-2} - l_{m-2} \n                and the flow condition: \n                    r_{m-3} + l_{m-1} = r_{m-2} + l_{m-2}\n\n            But we have: \n                l_{m-1} = b_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> which is g (before we pop a_{m-2}).\n                r_{m-2} = b_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> which is g.\n\n            Then the equation: \n                r_{m-3} + g = g + l_{m-2}   -> so r_{m-3} = l_{m-2}.\n\n            Then a_{m-2} = r_{m-2} - l_{m-2} = g - l_{m-2} = g - r_{m-3}.\n\n            But we also have: \n                b_{m-3} = r_{m-3} = l_{m-2}   (from the pattern) -> so a_{m-2} = g - b_{m-3}.\n\n            But note: b_{m-3} = b_{m-2} - a_{m-2} = g - a_{m-2}.\n\n            Then: a_{m-2} = g - (g - a_{m-2}) = a_{m-2} -> tautology.\n\n        So what is the constraint? \n\n        Actually, we have the constraint that the moves are non-negative: \n            r_{m-2} = g >=0 -> which we have because we require the partial sums to be non-negative? \n            l_{m-2} = r_{m-3} = b_{m-3} = g - a_{m-2} >=0 -> so we require g - a_{m-2} >=0 -> a_{m-2} <= g.\n\n        Therefore, we must have a_{m-2} <= g (which is the current value of g, which is the partial sum at m-2).\n\n        Similarly, for the next element: \n            After popping a_{m-2}, we update g = g - a_{m-2} = b_{m-3} (which must be non-negative) and then we check the next element: a_{m-3} must be <= g (which is now b_{m-3})? \n\n        But wait: the condition for a_{m-3} is: \n            l_{m-2} = b_{m-3} = g (after the update) and then the constraint: \n                a_{m-3} = r_{m-3} - l_{m-3} = b_{m-3} - l_{m-3} \n            and the flow condition: \n                r_{m-4} + l_{m-2} = r_{m-3} + l_{m-3} \n            -> r_{m-4} + g = b_{m-3} + l_{m-3} = g + l_{m-3}   (since b_{m-3}=g) \n            -> r_{m-4} = l_{m-3} \n            -> then a_{m-3} = g - l_{m-3} = g - r_{m-4} = g - b_{m-4} \n            and we also have: \n                b_{m-4} = b_{m-3} - a_{m-3} = g - a_{m-3} \n            so a_{m-3} = g - (g - a_{m-3}) = a_{m-3} -> tautology.\n\n        The constraint: l_{m-3} = r_{m-4} = b_{m-4} = g - a_{m-3} >=0 -> so a_{m-3} <= g.\n\n        Therefore, at every step (except the last one) we must have that the current last element is <= the current value of g.\n\n        But note: the current g is the partial sum at the next segment? and we are about to pop the current last element. \n\n        Therefore, the condition in the code:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]: \n\n        should be: if the condition fails, we break? because it's impossible? \n\n        Actually, we require a_{i} <= g at every step (for the current last element a_i and the current g). \n\n        But the condition is: if g <= c[-1] -> then we can proceed? but we require the opposite: we require c[-1] <= g? \n\n        So the condition should be: if g < c[-1] then it's invalid? \n\n        Actually, the condition we have is: we require a_i <= g. So if a_i > g, then we break.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO part should set a flag (k) to 0 if the condition fails? \n\n        The code has a variable `k` that is initially 1. Then we can set k=0 if we find an invalid condition.\n\n        So:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]: \n                # This is not the condition we want. We want: if g < c[-1] then invalid? \n\n        Actually, we require: c[-1] <= g? \n\n        So if c[-1] > g, then we set k=0.\n\n        But note: the condition in the if is: if g <= c[-1] -> that is equivalent to c[-1] >= g? which is the opposite of what we want? \n\n        We want to check if c[-1] > g -> then invalid.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition must hold for every step. So if at any step we have c[-1] > g, then we set k=0 and break? \n\n        However, the code does not break? It continues. But we can break? or set k=0 and then continue? but then the g update might be negative and then the next condition might also fail? \n\n        But the problem: we can break early? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set k=0 and break the loop? But the code doesn't have a break. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n            # and then update g = g - c.pop()\n\n        But then if we set k=0, we still continue? and then at the end we check k and g==c[0]. \n\n        However, if we set k=0, then the final condition will be false? \n\n        But note: we have multiple conditions: we require k to be true and g==c[0]. \n\n        So if we set k=0 at any time, then the answer will be \"No\".\n\n        But what about the update? We update g = g - c.pop() even if we set k=0? \n\n        That might lead to negative g? and then the next condition might also fail? \n\n        But we can do that? \n\n        However, we must also consider: the partial sums must be non-negative? but if we set k=0, we don't care? \n\n        But the problem: we are popping the entire array until one element remains? \n\n        So the code:\n\n            while len(c)-1:   # while len(c)>1\n                if g < c[-1]:\n                    k = 0\n                g = g - c.pop()\n\n        Then at the end, we have one element left in c (which is the first element) and we check if k is true and g==c[0].\n\n        But what is g at the end? \n\n        We have: \n            g = ... and then we pop until only the first element remains.\n\n        The entire array: \n            g = ... - a_2 - a_1? \n\n        But note: the total sum is 0: \n            a0 + a1 + ... + a_m = 0.\n\n        Then the partial sum from the front at the first element: \n            b0 = a0.\n\n        And we have: \n            g = (after popping all) = - (a1+a2+...+a_m) = a0? \n\n        Because a0 + (a1+...+a_m)=0 -> a0 = - (a1+...+a_m).\n\n        Therefore, we require g == a0.\n\n        So the final condition: \n            k must be true (meaning we never had an element that was greater than the current g) and g == c[0] (which is a0).\n\n        Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition we derived is c[-1] <= g? and if not, we set k=0.\n\n        However, the condition in the if is written as `if g <= c[-1]` in the provided code? \n\n        We are going to change that condition to check the opposite? \n\n        Actually, the provided code has:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]:\n                # TODO\n\n        We want to set k=0 when g < c[-1] is false? Actually, no: we want to set k=0 when c[-1] > g.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition in the code is already `if g <= c[-1]`? \n\n        Actually, the condition `g <= c[-1]` is equivalent to `c[-1] >= g`. We want to set k=0 when `c[-1] > g`, which is the same as `not (g >= c[-1])`? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        But the condition is written as `if g <= c[-1]` which is true when c[-1]>=g. So we want to do something when the condition fails? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is the same as `c[-1] > g`.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But the provided condition is `if g <= c[-1]`? We can change the condition? \n\n        The problem says: we must fill in the missing code. We are allowed to change the condition? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is inside the if block. So we can do:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]:\n                if g < c[-1]:   # then we set k=0? but wait, if g==c[-1] is allowed? \n                    k = 0\n\n        But note: when g==c[-1], then we have a_{i} = g, then the next g becomes g - a_i = 0, which is non-negative? and then we require the next element to be <=0? \n\n        But wait: the condition we derived is a_i <= g. So if a_i = g, then it is allowed? \n\n        Therefore, we only set k=0 when a_i > g.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g <= c[-1]` is true when g<=c[-1] (which includes g==c[-1] and g<c[-1]). We only want to set k=0 when g < c[-1] is false? Actually, no: we want to set k=0 when g < c[-1] is true? \n\n        Actually, we want to set k=0 when c[-1] > g, i.e., when g < c[-1]. \n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g <= c[-1]` is true for both g==c[-1] and g<c[-1]. We only want to set k=0 in the case g<c[-1]? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        regardless of the outer if? \n\n        But the outer if is `if g<=c[-1]`? Then we are inside when g<=c[-1]. But we want to set k=0 when g < c[-1]? That doesn't make sense because we are inside the if only when g<=c[-1]. \n\n        Actually, we want to set k=0 whenever we have c[-1] > g, but note: the condition `g<=c[-1]` is true when g<=c[-1] and false when g>c[-1]. \n\n        And when g>c[-1], we don't set k=0? But we must set k=0 when c[-1] > g? \n\n        Actually, the condition `c[-1] > g` is the same as `g < c[-1]`. \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the outer if condition is `if g<=c[-1]` which is true when g<=c[-1]. Then inside, we check if g < c[-1]? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do without the outer if? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            if g<=c[-1]:\n                # TODO\n\n        We can change that to:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But wait, what if g>c[-1]? Then we skip the if and then we update g? without setting k=0? \n\n        But we must set k=0 when g < c[-1] OR when g>c[-1]? \n\n        Actually, no: we only require that c[-1] <= g. So if g < c[-1] -> invalid. But if g>c[-1] -> valid? \n\n        But wait: we derived that we require c[-1] <= g. So if g < c[-1] -> invalid. If g>=c[-1] -> valid? \n\n        Therefore, we only set k=0 when g < c[-1]. \n\n        But the condition `g < c[-1]` can happen even if the outer if condition `g<=c[-1]` is true? Actually, when g<=c[-1] is true, then g < c[-1] is one possibility (the other is g==c[-1]). \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        inside the if block? \n\n        But note: if g>c[-1], then we don't enter the outer if, and we don't set k=0? \n\n        But we require that if g>c[-1], then it is valid? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: we require c[-1] <= g. So if g>=c[-1], it's valid. If g < c[-1], it's invalid.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        without the outer if? \n\n        But the provided code has an outer if. We cannot remove it? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to:\n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        and remove the outer if? \n\n        But the problem says: we must fill the TODO. We cannot change the existing if condition? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if g <= c[-1]:\n                # We don't care? because if g<=c[-1] then it might be g==c[-1] (valid) or g<c[-1] (invalid). \n                # So we need to check: if g < c[-1] then set k=0.\n                if g < c[-1]:\n                    k = 0\n\n        But note: if g==c[-1], we do nothing? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        and remove the outer if? \n\n        But the problem says: we are to fill the TODO. We are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n        The existing code is:\n\n            if g<=c[-1]:\n                # TODO\n\n        We can fill the TODO with:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: if g==c[-1], we do nothing. And if g>c[-1], we skip the outer if and do nothing? \n\n        But we must set k=0 only when g < c[-1]? \n\n        However, what if g>c[-1]? Then we skip the outer if and then update g? without setting k=0? \n\n        That is acceptable because g>c[-1] is allowed? \n\n        But wait: we require c[-1] <= g? so if g>c[-1], then it is allowed? \n\n        Therefore, we only set k=0 when we have g < c[-1]? \n\n        But note: the condition g>c[-1] is allowed? \n\n        So the TODO is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is only possible if the outer if condition `g<=c[-1]` is true? Actually, no: if g<=c[-1] is true, then g<c[-1] is one case. But if g>c[-1], then we don't enter the outer if. \n\n        Therefore, we can also set k=0 when we don't enter the outer if? \n\n        Actually, no: because if g>c[-1], then we don't set k=0? and that is correct.\n\n        So we only set k=0 when we have g < c[-1]? \n\n        But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is the same as `c[-1] > g`, which is the invalid condition.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside when g<=c[-1]. Then we check if g is strictly less than c[-1]? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        without an if? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        and it will be executed only when g<=c[-1]? \n\n        But no: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside that block. Then we check if g < c[-1]? \n\n        So:\n\n            if g<=c[-1]:\n                if g < c[-1]:\n                    k = 0\n\n        But note: if g==c[-1], we do nothing. \n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        without the outer if? \n\n        But we cannot remove the outer if? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the logic: \n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        and remove the outer if? \n\n        But the problem says: we must fill the TODO. We are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n        The existing code has the outer if and the update of g after the TODO. \n\n        Therefore, we fill the TODO with:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the condition `g < c[-1]` is only true when g is strictly less than c[-1]. \n\n        However, we can also write:\n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        which is equivalent.\n\n        But the problem: the outer if condition is `g<=c[-1]` and we are inside that block. Then if we set k=0 when c[-1]>g, that is always true inside the block? because if we are inside, then g<=c[-1] and then c[-1]>=g. So c[-1]>g is the same as g < c[-1]. \n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        So the code for program1.py becomes:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):\n                n=int(input())\n                c=[int(j) for j in input().split()]\n                k=1\n                if [0]*n==c:\n                    print('Yes')\n                else:\n                    g=0\n                    while c[-1]==0:\n                        c.pop()\n                    while len(c)-1:\n                        if g<=c[-1]:\n                            if g < c[-1]:\n                                k = 0\n                        g=g-c.pop()\n                    print(['No','Yes'][g==c[0] and k])\n\n        But wait, what if the array becomes of length 1 during the popping? The while condition is `while len(c)-1` which is while len(c)>1. So when we pop until the array has one element, we break.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if during the popping we set k=0? Then the final condition is false.\n\n        But note: we also update g even if we set k=0? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        But let's test with the example: [0,0] -> we remove one trailing zero? then the array becomes [0]? but then we skip the while loop? and then we check g==c[0] and k: g=0, c[0]=0, k=1 -> \"Yes\". But [0,0] should be \"Yes\"? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we start with [0,0] and then we do nothing? but we must end at the first element. We start at the first element? so we don't move. Then it is valid? \n\n        But the code: \n            if [0]*n==c: \n                print('Yes')\n\n        So [0,0] is caught by the first condition? \n\n        Then the else: we remove trailing zeros: \n            while c[-1]==0: \n                c.pop()   -> becomes [0]? \n            then the while loop: len(c)=1 -> skip.\n            then we check: g=0, c[0]=0, k=1 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        Now test with the example: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> which is the example in the note.\n\n        We remove the trailing zero: becomes [2,-1,-1].\n\n        Then:\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1 (which is 3>1 -> true)\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip the if block.\n                then g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: now c=[2,-1]\n            then while: 2>1 -> true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 1<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 1 - (-1) = 2\n                pop: c=[2]\n            then break.\n            then check: g==c[0] -> 2==2 -> true, and k=1 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        But wait: the example says it is possible? \n\n        However, we never set k=0? \n\n        Now test with an invalid example: [1, 0] -> remove trailing zero: becomes [1]. Then skip the while loop? then g=0, c[0]=1 -> 0==1 false -> \"No\". Correct.\n\n        Another invalid: [3, -1] -> \n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: c=[3]\n            then check: g==3? 1==3 -> false -> \"No\". Correct.\n\n        But what about [1, -2]? \n            Remove trailing zeros? [1,-2] -> last is -2, non-zero.\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-2 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-2) = 2\n                pop: c=[1]\n            then check: 2==1 -> false -> \"No\". \n            But is it valid? \n                We require: \n                    a0=1, a1=-2.\n                Conditions: \n                    total sum: 1-2 = -1 !=0 -> invalid. \n                So it should be \"No\". Correct.\n\n        Now a valid one: [1, -1] -> \n            Remove trailing zeros: [1,-1]\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=-1 -> false -> skip\n                g = 0 - (-1) = 1\n                pop: c=[1]\n            then check: 1==1 -> true -> \"Yes\". Correct.\n\n        Now an invalid one that fails the condition: [0, 1] -> \n            First condition: [0,1] is not all zeros -> skip.\n            Remove trailing zeros: [0,1] -> last is 1, so we don't pop? \n            Then c=[0,1]\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1: true\n                if g<=c[-1]: 0<=1 -> true -> then we check: if 0<1 -> true -> set k=0.\n                then g = 0 - 1 = -1\n                pop: c=[0]\n            then check: g==0? -1==0 -> false, and k=0 -> false -> \"No\". Correct.\n\n        But note: [0,1] is invalid because the total sum is 1 (not 0) and also the partial sum at the first element is 0, then the next element 1: then the partial sum at the first element must be non-negative (0 is non-negative) but then the last element must be -0=0? but it is 1. \n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: we are inside the outer if `if g<=c[-1]` and then we check if g is strictly less? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if c[-1] > g:\n                k = 0\n\n        But the problem: we are to output only the missing code? \n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        But note: the code has an indentation. We are inside the while loop and inside the outer if. \n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. The first line is t, then for each test case: n and a string s.\n\nThe problem: stamping two adjacent cells with either \"RB\" or \"BR\". We can stamp multiple times. The stamp must cover two adjacent cells. \n\nWe note:\n  - The stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to either \"RB\" or \"BR\". \n  - We can stamp the same cell multiple times. \n\nWe are to determine if the given string s (composed of 'R','B','W') can be obtained.\n\nNote: \n  - 'W' means white, which is the initial color.\n\nObservations:\n  - The operations only color non-white cells? Actually, the initial is white, and then we stamp. But note: we can stamp multiple times. \n  - The key: every stamping operation colors two adjacent cells to be one red and one blue. \n\nTherefore, the entire picture must satisfy:\n  - The number of red and blue cells must be such that in contiguous non-white segments, the counts of R and B are equal? \n\nBut note: we can have overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n\n  - The operation is linear and reversible? \n\n  - Note that the entire process can be seen as assigning a value to each cell: \n        Let white = 0, red = 1, blue = -1.\n\n    Then each stamping operation adds to two adjacent cells: \n        either (1, -1) or (-1, 1).\n\n    Therefore, the total sum of the entire array must be 0.\n\n    Also, the sum of any contiguous segment that is stamped must be 0? \n\n  - But note: we can stamp arbitrarily. The entire array might not be contiguous? \n\n  - However, the white cells are the ones that are never stamped? \n\n  - So we split the string by 'W'. Then for each contiguous segment of non-white (only 'R' and 'B'), we require that the segment can be decomposed into stamps? \n\n  - Conditions for a contiguous segment of non-white:\n        Condition 1: the length must be even? because each stamp covers two cells? \n        Condition 2: the total sum of the segment must be 0? \n\n    But note: we can stamp multiple times on the same cell. Then the net effect: \n          The value of a cell is the sum of all stamps that covered it? \n\n    However, the stamps are either (1,-1) or (-1,1). So the net value of a cell is the sum of the contributions from each stamp that covers it. \n\n    But note: the problem: the stamping operation sets the cell to a color? It does not add. \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". \n\n    And the example: \n        WWWWW -> then stamp on the last two: becomes WWWRB -> then stamp on the first two: becomes BRRB? \n\n    But note: the example: \n        WWWWW -> stamp on the middle two: WW RB W -> then stamp on the first two: BR RB W -> then stamp on the second and third: B (from the first stamp) and then the second stamp: originally W then stamped to R? but then the third stamp: stamps the second and third: which are R and W? \n\n    Actually, the example: \n        Step1: WWWWW -> stamp on the last two: so the last two become RB -> so the string becomes WWWRB? \n        Step2: then stamp on the first two: becomes BR on the first two -> so the string becomes BR WRB? \n        Step3: then stamp on the second and third: which are W and R? then becomes RB? so the string becomes B (from first) then R (from the stamp on second and third) then B (from the stamp on second and third for the third cell) and then the last two are RB? -> BRB RB? \n\n    But the example says: becomes B R B B W? \n\n    Actually, the example: \n        Step1: WWWWW -> stamp on the last two: becomes WWW RB -> then they stamp the first two: becomes BR RB W -> then they stamp the second and third: which are the R (from the first stamp) and the W? -> but the third cell is W? \n\n    The example says: \n        Step3: becomes B (from first) then the second and third: which are R and W? -> but the stamp covers two adjacent cells: the second and third. The second is R and the third is W. Then the stamp sets them to RB? so the second becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then the string becomes: B (first), R (second), B (third), then the last two are RB? -> BRB, and then the last two are RB? but the last two are the fourth and fifth: which are R and B? so the entire string: BRB RB? \n\n    But the example says: BRB B? \n\n    Actually, the example: \n        \"WWW\" -> \"W\" + stamp on the last two: becomes \"WRB\" -> then stamp on the first two: becomes \"BRB\" (because the first two: WW -> becomes BR? then the string becomes \"BR\" + \"B\" -> but wait, the third cell was B? \n\n    It's complex. \n\n    Alternate approach: \n\n        We note that the stamping operation is reversible? \n\n        We can use a greedy: \n          We split the string by 'W'. Then for each contiguous non-white segment, we check if it is possible.\n\n        Conditions for a segment:\n          - The segment must have an even length? \n          - But the example: \"RB\" -> length=2 -> valid.\n          - \"R\" -> length=1 -> invalid? \n          - \"RBRB\" -> valid.\n\n        But note: we can have \"RR\" -> is it valid? \n          How to make \"RR\"? \n          We can do:\n              Start: WW -> stamp: either RB or BR. \n              Then stamp again on the same two: \n                  If we stamp RB again: then the first cell: R becomes (if we stamp RB: the first cell becomes R again? but the stamp sets the two cells to RB. So if we stamp RB on a cell that is R and B? \n                  Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to RB. So if we have RB and we stamp with RB again, we get RB? \n                  But if we have RB and we stamp with BR, we get BR? \n\n          How to get RR? \n            We can do:\n                Start: WW -> stamp with RB: becomes RB.\n                Then stamp the same two with BR: becomes BR? \n                Then stamp the same two with RB: becomes RB? \n\n          It seems we cannot get RR? \n\n        Therefore, we must have an alternating pattern? \n\n        But note: we can also stamp overlapping. \n\n        Example: \"RR\" is not possible? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \n            The first test case: \"BRBBW\" -> is not possible? \n            The second, third, fourth: single non-white -> not possible.\n\n        So the conditions for a contiguous segment (without white) are:\n          - The length must be at least 1? \n          - If the length is 1, then impossible.\n          - If the length>=2, then we must be able to assign the entire segment as a sequence of stamps? \n\n        But note: the entire segment must be such that it is possible to assign stamps arbitrarily? \n\n        Insight: \n          The stamping operation is commutative? because each stamp adds a pattern. But the problem: the stamp sets the color? \n\n        Actually, we can model the entire process as: \n            Each cell is stamped an arbitrary number of times. The final color is the last stamp that covered it? \n\n        But note: the stamping operation sets two adjacent cells. \n\n        Alternate insight from known solutions to similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems):\n\n          We can use a greedy from left to right? \n\n          We note:\n            - The white cells are separators. \n            - For a contiguous segment of non-white, we can check:\n                  Let the segment be s[0..k-1] (only R and B).\n                  We can form the segment if and only if the segment is non-empty and the entire segment is not composed of a single color? \n\n          But the example: \n              \"R\" -> invalid.\n              \"RB\" -> valid.\n              \"RBR\" -> valid? \n                 How: \n                    Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> then we have RBW (if the segment is three? but we have three non-white? then we stamp the last two: which are BW? -> but we cannot stamp a white and a non-white? \n\n          Actually, the stamp must cover two adjacent cells that are within the segment? \n\n          We can do:\n              We require that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n\n          But the example: \n              \"RR\" -> invalid? \n              \"RBR\" -> valid? \n                 How: \n                    We can stamp the first two: set to BR? -> then we have BRR? \n                    Then stamp the last two: set to RB? -> then we have B (from first) then R (from first stamp) then B (from second stamp) -> BRB? \n\n          How to get RBR? \n\n          Alternate known solution for the same problem (from Codeforces Round #778): \n              We split by 'W'. For each segment, if the segment is not empty, then we check that it contains at least one R and at least one B? \n\n          Why? \n              Because if the entire segment is R, then we cannot have any B? but every stamp must put one R and one B? \n\n          But note: we can stamp multiple times. However, the net effect: the entire segment must have an equal number of R and B? \n\n          But wait: the entire segment: the sum of the values (if R=1, B=-1) must be 0? \n\n          And the length must be even? \n\n          But the known solution: \n              for _ in range(int(input())):\n                  n = int(input())\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  if s == \"R\"*n or s == \"B\"*n:\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      continue\n                  # or split by W?\n                  parts = s.split('W')\n                  valid = True\n                  for part in parts:\n                      if part == \"\":\n                          continue\n                      if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          But the example: \n              \"RR\" -> then part = \"RR\", then 'R' is in part and 'B' is not in part -> invalid -> \"NO\". \n              \"RB\" -> valid -> \"YES\".\n              \"RBR\" -> part = \"RBR\", which has 'R' and 'B' -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n          However, the example \"RR\" is invalid? \n\n          But the problem: \n              The fifth test case: \"B RB\" (with n=3, s=\"BRB\") -> valid? \n              The sixth: \"R BB\" (s=\"RBB\") -> valid? \n\n          The known solution: \n              \"BRB\": split by 'W' -> ['BRB'] -> has R and B -> valid -> \"YES\".\n              \"RBB\": split by 'W' -> ['RBB'] -> has R and B -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n          But the example: \n              The seventh: \"\" (all white) -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n          However, the problem says: \n              The second, third, and fourth test cases: \n                  The second: n=1, s=\"R\" -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n                  The third: n=1, s=\"B\" -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n                  The fourth: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> valid? but the known solution: split into ['',''] -> skip -> valid -> \"YES\". \n\n          But the problem says: \n              \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          However, the fourth test case: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> we don't stamp at all? so it is valid? \n\n          The known solution would output \"YES\" for \"WW\", which is correct.\n\n          But the second and third: \n              n=1, s=\"R\": \n                  parts = ['R'] -> then we check: if 'R' in 'R' -> true, but 'B' not in 'R' -> so we set valid=False -> \"NO\". \n\n          Therefore, the known solution is: \n              Split the string by 'W'. For each non-empty part, we require that the part contains at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n          Why is that? \n              Because if a contiguous segment has only one color, then it is impossible. \n\n          But note: we can have a segment of length 1: which is one color -> invalid. \n          And a segment of length>=2 that is all the same color: invalid. \n\n          And if a segment has both colors, then we can always form it? \n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            We read the test cases: \n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n                    # s is the string for each test case, but note: the first line is t, then the next lines: first line of test case is n, then the string. \n                    # [*open(0)]: \n                    #   index0: t\n                    #   index1: n for first test case\n                    #   index2: s for first test case\n                    #   index3: n for second test case\n                    #   index4: s for second test case, etc.\n                    # So [2::2] gives every even index starting at 2: that is the strings? \n                    # But note: the first test case: \n                    #   t\n                    #   n1\n                    #   s1\n                    #   n2\n                    #   s2\n                    # So [2::2] gives s1, s2, ... \n\n            Then we process each string s (which has a newline? we should strip).\n\n            Steps:\n                s = s.strip()\n                if the entire string is white? then we can do nothing -> valid.\n                But the condition: we split by 'W' and then check each part.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '': \n                        continue\n                    if part.count('R')==0 or part.count('B')==0:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n\n                Then print \"YES\" if valid else \"NO\"\n\n            But the problem: we must output the answer for each test case.\n\n            The code: \n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    flag = True\n                    for p in parts:\n                        if p == '':\n                            continue\n                        if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                            flag = False\n                            break\n                    print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n            But note: the problem says the total length of all test cases <= 10^5, so splitting is efficient.\n\n        However, the problem: \n            The example: \"RR\" -> invalid -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        But what about \"RWR\"? \n            Split: ['R', '', 'R'] -> then the first part \"R\": invalid -> \"NO\". \n\n        Correct? \n            We have: \n                R at the first, then white, then R at the last. \n            How to make \"RWR\"? \n                We cannot stamp a single R? so it is invalid.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            flag = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if len(p)==0:\n                    continue\n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the problem says: output only the missing code?

n>=1, so s is at least one char.\n\n        We can simplify:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for part in parts:\n                if part and not ('R' in part and 'B' in part):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: if part is non-empty, we require both R and B to be present. \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            for part in parts:\n                if part and (part.find('R')==-1 or part.find('B')==-1):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        But we cannot break the outer loop? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part != '' and (part.count('R')==0 or part.count('B')==0):\n                        print('NO')\n                        break\n                else:\n                    print('YES')\n\n        But note: the break inside the for part will break the inner for, then we have to avoid printing twice.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a flag.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                ok = True\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p and not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                        ok = False\n                        break\n                print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        This is clear.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p != '':\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        ok = False\n                        break\n            print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        But note: the problem says: output only the missing code? and the provided code is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to fill the TODO? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is the entire body of the for loop? \n\n        But the for loop is over the test cases. We are to process one test case per s.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p != '' and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        But note: the print will output for each test case.\n\n        However, the problem: the output must be exactly the answers for each test case.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above block.\n\n        But note: the input s might have a newline? we strip it.\n\n        We assume that.\n\n        Let's test with the example: \n            Test case: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> \n                s.strip() -> \"BRB\"\n                split by 'W' -> ['BRB'] -> then for p in ['BRB']: \n                    p != '' -> true\n                    check: 'R' in 'BRB' -> true, 'B' in 'BRB' -> true -> so condition fails? \n                    condition: if p != '' and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) -> false -> so we don't set ok=False.\n                then print 'YES'\n\n            Test case: n=1, s=\"R\" -> \n                s.strip() -> \"R\"\n                split -> ['R'] -> then: \n                    if '' -> false, then condition: true and (True or ...) -> 'R' not in 'R'? false, 'B' not in 'R'? true -> so condition: true and (false or true) = true -> set ok=False -> print 'NO'\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But note: the condition: \n            if p != '' and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n\n        is equivalent to: \n            if p and (not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)):\n\n        which is what we want.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        We can write without parentheses in the condition? \n\n        But the condition: \n            if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n\n        is correct.\n\n        So the final answer:\n\n        We output a json:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ok = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            ok = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the indentation in program1: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop and 12 spaces for the if. So we write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        with 12 spaces for the if and 16 for the inner.\n\n        However, the problem says: output only the missing code? and we are to output the exact code to fill.\n\n        For program1, the missing code is two lines? \n\n        We write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\n\n        But the existing code has the if condition and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n        Similarly, for program2, we are replacing the entire for loop body.\n\n        But note: the program2 provided code: \n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to fill the TODO with the entire block? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is the body of the for loop? \n\n        Therefore, we write the block with the same indentation as the for loop? \n\n        The for loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        But the provided code: the for loop is written without a body? \n\n        We are to write the body? \n\n        So for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        But note: the variable s is the line from the file, which includes the newline. We strip it.\n\n        We assume that.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer in json.\n\n        We output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    if g < c[-1]:\\n        k = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ok = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            ok = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\"\n            }\n\n        But wait: the program1 code: the existing code has:\n\n            while len(c)-1:\n                if g<=c[-1]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                g=g-c.pop()\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        The indentation: the TODO is at the same level as the if. So we write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        with the same indentation as the TODO (which is 8 more spaces than the while?).\n\n        Actually, the while is at 8 spaces (because the else: is at 4, then the while is at 8). Then the if is at 12. Then the TODO is at 16? \n\n        But the code:\n\n            else:\n                g=0\n                while c[-1]==0:\n                    c.pop()\n                while len(c)-1:\n                    if g<=c[-1]:\n                        # TODO\n                    g=g-c.pop()\n\n        The TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\n        Actually, let me count:\n\n            else: -> 4\n                g=0 -> 8\n                while ...: -> 8\n                    ... -> 12\n                while ...: -> 8\n                    if ...: -> 12\n                        # TODO -> 16\n\n        So we write:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:   -> at 16 spaces\n                k = 0        -> at 20 spaces\n\n        But the code we are to output: \n\n            \"program1\": \"    if g < c[-1]:\\n        k = 0\"\n\n        But we need to represent the exact indentation? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"    if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        But the existing code has 16 spaces for the TODO? \n\n        Actually, we can count the spaces: \n\n            The while loop: at 8 (from the else: which is 4, then the block is 8)\n            then the if: at 12 (inside the while)\n            then the TODO: at 16 (inside the if)\n\n        So the missing code should be at 16 and 20.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"    if g < c[-1]:\\n        k = 0\"\n\n        but that would be 4 and 8? \n\n        We must output the exact code that would be placed in the TODO, with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is at 16 spaces? then the next line for the inner if should be 16 and then the inner block 20.\n\n        But the code we are writing is:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        So:\n\n            Line1: 16 spaces + \"if g < c[-1]:\"\n            Line2: 20 spaces + \"k = 0\"\n\n        How to represent? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        But that would be without the 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing code has the 16 spaces for the if. We are replacing the TODO with two lines that are at 16 and 20.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        meaning: the first line is the same level as the TODO (so 16 spaces are already there) and we write the condition, then the next line with 16+4=20 spaces for the inner block.\n\n        But the TODO is at 16, and we are replacing it with:\n\n            if g < c[-1]:\n                k = 0\n\n        So the first line: we write \"if g < c[-1]:\" at the same indentation as the TODO (so 16 spaces) and then the next line: 20 spaces and \"k = 0\".\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        But note: the existing code has the if condition and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines. The first line is the if condition and the second is the assignment.\n\n        However, the existing if condition is already there. We are only filling the TODO block? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is inside the outer if. We are to write two lines of code that are at the same level as the TODO.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            Line1: \"if g < c[-1]:\"   -> at 16 spaces\n            Line2: \"k = 0\"            -> at 20 spaces\n\n        So the string is:\n\n            \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        But the newline and the 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the 16 spaces are already there? \n\n        We are only to output the code that replaces the TODO comment? \n\n        So we output:\n\n            \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\"\n\n        For program2, we are to output the entire body of the for loop? \n\n        The for loop is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        and then the body? \n\n        The body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        We write:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\n\n        But we need to represent it as a string with newlines and the same indentation? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ok = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            ok = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\"\n\n        This is 4 spaces for each line? \n\n        But the for loop body is at 4 spaces. Then the inner for loop is at 8, and the if inside the for is at 12, and the break at 16.\n\n        However, we write:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n            Line2: 4 spaces: \"    parts = s.split('W')\"\n            Line3: 4 spaces: \"    ok = True\"\n            Line4: 4 spaces: \"    for p in parts:\"\n            Line5: 8 spaces: \"        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\"\n            Line6: 12 spaces: \"            ok = False\"\n            Line7: 12 spaces: \"            break\"\n            Line8: 4 spaces: \"    print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\"\n\n        But the code we output as a string: we have to escape? \n\n        We are to output a json string. We must escape newlines and quotes? \n\n        But the problem: we output a json. We can use \\n for newline.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if g < c[-1]:\\n                k = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ok = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            ok = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if ok else 'NO')\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 code: the inner for loop and the condition: we have to be careful with the parentheses? \n\n        We wrote: \"if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\"\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        We output the json."
