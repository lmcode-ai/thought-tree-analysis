The operation with a zero and a non-zero: \n          They are not equal, so we change both to min(0, non_zero)=0. So in one operation, we can set one non-zero to zero? But wait: we set both to zero? Actually, we set both to min(0, non_zero)=0. So if we have one zero and one non-zero, we can set the non-zero to zero and the zero remains zero? So we clear one non-zero per operation? But note: we have two numbers: we set both to zero. So if we have one zero and k non-zeros, we can do:\n          Operation 1: zero and non_zero1 -> both become zero. Now we have two zeros and k-1 non-zeros. Operation 2: zero and non_zero2 -> both become zero. Now we have three zeros and k-2 non-zeros.\n          ... until all are zero. So the number of operations = k (the number of non-zeros). Therefore, if there is at least one zero, then the answer = (number of non-zeros) = n - (number of zeros). But what if there are no zeros initially?\n\n  Example: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations. How to clear?\n\n      Step1: choose 1 and 2 -> they are different, so set both to min(1,2)=1. Now the array becomes [1,1,3]. Step2: choose the two 1's -> set one of them to 0. Now [0,1,3].\n      Step3: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: [0,0,3].\n      Step4: choose 0 and 3 -> set both to 0: [0,0,0]. Alternatively, we could have:\n        Step1: choose 1 and 3 -> set to 1: [1,2,1]\n        Step2: choose 1 and 2 -> set to 1: [1,1,1]\n        Step3: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n        Step4: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1] -> then we need a fifth?

So we can do:\n\n  We remove the building of a and the double loops, and use the grid.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe current approach is O(n^2) which is too slow for n up to 10^5 (and total n over test cases up to 10^5, but note: the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, so worst-case one test case with n=10^5). However, the current code uses two nested loops (O(n^2)) which would be 10^10 operations in the worst-case, which is too slow in Python.\n\nWe need a more efficient solution.\n\nIdea:\nWe are counting pairs (i, j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position. This means:\n- Either the first character is the same and the second character is different, OR\n- The second character is the same and the first character is different.\n\nWe can use frequency dictionaries to count the occurrences of each string and then use combinatorial counts.\n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are of length 2, and from 'a' to 'k' (so 11 letters).\n\nWe can do:\nLet:\n  count1[char] = frequency of strings that have first character = char (regardless of the second)\n  count2[char] = frequency of strings that have second character = char (regardless of the first)\n\nBut also, we have to consider that a pair that shares the same first character and has different second characters: \n  For a fixed first character c, and for two different second characters d1 and d2, the pair (c,d1) and (c,d2) would be counted. However, note that we cannot simply do combinations of all pairs with same first character because we want to count each pair only once? Actually, we can: for a fixed first character c, the number of pairs that have the same first character and different second characters is: \n  total = f(c) = frequency of strings with first character c.\n  Then the number of pairs that have the same first character is C(f(c),2) but that counts pairs that have the same second character as well? Actually, no: we want pairs that have the same first character and different second characters? Actually, no: we want pairs that have the same first character and then we don't care about the second? But note: the condition is that they differ in exactly one position. So if they have the same first character and same second character, they don't count. If they have the same first character and different second characters, then they differ in exactly the second position -> that counts.\n\nSimilarly, for the same second character and different first characters.\n\nHowever, note: what if two strings are identical? They don't count. Also, what if two strings differ in both positions? They don't count.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\".\n\nSo we can break the count into two disjoint sets:\nSet A: pairs that have the same first character and different second characters.\nSet B: pairs that have the same second character and different first characters.\n\nBut note: is there any overlap? A pair that has the same first character and same second character is not in either. A pair that has the same first character and different second characters is only in A. Similarly for B. And a pair that has both different? Then it is in neither.\n\nSo total pairs = |A| + |B|\n\nHow to compute |A|?\n  For each first character c, let the frequencies of the second characters for that first character be stored? Actually, we don't need the full distribution. We can do:\n  For a fixed first character c, let the strings with first character c be grouped. Then the number of pairs in this group that have different second characters is: \n      total = f(c) = number of strings with first character c.\n      But if we have multiple second characters, we can also compute the pairs that have the same second character and subtract? Actually, we can do:\n      The total pairs in the group is C(f(c),2). Then subtract the pairs that have the same second character.\n\nBut wait, we want the pairs that have different second characters? That is: total pairs in the group - pairs that have the same second character.\n\nSimilarly, for Set B: for each second character d, the number of pairs that have the same second character and different first characters is: total pairs in the group (with second character d) - pairs that have the same first character.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require to avoid double counting? Actually, the two sets are disjoint: \n  In Set A: the two strings have the same first character and different second -> so they have different second, meaning they cannot have the same second character? Actually, they have the same first and different second -> so they are not in Set B (which requires same second and different first). So disjoint.\n\nBut wait: what if a pair has the same first and same second? Then it's not in either. What if a pair has same first and different second? Then it's in A. Same second and different first? Then in B. What if both different? Then not in A nor B.\n\nSo we can compute:\n\nLet:\n  freq_first = {}   # key: first char, value: count\n  freq_second = {}  # key: second char, value: count\n  But also, we need to know the frequency of each entire string? Actually, for the same first character, we need to break down by the second character.\n\nWe can have:\n  group_by_first = defaultdict(dict)   # for each first char, a dict of second char counts?\n  Or: group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\nAlternatively, we can have a 2D frequency grid: since the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters), we can have a grid of 11x11.\n\nBut note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\nApproach for one test case:\n  n = number of strings\n  We'll create:\n    grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]   # 11x11 grid: we can map 'a'->0, 'b'->1, ... 'k'->10\n\n  Then for each string s (which is two characters), let:\n      i = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      j = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[i][j] += 1\n\n  Then, we can compute:\n\n  total_pairs = 0\n\n  For Set A: same first char, different second char.\n    For each row i (which corresponds to first char), we have the counts in that row: [c0, c1, ..., c10]\n    The total in the row = row_total = sum(counts)\n    The number of pairs in the row that have the same second char? \n        For a fixed column j, the number of pairs that have second char j is C(c_j, 2) = c_j*(c_j-1)//2\n    Then the number of pairs in the row that have different second chars = C(row_total, 2) - sum_{j} [ C(c_j, 2) ]\n\n  Similarly, for Set B: same second char, different first char.\n    For each column j, we have the counts in that column: we can get the column by iterating over rows? \n        Actually, we can do: for each j, the column j is [ grid[0][j], grid[1][j], ... grid[10][j] ]\n        col_total = sum(grid[i][j] for i in range(11))\n        Then the number of pairs in the column that have the same first char? Actually, we don't have that directly. But note: the pairs that have the same second char (j) and same first char? That is already counted in the row? Actually, we are now considering the entire column.\n\n        The number of pairs in the column that have the same first char? Actually, we don't want that. We want the pairs that have the same second char (which is j) and different first chars. \n        How to compute: total pairs in the column = C(col_total, 2) \n        Then subtract the pairs that have the same first char? For a fixed first char i, the number of pairs that have first char i and second char j is C(grid[i][j], 2). But note: in the column, we have multiple first chars. So the pairs that have the same first char in the column are: for each i, C(grid[i][j], 2). \n        Then the pairs that have the same second char (j) and different first chars = C(col_total, 2) - sum_{i} [ C(grid[i][j], 2) ]\n\n  Then total = (for all rows: [C(row_total,2) - sum_j C(c_j,2)]) + (for all columns: [C(col_total,2) - sum_i C(grid[i][j],2)])\n\nBut wait: is that correct? Let me check with the example.\n\nExample 1: \n  n=5, strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\"]\n  We are told the answer is 5.\n\n  Let's build the grid (only showing non-zero):\n\n      a: [1, 1]   -> meaning for first char 'a': second char 'b' -> 1, second char 'a' -> 1? Actually, we have:\n          \"ab\": (0,1) -> grid[0][1] = 1\n          \"cb\": (2,1) -> grid[2][1] = 1\n          \"db\": (3,1) -> grid[3][1] = 1\n          \"aa\": (0,0) -> grid[0][0] = 1\n          \"cc\": (2,2) -> grid[2][2] = 1\n\n  Now, rows:\n    row0: [1,1,0,...] -> row_total = 2\n        pairs in row0: C(2,2)=1, but same second? \n          same second: for j=0: C(1,2)=0; j=1: C(1,2)=0 -> so 1 - 0 = 1? \n        But wait: the two strings in row0: \"aa\" and \"ab\" -> they differ in the second character? So that's one pair.\n\n    row1: none\n    row2: [0,1,1] -> row_total=2 -> pairs: C(2,2)=1, same second: j=1: C(1,2)=0; j=2: C(1,2)=0 -> 1.\n        The two strings: \"cb\" and \"cc\" -> they differ in the second character? So one pair.\n\n    row3: [0,1,0,...] -> row_total=1 -> 0.\n\n    So Set A: 1 (from row0) + 1 (from row2) = 2.\n\n  Now columns:\n    col0: [1,0,0,0,...] -> col_total=1 -> 0.\n    col1: [1,0,1,1,0,...] -> col_total=3 -> C(3,2)=3\n        same first? \n          row0: C(1,2)=0\n          row2: C(1,2)=0\n          row3: C(1,2)=0\n        so 3 - 0 = 3.\n        Which pairs? The three strings with second char 'b': \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\". \n        We want pairs that have the same second char (which they do) and different first chars? \n        They all have different first chars? So each pair: (ab,cb), (ab,db), (cb,db) -> 3 pairs.\n\n    col2: [0,0,1,0,...] -> col_total=1 -> 0.\n\n    Set B: 3.\n\n  Total = 2+3 = 5 -> matches.\n\nBut wait: the example in the note for the first test case: \n  The pairs: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> same second char 'b', different first -> counts in Set B? \n      (\"ab\", \"db\") -> same second char 'b', different first -> Set B\n      (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> same first char 'a', different second -> Set A\n      (\"cb\", \"db\") -> same second char 'b', different first -> Set B\n      (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> same first char 'c', different second -> Set A\n\n  So indeed 5.\n\nBut note: the example also includes (\"ab\", \"aa\") and (\"cb\",\"cc\") in Set A, and the other three in Set B.\n\nSo the method is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the grid is 11x11, and the total n is up to 10^5 per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n  For each test case:\n      n = int(input())\n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          c1 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n          c2 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n          grid[c1][c2] += 1\n\n      total = 0\n      # For rows: for each row i\n      for i in range(11):\n          row = grid[i]\n          row_total = sum(row)\n          same_in_row = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              # For each j in the row, the count is row[j]\n              same_in_row += row[j]*(row[j]-1)//2   # but wait, we don't need to add? Actually, we are going to subtract the same second pairs? \n          # Actually, we want: total pairs in the row (C(row_total,2)) minus the pairs that have the same second char (which are the pairs that are in the same cell? Actually, no: same second char in the same row? Actually, in the same row, the same second char means same cell? \n          # But note: in a row, the second char is the column index. So if two strings are in the same row and same column? Then they are the same string? \n          # Actually, the pairs that have the same second char in the same row are exactly the pairs that are in the same column? \n          # So for row i, the pairs that have the same second char are: for each j, C(row[j],2). \n          total_row_pairs = row_total*(row_total-1)//2\n          # Then the pairs that have same first (which is row i) and different second = total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n          total += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n      # Similarly for columns: for each column j\n      for j in range(11):\n          col_total = 0\n          same_in_col = 0\n          for i in range(11):\n              count = grid[i][j]\n              col_total += count\n              same_in_col += count*(count-1)//2\n          total_col_pairs = col_total*(col_total-1)//2\n          total += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n      print(total)\n\nBut note: the above for the row part: \n  same_in_row = sum_{j} [ C(row[j],2) ]\n  Then we subtract that from the total row pairs.\n\nSimilarly for column.\n\nBut wait: in the row part, we are counting the pairs that have the same first char and different second char. In the column part, we are counting the pairs that have the same second char and different first char. And these are disjoint.\n\nHowever, note: the example above: \n  row0: row_total=2, same_in_row = C(1,2) for j0 + C(1,2) for j1 = 0+0 = 0 -> then total_row_pairs - same_in_row = 1 - 0 = 1.\n  row2: same -> 1.\n\n  col1: col_total=3, same_in_col = C(1,2) for each row (three rows) = 0 -> total_col_pairs - same_in_col = 3.\n\n  total = 1+1+3 = 5? But wait, we did two rows and one column? Actually, we did all rows (11 rows) and all columns (11 columns). The rows that are zero: they contribute 0. So it's 1 (row0) + 1 (row2) + 3 (col1) = 5.\n\nSo the code for program1.py should be:\n\n  We'll create a grid of 11x11 (since letters from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters)\n\n  Steps for one test case:\n      n = int(input())\n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          # Map the two characters to indices 0..10\n          c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n          c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n          grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n      total = 0\n      # For each row\n      for i in range(11):\n          row_total = 0\n          same_in_row = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              cnt = grid[i][j]\n              row_total += cnt\n              same_in_row += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n          total_row_pairs = row_total*(row_total-1)//2\n          total += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n      # For each column\n      for j in range(11):\n          col_total = 0\n          same_in_col = 0\n          for i in range(11):\n              cnt = grid[i][j]\n              col_total += cnt\n              same_in_col += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n          total_col_pairs = col_total*(col_total-1)//2\n          total += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n      print(total)\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\nHowever, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and we are iterating 11*11 per test case? Actually, the grid is 11x11, so each test case we do 11*11*2 = 242 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100. However, the grid iteration is fixed (242 per test case) so 100*242 = 24200, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: the input says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so the number of test cases might be 100, but each test case n_i, and sum(n_i)<=10^5. So we are safe.\n\nSo for program1.py, we replace the entire inner part? The current code has:\n\n  for ii in range(int(input())):\n      n=int(input())\n      a=[]\n      co=0\n      x=set()\n      for jj in range(n):\n          a.append(input())\n      ... and then a double loop ...\n\nWe replace the double loop with the grid method.\n\nBut note: the current code has a TODO in the inner loop? Actually, the current code has:\n\n      for jj in range(n):\n          mul=1\n          if jj not in x:\n              for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                  ... and then conditions ...\n\nWe are going to remove that and use the grid.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the first for-loop after reading the strings until the print(co). But we are going to output the entire completion for program1.py? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the TODO is in the inner part? Actually, the TODO is in the inner loop, but we are replacing the entire inner loop with a different method.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nSo for program1.py, we output the code that replaces the part from the reading of the strings until the print(co). But note: the current code has:\n\n  a = []\n  for jj in range(n):\n      a.append(input())\n\n  Then the double loop.\n\nWe are going to replace the double loop and the set x and the co variable with the grid method.\n\nBut note: we are not using the set x and the variable mul? So we can remove them.\n\nSo the completion for program1.py for the test case loop body is:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  # We'll create a grid of 11x11\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n  total = 0\n  # For each row\n  for i in range(11):\n      row_total = 0\n      same_in_row = 0\n      for j in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          row_total += cnt\n          same_in_row += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      total_row_pairs = row_total*(row_total-1)//2\n      total += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n  # For each column\n  for j in range(11):\n      col_total = 0\n      same_in_col = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          col_total += cnt\n          same_in_col += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      total_col_pairs = col_total*(col_total-1)//2\n      total += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n  print(total)\n\nBut note: the variable name in the outer loop is 'co'? And we are printing 'co'. We are using 'total'. So we can set co = total.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the variable to co. But the problem says the current code has:\n\n  co=0\n  ... and then at the end: print(co)\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  co = total\n\nBut we are replacing the entire inner part.\n\nSo the code for the test case body becomes:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n  co = 0\n  # For each row\n  for i in range(11):\n      row_total = 0\n      same_in_row = 0\n      for j in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          row_total += cnt\n          same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n  # For each column\n  for j in range(11):\n      col_total = 0\n      same_in_col = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          col_total += cnt\n          same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n  print(co)\n\nBut note: the original code had a set x and a variable mul that we are not using. We can remove them. But the problem says: output the missing code. However, the TODO is only in one branch? But we are replacing the entire inner loop.\n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the entire block from the reading of the strings until the print(co). Actually, the original code after reading the strings had:\n\n  for jj in range(n):\n      ... inner loop ...\n\nWe are replacing that with the grid and the two double loops (over 11x11). So we output the entire block that replaces from the reading of the strings until the print(co). But note: the original code had:\n\n  a = []   # we are not using a anymore? So we can skip building a.\n\nSo the completion for program1.py is:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n  co = 0\n  for i in range(11):\n      row_total = 0\n      same_in_row = 0\n      for j in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          row_total += cnt\n          same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n  for j in range(11):\n      col_total = 0\n      same_in_col = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          col_total += cnt\n          same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n  print(co)\n\nBut note: the original code had a variable 'a' and a set 'x' that we are not using. We can remove them? But the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the entire block after the reading of the strings and the initialization of co and x. Actually, the original code had:\n\n  a = []\n  co = 0\n  x = set()\n\nWe are replacing the entire block from the for-loop that builds 'a' and the double loops. So we can do:\n\n  We remove the building of a and the double loops, and use the grid.\n\nBut note: the original code had:\n\n  for jj in range(n):\n      a.append(input())\n\nWe are replacing that with:\n\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      ... and then update grid.\n\nSo we don't need the list 'a'. We can remove it.\n\nTherefore, the entire body for the test case becomes:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n  co = 0\n  for i in range(11):\n      row_total = 0\n      same_in_row = 0\n      for j in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          row_total += cnt\n          same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n  for j in range(11):\n      col_total = 0\n      same_in_col = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          col_total += cnt\n          same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n  print(co)\n\nBut note: the original code had a variable 'ii' for the test case index? We are not changing that.\n\nSo for program1.py, we output the above block as the completion for the test case body? Actually, the problem says: the missing lines or blocks. The original code had a TODO in the inner loop, but we are replacing the entire inner part.\n\nBut note: the original code had:\n\n  for ii in range(int(input())):\n      n=int(input())\n      a=[] \n      co=0\n      x=set()\n      for jj in range(n):\n          a.append(input())\n      for jj in range(n):\n          ... inner loop ...\n\nWe are replacing from the line \"a=[]\" until the inner loops? Actually, we are replacing from the reading of the n strings until the end of the inner loops.\n\nSo the missing block for program1.py is the entire block that starts from the reading of the n strings and ends at the print(co), but we are replacing it with the grid method.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      s = input().strip()\n      c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n      c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n      grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n  co = 0\n  for i in range(11):\n      row_total = 0\n      same_in_row = 0\n      for j in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          row_total += cnt\n          same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n  for j in range(11):\n      col_total = 0\n      same_in_col = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          cnt = grid[i][j]\n          col_total += cnt\n          same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n      total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\n      co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n  print(co)\n\nBut note: the variable 'n' is already defined. And we are reading n strings.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe have:\n\n  def solve():\n      input()\n      a = [*getInts()]\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to complete the else branch.\n\nProblem description: \n  We have a sequence a of length n (2<=n<=100). \n  Operation: choose two distinct indices i and j.\n      If a_i = a_j, then change one of them to 0.\n      Otherwise, change both to min(a_i, a_j).\n\n  We want the minimum number of operations to change all numbers to 0.\n\nNote: the example: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\nObservations:\n\n  We note that if there is a zero, then we can use that zero to clear others? \n      The operation with a zero and a non-zero: \n          They are not equal, so we change both to min(0, non_zero)=0. So in one operation, we can set one non-zero to zero? But wait: we set both to zero? Actually, we set both to min(0, non_zero)=0. So if we have one zero and one non-zero, we can set the non-zero to zero and the zero remains zero? So we clear one non-zero per operation? But note: we have two numbers: we set both to zero. So if we have one zero and k non-zeros, we can do:\n          Operation 1: zero and non_zero1 -> both become zero. Now we have two zeros and k-1 non-zeros.\n          Operation 2: zero and non_zero2 -> both become zero. Now we have three zeros and k-2 non-zeros.\n          ... until all are zero. So the number of operations = k (the number of non-zeros).\n\n      Therefore, if there is at least one zero, then the answer = (number of non-zeros) = n - (number of zeros).\n\n  But what if there are no zeros initially?\n\n  Example: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\n  How to clear?\n\n      Step1: choose 1 and 2 -> they are different, so set both to min(1,2)=1. Now the array becomes [1,1,3].\n      Step2: choose the two 1's -> set one of them to 0. Now [0,1,3].\n      Step3: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: [0,0,3].\n      Step4: choose 0 and 3 -> set both to 0: [0,0,0].\n\n      Alternatively, we could have:\n        Step1: choose 1 and 3 -> set to 1: [1,2,1]\n        Step2: choose 1 and 2 -> set to 1: [1,1,1]\n        Step3: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n        Step4: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1] -> then we need a fifth? \n\n      So the first way is better.\n\n  How to think:\n\n      We note that we can create zeros by either:\n        - Having two equal non-zero numbers: then we can set one of them to zero in one operation (and the other remains the same non-zero? but then we can use that non-zero again?).\n        - Or by having a zero and a non-zero: then we set the non-zero to zero.\n\n      The key: we want to minimize the operations.\n\n      We can break the process:\n\n        Phase 1: create the first zero. How?\n          We need to create two equal numbers? Then we can set one to zero.\n\n          How to create two equal numbers? \n            Operation: if we have two distinct numbers, we can set both to the minimum. Then we might get duplicates.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3]:\n            Operation1: 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3] (cost 1)\n            Operation2: then we have two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,3] (cost 2)\n\n          Now we have a zero. Then we clear the rest in 2 operations (for the two non-zeros) -> total 4.\n\n          Alternatively, we could:\n            Operation1: 1 and 3 -> [1,2,1] (cost 1)\n            Operation2: 1 and 2 -> [1,1,1] (cost 2) -> now we have three 1's.\n            Operation3: set one 1 to 0: [0,1,1] (cost 3)\n            Operation4: set one 1 to 0: [0,0,1] (cost 4)\n            Operation5: set the last 1: we have 0 and 1 -> set to 0: [0,0,0] (cost 5) -> too many.\n\n          So we need to be efficient.\n\n      Insight:\n\n        We note that once we have a zero, we can clear one non-zero per operation. So the total operations = (number of operations to get the first zero) + (n - 1) [because we have n-1 non-zeros to clear? but wait: when we create the first zero, we might have already cleared two numbers? Actually, no: in the operation that creates the first zero, we set one element to zero and the other remains? So we have one zero and the rest non-zeros? Then we clear the rest in (n-1) operations? \n\n        But in the example: \n          [1,2,3] -> \n            Operation1: 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3] -> no zero yet? \n            Operation2: two 1's -> set one to zero: [0,1,3] -> now we have one zero and two non-zeros -> then we need two more operations: total 4.\n\n        So the cost to get the first zero is 2 operations? Then we have two non-zeros left -> 2 more operations? total 4.\n\n        How about if we have duplicates initially?\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,3] \n          We can immediately set one of the 1's to zero: [0,1,2,3] -> then we have 3 non-zeros -> 3 operations? total 4.\n\n        But wait: \n          Operation1: set two 1's: one becomes 0, the other remains 1 -> [0,1,2,3] -> then we have 3 non-zeros: 1,2,3 -> then we do:\n          Operation2: 0 and 1 -> set to 0: [0,0,2,3] -> now two non-zeros: 2,3 -> then two more operations? \n          Operation3: 0 and 2 -> set to 0: [0,0,0,3]\n          Operation4: 0 and 3 -> set to 0: [0,0,0,0] -> total 4.\n\n        So if there is a duplicate, we can get the first zero in 1 operation, then clear the rest in (n-1) operations? total = 1 + (n-1) = n? But n=4 -> 4.\n\n        But without duplicate? \n          We need two operations to get the first zero? Then total = 2 + (n-1) = n+1? For n=3: 3+1=4.\n\n        However, what if we can create more than one zero at a time? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we can only change two at a time.\n\n        But note: the operation that creates the first zero: we set one element to zero and the other remains? So we only get one zero per such operation.\n\n        Therefore, the total operations = (operations to get the first zero) + (number of non-zeros after the first zero is created)\n\n        But the number of non-zeros after the first zero is created = n - 1? Then we need n-1 operations to clear the rest? \n\n        However, when we create the first zero, we have one zero and n-1 non-zeros. Then we can use the zero to clear one non-zero per operation? So we need n-1 operations? \n\n        Therefore, total = (cost to get the first zero) + (n-1)\n\n        Now, what is the minimum cost to get the first zero?\n\n          Case 1: if there is already a duplicate? Then we can get the first zero in 1 operation? \n          But wait: what if there are more than two duplicates? We can use any duplicate? \n\n          However, what if we have [1,1,1]? \n            Operation1: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,1] -> then we have one zero and two non-zeros? Then we need 2 more operations? total 3? \n            But we can do:\n                Operation1: set two 1's -> [0,1,1] (cost1)\n                Operation2: set two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1] (cost2)\n                Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> set to 0: [0,0,0] (cost3) -> total 3.\n\n            But according to the formula: cost to get first zero = 1, then n-1 = 3-1=2 -> total 3? which matches.\n\n          Case 2: if there is no duplicate? Then we need to create a duplicate? and then use that duplicate to create a zero? \n\n          How to create a duplicate? \n            We can use an operation: choose two distinct numbers, set both to the minimum. Then we get two numbers that are the minimum? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3] -> \n            Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3] -> now we have a duplicate? Then Operation2: set two 1's to get one zero -> [0,1,3] -> then we need 2 more operations? total 4.\n\n          But what if we have [1,2,3,4]? \n            We can do:\n              Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3,4] -> now we have a duplicate? \n              Operation2: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,3,4] -> then we have 3 non-zeros -> 3 operations? total 5.\n\n          Alternatively, we might create two duplicates? \n            Operation1: set 1 and 3 to 1 -> [1,2,1,4] -> now we have two 1's? \n            Operation2: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,2,1,4] -> then we have 3 non-zeros -> 3 operations? total 5.\n\n          But note: we can also create a duplicate in a way that we can use it to clear more? \n\n          Actually, the formula: \n            total_ops = (cost to get first zero) + (n-1)\n\n          And the cost to get first zero: \n            if there is at least one duplicate (any number that appears at least twice) -> then 1.\n            else? we need 2? \n\n          But wait: what if we have [1,2,3,4]? \n            We need to create a duplicate: that takes 1 operation? Then we have a duplicate? Then we can set one of the duplicates to zero: 1 operation? So cost to get first zero = 2.\n\n          Then total_ops = 2 + (4-1) = 5.\n\n          However, is there a way to do it in less? \n\n          Consider:\n            Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3,4] -> now we have two 1's and two others.\n            Operation2: set 1 and 3 to 1 -> [1,1,1,4] -> now we have three 1's? \n            Operation3: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,1,4] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 4? \n            Operation4: set 0 and 1 -> 0: [0,0,1,4] \n            Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0: [0,0,0,4]\n            Operation6: set 0 and 4 -> 0: [0,0,0,0] -> 6 operations.\n\n          Alternatively, after [1,1,3,4]:\n            Operation2: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,3,4] -> then we have three non-zeros: 1,3,4 -> then we need 3 operations: total 5.\n\n          So 5 is the minimum.\n\n          Therefore, the cost to get the first zero is 2 if there is no duplicate.\n\n          But what if we have more numbers? \n\n          Actually, we can create multiple duplicates in one operation? \n\n          However, note: one operation only changes two numbers.\n\n          Therefore, the minimum cost to get the first zero is:\n            1 if there is at least one duplicate initially.\n            2 if there is no duplicate.\n\n          Then total_ops = (1 if has_duplicate else 2) + (n-1) = n + (0 if has_duplicate else 1)\n\n          Example: \n            [1,1,2,3]: has_duplicate -> total_ops = 4 + 0? = 4? which matches.\n            [1,2,3]: no duplicate -> total_ops = 3+1 = 4? matches.\n\n          But wait: what if we have [1,2,3,4]? no duplicate -> total_ops = 4+1 = 5? matches.\n\n          However, what if we have [1,1,1]? \n            has_duplicate -> total_ops = 3 + 0 = 3? which matches.\n\n          But what if we have [1,1,2,2]? \n            has_duplicate -> total_ops = 4? \n            How?\n              Operation1: set two 1's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,2,2] -> then we have one zero and three non-zeros: 1,2,2 -> then we need 3 operations? total 4? \n              But we can do:\n                Operation1: set two 1's: [0,1,2,2] -> then \n                Operation2: set two 2's: one becomes 0 -> [0,1,0,2] -> then we have two zeros and two non-zeros: 1 and 2 -> \n                Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> 0: [0,0,0,2]\n                Operation4: set 0 and 2 -> 0: [0,0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n\n            So 4.\n\n          Therefore, the formula: \n            total_ops = n + (0 if there is at least one duplicate initially else 1) - 1? \n            Actually: we said: cost = (1 if duplicate else 2) + (n-1) = n + (0 if duplicate else 1)\n\n          So for [1,1,2,2]: n=4, duplicate -> 4+0 = 4.\n\n          But wait: the formula: \n            cost_to_get_first_zero = 1 (because duplicate) \n            then we have n-1 non-zeros? -> 3 non-zeros? so 1+3=4.\n\n          So it holds.\n\n          However, what if we have [1,2,1,2]? \n            This is the same as [1,1,2,2]? \n\n          Therefore, the code for the else branch (no zero initially) is:\n\n            if there is at least one duplicate: \n                total_ops = n   # because 1 (to get first zero) + (n-1) = n\n            else:\n                total_ops = n+1   # because 2 (to get first zero) + (n-1) = n+1\n\n          But wait: what if we have more than one duplicate? It doesn't matter: we only need one duplicate to get the first zero in one operation.\n\n          How to check for duplicate? \n            We can check: if len(a) != len(set(a)): then there is duplicate? \n            But note: the array might have duplicates? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4] -> no duplicate -> set(a) = {1,2,3,4} -> len=4, same as n? \n          [1,1,2,3] -> set(a) = {1,2,3} -> len=3 < 4 -> duplicate.\n\n          So:\n\n            if len(set(a)) < n:\n                print(n)\n            else:\n                print(n+1)\n\n          But wait: what if we have [1,1,1]? \n            n=3, set(a) = {1} -> len=1 < 3 -> duplicate -> print(3) -> which is correct.\n\n          However, what if we have [1,1,1,2]? \n            set(a) = {1,2} -> len=2 < 4 -> duplicate -> print(4) -> which is correct.\n\n          But note: the problem says: if there is a zero initially, we do: \n            print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n\n          So the entire solve function:\n\n            def solve():\n                input()\n                a = [*getInts()]\n                if 0 in a:\n                    print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n                else:\n                    if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n                        print(len(a))\n                    else:\n                        print(len(a)+1)\n\n          Let's test with the example: \n            [1,2,3]: \n                no zero, and set(a) = {1,2,3} -> len=3, which equals n=3 -> so print(3+1)=4 -> correct.\n\n          But wait: the example in the note: \n            The first test case: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\n          However, the problem note says: \n            \"In the first test case, one of the possible ways to change all numbers in the sequence to 0: ... So the minimum number of operations is 4.\"\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          But what about the second example? \n            The problem note also has a second test case? Actually, the problem note only shows one example.\n\n          But the problem says: \n            \"The first line contains a single positive integer t (1<=t<=1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n          And the example input: \n            \"In the first test case, ...\"\n\n          So we assume the formula holds.\n\n          However, let me test with a small example: [1,2] (n=2)\n            Without zero: \n              Operation1: if we choose 1 and 2 -> they are different -> set both to min(1,2)=1 -> [1,1] \n              Operation2: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1] \n              Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> set to 0 -> [0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\n            According to our formula: \n              n=2, no duplicate initially -> so total_ops = 2+1 = 3 -> correct.\n\n          But wait: can we do it in 2 operations?\n            Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1] \n            Operation2: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1] -> not all zeros? \n            Then Operation3: set 0 and 1 -> 0.\n\n            So 3 is minimum.\n\n          Another: [1,1] (n=2)\n            Operation1: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1] \n            Operation2: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> [0,0] -> 2 operations.\n            Formula: duplicate -> total_ops = 2 -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py in the else branch is:\n\n            if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n                print(len(a))\n            else:\n                print(len(a)+1)\n\n  But note: the problem says the array can have zeros? But the else branch is for when there is no zero. So we don't have to worry about zeros in the else branch.\n\n  However, what if the array has zeros? Then we are in the first branch. So the else branch is only when there is no zero.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n                print(len(a))\n            else:\n                print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut note: the problem says: the array elements are between 0 and 100, and n between 2 and 100. So the set conversion is efficient.\n\nSo the entire program2.py becomes:\n\n  import sys\n  input = sys.stdin.readline\n  def getInts(): return map(int, input().split())\n\n\n  def solve():\n      input()\n      a = [*getInts()]\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\n\n  for _ in range(int(input())):\n      solve()\n\nBut we are only to output the missing block for the else branch? \n\n  The TODO is in the else branch. So we output:\n\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nTherefore, for program1.py, we output the block that replaces the inner part (the double loops and the TODO) with the grid method.\n\nAnd for program2.py, we output the block for the else branch.\n\nBut note: the output format is a json string with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nWe must output the code as a string? and without markdown? \n\nSo:\n\n  program1: \n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n          c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n          grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n      co = 0\n      for i in range(11):\n          row_total = 0\n          same_in_row = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              cnt = grid[i][j]\n              row_total += cnt\n              same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n          total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\n          co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\n\n      for j in range(11):\n          col_total = 0\n          same_in_col = 0\n          for i in range(11):\n              cnt = grid[i][j]\n              col_total += cnt\n              same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\n          total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\n          co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\n\n      print(co)\n\n  program2:\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut note: the program1 block must be exactly the code that replaces the part from the reading of the strings until the print(co). The original code had a list 'a' and then a double loop. We are replacing that entire block.\n\nAnd for program2, we are replacing the TODO block.\n\nNow, we must format as a json string. We need to escape the newlines and quotes? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nWe are to output a json object with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\", and the values are the code strings.\n\nWe can write:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\\n    c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\\n    grid[c0][c1] += 1\\n\\nco = 0\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    row_total = 0\\n    same_in_row = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        row_total += cnt\\n        same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\\n\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    col_total = 0\\n    same_in_col = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        col_total += cnt\\n        same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\\n\\nprint(co)\",\n    \"program2\": \"if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n    print(len(a))\\nelse:\\n    print(len(a)+1)\"\n  }\n\nBut note: the program1 block uses the variable 'n' which is already defined (from the input). And we are reading n strings.\n\nWe must be cautious: the program1 block must be inserted exactly in the test case body after reading n and before the print(co). The original code had:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  a = []\n  co = 0\n  x = set()\n  for jj in range(n):\n      a.append(input())\n\n  ... then the double loops ...\n\nWe are replacing from the line \"a = []\" to the end of the double loops? Actually, we are replacing the entire block from the for-loop that builds 'a' and the double loops. But note: the variable 'co' is initialized to 0. We are going to set co to the total at the end. So we keep the initialization of co=0? Actually, we are going to set co = ... at the end of the grid computation? But we are replacing the entire block. So we remove the initialization of a, x, and the for-loop that builds a, and the double loops. And we set co to the computed total.\n\nTherefore, the above block for program1 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the else branch is replaced by the if-else block.\n\nBut note: the program2 block: the variable 'a' is defined as the list of integers.\n\nSo we output the json as above.\n\nHowever, we must escape the quotes? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we are to output a json string. The values are strings that contain code. We must escape the newlines and the double quotes? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then the format is json. So we must output a valid json.\n\nWe can use:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"code for program1\", \"program2\": \"code for program2\"}\n\nAnd we escape the newlines as \\n and the quotes as \\\".\n\nBut the code does not contain double quotes? It has single quotes. So we can use double quotes for the json keys and values.\n\nBut the code for program1 has a line: \n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n\nThis has no quotes? Actually, it has single quotes? No, it has no quotes. \n\nBut the code for program1 has: \n  s = input().strip()\n\nThis has single quotes? No, it has double quotes? Actually, no: it has no quotes. \n\nWait, the code for program1 has:\n\n  s = input().strip()\n\nThis is a string without quotes? Actually, it's code. \n\nBut the only quotes we have are in the ord: \n  c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n\nHere we have single quotes. In the json string, we can have single quotes without escaping? Actually, in json, the string value must be in double quotes. But the content can have single quotes.\n\nSo we don't need to escape the single quotes.\n\nBut we do need to escape the newlines? Yes, we represent them as \\n.\n\nSo the string for program1:\n\n  \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\\n    c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\\n    grid[c0][c1] += 1\\n\\nco = 0\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    row_total = 0\\n    same_in_row = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        row_total += cnt\\n        same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\\n\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    col_total = 0\\n    same_in_col = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        col_total += cnt\\n        same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\\n\\nprint(co)\"\n\nSimilarly for program2:\n\n  \"if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n    print(len(a))\\nelse:\\n    print(len(a)+1)\"\n\nNow, we write the json.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the json.\n\nFinal output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\\n    c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\\n    grid[c0][c1] += 1\\n\\nco = 0\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    row_total = 0\\n    same_in_row = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        row_total += cnt\\n        same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\\n\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    col_total = 0\\n    same_in_col = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        cnt = grid[i][j]\\n        col_total += cnt\\n        same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n    total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\\n    co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\\n\\nprint(co)\", \"program2\": \"if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n    print(len(a))\\nelse:\\n    print(len(a)+1)\"}\n\nBut note: the program1 block has a lot of newlines. We replaced them with \\n.\n\nWe must be cautious: the indentation? The original code in program1.py is indented. The block we are replacing is inside the for-loop for the test cases. The new code must be properly indented? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the block that should be inserted. The insertion point is at the same indentation level as the original code.\n\nSo we output the code as a string with the same indentation? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the example code in the problem statement is given without extra indentation? \n\nWe output the code as a string that is to be inserted at the position of the TODO? But for program1, we are replacing a block that starts at the same level as the for-loop that reads the strings. So we output the code without extra indentation? \n\nBut in the json string, we represent the newlines and the spaces as they are? \n\nActually, the code for program1 has:\n\n  grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n  for i in range(n):\n      ...\n\nThis is at the same indentation level as the original code? \n\nThe original code for the test case body:\n\n  n=int(input())\n  a=[] \n  co=0\n  x=set()\n  for jj in range(n):\n      a.append(input())\n  ... \n\nWe are replacing from the \"a=[]\" to the inner loops. We output the code without the initial indentation? But the entire block is inside the for-loop for the test cases. So we must have the same base indentation? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that is to be inserted. The insertion point is at the same level as the original TODO. \n\nBut the TODO in program1 is in an inner loop? Actually, we are replacing a larger block. \n\nTo avoid confusion, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that is to be inserted, and the insertion point is at the same level as the original code that we are replacing.\n\nTherefore, we output the code without extra indentation? \n\nBut note: the entire program1 block is at the same level as the original code that we are replacing? \n\nThe original code:\n\n  for ii in range(int(input())):\n      n=int(input())\n      a=[] \n      co=0\n      x=set()\n      for jj in range(n):\n          a.append(input())\n      ... (inner loops)\n\nWe are replacing from \"a=[]\" to the inner loops. The replacement code:\n\n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          ... \n\nBut note: the original code had 4 spaces of indentation for the test case body. The replacement code should have the same.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the example code in the problem uses 4 spaces? \n\nBut we are to output the code as a string. We can output with 4 spaces per level? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output the code as a string that is to be inserted, and we assume the base indentation is already there? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So we output the lines as they would appear in the program, with the correct indentation? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the indentation level. \n\nTo be safe, we output the code without any extra base indentation? Because the base indentation (the outer for-loop) is already present. The code we output is at the same level as the original \"a=[]\", etc.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  program1: \n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          ... \n\n  with each line having the same base indentation (one level, 4 spaces) as the original.\n\nBut in the json string, we represent the newlines and the spaces as they are.\n\nTherefore, the string for program1 has:\n\n  \"    grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        s = input().strip()\\n        ... \"\n\nBut wait, the original code had:\n\n      n=int(input())\n      a=[] \n      co=0\n      x=set()\n      for jj in range(n):\n          a.append(input())\n\nWe are replacing that with:\n\n      grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\n          c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\n          grid[c0][c1] += 1\n\n      co = 0\n      ... \n\nBut note: the variable 'co' is already defined? In the original code, we have:\n\n      co=0\n\nWe are going to set co again? So we can remove the original initialization? \n\nBut we are replacing the entire block that includes the initialization of a, co, x, and the reading of the strings and the inner loops. So we remove the original:\n\n      a=[] \n      co=0\n      x=set()\n      for jj in range(n):\n          a.append(input())\n\nand replace it with the grid reading and computation.\n\nTherefore, the replacement block does not include the initialization of co=0? But we have:\n\n      co = 0   # in the replacement block\n\nSo we are setting co to 0 again? \n\nBut the original code had co=0. We are replacing that line? So we don't need to output the original co=0? \n\nTherefore, the replacement block for program1 should start with the grid initialization and then the for-loop to read the strings, and then the computation of co.\n\nSo the base indentation is 4 spaces (one level). \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the example code uses 4 spaces? \n\nWe'll assume 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the program1 string:\n\n  \"    grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        s = input().strip()\\n        c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\\n        c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\\n        grid[c0][c1] += 1\\n\\n    co = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        row_total = 0\\n        same_in_row = 0\\n        for j in range(11):\\n            cnt = grid[i][j]\\n            row_total += cnt\\n            same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n        total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\\n        co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\\n\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        col_total = 0\\n        same_in_col = 0\\n        for i in range(11):\\n            cnt = grid[i][j]\\n            col_total += cnt\\n            same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n        total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\\n        co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\\n\\n    print(co)\"\n\nBut wait, the last line: print(co) is at the same level? \n\nYes, because it is the last line of the test case body.\n\nBut the original code had:\n\n      print(co)\n\nWe are replacing the entire block from the reading of the strings until the print(co)? Actually, the original code had the print(co) at the end? And we are keeping that? \n\nBut in the replacement block, we have:\n\n      ... \n      print(co)\n\nSo we are including the print(co) in the replacement block? \n\nBut the original code had:\n\n      ... (inner loops)\n      print(co)\n\nWe are replacing the inner loops and the print(co) is at the end of the test case body? \n\nActually, the original code had the print(co) after the inner loops. We are replacing the inner loops and then we print(co) at the end of the replacement block? \n\nBut the problem says: the original code had:\n\n      for jj in range(n):\n          ... inner loop ...\n\n      print(co)\n\nWe are replacing the inner loops and then we do print(co) at the end? \n\nBut the replacement block does the computation and then prints co? \n\nSo we include the print(co) in the replacement block.\n\nTherefore, the above string for program1 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the else branch is at the same indentation level as the if branch? \n\nThe original:\n\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          # TODO\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nSo the base indentation is 8 spaces (two levels). \n\nBut the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the program2 string:\n\n  \"    if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n        print(len(a))\\n    else:\\n        print(len(a)+1)\"\n\nBut wait, the entire else branch is:\n\n      else:\n          if ...:\n          else:\n\nBut the original else branch is one level. The code inside the else branch is one more level.\n\nSo the replacement block for program2 is:\n\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nBut in the program, the else branch is:\n\n      else:\n          [replacement block]\n\nSo the replacement block should be at the same level as the print in the if branch? \n\nThe if branch has:\n\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n\nSo the replacement block should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: the TODO is in the else branch. So we output the block that goes inside the else.\n\nTherefore, the program2 string is:\n\n  \"    if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n        print(len(a))\\n    else:\\n        print(len(a)+1)\"\n\nBut note: the entire else branch becomes:\n\n      else:\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nSo the replacement block is the entire block that is the body of the else.\n\nTherefore, the base indentation for the replacement block is 8 spaces? \n\nBut we output the code as:\n\n      else:\n          [the code we output]\n\nSo the code we output is at 8 spaces? \n\nBut in the json string, we represent the code with the indentation.\n\nSo the program2 string has:\n\n  \"    if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n        print(len(a))\\n    else:\\n        print(len(a)+1)\"\n\nBut the first line: \"    if ...\" has 4 spaces? Then the next line \"        print\" has 8 spaces? \n\nThat matches: \n  The else branch body is at 4 spaces (relative to the function) and then the if block inside is at 8 spaces.\n\nBut the function solve is:\n\n  def solve():\n      input()\n      a = [*getInts()]\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nSo the replacement block is:\n\n          if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n              print(len(a))\n          else:\n              print(len(a)+1)\n\nWhich is 8 spaces for the first line and 12 for the prints? \n\nBut the problem says: the base indentation for the function body is 4 spaces. \n\nTherefore, the replacement block should be:\n\n  Line1: 8 spaces: \"        if ...\"\n  Line2: 12 spaces: \"            print ...\"\n  Line3: 8 spaces: \"        else:\"\n  Line4: 12 spaces: \"            ...\"\n\nBut the example code in the problem uses 4 spaces per level? \n\nWe'll assume 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo:\n\n  Level0: def solve(): -> 0\n  Level1: the body of solve: 4 spaces\n  Level2: the body of the else branch: 8 spaces\n  Level3: the body of the inner if: 12 spaces\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the block that goes in the else branch. So we output the code at level2 and level3? \n\nBut the entire block is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\n            print(len(a))\n        else:\n            print(len(a)+1)\n\nSo we output:\n\n  \"        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n            print(len(a))\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a)+1)\"\n\nBut wait, the original else branch had:\n\n      else:\n          # TODO\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the above block? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the final json:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        s = input().strip()\\n        c0 = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')\\n        c1 = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')\\n        grid[c0][c1] += 1\\n\\n    co = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        row_total = 0\\n        same_in_row = 0\\n        for j in range(11):\\n            cnt = grid[i][j]\\n            row_total += cnt\\n            same_in_row += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n        total_row_pairs = row_total * (row_total-1) // 2\\n        co += total_row_pairs - same_in_row\\n\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        col_total = 0\\n        same_in_col = 0\\n        for i in range(11):\\n            cnt = grid[i][j]\\n            col_total += cnt\\n            same_in_col += cnt * (cnt-1) // 2\\n        total_col_pairs = col_total * (col_total-1) // 2\\n        co += total_col_pairs - same_in_col\\n\\n    print(co)\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if len(set(a)) < len(a):\\n            print(len(a))\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a)+1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 block has a trailing newline? We don't need to worry.\n\nWe output this json."
