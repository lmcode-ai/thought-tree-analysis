However, we also have the condition that no tree has size > k. \n\n          Let T_k(x) = sum_{n=1}^{k} (n-1)! * x^n / n! = sum_{n=1}^{k} x^n / n.\n\n          Then the generating function for forests with tree size <= k is exp(T_k(x)). Therefore, the number of increasing forests on n nodes with tree size <= k is: \n\n                F(n, k) = n! * [x^n] exp( sum_{j=1}^{k} x^j / j )\n\n          But note: the exponential generating function is for the exponential method, so the coefficient of x^n in exp(T_k(x)) is the exponential generating function, and then we multiply by n! to get the actual count. So F(n, k) = n! * [x^n] exp( sum_{j=1}^{k} x^j / j ) Then the number of trees with centroid i is: F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = (n-1)! * [x^(n-1)] exp( sum_{j=1}^{(n-1)//2} x^j / j )\n\n          But note: the entire tree is built by: We have the root i. The forest on the remaining n-1 nodes must be increasing and with tree size <= (n-1)//2.",

The forest on nodes 1 and 2: the only forest with tree size<=1 is the forest with two trees: {1} and {2}. Then the number of ways to attach i=3: we can attach to any node in the forest with label<3, which are 1 and 2 -> 2 ways. But then we get two trees:\n\n                Tree1: 1-3, 2 (attached to someone? but 2 must be attached to a smaller node: only 1, so the tree would be: 1-2 and 1-3 -> which is the tree with centroid 1, not 3.\n                Tree2: 2-3, and 1 must be attached to someone: 1 can be attached to 2 (since 1<2) -> tree: 2-1 and 2-3 -> centroid is 2.",

So the count for i should be the number of trees in which the components after removing i have size <= (n-1)//2. For i=3 in n=3: the components after removing i have size 2 > 1, so it fails. Therefore, we should have F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = 1 for the forest, but then we must have an additional condition: the forest must have tree size <= (n-1)//2. For i=3, the forest on nodes 1 and 2 has size 2, which is > (3-1)//2=1, so it should not be counted in F(2,1). But earlier we said F(2,1) = 1, and that 1 corresponds to the forest of two singletons, which has tree size 1 for each tree. So then the size of the forest is 2, but the tree size (meaning the size of each tree) is 1, which is <=1.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given the number of test cases t, but note: the input specification says the first line is t (number of test cases) and then for each test case, we have n and the list of weights.\n However, the provided code at the bottom does not have a loop for t test cases. Instead, it reads n and then proceeds.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: the input first line is t (the number of test cases). But the provided code only reads n = int(input()) and then processes one test case.\n\n Therefore, we must adjust the code to handle multiple test cases.\n\n But note: the note says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can process each test case in a loop.\n\n However, the provided code does not have a loop for t. So we must add that.\n\n Also, the problem says: \"For each test case, print a single integer\" but then we are to print n integers per test case? Actually, the output says: \"print n integers in a single line\".\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Read t = number of test cases.\n   For each test case:\n        read n\n        read the list of n integers (the weights) but note: the code does not use the weights? \n\n Wait, the provided code does not use the list of weights at all. How is that?\n\n Let me read the problem again: the trees are defined by the fact that for each i from 2 to n, the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index. \n This is a rooted tree (at 1) and the tree is built by attaching each new node to one of the previous nodes. However, note that the problem does not give the tree structure? \n Actually, the input gives the weights? But the example input does not show weights? \n\n Example 1: n=3, and then a list of weights? But the example says: \n        For the first test case: n=3, and then weights? The example does not specify weights? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n However, the provided code does not use the weights. This is suspicious.\n\n But note: the problem says that the trees are defined by the condition that each vertex i (from 2 to n) is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index. \n This means the tree is a \"recursively grown\" tree. In fact, the entire structure of the tree is not arbitrary: it is a tree that can be built by starting with 1 and then each new node attached to any of the existing nodes? \n However, note: the problem does not say that the tree is built in order of index? Actually, it says: \"the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index\", so the tree is built by attaching nodes in increasing order? \n\n But then why the weights? \n\n The problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\n So the weights are important. However, the provided code does not use the weights. \n\n Let me look at the example: \n   Example 1: n=3, and the two trees. The weights are not provided? Actually, the example says: \n        \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" \n        and the answer is 2.\n\n   Example 2: n=5, and the answer is 6.\n\n   Example 3: n=3, but the answer is 0.\n\n   Example 4: n=7, and the answer is 7.\n\n How is the answer computed? \n\n The note says: \n        Example 1: two trees: \n            Tree1: edges (1-2) and (1-3): centroid is 1 -> so for vertex1: count=1, vertex2: count=1, vertex3: count=0? \n            But the output is \"1, 1, 0\"\n\n        Example 2: n=5, and the answer for the centroid (which is vertex 3) is 24? But the output for each vertex? The example says the answer is 6 (total candies eaten) but the problem asks for the number of trees for which the i-th vertex is the centroid.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"for each i (1<=i<=n) calculate the number of trees for which the i-th vertex will be the centroid\"\n\n So for each vertex i, we output the count of trees (among all possible trees that satisfy the growing condition) such that vertex i is the centroid.\n\n How to compute?\n\n The note: the tree is built by attaching each new node to any one of the previous nodes. So the total number of trees is (n-1)!? \n Why? \n   For node 1: no choice.\n   For node 2: only one choice: attach to 1.\n   For node 3: can attach to 1 or 2 -> 2 choices.\n   For node 4: can attach to 1,2,3 -> 3 choices.\n   ... so total trees = 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) = (n-1)! \n\n But note: the problem does not say that the tree is built by attaching to any previous node arbitrarily? Actually, the condition is: \"for each 2<=i<=n, the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index\", which is the definition of a tree. And the number of trees on n labeled nodes is n^(n-2) by Cayley? But note: the tree is rooted? and the edges are directed? \n\n Actually, the problem does not say rooted. But note: the tree is unrooted? However, the condition forces a natural ordering: we know node 1 is always present. The tree is unrooted, but the condition that each node i (>=2) has exactly one neighbor with a smaller index implies that the tree is connected and acyclic. \n\n How many such trees? Actually, it is the same as the number of increasing trees? \n\n But note: the problem does not require the tree to be increasing in the sense of the parent being exactly the smallest? It just requires one neighbor with a smaller index. \n\n Actually, the structure is: the tree must have the property that the entire tree is connected and the node set is {1,...,n} and for every node i (>=2) there is at least one neighbor with a smaller index. But since the tree is connected, each node (except 1) must have at least one such neighbor. However, the condition says \"exactly one\" neighbor? \n\n The problem says: \"exactly one\" -> meaning each node from 2 to n has exactly one edge to a node with a smaller index. \n\n This is the definition of a tree: because if we start from 1 and then each new node adds one edge to an existing node, then we have a tree. And the total number of trees is: \n   for node 2: 1 choice (only node 1)\n   for node 3: 2 choices (node 1 or 2)\n   for node 4: 3 choices (node 1,2,3)\n   ... so total trees = 1 * 2 * ... * (n-1) = (n-1)! \n\n So the total number of trees is (n-1)!.\n\n Now, we need for each vertex i, the number of trees in which vertex i is the centroid.\n\n Conditions for centroid: removing vertex i splits the tree into connected components, each of size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n How to count?\n\n We note that the tree is built by attaching nodes in increasing order? Actually, the tree is not built in increasing order? The condition only says that each node has one edge to a smaller node, but the tree is unrooted. However, we can root the tree arbitrarily? \n\n Alternatively, we can use generating functions and combinatorial identities.\n\n The known solution for this problem (from known similar problems on Codeforces) is:\n\n   Let dp[i] be the number of trees of size i (with nodes 1..i) that are \"centered\" appropriately? \n\n But note: the problem is about the centroid of the entire tree (with n nodes) and we are counting for each vertex.\n\n Insight: the centroid condition for a vertex i is that all the connected components after removing i have size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n How to assign the nodes? The nodes are labeled and the tree is built by the increasing condition.\n\n We can use the following:\n\n   Let f(i) be the number of trees of size i. We know f(i) = (i-1)!.\n\n   Now, consider the centroid condition for a fixed vertex i. \n\n   However, note: the tree is built by attaching nodes in increasing order? Actually, the labeling is fixed. The centroid condition is symmetric? \n\n   But the tree is built by attaching each new node to a previous one. We can root the tree at the centroid? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the known result: \n\n        Let F(n, k) = number of trees on n nodes such that the maximum subtree size after removing the root is <= k.\n\n        Then the centroid condition is that the maximum subtree size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n   How to compute F(n, k)? \n\n   We can use generating functions. \n\n   The generating function for a rooted tree (with the root having subtrees) is:\n\n        T(x) = x * exp( T(x) + T(x)^2/2 + ... )   -> but that is for unlabeled trees.\n\n   However, our trees are labeled. The exponential generating function for rooted labeled trees is T(x) = x * exp(T(x)), and the solution is T(x) = -W(-x) where W is the Lambert function, and the number of rooted trees is n^(n-1). But note: our trees are unrooted? \n\n   Actually, the trees we are counting are unrooted, but we have a condition on the centroid.\n\n   Known fact: every tree has either one centroid or two adjacent centroids (when n is even? but note n is odd). Since n is odd, there is exactly one centroid.\n\n   Therefore, the centroid is the unique vertex that satisfies the condition.\n\n   How to count the trees for which a given vertex i is the centroid?\n\n   We can root the tree at i. Then the condition is that every subtree of i has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n   But note: the tree is built by the increasing condition? However, the labeling is fixed. The vertex i is fixed. How does the labeling affect? \n\n   The problem: the nodes are labeled from 1 to n. The condition for the tree: each node j (>=2) has exactly one neighbor with a smaller index. \n\n   If we root the tree at i, then the entire tree is built by starting with i? But the labeling is fixed: the nodes with index less than i and greater than i. \n\n   We can break the tree into two parts: the nodes that are less than i and the nodes that are greater than i? \n\n   However, the condition for the tree: each node must have a neighbor with a smaller index. \n\n   How to handle the root at i? \n\n   We can consider the following:\n\n        The entire tree is built by starting with node 1. But now we want to have a tree with centroid at i.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the known solution from Codeforces problems (like the one for \"Centroids\"):\n\n        We precompute the size of the subtree for each node? But we don't have a specific tree, we are counting over all trees.\n\n   There is a known combinatorial solution:\n\n        Let dp[i] be the number of trees of size i such that the maximum subtree size of the root is at most (n-1)//2.\n\n        Then the number of trees with centroid at a particular vertex i is:\n\n            (n-1)! - (number of trees where the root i has at least one subtree of size > (n-1)//2)\n\n        But note: the tree is built by the increasing condition? \n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n        The entire tree is built by starting with node 1. However, we can change the root? \n\n        We can use the Prufer code? \n\n   Another known solution (from Codeforces submissions for the same problem) is:\n\n        Let f(n, m) = number of forests of m rooted trees on n nodes. Then the generating function is: \n            F(x) = exp( T(x) ) \n        but for rooted trees, T(x) = x * exp(T(x)).\n\n        However, we need to count the trees that are rooted at i and with maximum subtree size <= k.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n        Let dp[i] = number of rooted trees on i nodes such that no subtree has size > k. Then:\n\n            dp[0] = 1\n            dp[i] = sum_{j=0}^{min(i-1, k)} C(i-1, j) * dp[j] * dp[i-1-j]\n\n        But that is for binary trees? \n\n   Actually, for labeled trees: the root has subtrees. The subtrees are independent. The recurrence for the forest:\n\n        Let F(n, k) = number of forests of rooted trees (with labels) on n nodes such that each tree has at most k nodes.\n\n        Then: \n            F(0, k) = 1\n            F(n, k) = sum_{j=0}^{min(n, k)} C(n-1, j-1) * F(n-j, k) * f(j)   ??? \n\n   But note: the root has several subtrees. The standard recurrence for labeled forests:\n\n        F(n) = exp( T(x) ) -> but we need bounded size.\n\n   Actually, we can use exponential generating functions:\n\n        F_k(x) = exp( \\sum_{j=1}^{k} T_j * x^j / j! )   ... but not exactly.\n\n   There is a known generating function for the number of rooted labeled trees with bounded component size? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        Let F(n, m) = number of forests of m rooted trees on n nodes. Then:\n\n            F(n, m) = m * F(n-1, m) + n * F(n-1, m+1)\n\n        but that doesn't bound the size.\n\n   We are stuck? \n\n   Let me look at the provided code:\n\n        It precomputed factorials and inverse factorials.\n\n        Then for i in range((n+1)//2):\n            base = fact[n-1]\n            frac = modmul( comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i) )\n            out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n        Then it does:\n\n            rem = 0\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                oldrem = rem\n                rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n                out[i] -= oldrem\n                ... modulo\n\n        Then prints the out array.\n\n   How does this work?\n\n   Note: the code does not use the weights. So the weights are not used? \n\n   But the problem says the weights are given. \n\n   Let me check the example: n=3.\n\n        t = 1 test case, n=3.\n\n        Then the code:\n\n            out = [0]*3\n\n            i in range((3+1)//2) = range(2) -> i=0 and i=1.\n\n            For i=0:\n                base = fact[2] = 2\n                frac = comb(1,0) * invcomb(2,0) \n                    comb(1,0)=1, invcomb(2,0)= fact[0]*fact[2] / fact[2]? \n                Actually, invcomb(x,y) = fact[y] * fact[x-y] / fact[x]? \n\n                But the code: \n                    comb(x,y) = fact[x] * invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] \n                    invcomb(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] \n\n                So:\n                    comb(1,0) = fact[1] * invfact[0] * invfact[1] = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1\n                    invcomb(2,0) = invfact[2] * fact[0] * fact[2] = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1? \n\n                So frac = 1 * 1 = 1\n                out[0] = 2 * 1 = 2\n\n            For i=1:\n                base = 2\n                frac = comb(1,1) * invcomb(2,1) \n                    comb(1,1)=1\n                    invcomb(2,1)= invfact[2] * fact[1] * fact[1] = (1/2)*1*1 = 1/2 mod MOD? \n                So frac = 1 * (1/2) = 1/2 mod MOD -> which is 499122177 (since 2*499122177 mod 998244353=1)\n                out[1] = 2 * 499122177 = 1 mod MOD.\n\n            Then out = [2, 1, 0] initially.\n\n            Then the loop for i from 2 down to 0:\n\n                i=2: \n                    oldrem = 0\n                    rem += out[2] * invs(2) -> but out[2] is 0, so rem=0\n                    out[2] = 0 - 0 = 0\n\n                i=1:\n                    oldrem = 0\n                    rem += out[1] * invs(1) = 1 * 1 = 1 -> rem=1\n                    out[1] = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n                i=0:\n                    oldrem = 1\n                    rem += out[0] * invs(0) -> but invs(0): \n                         invs(x) = fact[x-1] * invfact[x] \n                         for x=0: fact[-1] -> index out of bounds.\n\n            This fails.\n\n   So the provided code is incomplete and has an error.\n\n   How to fix?\n\n   Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Centroids\" in Codeforces (problem 1401F) is different.\n\n   After checking known solutions for the problem \"Centroids\" (which is the same as this problem), we see:\n\n        We need to compute for each vertex i the number of trees in which i is the centroid.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          total = (n-1)!   [the total number of trees]\n\n          Then, for a fixed vertex i, we subtract the trees in which i is not the centroid.\n\n          How? \n\n          Condition: i is not the centroid if and only if there exists a subtree (after removing i) of size > (n-1)/2.\n\n          How to count the trees that are not centered at i?\n\n          We can use the following:\n\n            Let F(i) = total - (number of trees where the subtree that contains the smallest node (node 1) has size > (n-1)/2) ... but that is not symmetric.\n\n          Actually, we can root the tree at i. Then the subtrees are the connected components after removing i. The condition fails if one of the subtrees has size > (n-1)/2.\n\n          How to count the trees rooted at i with a subtree of size > (n-1)/2?\n\n          But note: the tree is built by the increasing condition? \n\n          We can use inclusion-exclusion:\n\n            Let A_j be the set of trees where the subtree attached to i that contains the node j (for j in the neighbors) has size > (n-1)/2.\n\n          However, the subtrees are defined by the entire structure.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use generating functions.\n\n          Let f(n, k) = number of forests of rooted trees (with labels) on n nodes such that no tree has size > k.\n\n          Then the number of trees with root i and no subtree of size > (n-1)//2 is: \n                f(n-1, (n-1)//2)\n\n          Then the number of trees with centroid i is: \n                f(n-1, (n-1)//2)   [because the root i has subtrees that are forests and we require each <= (n-1)//2]\n\n          But note: the entire tree is built by starting with i? \n\n          How to build the tree with root i? \n\n          The nodes are labeled. We have to assign the labels to the subtrees. However, the condition: each node (except i) must have exactly one neighbor with a smaller index. \n\n          How does the root i fit? \n\n          The root i is the smallest node in its component? Not necessarily. \n\n          We must be cautious: the condition says that every node j (>=2) has exactly one neighbor with a smaller index. \n\n          If we root at i, then for any node j that is not i, it must have a parent that is smaller than j? \n\n          But note: the parent of j must be a node that is already present when j is added. And the parent must be smaller than j? \n\n          However, if j is attached to i, and i>j, then that would violate the condition? \n\n          Example: n=3, i=2: \n                We have nodes 1,2,3.\n                Node 1: no condition.\n                Node 2: must be attached to a smaller node -> only node 1.\n                Node 3: must be attached to a smaller node -> can be attached to 1 or 2.\n\n          But if we want the tree to be rooted at 2, then 2 must be the parent of 3. But 2<3, so that's allowed. However, 2 is attached to 1 (which is smaller) so that's allowed.\n\n          So the condition is satisfied as long as every node j (except 1) has one parent that is smaller. \n\n          Therefore, the tree is built by: \n                We start with node 1. Then we attach nodes in increasing order? Not necessarily: we can attach node 2 to 1, then node 3 to 2 (even though 2<3) -> allowed.\n\n          But what if we want to have a tree with root i? \n\n          We can consider the following: \n\n                The entire tree is built by attaching nodes in increasing order. However, the root i might not be the smallest. \n\n          How to count the trees with root i? \n\n          We can use the following: \n\n                The tree is built by starting with node 1. We will eventually have node i. We can think of the entire tree as:\n\n                    First, we build the tree on the set {1,2,...,i}. In this tree, i is a node. Then we attach the remaining nodes (i+1 to n) to the existing nodes.\n\n          But note: the condition requires that every node j (>=2) has a parent that is smaller. So the parent of j must be in [1, j-1]. \n\n          Therefore, the entire tree is built by:\n\n                We have a tree on the first i nodes. Then for each node j from i+1 to n, we choose a parent from [1, j-1]. \n\n          How many ways to build the tree on the first i nodes? (i-1)! \n\n          And then for j from i+1 to n: we have j-1 choices. So the total number of trees in which the node i is the root? \n\n          But note: the root of the entire tree is not necessarily i. We are counting trees where i is a particular node. \n\n          Actually, we are counting trees with a fixed node i. The condition for the entire tree is independent of the root.\n\n          However, we want to count the trees in which i is the centroid. \n\n          How to count the trees with root i and with the condition that no subtree has size > (n-1)//2? \n\n          We can use the following:\n\n                Let F(n, k) = number of forests of rooted trees (with labels) on n nodes such that every tree has size <= k.\n\n                Then the number of trees with root i and with the entire forest of n-1 nodes (the children of i) having no tree of size > (n-1)//2 is: \n                      F(n-1, (n-1)//2)\n\n                But note: the forest is built on the set of nodes excluding i. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n excluding i.\n\n                However, the labels are fixed. And the condition for the tree: each node j (>=2) must have a parent in [1, j-1]. \n\n                How to count F(n, k) for labeled forests with the increasing parent condition? \n\n          Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied if we build the forest in increasing order? \n\n          We can use the following recurrence for F(n, k) (without the increasing condition, for labeled forests of rooted trees with bounded tree size):\n\n                F(0, k) = 1\n                F(n, k) = sum_{j=1}^{min(n,k)} (n-1 choose j-1) * F(n-j, k) * F_tree(j)\n\n          where F_tree(j) = number of rooted labeled trees on j nodes = j^(j-2) ??? \n\n          But wait, our trees are rooted and labeled, and the number of rooted labeled trees on j nodes is j^(j-1) [because we have j choices for the root and then a tree on j nodes: total trees are j^(j-2) for unrooted, so rooted is j^(j-1)].\n\n          However, in our case, the trees are built by the increasing parent condition, which gives (j-1)! trees for a rooted tree on j nodes? \n\n          Why? \n\n                For a rooted tree on j nodes (with a fixed root), the number of trees satisfying the increasing parent condition (that every node has a parent with a smaller label) is (j-1)! / (something)? \n\n          Actually, the condition is: the tree must be increasing in the sense that the parent of a node is smaller than the node. This is called an increasing tree. And for a fixed root, the number of increasing trees is (j-1)! / (the product of ...) -> no, actually it is (j-1)! divided by the automorphisms? \n\n          But note: the labels are distinct and we care about the labeling. The number of increasing trees on j nodes (with root fixed as the smallest?) is (j-1)!? \n\n          Actually, the root must be the smallest node. Then the next smallest node can be attached to the root or to the next? \n\n          In fact, the number of increasing trees on j nodes (with node 1 as the root) is (j-1)!? \n\n          Why? \n\n                We have j-1 edges. The tree is built by: \n                    node 1 is the root.\n                    then node 2 can be attached to 1.\n                    node 3 can be attached to 1 or 2 -> 2 choices.\n                    node 4 can be attached to 1,2,3 -> 3 choices.\n                    ... so (j-1)!.\n\n          But what if the root is not 1? \n\n          In our forest, the root of each tree can be any node? \n\n          However, the condition requires that every node (except the root) has a parent with a smaller label. Therefore, the root of a tree in the forest must be the smallest node in that tree.\n\n          So in the forest, each tree has its own smallest node as the root.\n\n          Therefore, the forest is built by: \n\n                We have a set of nodes. The smallest node in each tree is the root of that tree.\n\n                Then the number of increasing forests on n nodes (with the condition that each tree is increasing) is: \n\n                    F(n) = (n-1)!   ??? \n\n          But wait, the entire forest: \n\n                We have n nodes. We partition the set into trees. In each tree, the smallest node is the root. Then for the remaining nodes in a tree of size j, we have (j-1)! ways? \n\n                However, the forest is not necessarily on consecutive nodes? \n\n          Actually, the forest is on a fixed set of n nodes. The number of increasing forests on a set of n nodes is: \n\n                n! / (product_{trees} (size of tree))   ??? \n\n          I recall: the number of increasing forests on n nodes is n! / (the product of the sizes of the trees) multiplied by something? \n\n          Or: the number of increasing forests is the same as the number of ways to build a forest with the increasing condition. \n\n          We can build the forest by: \n\n                The smallest node is a root. Then the next smallest node can be either a root or attached to the smallest node. \n\n                In general, when we add the k-th smallest node, it can be attached to any of the k-1 nodes that are already present (and that are smaller) OR it can be a root. \n\n                But if it is a root, then we don't attach it. \n\n                So the number of choices for the k-th node is: (number of roots so far) + (number of non-root nodes that are already present) = (number of trees in the forest so far) + (k-1 - (number of trees)) = k-1? \n\n                Actually, the number of trees is not fixed. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use exponential generating functions. \n\n          The exponential generating function for a tree (with the smallest node as the root) is: \n\n                T(x) = x + x^2/1! * 1 + x^3/3! * 2 + ... = x * (1 + x/1! * 1 + x^2/2! * 2 + ... ) \n\n          But the number of increasing trees on n nodes is (n-1)!, so the exponential generating function is:\n\n                T(x) = sum_{n>=1} (n-1)! * x^n / n! = sum_{n>=1} x^n / n = -ln(1-x)\n\n          Then the exponential generating function for a forest is exp(T(x)) = exp(-ln(1-x)) = 1/(1-x) = sum_{n} n! * x^n / n! = sum_{n} x^n.\n\n          So the number of increasing forests on n nodes is n!.\n\n          But wait, that can't be: because the exponential generating function for forests is exp(T(x)) = 1/(1-x) = sum_{n} x^n, so the coefficient of x^n/n! is n!.\n\n          Therefore, the number of increasing forests on n nodes is n!.\n\n          However, we also have the condition that no tree has size > k. \n\n          Let T_k(x) = sum_{n=1}^{k} (n-1)! * x^n / n! = sum_{n=1}^{k} x^n / n.\n\n          Then the generating function for forests with tree size <= k is exp(T_k(x)).\n\n          Therefore, the number of increasing forests on n nodes with tree size <= k is: \n\n                F(n, k) = n! * [x^n] exp( sum_{j=1}^{k} x^j / j )\n\n          But note: the exponential generating function is for the exponential method, so the coefficient of x^n in exp(T_k(x)) is the exponential generating function, and then we multiply by n! to get the actual count.\n\n          So F(n, k) = n! * [x^n] exp( sum_{j=1}^{k} x^j / j )\n\n          Then the number of trees with centroid i is: F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = (n-1)! * [x^(n-1)] exp( sum_{j=1}^{(n-1)//2} x^j / j )\n\n          But note: the entire tree is built by: \n                We have the root i. The forest on the remaining n-1 nodes must be increasing and with tree size <= (n-1)//2.\n\n          However, the forest is on the set of nodes excluding i. The labels are fixed. The increasing condition is with respect to the natural order of the labels. But the set of labels excluding i is not consecutive. \n\n          But the increasing condition only cares about the relative order. Since the labels are distinct, we can relabel the nodes excluding i with 1 to n-1, preserving the order. \n\n          Therefore, the count is the same as for the set {1,2,...,n-1}. \n\n          So the number of trees with centroid i is independent of i? \n\n          That matches the examples: \n                Example1: n=3, then for i=1,2,3: \n                    For i=1: F(2,1) = 2! * [x^2] exp( x ) = 2! * [x^2] (1 + x + x^2/2! + ...) = 2! * (1/2) = 1.\n                    For i=2: F(2,1) = 1.\n                    For i=3: F(2,1) = 1? \n                But the example says the answers are 1,1,0.\n\n          Why for i=3 it is 0? \n\n          Because the centroid condition: removing vertex 3 -> the remaining tree has two nodes. The condition: each connected component has size <= (3-1)/2 = 1. But the two nodes are connected? So the component has size 2>1 -> so vertex 3 cannot be the centroid.\n\n          Therefore, for vertex 3, the count is 0.\n\n          How to account for that? \n\n          The formula F(n-1, (n-1)//2) for the forest on the other nodes works only if the forest has no tree of size > (n-1)//2. But note: the entire forest might be one tree of size 2, which is >1, so it fails.\n\n          But wait, the forest is the entire graph after removing i. In the tree, after removing i, the remaining graph is a forest. The condition for centroid is that every connected component (tree in the forest) has size <= (n-1)//2.\n\n          So the count for a fixed i is: \n                if there is any tree in the forest (after removing i) that has size > (n-1)//2, then i is not centroid.\n\n          But our F(n-1, (n-1)//2) counts the forests on n-1 nodes with every tree size <= (n-1)//2.\n\n          So the number of trees in which i is the centroid is F(n-1, (n-1)//2).\n\n          However, for i=3 in n=3: \n                F(2,1) = 2! * [x^2] exp( x ) = 2 * (1/2) = 1? \n                But the example says for i=3 the answer is 0.\n\n          Why is it 1? \n\n          What are the forests on 2 nodes (nodes 1 and 2) with tree size<=1? \n                The forest must be two trees: one with node 1 and one with node 2. \n                How many ways? \n                    We have two nodes. The forest must have two trees. \n                    The increasing condition: \n                         node 1: must be a root (smallest in its tree) -> fixed.\n                         node 2: must be a root (since it cannot be attached to 1 because that would make a tree of size2) -> fixed.\n                So only one forest.\n\n          But in the tree with root i=3, we would have:\n                The tree: \n                    node 3 is the root.\n                    then we have two trees: one with node1 and one with node2.\n                How to attach them to 3? \n                    We have to attach node1 and node2 to 3. \n                    But the condition: node1 and node2 must have a parent with a smaller index. \n                    However, 3>1 and 3>2? \n                    But node1: parent must be smaller than 1? -> there is no node smaller than 1. \n                    So node1 cannot be attached to 3? \n\n          This is the catch: the condition requires that every node j (>=2) has a parent with a smaller index. \n\n          In this forest, the trees are not attached to i yet. But when we attach the forest to i, we are not done. \n\n          Actually, the tree is built by: \n                We have the forest on the nodes excluding i. Then we attach each tree to i? \n\n          How do we attach? \n\n                The entire tree is built by the increasing condition. The node i might not be the smallest. \n\n          Specifically, for node i, if there is a node j < i that is in the forest, then when we attach the tree containing j to i, we must have j attached to i? But i>j, so that is allowed. \n\n          However, if there is a node j > i, then when we attach the tree containing j to i, we are attaching j to i, and i<j, so that is allowed.\n\n          But note: the forest is already built with the increasing condition within the forest. Then we attach the roots of the forest to i. \n\n          How many ways to attach? \n\n                The forest has several trees. The roots of these trees are the smallest nodes in their respective trees. \n\n                When we attach the forest to i, we are essentially making i the parent of each root? \n\n                But wait, the condition: when we add a node (which is the root of its tree) to i, we are not \"adding\" the node in the usual sense? \n\n          Actually, the tree is built by the entire process. The forest is not built independently. \n\n          We must build the tree in increasing order of the node labels. \n\n          The correct way: \n\n                We have to build the tree on the entire set. We know that i will be the root of the entire tree? Not necessarily. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n                The tree is built by the parent assignment. The parent of a node j (j != i) is chosen from the nodes in [1, j-1] (which may or may not be i). \n\n                For the forest on the nodes excluding i, we have to ensure that within the forest the parent-child relations are consistent and also that the parent of the roots of the forest will be i. \n\n          But note: the node i might be added after some of the nodes in the forest. \n\n          Example: i=3, n=3, nodes 1,2,3. \n                We start with node1. \n                Then node2: parent must be in [1] -> only 1.\n                Then node3: parent must be in [1,2]. We want to attach it to i=3? But i=3 is the current node, so we are attaching node3 to either 1 or 2. \n                If we attach node3 to 1, then the tree has edges (1-2) and (1-3). \n                If we attach node3 to 2, then the tree has edges (1-2) and (2-3). \n\n                In neither case is 3 the root. \n\n          How to make 3 the root? \n\n                In the increasing tree, the root must be the smallest node in its component. But 3 is not the smallest. \n\n          Therefore, in an increasing tree, the root of the entire tree must be the smallest node, which is 1. \n\n          So it is impossible to have 3 as the root? \n\n          Then how can 3 be the centroid? \n\n          In the tree (1-2) and (1-3): \n                Removing 3: leaves the edge (1-2) -> one component of size 2 -> which is > (3-1)/2=1 -> so 3 is not centroid.\n                In the tree (1-2) and (2-3): \n                    Removing 3: leaves the edge (1-2) -> one component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n\n          So indeed, there is no tree in which 3 is the centroid. \n\n          Therefore, the count for i=3 is 0.\n\n          How to reconcile with the formula F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = 1 for n=3? \n\n          The formula counted the forest on nodes 1 and 2 with tree size<=1: which is the forest with two trees: {1} and {2}. \n\n          Then how do we attach these to the rest of the tree? \n\n          In the entire tree, we have node 3. We must attach node 3 to one of the existing nodes (which are 1 and 2) when we add it. But then the forest on {1,2} is not preserved: because if we attach 3 to 1, then 1 and 2 are not in separate trees anymore? \n\n          Actually, the forest on the nodes excluding i is not the same as the connected components after removing i. In the tree, after removing i, the remaining is a forest. But in the increasing tree, the forest on the nodes excluding i is not built independently: the parent-child relations within the forest are exactly the edges that are not incident to i. \n\n          How to count the trees in which the forest on the nodes excluding i is a given forest? \n\n          We have the forest on the nodes excluding i. Then we attach i to the forest? \n\n          But note: the node i must be attached to one node in the forest? \n\n          Actually, the entire tree has exactly one edge from i to a node in the forest. \n\n          And the condition: when we add node i, we choose a parent from the nodes in [1, i-1] (which are all in the forest). \n\n          So the number of ways to attach i to the forest is: the number of nodes in the forest that are in [1, i-1] -> which is the entire forest if i> every node in the forest? \n\n          But the forest has nodes from 1 to n excluding i. Since i is fixed, the nodes in the forest that are < i are exactly the nodes in the forest with label < i. \n\n          How many such nodes? \n\n                The number of nodes in the forest with label < i is (i-1) (because the forest has all nodes except i, and the labels are 1..n).\n\n          Therefore, the number of choices to attach i is (i-1) (because any node in the forest with label < i can be chosen).\n\n          But wait, the forest might have nodes greater than i? \n\n          Example: n=4, i=2: the forest has nodes 1,3,4. The nodes with label<2 are only 1. So only one choice.\n\n          So the number of trees that yield a particular forest on the nodes excluding i is: (number of nodes in the forest that are < i) = (i-1).\n\n          Therefore, the total number of trees in which the forest on the nodes excluding i is a specific forest F is: (i-1).\n\n          And the number of forests on the nodes excluding i that have tree size <= (n-1)//2 is F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = (n-1)! * [x^(n-1)] exp( sum_{j=1}^{(n-1)//2} x^j / j ) \n\n          Then the total number of trees in which i is the centroid is: (i-1) * F(n-1, (n-1)//2) ? \n\n          But for i=1: (i-1)=0, so 0. But example: for n=3, i=1: the answer is 1.\n\n          Alternatively, for i=1: the forest on nodes 2,3. The number of forests on 2 nodes with tree size<=1: \n                only the forest with two trees: {2} and {3}. \n                Then the number of ways to attach 1: we can only attach to nodes in the forest that are <1 -> there are none. \n                So 0.\n\n          But the example says for i=1: 1 tree.\n\n          What is the tree for i=1? \n                The tree: \n                    node1 is the root.\n                    node2: must be attached to a node in [1] -> only 1.\n                    node3: must be attached to a node in [1,2] -> can be 1 or 2.\n                But if we want the forest on nodes 2,3 to be two trees, then we would attach node2 to 1 and node3 to 1? \n                Then the forest after removing 1 is two trees: {2} and {3}. \n                So that tree is counted.\n\n          How to attach node2 and node3 to the forest? \n\n          When we added node2, we attached it to 1. \n          When we added node3, we attached it to 1 (or to 2, but if we attach to 2 then the forest after removing 1 would be one tree: {2,3} which has size2>1, so not allowed for centroid at 1).\n\n          So for the forest to be two trees, we must attach node3 to 1, not to 2.\n\n          Therefore, the forest on {2,3} is determined: two singletons. \n          Then the number of ways to attach: \n                For node2: when it is added, it must be attached to 1 (only choice).\n                For node3: when it is added, it can be attached to 1 or 2. We choose to attach to 1.\n\n          So there is one tree.\n\n          How to count the attachment for the forest? \n\n          We have the forest on the nodes excluding i. Then we attach i to one node in the forest that is < i. \n\n          But then, for the nodes in the forest that are > i, they might be attached to a node in the forest that is < i or to i? \n\n          Actually, the forest is already built. The entire tree is built by the increasing condition. The forest is the connected components after removing i. The edges within the forest are fixed. The only edge incident to i is one edge from i to a node in the forest. \n\n          But note: the condition for the forest: within the forest, the parent-child relations are already fixed and satisfy the increasing condition. \n\n          Then, when we add i, we choose a parent for i from the nodes in the forest that are < i. \n\n          However, the tree has the condition that every node j (>=2) has a parent with a smaller index. For node i, we are choosing a parent from [1, i-1] (which is allowed). For the nodes in the forest that are > i, they already have a parent in the forest (which is smaller) so that's allowed. \n\n          Therefore, the only freedom is the choice of the parent for i: which must be a node in the forest with label < i. \n\n          So the number of choices is the number of nodes in the forest with label < i = (i-1) (because the forest has all nodes except i, and the nodes < i are 1..i-1, which are i-1 nodes).\n\n          Therefore, for a given forest F on the nodes excluding i, there are (i-1) ways to attach i.\n\n          So the total number of trees for which the forest on the nodes excluding i has tree size <= (n-1)//2 is: (i-1) * F(n-1, (n-1)//2).\n\n          For i=1: (1-1)*F(2,1) = 0 * 1 = 0, but we need 1.\n\n          What is the issue? \n\n          For i=1: the forest on nodes 2..n. The number of choices to attach i=1: we need to choose a parent for 1? \n\n          But node1 is the smallest, so it has no parent? \n\n          In the tree, node1 is the root. It has no parent. \n\n          Therefore, for i=1, we do not attach it to any node. \n\n          So the number of ways is 1 for the forest itself. \n\n          How to unify? \n\n          The attachment of i to the forest is only if i is not the smallest node. If i is the smallest node, then it must be the root of the entire tree, and then the forest is the entire remaining and we don't attach it to anyone. \n\n          But in our forest, we have the nodes excluding i. For i=1, the forest has nodes 2..n. \n\n          The condition for the forest: it must be an increasing forest. \n\n          And then we don't attach node1 to anyone. \n\n          So the number of ways for i=1 is F(n-1, (n-1)//2).\n\n          For i>1, we have (i-1) * F(n-1, (n-1)//2).\n\n          Therefore, the number of trees with centroid i is:\n\n                if i==1: F(n-1, (n-1)//2)\n                else: (i-1) * F(n-1, (n-1)//2)\n\n          But for n=3, i=1: F(2,1)=1 -> matches.\n                i=2: (2-1)*F(2,1)=1 -> matches.\n                i=3: (3-1)*F(2,1)=2 -> but should be 0.\n\n          Why for i=3 it is 2? \n\n          We must ensure that the forest on the nodes excluding i has tree size <= (n-1)//2. For i=3, (n-1)//2 = 1. \n          The forest on nodes 1 and 2: the only forest with tree size<=1 is the forest with two trees: {1} and {2}. \n          Then the number of ways to attach i=3: we can attach to any node in the forest with label<3, which are 1 and 2 -> 2 ways.\n\n          But then we get two trees:\n\n                Tree1: 1-3, 2 (attached to someone? but 2 must be attached to a smaller node: only 1, so the tree would be: 1-2 and 1-3 -> which is the tree with centroid 1, not 3.\n                Tree2: 2-3, and 1 must be attached to someone: 1 can be attached to 2 (since 1<2) -> tree: 2-1 and 2-3 -> centroid is 2.\n\n          In neither tree is 3 the centroid. \n\n          So why are we counting them for i=3? \n\n          The issue: the formula (i-1)*F(n-1, (n-1)//2) counts the trees in which the forest on the nodes excluding i has tree size<= (n-1)//2. \n          But it does not ensure that i is the centroid. It only ensures that the components after removing i are small. \n          However, in these trees, the centroid might not be i because the centroid might be elsewhere. \n\n          The centroid is the unique vertex that satisfies the condition. In a tree with an odd number of nodes, there is exactly one centroid. \n\n          Therefore, the events for different i are disjoint. \n\n          But our count for a fixed i counts trees in which the components after removing i are small, but it does not ensure that i is the centroid. It ensures that i satisfies the condition, but there might be another vertex that also satisfies the condition? \n\n          No, because there is exactly one centroid. \n\n          However, in the tree 1-2-3 (with edges (1-2) and (2-3)): \n                Removing 1: leaves a component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n                Removing 2: leaves two components of size 1 -> centroid.\n                Removing 3: leaves a component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n\n          So only 2 is centroid.\n\n          In the tree 1-2, 1-3: \n                Removing 1: leaves two components of size 1 -> centroid.\n                Removing 2: leaves a component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n                Removing 3: leaves a component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n\n          So only 1 is centroid.\n\n          Therefore, the count for i=3 should be 0.\n\n          What went wrong in the attachment for i=3? \n\n          The forest on nodes 1 and 2 is two singletons. \n          Then we attach 3 to either 1 or 2. \n          If we attach to 1, we get the tree: \n                node1: connected to 2 and 3. \n                This tree has centroid 1.\n          If we attach to 2, we get the tree:\n                node2: connected to 1 and 3.\n                This tree has centroid 2.\n\n          So in both cases, the centroid is not 3.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for i to be the centroid is not only that the components after removing i are small, but also that i is the centroid. \n\n          How to ensure that i is the centroid? \n\n          The condition is: the components after removing i have size <= (n-1)//2. \n          This is exactly the condition for i to be a centroid. \n\n          So the count for i should be the number of trees in which the components after removing i have size <= (n-1)//2. \n\n          For i=3 in n=3: the components after removing i have size 2 > 1, so it fails. \n\n          Therefore, we should have F(n-1, (n-1)//2) = 1 for the forest, but then we must have an additional condition: the forest must have tree size <= (n-1)//2. \n\n          For i=3, the forest on nodes 1 and 2 has size 2, which is > (3-1)//2=1, so it should not be counted in F(2,1). \n\n          But earlier we said F(2,1) = 1, and that 1 corresponds to the forest of two singletons, which has tree size 1 for each tree. \n\n          So then the size of the forest is 2, but the tree size (meaning the size of each tree) is 1, which is <=1. \n\n          Therefore, the forest is valid. \n\n          The catch: the condition for the centroid is on the size of the connected components after removing i, which is the size of the trees in the forest. In the forest, the tree size is the number of nodes in that tree. In the forest of two singletons, the tree sizes are 1 and 1, which are <=1. \n\n          So the condition is satisfied. \n\n          Then why is i=3 not the centroid? \n\n          Because the condition for the centroid is: \n                removing i splits the tree into subtrees with at most (n-1)/2 vertices each.\n\n          In this case, (n-1)/2 = 1, and the two trees have size 1, so it should be centroid.\n\n          But in the tree we built: \n                If we remove i=3, we get two components: {1} and {2}. \n                So it should be centroid.\n\n          However, in the tree we built by attaching 3 to 1 or 2, we have an edge between 1 and 2? \n\n          In the forest on {1,2} of two singletons, there is no edge between 1 and 2. \n\n          So the tree after removing 3 should have two components: {1} and {2}. \n\n          How do we build such a tree? \n\n                We have node1 and node2. They are not connected. \n                Then we add node3 and attach it to 1 and also to 2? \n\n          But a tree on 3 nodes must have only 2 edges. \n\n          We have two edges: \n                edge1: between 3 and 1.\n                edge2: between 3 and 2.\n\n          This is a tree: 1-3-2. \n\n          Now, remove 3: we get two components: {1} and {2} -> sizes 1 and 1.\n\n          Now check the centroid: \n                Remove 1: leaves 3 and 2. The edge 3-2 is there, so one component of size 2 -> not centroid.\n                Remove 2: similarly, one component of size 2.\n                Remove 3: two components of size 1 -> centroid.\n\n          So this tree has centroid 3.\n\n          Therefore, for n=3, i=3: there is one tree: the tree with edges (1-3) and (2-3). \n\n          But wait, the increasing condition: \n                node1: no condition.\n                node2: must have a parent with a smaller index. The only choices at the time of adding node2 are node1. So node2 must be attached to node1. \n                node3: can be attached to node1 or node2.\n\n          In this tree, node2 is attached to node3, but node3 is added after node2, so at the time of adding node2, node3 is not present. \n\n          Therefore, node2 must be attached to node1. \n\n          So the tree (1-2) and (1-3) or (1-2) and (2-3) are allowed, but the tree (1-3) and (2-3) is not allowed because node2 is not attached to a node with a smaller index (node1) at the time of its addition.\n\n          How to attach node2 to node1 and node3 to both? \n\n          We cannot have two edges from node3. \n\n          So the tree (1-3) and (2-3) is not built by the procedure. \n\n          Therefore, it is not counted in our total trees. \n\n          So then how do we build the tree (1-3) and (2-3)? \n\n          We would have to attach node2 to node3, but node3 is added after node2, so at the time of adding node2, node3 is not available. \n\n          Therefore, the tree (1-3) and (2-3) is not possible. \n\n          So for i=3, there is no tree. \n\n          Therefore, the count for i=3 is 0.\n\n          What is the error in the forest approach? \n\n          The forest on nodes 1 and 2 of two singletons is valid. \n          Then we attach node3 to a node in the forest with label<3, which are 1 and 2. \n          But we can only attach to one node. \n\n          So the tree will have only one edge incident to 3. \n\n          Therefore, the components after removing 3 will be: \n                the tree that includes the node we attached to, and the other tree. \n\n          If we attach to 1, then the components are: \n                {1,3} is not a component because we only have edge (1-3), and then node2 is alone? \n                But how is node2 connected? \n\n          In the forest, node2 is a singleton. When we attach node3 to node1, we are not connecting node2 to anything. \n\n          So the final tree has three components: {1,3}, {2}? \n\n          No, the tree has two edges: \n                edge1: from node2 to its parent (which must be node1, because node2 must be attached to a smaller node, and at the time of adding node2, only node1 is available) -> so we must have edge (1-2).\n                edge2: from node3 to node1 (or to node2, but we are attaching to node1).\n\n          So the tree is: node1 connected to node2 and node3. \n          Then removing node3: leaves node1 and node2 connected -> one component of size2.\n\n          Therefore, the forest after removing node3 is not the forest we started with. \n\n          The forest we started with (two singletons) is not preserved because we are not allowed to leave node2 as a singleton: it must be attached to node1. \n\n          So the flaw is: the forest on the nodes excluding i is not arbitrary. The increasing condition forces that within the set of nodes that are < i, the tree must be connected? \n\n          No, the increasing condition only forces that each node is attached to a smaller node, but the smaller node might be in the forest or might be i. \n\n          Specifically, for a node j < i, it might be attached to i or to a node in the forest that is < j. \n\n          Therefore, the forest on the nodes excluding i is not necessarily the same as the forest we are counting. \n\n          This approach is not working.\n\n Given the complexity and the provided code structure, and the fact that the provided code does not use the weights, I suspect the weights are not used in the solution. \n\n The provided code for program1.py (which is to be completed) has:\n\n        out = [0] * n\n        for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n            base = fact[n-1]\n            frac = modmul( comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i) )\n            out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n        rem = 0\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            oldrem = rem\n            rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n            out[i] -= oldrem\n            out[i] %= MOD\n            rem %= MOD\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n We must complete the function modmul.\n\n But note: the provided code also has:\n\n        MOD = 998244353\n\n        def inv(x):\n            return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n        MAX = 10 ** 6\n\n        fact = [1] ... up to MAX-1.\n\n        invfact = ... \n\n        comb(x,y) = fact[x] * invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] mod MOD\n\n        invcomb(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] mod MOD\n\n        invs(x) = fact[x-1] * invfact[x]   [which is 1/x mod MOD]\n\n The loop: for i in range((n+1)//2) -> i from 0 to (n//2) (approximately).\n\n        out[i] = fact[n-1] * comb(n//2, i) * invcomb(n-1, i) mod MOD\n\n        comb(n//2, i) = C(n//2, i)\n        invcomb(n-1, i) = fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n-1] \n\n        So out[i] = fact[n-1] * [ C(n//2, i) * ( fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n-1] ) ] = C(n//2, i) * fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] \n\n        But note: C(n//2, i) = fact[n//2] / (fact[i] * fact[n//2-i]) \n\n        So out[i] = [ fact[n//2] / (fact[i] * fact[n//2-i]) ] * fact[i] * fact[n-1-i] \n                   = fact[n//2] * fact[n-1-i] / fact[n//2-i]\n\n        This doesn't look familiar.\n\n The second part: \n\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            oldrem = rem\n            rem += out[i] * invs(i)   [which is 1/i mod MOD]\n            out[i] = out[i] - oldrem\n\n        This is a mirror of the generating function or an inclusion-exclusion.\n\n Given the complexity and the time, and the fact that the known solution for this problem is to use a generating function and a convolution, but the constraint is that the sum of n is <= 200000, we must output the missing code.\n\n The only missing code is the function modmul.\n\n But the provided code also does not have the loop for t test cases.\n\n The problem: the first line is t, then t test cases.\n\n So we must wrap the code in a loop for _ in range(t).\n\n Therefore, the completed program1.py should be:\n\n   MOD = 998244353\n\n   def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n        # It is defined to do: (x * y + c) % MOD, but the provided code calls it with two arguments.\n        # So we do:\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n   However, the function is called with two arguments: modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n\n   So we can define:\n\n        def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n            return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n   But the name suggests it might be for modular multiplication. We can do:\n\n        def modmul(a, b, c=0):\n            return (a * b + c) % MOD\n\n   Then the rest of the code.\n\n   But the code after the function definitions does not loop over test cases.\n\n   We must read t first.\n\n   So:\n\n        t = I()[0]   # which is the first integer in the input.\n\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = I()[0]\n            l = I()   # the weights, but not used.\n            ... the rest ...\n\n   However, the weights are read but not used. The example weights are not used in the provided code.\n\n   Therefore, we can discard the list of weights.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input has weights. We must read them even if not used.\n\n   So the completed program1.py is:\n\n        MOD = 998244353\n\n        def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n            return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n        def inv(x):\n            return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n        MAX = 10 ** 6\n\n        fact = [1]\n        for i in range(1, MAX):\n            fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n        invfact = [1] * (MAX)\n        invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n        for i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n            invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n        def comb(x, y):\n            if y < 0 or y > x:\n                return 0\n            return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\n        def invcomb(x, y):\n            # Note: the provided code: invcomb(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] \n            if y < 0 or y > x:\n                return 0\n            return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))\n\n        def invs(x):\n            # for x>=1, but when x=0, we have fact[-1] -> avoid.\n            # The code uses invs(i) in the loop for i from n-1 down to 0.\n            # When i=0, we get fact[-1] which is not defined.\n            # We must avoid: the loop uses i from n-1 down to 0, and n>=1.\n            # But for i=0, we should return 0? or handle separately.\n            # However, in the provided code: \n            #    out[i] is only defined for i in [0, (n+1)//2-1] and for i beyond that is 0.\n            #    then in the loop for i in range(n-1,-1,-1), we do invs(i) for i from n-1 to 0.\n            #    for i=0, invs(0) would be: fact[-1] * invfact[0] -> index out of bounds.\n            # We must define invs(0) = 0? or skip the call for i=0? \n            # But the code: \n            #    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n            #    and out[i] for i>= (n+1)//2 is 0, so it would be 0.\n            #    but invs(i) for i=0: we are indexing fact[-1] -> crash.\n            # So we must define invs(0) = 0.\n            if x == 0:\n                return 0\n            return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            # read the next line and discard\n            w = list(map(int, input().split())   # not used\n\n            out = [0] * n\n\n            # only for i in [0, (n+1)//2 - 1] we compute\n            for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n                base = fact[n-1]\n                frac = modmul( comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i) )\n                out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n            rem = 0   \n            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n                oldrem = rem\n                # Note: invs(i) might be 0 for i=0, but that's handled.\n                rem = (rem + modmul(out[i], invs(i))) % MOD\n                out[i] = (out[i] - oldrem) % MOD\n                # Ensure non-negative modulo?\n                if out[i] < 0:\n                    out[i] += MOD\n\n            # Format the output: n integers in a single line.\n            print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n But wait, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, and n can be up to 200000, but the number of test cases t can be up to 10000, and the sum of n<=200000, so t can be up to 10000 but the sum of n is bounded, so we are safe.\n\n However, the precomputation of factorials is done for MAX=10**6, which is 1000000, and that is done once.\n\n But the provided code has MAX=10**6, and n can be up to 200000, which is within MAX.\n\n But note: in the comb function, we use x up to n, and n<=200000, so it is within MAX.\n\n However, in the first for-loop in the test case: i in range((n+1)//2), and n can be up to 200000, so we do about 100000 iterations per test case. And the sum of n<=200000, but the sum of the values of n is the total number of nodes over test cases, but the work per test case is O(n), and the sum of n is 200000, so total work is 200000.\n\n But note: the first loop runs (n+1)//2 iterations, and the sum of n is 200000, so the total number of iterations in the first loops over all test cases is at most 100000.\n\n So it is acceptable.\n\n However, the second loop runs n iterations per test case, and the sum of n is 200000, so total 200000 iterations.\n\n Therefore, the code should be efficient.\n\n But note: the example n=3:\n\n        t=1, n=3.\n        out = [0,0,0]\n\n        i in range((3+1)//2)=range(2): i=0 and i=1.\n\n        i=0:\n            base = fact[2] = 2\n            comb(3//2,0) = comb(1,0) = 1\n            invcomb(2,0) = invfact[2] * fact[0] * fact[2] = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1\n            out[0] = 2 * 1 = 2\n\n        i=1:\n            comb(1,1)=1\n            invcomb(2,1)= invfact[2] * fact[1] * fact[1] = (1/2)*1*1 = 1/2 mod MOD = 499122177\n            out[1] = 2 * 499122177 % MOD = 1\n\n        out = [2, 1, 0]\n\n        Then the second loop:\n            i=2: \n                oldrem=0\n                rem = 0 + out[2]*invs(2) = 0 + 0 * ... = 0\n                out[2] = 0 - 0 = 0\n            i=1:\n                oldrem=0\n                rem = 0 + out[1]*invs(1) = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\n                out[1] = 1 - 0 = 1\n            i=0:\n                oldrem=1\n                rem = 1 + out[0]*invs(0) = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1\n                out[0] = 2 - 1 = 1\n\n        Then output: [1, 1, 0] -> matches.\n\n   Example n=5: \n        We are not going to compute, but the example says the answer for the centroid (vertex 3) should be 24 trees? \n        But the output is for each vertex: the number of trees in which that vertex is the centroid.\n\n        The example says: for n=5, the answer is 6 (total candies eaten) -> but that is not the output format. \n\n        The output format: for each test case, print n integers.\n\n        The example: \"the answer is 6\" refers to the total number of candies eaten in one example tree, but the problem asks for the number of trees for which the i-th vertex is the centroid.\n\n        The example says: for n=5, there are 24 possible trees. And in the example tree with edges (1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5) the centroid is 3. \n\n        How many trees have centroid at 3? \n\n        We would output 5 integers. The third integer should be the count for vertex 3.\n\n        We trust the code.\n\n   Therefore, the completed program1.py is as above.\n\n   However, the problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n   The instruction: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n   What is program2.py? \n\n   The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n   But we are only given program1.py.\n\n   We must also complete program2.py.\n\n   But the problem says: Output only the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n   We are not given program2.py, so we must assume that program2.py is also provided and has missing parts.\n\n   However, the problem does not provide program2.py.\n\n   Let me reread: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n   But in the input, we only have program1.py.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   The example output format: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n   Since we are not given program2.py, we cannot complete it.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n   And for program1.py, we have provided the missing code (the modmul function and the loop for test cases).\n\n   For program2.py, we are not given any code, so we cannot complete it.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n   What could program2.py be? \n\n   It might be a simple program that reads the output of program1.py and does nothing? or formats it? \n\n   But the output of program1.py is: for each test case, a line of n integers.\n\n   The problem does not specify what program2.py does.\n\n   Given the information, we must assume that program2.py is not provided and we are only to complete program1.py.\n\n   But the problem says both are to be completed.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is not needed and we are only to output the missing code for program1.py, and for program2.py output an empty string.\n\n   But the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n   Since we are not given program2.py, we cannot know what is missing.\n\n   I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n   In this instance, we are only given program1.py.\n\n   Therefore, I will assume that program2.py is not provided and we are only to complete program1.py.\n\n   But the output format requires both.\n\n   Alternatively, program2.py might be the same for every instance? \n\n   Given the history, program2.py might be a simple program that just passes the data through.\n\n   For example:\n\n        import sys\n        for line in sys.stdin:\n            print(line.strip())\n\n   But then it is not missing any code.\n\n   Or it might be that program2.py is not provided and we are to output only the completion for program1.py.\n\n   Given the complexity, I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py I will output an empty string.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n   And for program2.py, if it is not provided, then we have nothing to output.\n\n   However, the example output format requires a json with both.\n\n   Therefore, I will output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"the code for program1.py completion\", \"program2\": \"\"}\n\n   But the problem might have intended that program2.py is provided and has a small missing part.\n\n   Since we don't have it, we cannot do anything.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n   In the input, we are only given program1.py.\n\n   This is an error.\n\n   I will complete program1.py and for program2.py, I will output the empty string.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so if program2.py is not provided, then the entire program2.py is missing? \n\n   That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Given the constraints, I output the completion for program1.py and hope that program2.py is not needed or is provided in full elsewhere.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is the same as program1.py? \n\n   But the command: program1.py | program2.py\n\n   We are to output the missing code for both.\n\n   Since we are only given program1.py, we assume program2.py is not provided and we output only for program1.py.\n\n   But the output format requires both.\n\n   I will output for program2.py the string \"Not provided\".\n\n   However, the problem says: Output only the missing code.\n\n   We must follow the format.\n\n   Given the above, I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py I will output an empty string.\n\n   But note: the problem might have intended that program2.py is not to be modified, so we output the empty string for program2.py.\n\n   Final Answer:\n\n   We output a json:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"def modmul(x, y, c=0):\\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\\n\\n# And then wrap the main code in a loop for t test cases, and read the weights and discard them.\\n# Also, in the invs function, handle x=0.\\n# The complete code for program1.py is:\\n\\nMOD = 998244353\\n\\ndef modmul(x, y, c=0):\\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\\n\\ndef inv(x):\\n    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\\n\\nMAX = 10 ** 6\\n\\nfact = [1]\\nfor i in range(1, MAX):\\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\\n\\ninvfact = [1] * (MAX)\\ninvfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\\nfor i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\\n    invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\\n\\ndef comb(x, y):\\n    if y < 0 or y > x:\\n        return 0\\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\\n\\ndef invcomb(x, y):\\n    if y < 0 or y > x:\\n        return 0\\n    return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))\\n\\ndef invs(x):\\n    if x == 0:\\n        return 0\\n    return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\\n\\nt = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))  # not used\\n    out = [0] * n\\n    for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\\n        base = fact[n-1]\\n        frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\\n        out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\\n    rem = 0\\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\\n        oldrem = rem\\n        rem = (rem + modmul(out[i], invs(i))) % MOD\\n        out[i] = (out[i] - oldrem) % MOD\\n        if out[i] < 0:\\n            out[i] += MOD\\n    print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\",\n          \"program2\": \"\"\n        }\n\n   But the above string for program1 is very long and may have newlines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write it as a string with embedded newlines.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n   We are outputting a json string.\n\n   We must escape the string properly.\n\n   But the online judge will parse the json.\n\n   Given the constraints, I will output the json as above.\n\n   But note: the provided program1.py already has the functions and the precomputation. We are only adding the modmul function and the loop for t test cases, and the invs(0) fix.\n\n   We are also adding the comb and invcomb with bounds checking.\n\n   We'll output the entire program1.py as a string for the value of \"program1\", and for \"program2\" an empty string.\n\n   This is the best we can do."
