In each iteration, we do:\n\n                      time += 1 So the total time at the end is the answer. The groups that are not activated (f>=const) are activated by converting them to: f = (original count) + time + 1.\n\n                  Why time+1? Example: \n\n                    n=2, parents = [1]   # so one test case: n=2, and the parent of vertex2 is 1. Then, things = {0: const} and then for x in [1]: \n                         if 1 in things? no -> so things[1] = const. Then, we push: \n                         laze = [-const, -const]   # because we have two keys: 0 and 1? Then:\n\n                      time=0 while laze not empty:\n\n                         first: f = const (because -laze[0] = const) -> so we go to the elif branch. f = const - const = 0? then f = 0 + 0+1 = 1? Then we pop and push -1. Then time becomes 1. Then next iteration:\n\n                         f = 1 -> else branch: \n                             f = 1-1 = 0 -> then 0>1? no, so we don't push. time becomes 2. Then we have the other element: \n                         f = const -> elif branch: f = const - const = 0 -> then f = 0+2+1 = 3? \n                         then push -3. time becomes 3. Then next iteration: \n                         f=3 -> else branch: 3-1=2, then 2>3? no -> time becomes 4. Then next iteration: \n                         heap empty? Then answer=4.

But if we only have 2 children, we don't need to inject a third. So we can use:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1 child\n              Time3: spread to child2 -> 2 children. So F(2)=3. For 3 children:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1\n              Time3: spread to child2 and inject child3 -> 3 children -> F(3)=3. How? At time3: \n              Spreading: we spread from the root to child2 (because we have child1 infected) -> child2 becomes infected. Then injection: we inject child3. So we get two new infections at time3. Therefore, F(3)=3.

Alternatively:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1\n              Time3: spread to child2 -> 2, then inject child3 -> 3\n              Time4: spread to child4 -> 4\n\n            So F(4)=4. But note: at time4, we can also inject? but we don't need to. Therefore, the minimal time for k children is the minimal t such that:\n\n            We start at time0 = time when the parent was infected (say T0). Then at time T0+1: we can inject one child -> one child at time T0+1. Then at time T0+2: we can spread to one child (because we have one infected) and then inject one child -> two new children at time T0+2? Actually, the spreading and injection in the same second:\n\n            At time T0+2:\n              Spreading: we spread to one child -> that child becomes infected at time T0+2. Injection: we inject one child -> that child becomes infected at time T0+2. So two children at time T0+2. Then at time T0+3: we can spread to two more? But note: the spreading operation: for each vertex, we can spread at most one. So at the parent, we can only spread to one child per second. Then we can inject one more. So at time T0+3: two more children.",

Then the time for the last child is T0 + x = T0 + ceil((k-1)/2) + 1. But note: the parent is infected at T0, so the time for the children is T0 + 1 + ceil((k-1)/2) ?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete. We must output only the missing lines or blocks for each program in a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is (length) if the sum is positive, 0 if zero, and (-length) if negative.\n\nThe provided code uses a dynamic programming approach with coordinate compression and segment trees (or Fenwick trees) to efficiently compute the maximum dp[i] for the prefix ending at i.\n\nHowever, note that the provided code for program1.py is already complete? But the problem says there are missing lines or blocks.\n\nLooking at the code for program1.py, we see that the segment tree class `Seg` is defined but not used. Instead, the solution uses two Fenwick trees and a dictionary. The code for the Fenwick tree is provided and the main logic is in `my_main`.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\". However, the entire program1.py is provided and seems to be complete? \n\nBut note: the problem states that the program has missing lines or blocks. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the `Seg` class, the `modify` method has a TODO:\n\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we must complete the `modify` method of the `Seg` class? But note that the `Seg` class is not used in the current solution. The solution uses the `Fenwick` class. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing part is in the `Seg` class? But the solution doesn't use the `Seg` class. It uses the `Fenwick` class. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the provided code for program1.py is incomplete and we are to complete the entire solution? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the output format is a JSON with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo for program1.py, we are to output the missing code block? But the provided code for program1.py is long and the only TODO is in the `Seg` class. However, the solution does not use the `Seg` class. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the solution to use the `Seg` class? But the current solution uses Fenwick trees. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". The provided code already has a solution that uses Fenwick trees. However, the `Seg` class is incomplete. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are to complete the `Seg` class? Even though it is not used? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the provided code for program1.py is not the entire code? The problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\". We are given the code for program1.py as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque\nimport bisect\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\nfrom itertools import repeat\nimport math\n\nMOD = 998244353\ninput = stdin.readline\nfinp = [int(x) for x in stdin.buffer.read().split()]\n\ndef inp(force_list=False):\n    re = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if len(re) == 1 and not force_list:\n        return re[0]\n    return re\n\ndef inst():\n    return input().strip()\n\ndef gcd(x, y):\n   while(y):\n       x, y = y, x % y\n   return x\n\ndef qmod(a, b, mod=MOD):\n    res = 1\n    while b:\n        if b&1:\n            res = (res*a)%mod\n        b >>= 1\n        a = (a*a)%mod\n    return res\n\ndef inv(a):\n    return qmod(a, MOD-2)\n\nINF = 1<<30\n\nclass Seg(object):\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self._da = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n        self._op = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n\n    def update(self, p):\n        self._op[p] = max(self._op[p*2], self._op[p*2+1])\n\n    def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r):\n        if l==r-1:\n            self._da[p] = self._op[p] = x\n            return\n        mid = (l+r)//2\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        self.update(p)\n\n    def query(self, x, y, p, l, r):\n        if x <= l and r <= y:\n            return self._op[p]\n        if x >= r or y<=l:\n            return -INF\n        mid = (l+r)//2\n        return max(self.query(x, y, p*2, l, mid), self.query(x, y, p*2+1, mid, r))\n\n... and then the Fenwick class and my_main.\n\nSo the missing part is in the `Seg.modify` method. We are to complete that.\n\nThe `Seg` class is a segment tree for range maximum queries. The `modify` method is for updating a single position. The method is recursive. If the position is in the left child (pos < mid), we update the left. Otherwise, we update the right.\n\nSo the missing code for the else branch should be:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the parameters: \n- `pos` is the position to update.\n- `x` is the value to set.\n- `p` is the current node index.\n- `l` and `r` are the current segment boundaries.\n\nIn the left branch we do: `self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)`\nSimilarly, for the right branch: `self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)`\n\nSo the missing line is: `self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)`\n\nBut note: the current code for the segment tree is not used in the solution. However, the problem requires that we complete the code. So we complete the segment tree even though it is not used? \n\nBut the problem says: \"so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly\". The program1.py must run without errors. The segment tree class is defined but not used, so the incomplete method might not cause an error? However, if someone uses the segment tree, it would. But the problem does not specify that the segment tree must be used. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". The provided code already has a solution that uses Fenwick trees. The segment tree is an alternative and is incomplete. We are to complete the entire code, including the segment tree, even if it is not used? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to use the segment tree? But the current solution uses Fenwick trees. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, we complete the segment tree method as described.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The provided code uses a heap to simulate the process.\n\nThe code for program2.py:\n\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\nt = int(input())\nconst = 1 << 18\n\nfor T in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(\" \")]\n\n    things = {0: const}\n    for x in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[x] in things:\n            things[arr[x]] += 1\n        else:\n            things[arr[x]] = const\n\n    laze = []\n    for x in things:\n        heappush(laze, -things[x])\n\n    time = 0\n    while len(laze) > 0:\n\n        f = -laze[0]\n\n        if f <= time:\n            heappop(laze)\n            continue\n        elif f >= const:\n            f -= const\n            f += time + 1\n            heappop(laze)\n\n            if f > time:\n                heappush(laze, -f)\n        else:\n            f -= 1\n            heappop(laze)\n\n            if f > time:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        time += 1\n    print(time)\n\nWe see a TODO in the else branch.\n\nThe algorithm seems to be:\n\nWe are counting the frequency of each parent? Actually, the input gives the parent of vertices 2..n. The root is 1.\n\nThe idea is to simulate the infection process. The infection starts at time 0 with the root? But note: initially all are healthy. Then we do operations each second: spreading and then injection.\n\nHowever, the provided code does:\n\n- We build a dictionary `things` that maps a node (or the root?) to a count. But note: the root is 1, and the input gives p2, p3, ... pn. The code does:\n\n    things = {0: const}   # why 0? \n    for x in range(len(arr)):   # arr has n-1 elements\n        if arr[x] in things:\n            things[arr[x]] += 1\n        else:\n            things[arr[x]] = const\n\nThis counts the frequency of each parent. But note: the root (1) is not in the list of parents? Actually, the list arr has the parent for vertex 2,3,...,n. The root (vertex 1) might appear as a parent. But the code starts by having a key 0 with value const (which is 1<<18, a big number). Why?\n\nActually, the code then builds a heap `laze` of the negative of the counts (so that we can use a min-heap as a max-heap). \n\nThen the simulation:\n\n    time = 0\n    while heap not empty:\n        f = -heappop (but we look at the top without popping first? Actually, we do heappop in the branches)\n\nBut the code does:\n\n        f = -laze[0]   # the largest count (since we stored negative)\n\n        if f <= time: \n            pop and continue   # meaning this node is already handled? \n        elif f >= const: \n            # This branch is for the initial setup? \n            f = f - const   # remove the big constant\n            f = f + time + 1\n            pop the heap\n            if f > time: push back -f\n        else:\n            f = f - 1   # decrement the count? \n            pop the heap\n            if f > time: \n                # TODO: push back -f? \n\nBut note: the initial counts for the parents are stored as `const` (for the root? or for the initial node?) and then we add 1 for each occurrence. Actually, the root (vertex 1) is not in the input array. The code starts by having a key 0? That might be a placeholder.\n\nAlternatively, the intended logic:\n\nWe note that the infection process:\n\n- At time 0, we start. We can inject the root at time 0? But note: the injection operation is done each second after the spreading. Actually, the problem says:\n\n  \"Initially, all vertices are healthy.\n\n  Each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation.\"\n\nSo at second 1: we can do an injection (and then spreading? but then the injection is done at the beginning of second 1, then spreading at the same second?).\n\nActually, the minimal seconds needed.\n\nThe known solution for this problem:\n\nWe can note that the infection starts at the root. Then we can model the infection as:\n\n  Let f(v) be the maximum time at which the infection can reach v (starting from the root at time 0).\n\n  The root is infected at time 0? But note: we can choose to inject the root at time 0? Actually, the problem says: \"Initially, all vertices are healthy.\" and then the first second we do:\n\n    Spreading: since the root has no infected child initially, we skip? Then injection: we inject the root.\n\n  So the root is infected at time 1? \n\nBut the example image: at second 1, the root is blue (infected by injection). Then at second 2, the root is red (infected earlier) and two children are blue (injected at second 2) and one child is green (spread at second 2?).\n\nActually, the known solution:\n\n  We can use a greedy strategy. We note that:\n\n    - We start by infecting the root (by injection at time 1).\n    - Then, for a node with k children, we can prioritize the subtrees that take the longest.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Let dp[u] be the time when the infection reaches the node u.\n\n    We know the root: dp[1] = 1.\n\n    Then, for a node u, we can model:\n\n        We have k children. We can inject one child at any time (if we have an injection available) and then the spreading can be used to infect one more child per second (if at least one child is infected, we can spread to one more).\n\n        Actually, the process:\n\n          At time t (when u is infected), we can start infecting the children.\n\n          We can inject one child at time t+1, then at time t+2 we can inject another, and also at time t+2 we can spread to one child that was not injected? \n\n        However, note: the spreading operation in a second can only be done if at least one child is already infected. And then we can spread to at most one other child. So for a node u, we can:\n\n          - At time t+1: inject one child -> that child gets infected at time t+1.\n          - Then, at time t+2: we can inject a second child, and also spread to a third child? But note: the spreading operation happens after the injection? \n\n        Actually, the operations per second:\n\n          Second 1: \n            Injection: we inject the root -> root infected at time 1.\n\n          Second 2:\n            Spreading: from the root, we can spread to one child? But note: the root has no infected child at the beginning of second 2? So we cannot spread. Then we inject one child -> that child is infected at time 2.\n\n          Second 3:\n            Spreading: from the root, now we have one infected child (infected at time 2) so we can spread to one more child. Then we inject a third child? \n            So we can have two new infections: one by spreading and one by injection.\n\n        Therefore, for a node u with k children, we can assign:\n\n          We start at time = dp[u] (the time when u is infected).\n\n          Then we have a sequence of events:\n\n            At time dp[u] + 1: we can inject one child -> that child gets infected at time dp[u]+1.\n            Then at time dp[u]+2: we can inject one child and also spread to one child? But note: we can only spread if we have at least one child already infected. So at time dp[u]+2, we have two infected children: one from injection at time dp[u]+1 and one from injection at time dp[u]+2? Then we can spread to a third child at time dp[u]+2? Actually, the spreading operation happens at the same second as the injection? \n\n          The problem says: \"each second you do two operations: spreading and then injection\".\n\n          So at time = t (a second):\n\n            Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can spread to at most one other child. This is done simultaneously for all vertices.\n\n            Then, injection: we can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\n          Therefore, in one second:\n\n            - First, we spread: so for the root, if it has at least one infected child, we can spread to one more child (if available). Then we inject one more.\n\n          So the number of new infections per second for the root's children:\n\n            Second 1: root is infected (by injection at second 1) -> no spreading, then we can inject one child? But note: the root is infected at the end of second 1? Then at the beginning of second 2, we can use spreading from the root? \n\n          Actually, the process:\n\n            Second 1:\n              Injection: we choose the root -> root becomes infected.\n\n            Then the spreading: but at the time of spreading in second 1, the root was not infected? Actually, the injection happens in second 1, so at the spreading step of second 1, the root is not infected? \n\n          The problem says: \"Initially, all vertices are healthy.\" and then \"each second\" we do:\n\n            Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, ... \n\n          So at the very first second (second 1), no vertex is infected at the beginning, so spreading does nothing. Then we inject the root.\n\n          Then at second 2:\n\n            Spreading: the root is infected and has no infected children? (because we just infected the root at the end of second 1, and the children are still healthy) -> so spreading does nothing. Then we inject one child.\n\n          Then at second 3:\n\n            Spreading: the root has one infected child (from second 2) so we can spread to one more child. Then we inject a third child? \n\n          So we get two new infections at second 3.\n\n          Then at second 4:\n\n            Spreading: the root has two or three infected children? We can spread to one more? Then we inject one more.\n\n          Therefore, the infection of the children of the root:\n\n            We have k children.\n\n            We need to assign the time of infection for each child.\n\n            The first child: infected at time 2 (by injection at second 2).\n            The second child: infected at time 3 (by spreading at second 3) -> but note: we can also inject at second 3, so we can get two children at time 3? \n\n          Actually, at second 3:\n\n            Spreading: we spread from the root to one child (so that child becomes infected at time 3).\n            Then injection: we inject a third child (so that child becomes infected at time 3).\n\n          So two children at time 3.\n\n          Then at second 4:\n\n            Spreading: we can spread from the root to a fourth child? (because now we have two infected children: at time 2 and 3) -> so we spread to one more -> infected at time 4.\n            Then injection: we inject a fifth child -> infected at time 4.\n\n          So we get two children per second after the first.\n\n          Therefore, the time to infect all k children of the root:\n\n            We start at time = 1 (root infected).\n\n            We need to assign:\n\n              Time 2: 1 child\n              Time 3: 2 children\n              Time 4: 2 children\n              ...\n\n            So the time for the last child: \n\n              If k <= 1: then time 2.\n\n              If k>=2: then the time for the last child is 2 + ceil((k-1)/1) ? \n\n          But note: at time 2 we get 1 child, then at each subsequent second we get 2 children? \n\n          Actually:\n\n            Time 2: 1 child\n            Time 3: 2 children -> total 3\n            Time 4: 2 children -> total 5\n            ...\n\n          So the number of children infected by time t is: 1 + 2*(t-2) for t>=2.\n\n          Therefore, to have k children: 1 + 2*(t-2) >= k  => t >= (k-1)/2 + 2.\n\n          But wait: at time 2: 1 child -> t=2, then at time 3: 2 more -> total 3, so at time 3 we have 3 children? \n\n          Actually, at time 3 we have 1 (from time2) + 2 (from time3) = 3.\n\n          So the recurrence:\n\n            Let F(k) = minimal time to infect k children of a node.\n\n            F(0) = 0\n            F(1) = 2\n            F(2) = 3? but wait: we can do:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1 child\n              Time3: spread to child2 -> 2 children (and then we can also inject child3? but we don't have to, we are only infecting 2 children) -> so we can stop at time3.\n\n            But if we only have 2 children, we don't need to inject a third. So we can use:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1 child\n              Time3: spread to child2 -> 2 children.\n\n            So F(2)=3.\n\n            For 3 children:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1\n              Time3: spread to child2 and inject child3 -> 3 children -> F(3)=3.\n\n            How? At time3: \n              Spreading: we spread from the root to child2 (because we have child1 infected) -> child2 becomes infected.\n              Then injection: we inject child3.\n\n            So we get two new infections at time3.\n\n            Therefore, F(3)=3.\n\n            For 4 children:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1\n              Time3: spread to child2 and inject child3 -> 3\n              Time4: spread to child4 -> 4\n\n            So F(4)=4.\n\n            Alternatively:\n\n              Time2: inject child1 -> 1\n              Time3: spread to child2 -> 2, then inject child3 -> 3\n              Time4: spread to child4 -> 4\n\n            So F(4)=4.\n\n            But note: at time4, we can also inject? but we don't need to.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal time for k children is the minimal t such that:\n\n            We start at time0 = time when the parent was infected (say T0).\n\n            Then at time T0+1: we can inject one child -> one child at time T0+1.\n            Then at time T0+2: we can spread to one child (because we have one infected) and then inject one child -> two new children at time T0+2? \n\n          Actually, the spreading and injection in the same second:\n\n            At time T0+2:\n              Spreading: we spread to one child -> that child becomes infected at time T0+2.\n              Injection: we inject one child -> that child becomes infected at time T0+2.\n\n            So two children at time T0+2.\n\n          Then at time T0+3: we can spread to two more? But note: the spreading operation: for each vertex, we can spread at most one. So at the parent, we can only spread to one child per second. Then we can inject one more.\n\n          So at time T0+3: two more children.\n\n          Therefore, the number of children we can infect by time T0 + x is:\n\n            We have one child at time T0+1, then two children at time T0+2, two at time T0+3, ... \n\n          So the total by time T0+x is: 1 + 2*(x-1) for x>=1.\n\n          Therefore, to have k children: 1 + 2*(x-1) >= k  => x >= ceil((k-1)/2) + 1.\n\n          Then the time for the last child is T0 + x = T0 + ceil((k-1)/2) + 1.\n\n          But note: the parent is infected at T0, so the time for the children is T0 + 1 + ceil((k-1)/2) ? \n\n          Actually, x = the number of seconds after T0: \n            at T0+1: we get 1 child -> so after 1 second: 1 child.\n            at T0+2: we get 2 more? -> total 3? \n\n          Alternatively, we can model:\n\n            Let f(k) = minimal additional time (after the parent is infected) to infect k children.\n\n            f(0)=0\n            f(1)=1   (because we need one second: at the next second we inject one)\n            f(2)=1   because at the next second: we can inject one and then spread to one? -> but wait, we can only spread if we have at least one infected. At the beginning of the second after the parent is infected, we have none. So:\n\n              Second 1 (after parent): \n                Spreading: nothing -> then injection: we inject one -> so we have one child. \n                Then we cannot spread until the next second.\n\n            So to get two children:\n\n              Second 1: inject one -> 1 child.\n              Second 2: spreading: we can spread to one more -> then injection: we can inject a third? but we only want two. So we can stop after spreading? \n\n            Actually, we can choose not to inject? The problem says: \"you can choose\" for both spreading and injection.\n\n            So for two children:\n\n              Second 1: inject one -> 1 child.\n              Second 2: spreading: we spread to one more -> 2 children. Then we don't inject any more? \n\n            So we get two children at the end of second 2 -> f(2)=2.\n\n            But wait, the example for the root: the root was infected at time1, then at time2 we inject one child, then at time3 we spread to one child -> so two children at time3? \n\n            Actually, the time for the second child is time3, so f(2)=2 seconds after the parent (which was infected at time1) -> time1+2 = time3.\n\n          Therefore, the recurrence for a node u with k children:\n\n            We sort the children by the time they need to finish infecting their own subtree? Actually, we need to do a DFS.\n\n          Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #683 (Div. 2) by Meet IT: D) is:\n\n            We do a DFS. For a node u, we let the children be v1, v2, ..., vk. We compute dp[v_i] for each child.\n\n            Then, we sort the children in decreasing order of dp[v_i].\n\n            Then, for the node u:\n\n              dp[u] = max( i + dp[v_i] ) for i from 1 to k, and then we also consider the case of having only one child? \n\n            Actually, the infection process for the children of u:\n\n              We start at time t0 = dp[u] (the time when u is infected).\n\n              Then we have k children. We can choose the order of injection and spreading.\n\n              The idea: we want to assign an infection time to each child. The infection time for child v_i must be at least dp[v_i]? Actually, the infection time for child v_i is the time when we start infecting the subtree of v_i? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n              Let the children be sorted by the value of dp[v_i] in descending order.\n\n              Then, we have:\n\n                 dp[u] = max( dp[v_i] + i ) \n\n              and then we compare with the base: if the node u has no children, then we set dp[u] = 0? \n\n            But note: the root is infected at time1. Then we start infecting the children.\n\n            Example: one child:\n\n              We have k=1.\n\n              Then dp[u] = max( dp[v1] + 1 ) \n\n              But the child v1: we inject at time2, then the infection of the subtree of v1 takes dp[v1] seconds? so the entire subtree of v1 is infected at time2 + dp[v1]? \n\n              But the problem asks for the time when the whole tree is infected, which is the maximum time among all nodes.\n\n              However, the recurrence for u: we want the time when the entire subtree of u is infected.\n\n            Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Tree Infection\" (which has appeared in Codeforces) is:\n\n              We note that:\n\n                We can only inject one node per second, and we can spread one per second per parent that has at least one infected child.\n\n              Steps:\n\n                We group the children by parent.\n\n                Then, we note that for a parent with k children, we can infect them in a way that the time for the last child to be infected is: 1 + (the time to infect k children given that we start at time t0).\n\n                But we also have to account for the time to infect the subtrees of the children.\n\n              The solution:\n\n                Let f(s) be the minimal time to infect a group of s siblings (with the parent already infected).\n\n                Then, f(s) = 1 + ceil((s-1)/1) ? -> no.\n\n                Actually, we can model:\n\n                  We start at time t0 (when the parent is infected).\n\n                  Then:\n\n                    At time t0+1: we inject one child -> one child infected.\n                    Then at each subsequent second, we can spread to one more child (if we have at least one infected) and we can also inject one more? \n\n                But note: we can also choose to inject in any second. And we can do one injection per second globally? \n\n                Actually, the injection is global: we can choose any healthy vertex. So we can inject a child of any parent.\n\n                Therefore, the problem is more complex.\n\n              The known solution (from a known submission for \"Tree Infection\"):\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Count the frequency of each parent -> we get an array of frequencies for each parent.\n\n                  Then, we do:\n\n                    Let a = sorted(frequencies, reverse=True)\n\n                    Then, we use a binary search on the total time T.\n\n                  Or a greedy simulation:\n\n                    We note that for a parent with k children, we need to assign injections to some of the children and then the rest can be spread.\n\n                    The minimal time for a group of size k (with the parent already infected at time t0) is:\n\n                      We must inject at least one child (to start the spreading). Then the spreading can cover one per second. But we can also inject more.\n\n                    Actually, the time for the group is:\n\n                      Let x be the number of injections we use for this group (x>=1). Then the time for the last child in the group is: t0 + x + (k - x)   [because after the x injections, we can spread to the remaining k-x children, one per second]? \n\n                    But note: the injections are not necessarily consecutive. We can interleave with injections in other groups.\n\n                  Instead, we simulate the entire process:\n\n                    We have multiple groups (each parent is a group). The root group: the root is infected at time0? but we start at time1.\n\n                    We start by injecting the root at time1.\n\n                    Then, for each group (each parent), we must wait until the parent is infected.\n\n                    Then, we can assign injections to the children in the group at any time after the parent is infected.\n\n                  The known solution (from a known AC code):\n\n                    t = int(input())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input())\n                        p = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                        cnt = [0] * (n+1)\n                        for i in p:\n                            cnt[i] += 1\n                        cnt = sorted([x for x in cnt if x > 0], reverse=True)\n                        # We also have the root? \n                        # The root is not in the list? \n                        # Actually, the root is 1, and it might not be in the list of parents? \n                        # But we know the root must be infected. We add the root as a group of size 1? \n                        # Actually, the root is already infected at time1, so we consider the children of the root.\n\n                        # But the list cnt: we have the frequencies of the parents. The root (1) might appear? \n\n                        # The known code:\n\n                        # We start by having the root group: the root has no parent in the input, so we add it.\n\n                        # Actually, the known solution:\n\n                        #   groups = [1]   # the root must be infected, so we count it as a group of size 1? \n                        #   Then for each parent that appears, we have a group of size = frequency.\n\n                        # But the root is not in the list of parents? \n\n                        # Correction: the input: p2, p3, ... pn: the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n). So the parent of vertex 2 to n are given. The root (vertex1) is the parent of some vertices? \n\n                        # So we build cnt for parents from 1 to n. The root (1) will appear in the list.\n\n                        # Then, we do:\n\n                        #   groups = [1]   # because the root is initially infected? but we have to account for the root as a group? \n\n                        # Actually, the known solution:\n\n                        #   cnt = [0]*(n+1)\n                        #   for x in p: \n                        #       cnt[x] += 1\n                        #   cnt = [1] + [x for x in cnt if x>0]   # we add the root as a group of size 1? \n\n                        # But the root is already infected at time1, so we don't need to infect the root again. However, the spreading from the root requires that we account for the root's children.\n\n                        # Actually, the known solution from the provided code in the problem:\n\n                        #   things = {0: const}   # why 0? \n                        #   for x in range(len(arr)):   # arr is the list of parents\n                        #       if arr[x] in things: things[arr[x]] += 1\n                        #       else: things[arr[x]] = const\n\n                        #   Then they build a heap of the counts.\n\n                        # And then they simulate.\n\n                  The simulation in the provided code for program2.py:\n\n                    time = 0\n                    while heap:\n                        f = -heappop(laze)   # the largest count\n\n                        if f <= time: \n                            # This group is done? \n                            pop and continue\n                        elif f >= const: \n                            # This is the first time we are processing this group? \n                            f = f - const   # get the actual count\n                            f = f + time + 1   # why time+1?\n                            heappop(laze)   # we popped above?

The size of the group is stored. But the initial storage: for the groups that are not the root, we store the count. For the root? we stored 0: const? \n\n                    Then, we simulate by seconds. In the heap, we store the remaining work for each group.\n\n                    The value in the heap for a group is the number of uninfected children in that group? \n\n                    And we are simulating the effect of injections and spreading.\n\n                  How the spreading and injection work globally:\n\n                    - Injection: we can reduce the count of any group by 1? (because we inject one child in that group) -> but we can only inject one child per second globally.\n\n                    - Spreading: for each group that has at least one infected child, we can reduce the count by 1? (because we spread to one child in that group) -> and this happens for every group that has at least one infected child.\n\n                    Therefore, in one second:\n\n                      Spreading: for every group that has at least one infected child and has at least one uninfected child, we can reduce the count by 1.\n\n                      Injection: we can reduce the count of one group by 1 (and we choose the group that benefits the most).\n\n                  The simulation:\n\n                    We maintain a heap of the current sizes of the groups (the number of uninfected children in the group) but only for groups that have at least one infected child? \n\n                    However, initially, only the root group (which is not really a group of children? ) is present.\n\n                    The provided code starts with:\n\n                         things = {0: const}\n                         for x in arr: \n                             if x in things: things[x] += 1\n                             else: things[x] = const\n\n                    Why const=1<<18? \n\n                    Then, they push the negative of the counts into a heap.\n\n                    The simulation:\n\n                      time = 0\n                      while heap:\n                          f = -heap[0]   # the largest count\n\n                          if f <= time: \n                              pop and continue   # meaning this group is finished? \n                          elif f >= const:   // this is a marker for a group that hasn't been started?\n                              // then we process it: \n                                  f = f - const   // get the actual count\n                                  f = f + time + 1   // why?\n                                  pop the heap\n                                  if f > time: push -f (without const) \n                          else: \n                                  f = f - 1   // we reduce by one (by spreading? or by injection?)\n                                  pop the heap\n                                  if f > time: push -f\n\n                      time += 1\n\n                    What does this do?\n\n                    The known solution from a known problem \"Tree Infection\" (e.g., from a known contest) might be:\n\n                      We start by having groups of sizes s1, s2, ... , sm.\n\n                      We need to assign injections and then let the spreading happen.\n\n                      The minimal time is the minimal T such that:\n\n                         For each group i, we inject x_i children (with x_i>=1) and then the spreading will cover the rest s_i - x_i children.\n\n                         The constraint: the total injections (over groups) is at most T, and for each group i, the time when the last child in group i is infected is: \n                             t_i = (injection time of the first injection in group i) + (s_i - x_i)\n\n                         and we require t_i <= T.\n\n                      But we can choose the injection times arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct seconds and >= the time when the parent is infected).\n\n                    However, the provided code does not use this binary search.\n\n                    The provided code uses a heap simulation.\n\n                    The idea of the simulation:\n\n                      We have two types of events:\n\n                        1. For a group that hasn't been touched (marked with const), we \"activate\" it: \n                             f = (original count) + time + 1   // then we push it back without const.\n\n                        2. For a group that is active, we reduce it by 1 (simulating that we use an injection for it? or spreading?) \n\n                      But note: the else branch reduces by 1 and then pushes back if still positive.\n\n                      And the time increases by 1 each iteration.\n\n                      The condition: if f<=time, we pop and do nothing (meaning the group is finished by time 'time').\n\n                  How does the spreading happen? \n\n                    The spreading is not explicitly in the heap? \n\n                    The key: the spreading happens automatically for every active group that has at least one infected child? \n\n                    But in the simulation, we only reduce one group per iteration? \n\n                  Actually, the spreading is accounted for by the fact that every second, every active group that has at least one infected child will have one more child infected by spreading? \n\n                  But then why do we only reduce one group? \n\n                  The provided code only reduces one group per iteration? \n\n                  Let me read the simulation:\n\n                    while heap:\n                        f = -heap[0]   # the largest count\n\n                        if f<=time: \n                            pop and continue   # this group is finished at this time? \n                        elif f>=const: \n                            # This group is not activated.

However, we have to infect the root.\n\n                  In the simulation, group0 is activated first:\n\n                    time0: \n                      f = const -> elif branch: \n                         f = const - const = 0 -> then f = 0+0+1 = 1 -> push -1.\n\n                  Then group1 is activated at time1:\n\n                    time1: \n                      f = 1 (from group0) -> else branch: reduce to 0 -> done.\n                    time2: \n                      f = const (group1) -> elif: f = 0+2+1=3 -> push -3.\n                    time3: \n                      f=3 -> else: reduce to 2 -> push -2.\n                    time4: \n                      f=2 -> else: reduce to 1 -> push -1.\n                    time5: \n                      f=1 -> else: reduce to 0.\n\n                  Then time=5.\n\n                  This is not matching.\n\n                  Alternatively, the intended meaning of the groups:\n\n                    We should only consider groups for the parents that appear? and the root group should be the children of the root? \n\n                  The input: for n=2, we have one parent: 1 (for vertex2). So the root (1) has one child.\n\n                  Then the groups: \n                    group1: size=1.\n\n                  But the code also has group0: size=const.\n\n                  Why group0? \n\n                  The known solution might be: we also need to account for the root being infected. The group0 might represent the root.\n\n                  How many seconds to infect the root? \n\n                    We inject the root at time1.\n\n                  Then group0 is finished? \n\n                  Then group1: size=1.\n\n                    We can inject the child at time2, or we can spread at time2.\n\n                  But to spread at time2, we need the root to be infected and the child to be not infected. At time2: \n                    Spreading: from the root to the child -> child infected.\n\n                  So done at time2.\n\n                  Therefore, the simulation should be:\n\n                    Only group0: size=1 (the root) and group1: size=1 (the child of the root).\n\n                  But the code has group0: size=const? \n\n                  The const is 1<<18, which is 262144, a large number.\n\n                  This doesn't make sense.\n\n                  Reexamine the code:\n\n                    things = {0: const}\n                    for x in range(len(arr)):   # arr has n-1 elements\n                        if arr[x] in things:\n                            things[arr[x]] += 1\n                        else:\n                            things[arr[x]] = const\n\n                  This counts the frequency of each parent. For parent 1, we do: \n                      things[1] = const   (because initially we have {0:const}, and 1 is not in things)\n\n                  Then we have two groups: \n                      group0: count = const\n                      group1: count = const+1   ? \n\n                  But then we push the negative of the counts.\n\n                  This is not right.\n\n                  What if we change the initialization:\n\n                    things = {}\n                    for x in arr:\n                        things[x] = things.get(x,0)+1\n\n                  and then we also need to account for the root? \n\n                  The root (1) might not be in the list of parents? \n\n                  But the input: the parent of vertex2 is given. For a tree with root 1, vertex2's parent is 1.\n\n                  So group1: count=1.\n\n                  Then why group0? \n\n                  The provided code has a group0 with count=const initially.\n\n                  This group0 might be a dummy group for the root itself? \n\n                  How many seconds to infect the root? \n\n                    We inject the root at time1.\n\n                  So the group0: size=1 (the root) -> but the code sets it to const.\n\n                  This is not matching.\n\n                  Given the complexity and the fact that the provided code has a TODO in the else branch, and the other branch is provided, we complete the else branch as:\n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  But the code already does: \n\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  in the other branch. In the else branch, we do the same.\n\n                  However, the variable 'f' in the else branch is reduced by 1.\n\n                  So the missing code is simply: \n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  But note: the code already has:\n\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  So we only push if f>time.\n\n                  But the TODO is inside the else branch, and the condition is already there.\n\n                  The TODO is at the line:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                  and the next line is:\n\n                    time += 1\n\n                  So we only need to push if f>time.\n\n                  But the code for the push is already written: \n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  So the missing code is that one line.\n\n                  However, the code in the else branch is:\n\n                    f = f - 1\n                    heappop(laze)   # we pop the current largest\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  This is already there. The TODO is in the else branch, and the only thing missing is the push inside the if.\n\n                  But the if condition and the push are already there. The TODO is at the position of the push.\n\n                  So the missing code is: \n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  But note: the code after the TODO is:\n\n                    time += 1\n\n                  So the block is:\n\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  But the if condition and the push are already present. The TODO is at the else branch of the if in the else branch of the big if? \n\n                  Let me format the else branch:\n\n        else:\n            f -= 1\n            heappop(laze)\n            if f > time:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        time += 1\n\n                  So the missing code is: \n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  But note: we have to push the negative of f.\n\n                  So the missing line is: \n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n                  However, we must be cautious: the heap stores negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n\n                  Therefore, we output for program2.py: \"heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\nBut wait, the variable is `laze` (the heap).\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is: \n\n    heappush(laze, -f)\n\nBut note: the code already has the same line in the elif branch.\n\nSummary:\n\n  For program1.py: complete the else branch in the Seg.modify method with:\n\n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\n  For program2.py: complete the TODO in the else branch with:\n\n        heappush(laze, -f)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and in the case of program1.py, the missing code is one line. For program2.py, one line.\n\nHowever, the output format is a JSON with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nWe output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\", \"program2\": \"                heappush(laze, -f)\"}\n\nBut note: the exact indentation? \n\nIn program1.py, the missing line is at the same indentation level as the if branch. The if branch has:\n\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n\nSo the else branch should be at the same indentation: 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\nIn the provided code for program1.py, the else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        self.update(p)\n\nSo we replace the TODO line with the code, and the next line (self.update(p)) is already there.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the TODO is at:\n\n            if f > time:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO line with the code.\n\nTherefore, the exact strings for the completions:\n\n  program1: \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\"\n\n  program2: \"                heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has 8 spaces for the while loop, then 4 for the if/elif/else, then 8 for the inner blocks. The else branch has:\n\n        else:\n            f -= 1\n            heappop(laze)\n            if f > time:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at an indentation of 16 spaces. So the code we insert should be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the line we are inserting: \"heappush(laze, -f)\" should be at 16 spaces.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  program1: \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\"\n  program2: \"                heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\nBut note: the program1.py code uses 4-space indents? The code we see uses 4 spaces per indent. The modify method:\n\n    def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r):\n        if l==r-1:\n            ... 4 more spaces for the block.\n\n        mid = (l+r)//2\n        if pos < mid:\n            ... 8 more spaces\n        else:\n            ... 8 more spaces for the TODO\n\n        self.update(p)   # at the same level as the if/else\n\nSo the else branch is at 8 spaces, and the code we insert should be at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the if branch has:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n\nwhich is 12 spaces.\n\nSo the else branch should be:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nat 12 spaces.\n\nBut the provided code for program1.py in the else branch has:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nwhich is at 12 spaces.\n\nSo we output the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
