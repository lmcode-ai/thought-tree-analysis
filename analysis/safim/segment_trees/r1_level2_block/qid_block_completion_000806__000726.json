However, the example in the note:\n  First test case: [1,1] -> Alice eats one from left (weight=1), Bob eats one from right (weight=1) -> total candies=2. Second test case: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> Alice eats [7,3,20] (30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (30) -> total candies=7. Third test case: [1,2,3,4] -> no non-zero equal partition? So they eat 0.

Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                divisions = {0:4, 1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1}\n                # But note: \n                #   rating < -5001 -> index0 -> division4? but that rating is not possible? Since the problem says rating>=-5000, and our b[0] is -5001, then the smallest rating is -5000, which is greater than -5001 -> so the index will be at least 1. Therefore, we can do:\n\n                idx = bisect.bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx   # because the index can be 1,2,3,4 -> then division=4,3,2,1.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n1. It reads the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case:\n   a. Reads n (number of candies)\n   b. Reads the list of candy weights.\n   c. Computes x = total sum // 2 (since they want to have equal weight, each must have at most half the total)\n   d. Then it builds a dictionary `d` by iterating from the left:\n        s = 0\n        for each candy (with index and weight):\n            s += weight\n            if s exceeds x, break (because we cannot have a sum more than half the total? Actually, note: they don't have to use the entire total, but the condition is that the two sums must be equal and as large as possible. However, the note says that the total they eat is at most the entire table, and the goal is to maximize the number of candies? Actually, the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" under the condition that the total weight each eats is equal.\n\nBut note: the example 2: \n  n=3, [1, 2, 1] -> answer=2? Actually the example says: \n  For the second test case: Alice eats [7,3,20] and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> total 30 each, and they ate 7 candies in total.\n\nHowever, the example in the note:\n  First test case: [1,1] -> Alice eats one from left (weight=1), Bob eats one from right (weight=1) -> total candies=2.\n\nSecond test case: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> Alice eats [7,3,20] (30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (30) -> total candies=7.\n\nThird test case: [1,2,3,4] -> no non-zero equal partition? So they eat 0.\n\nFourth test case: [1,2,3,4] -> wait, the example says the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> answer=7.\n\nSo the approach:\n\nWe are to maximize the total number of candies eaten (so we want as many as possible) such that the sum of weights from the left (by Alice) equals the sum of weights from the right (by Bob). Note that they eat from opposite ends and the candies in the middle (if any) are not eaten.\n\nWe can use two pointers or prefix sums.\n\nThe provided code does:\n  x = sum(a) // 2   # but note: the total sum might be odd, but we are only going to consider sums that are at most half? Actually, we are going to consider all possible prefix sums from the left until the cumulative sum exceeds x (which is half the total). Why? Because if a prefix from the left has a sum s, then we require that the suffix from the right has the same sum s. And s cannot exceed half the total? Actually, it can be at most half the total? But note: the entire table might be used if the total is even? However, the problem does not require that they eat all the candies, but they can only eat from the ends without overlapping.\n\nThe code then builds a dictionary `d` that maps a prefix sum (from the left) to the number of candies (index+1) that gives that sum. But note: it breaks when the prefix sum exceeds x (half the total). Why? Because if the prefix sum is already more than half, then we cannot have a matching suffix that is equal to that (since the total is fixed and the suffix would have to be at least that, but then the total would be at least 2*s which is more than the entire total). However, note: the entire total might be odd, so we break at x? Actually, we break when s > x, meaning we don't consider any prefix that is more than half the total.\n\nThen, we traverse from the right (suffixes). We start from the right and accumulate the suffix sum. For each suffix sum `s`, we check if that `s` is in the dictionary `d` (which means we have a prefix from the left that has the same sum). Then, the total candies eaten would be (number of candies in the prefix) + (number of candies in the suffix). We want to maximize that total.\n\nBut note: the prefix and suffix must not overlap. The dictionary `d` was built for the entire prefix? But when we traverse the suffix, we are starting from the right and going left. We must ensure that the prefix and suffix do not overlap.\n\nThe provided code for the suffix part:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d:   # then we have a candidate\n            # How many candies in the suffix? idx+1\n            # How many candies in the prefix? d[s] \n            # But we must check that the prefix and suffix do not overlap? \n            # The condition: the prefix ends at index (d[s]-1) (0-indexed) and the suffix starts at index (n-1-idx) (0-indexed). We require that the prefix does not extend beyond the suffix. That is: (d[s] - 1) < (n-1-idx). \n            # However, note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy. So the prefix and suffix must be disjoint.\n\n            # Therefore, we require: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n   (because the total candies eaten is the prefix count and the suffix count, and they must not overlap, so the total count must be at most n). But note: the entire array might be used? Yes, as in the second example.\n\n            # However, the dictionary `d` was built without considering the suffix. And we break the prefix when the sum exceeds x (which is half the total). But note: the suffix we are building might also break when the sum exceeds x? Actually, we don't break in the suffix loop. But we are only checking for s in d. And if s is in d, then we have a candidate.\n\n            # So we can do: \n            #   total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\n            #   and then set r = max(r, total_candies)\n\n            # But we must also check that the prefix and suffix do not cover the entire array? Actually, if they do, that's allowed. However, we must check that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. The condition is that the prefix ends at position (d[s]-1) and the suffix starts at (n-1-idx). We require that the prefix end is strictly less than the suffix start? \n            #   d[s] - 1 < n - 1 - idx   =>   d[s] + idx < n\n            # But note: the entire array can be partitioned? Actually, the example: [1,1] -> prefix [1] and suffix [1] -> the prefix ends at index0 and the suffix starts at index1 -> disjoint. So condition: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the total number of candies is d[s] (from left) and (idx+1) from the right. The condition is that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? But note: the entire array is n. So if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint? Actually, the prefix uses the first d[s] candies, the suffix uses the last (idx+1) candies. They are disjoint if the prefix ends before the suffix starts, i.e., the last index of the prefix is d[s]-1 and the first index of the suffix is n - (idx+1). We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1)  => d[s] + idx < n. \n\n            # However, note: the problem does not require that the entire array is contiguous? They are contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right. So if the prefix and suffix together use more than n candies, that would be impossible. But we are building the suffix from the very end. The prefix starts at 0 and the suffix starts at n-1. They meet when the prefix has taken the first k and the suffix has taken the last l, and we require k + l <= n.\n\n            # Therefore, we must check that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is necessary. But note: the dictionary `d` was built for the entire array? And the suffix we are building is also for the entire array? However, when we have a candidate s, we have a prefix of d[s] candies and a suffix of (idx+1) candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two sets of indices are disjoint. The prefix uses indices [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix uses indices [n - (idx+1), n-1]. They are disjoint if d[s] <= n - (idx+1). So we require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, no: the condition is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). But note: the total candies eaten is d[s] + (idx+1). We require that this total does not exceed n? Actually, the entire array has n candies, so the total eaten cannot exceed n. But the condition for non-overlap is exactly that the two intervals do not overlap, which is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\n            # However, the problem does not require that the entire array is used? They can leave some in the middle. So we can have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n            # But note: the example [1,1] -> d[1] = 1 (from the prefix) and then when we do the suffix: \n            #   first candy from the right: 1 -> s=1 -> found in d -> then total candies = 1 (prefix) + 1 (suffix) = 2, and 2<=2 -> valid.\n\n            # So we can do: \n            #   if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            #       r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n            # However, note: the dictionary `d` might have multiple ways to get the same sum? But we are storing the first time we get that sum? Actually, we want the maximum number of candies? But note: we are storing the prefix with the smallest index? Actually, we store the index (which is the count) for the prefix. And we want the maximum total candies? So if we have the same sum s, we want the prefix with the smallest count? Actually, no: we want the prefix that gives the sum s with the largest count? Actually, no: we are building the prefix from left to right, and we store the sum s at the first time we get that sum? Actually, no: we store the last time we get that sum? \n\n            # How do we build d?\n            #   for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n            #       s += i\n            #       if s > x: break\n            #       d[s] = idx+1\n            # So for a given s, we store the last index (the largest index) that gives that sum? Actually, no: we are overwriting. For example, if we have [1,2,3] and we get s=1 at index0, then s=3 at index1, then s=6 at index2. But if we break at s> x (if x=3, then we break at s=6). Then d[1]=1, d[3]=2, and then we break. But note: we break when s> x, so we don't store s=6.\n\n            # However, we want the prefix that gives the sum s with the smallest number of candies? Actually, no: we want to maximize the total candies. So if we have two ways to get the same sum s, we want the one with the larger prefix count? But note: we are traversing from left to right, and we store the last occurrence of the sum? Actually, we are storing the first time we get a sum? No, we are storing the last time we get a sum? \n\n            # Example: [1,0,1] -> \n            #   idx0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n            #   idx1: s=1 (because 1+0=1) -> then we overwrite d[1]=2? \n            #   Then when we see a suffix that sums to 1, we would use 2 (the last stored value) for the prefix. But that is better because 2 is more than 1? \n\n            # Actually, we want the prefix that gives the sum s with the largest number of candies? Because then the total candies (prefix_count + suffix_count) is maximized. So we should store the maximum index (i.e., the largest count) for a given sum? \n\n            # How can we do that? Currently, we are storing the last index that gives that sum. But if we have a prefix that gives the same sum with a larger count, then we want that. Actually, as we traverse, the index increases. So when we get the same sum again, we have a larger index? But note: the sum is increasing? Actually, the weights are positive? Yes, w_i>=1. So the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Therefore, we cannot have the same sum twice? \n\n            # Therefore, we don't have to worry about multiple indices for the same sum. The prefix sums are distinct? Because we are adding positive integers. So the same sum cannot appear twice.\n\n            # Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #   if s in d:\n            #       if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            #           r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n            # But note: the suffix we are building: we are starting from the right and going left. The suffix sum might also be increasing? But we are going from right to left, so the suffix sum is the sum of the last (idx+1) candies. And we are adding the next candy to the left? So the suffix sum is increasing? Actually, we are starting from the last candy and moving left, so we are adding the next candy to the left to the suffix. Therefore, the suffix sums are also increasing? \n\n            # However, we are iterating in the reverse order: \n            #   a[::-1] -> so the first element in the reversed list is the last candy, then the second last, etc.\n\n            # But note: the condition for non-overlap: we must have the prefix and suffix disjoint. However, we are building the suffix from the very end. The prefix we stored was built from the beginning. The condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary and sufficient? \n\n            # But wait: the entire array is of size n. The prefix uses d[s] candies and the suffix uses (idx+1) candies. The condition is that the two sets of indices are disjoint. The prefix uses indices [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix uses indices [n-1-idx, n-1]. The condition for disjointness is that d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n            #   The last index of the prefix is d[s]-1, and the first index of the suffix is n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx  => d[s] + idx < n.\n\n            # So we should check: if d[s] + idx < n? Then the total candies is d[s] + (idx+1) and we have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) = (d[s] + idx) + 1 <= n? Not necessarily: if d[s]+idx = n-1, then d[s]+(idx+1)=n, which is acceptable because the entire array is used? And the condition for disjointness: the last index of the prefix is d[s]-1, and the first index of the suffix is n-1-idx. \n            #   We have: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx  => d[s] + idx < n.\n            #   If d[s] + idx = n-1, then d[s]-1 = n-1-idx-1? Actually, let me plug: \n            #       d[s] + idx = n-1  => d[s] = n-1-idx.\n            #       Then the last index of the prefix is (n-1-idx)-1 = n-1-idx-1.\n            #       The first index of the suffix is n-1-idx.\n            #       So the prefix ends at n-1-idx-1 and the suffix starts at n-1-idx -> disjoint.\n\n            # Therefore, the condition is d[s] + idx < n? But note: the total candies eaten is d[s] + (idx+1). We can have that total up to n? Then we require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is equivalent to d[s] + idx < n? No: \n            #   d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  <=> d[s] + idx <= n-1.\n\n            # But the disjoint condition is d[s] + idx < n? \n            #   d[s] + idx < n  <=> d[s] + idx <= n-1.\n\n            # So they are the same? \n\n            # Therefore, we can check: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that is the same as d[s] + idx <= n-1? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can check: if d[s] <= n - (idx+1)   [because the prefix must not extend beyond the point where the suffix starts, which is at index n-(idx+1)].\n\n            # But note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is the same as d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\n            # So we can do:\n\n            #   if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            #       r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n            # However, note: the suffix we are building: the index in the reversed array is `idx`, which corresponds to the (idx+1)-th candy from the right.\n\n            # But wait: what if the suffix sum s is greater than x? Then we break in the prefix building? Actually, we break in the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x, but the suffix might also exceed x? However, we are only checking for s in d. And d only contains keys that are at most x. So if the suffix sum s is greater than x, then we won't find it in d? So we are safe.\n\n            # Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            #   if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            #       r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n            # But note: we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x (which is half the total). But the suffix might also exceed half the total? Then we skip because s (suffix) would be greater than x and not in d. So it's safe.\n\n            # However, what if the suffix sum is less than or equal to x, but the prefix that gives that sum is stored? Then we check the non-overlap condition.\n\n            # Also note: we must break the suffix loop if the suffix sum exceeds x? Actually, we don't have to, because we are only checking for s in d, and d only has keys <= x. But if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we can break? Because the suffix sum is increasing? And we are only interested in sums that are in d (which are <=x). So we can break when s > x? But note: the problem says the total of the entire array might be large, and we have many test cases. We want to break early.\n\n            # However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 200000. So we can break when s > x? \n\n            # But the provided code does not break in the suffix loop. We are allowed to break? We can add:\n\n            #   if s > x: break\n\n            # But note: the prefix building broke at s> x. Similarly, we can break the suffix loop when s> x? \n\n            # However, the problem does not require that. But to be efficient, we can break. But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the worst-case for the suffix loop is 200000 per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so we only have one test case? Actually, the note: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can break when s> x.\n\n            # But the problem does not require that. However, the provided code does not have a break. We are only to fill the missing part.\n\n            # The missing part is only the body of the if statement.\n\n            # Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            #   if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            #       r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n            # But note: the variable `r` is initialized to 0.

Actually, we might have a partition? \n            #   total=10, x=5.\n            #   prefix: \n            #       1 -> d[1]=1\n            #       3 -> d[3]=2\n            #       6 -> break (6>5)\n            #   suffix:\n            #       4 -> s=4 -> not in d? \n            #       4+3=7 -> not in d?\n            #       4+3+2=9 -> not in d?\n            #       4+3+2+1=10 -> break? \n            #   so r=0.\n\n            # But the example says: For the third test case, there is no way -> 0.\n\n            # Therefore, we are good.\n\n            # However, note: what if we have a partition that uses the entire array? \n            #   Example: [1,2,3,4] -> total=10, which is even? But 10/2=5. \n            #   Is there a prefix that sums to 5? \n            #       1, then 1+2=3, then 1+2+3=6 -> no. \n            #   Suffix: \n            #       4 -> 4, then 4+3=7, then 4+3+2=9, then 4+3+2+1=10 -> no 5.\n            #   So no.\n\n            # Therefore, the code for program1.py is complete.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are to complete the code that outputs the division for a given rating.\n\nThe provided code:\n   from bisect import bisect\n   b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n   for i in range(int(input())):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe note that the divisions:\n   Division 1: rating >= 1900\n   Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n   Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n   Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nThe list `b` has: [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n\nWe can use bisect to find the index. Note that the divisions are:\n\n   rating < 1400 -> division 4 -> index? \n        if rating < 1400, then it falls in the first interval? \n\n   We have the boundaries: \n        (-5001, 1400) -> division 4? \n        [1400, 1600) -> division 3? \n        [1600, 1900) -> division 2?\n        [1900, ...) -> division 1?\n\n   But note: the divisions are inclusive? \n        Division 4: rating <= 1399 -> so rating < 1400.\n        Division 3: 1400<=rating<=1599 -> so [1400, 1600) in half-open intervals? \n        Division 2: [1600, 1900) -> but note: 1899 is included, so [1600, 1900) is [1600, 1899.999...] -> which includes 1899? \n        Division 1: [1900, ...)\n\n   The list `b` has the boundaries: \n        b[0] = -5001 (a lower bound)\n        b[1] = 1400 -> then the interval [b[0], b[1]) -> division 4? \n        [b[1], b[2]) -> division 3?\n        [b[2], b[3]) -> division 2?\n        [b[3], ...) -> division 1?\n\n   But note: the divisions are defined as:\n        Division 4: rating <= 1399 -> so if we set the intervals as:\n            (-inf, 1400) -> division 4\n            [1400, 1600) -> division 3\n            [1600, 1900) -> division 2\n            [1900, inf) -> division 1\n\n   The bisect module: bisect_left returns the index at which we can insert the value to keep sorted. \n\n   We can do:\n        pos = bisect.bisect(b, rating) \n        But note: the function `bisect` returns the insertion position. \n\n        Example: \n            rating = -789 -> which is between -5001 and 1400 -> so it should go at index1? \n            Actually, the list b is sorted: [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n            bisect.bisect(b, -789) returns the index where -789 would be inserted to keep sorted -> that is after the first element? \n            Actually, bisect.bisect returns the insertion position to the right. \n            For -789: \n                it is greater than -5001 and less than 1400 -> so it would be inserted at index1? \n            Then we have 4 divisions? The index we get from bisect(b, rating) is in the range [0,4]? \n\n        How to map to division?\n            We want:\n                if rating < 1400 -> division 4 -> then if the index is 1? \n                if 1400<=rating<1600 -> division 3 -> index=2?\n                if 1600<=rating<1900 -> division 2 -> index=3?\n                if rating>=1900 -> division 1 -> index=4?\n\n            Then the division number = 4 - (index - 1) ? \n\n            Actually, we want:\n                index=1 -> division 4 -> 4 = 5 - index? \n                index=2 -> division 3 -> 3 = 5-2? -> 5-2=3 -> yes.\n                index=3 -> division 2 -> 5-3=2 -> yes.\n                index=4 -> division 1 -> 5-4=1 -> yes.\n\n            So division = 5 - index? \n\n            But wait: \n                rating=-789 -> index=1 -> division=5-1=4 -> correct.\n                rating=1400 -> bisect.bisect(b,1400) returns the index where 1400 would be inserted? \n                    The list b: [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n                    bisect.bisect(b,1400) returns the index after the first occurrence of 1400? -> 2? \n                Then division=5-2=3 -> correct.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                idx = bisect.bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx   # but 5? because we have 4 divisions and the index goes from 1 to 4? \n\n            However, note: the list b has 4 elements, so the possible indices from bisect.bisect are from 0 to 4? \n                rating < -5001 -> index=0 -> division=5-0=5 -> that's not in [1,4]. \n\n            But the rating is at least -5000? and our lower bound is -5001, so the smallest rating is -5000, which is greater than -5001 -> so index=1? \n\n            Therefore, we are safe.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                divisions = {0:4, 1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1}\n                # But note: \n                #   rating < -5001 -> index0 -> division4? but that rating is not possible? \n\n            Since the problem says rating>=-5000, and our b[0] is -5001, then the smallest rating is -5000, which is greater than -5001 -> so the index will be at least 1.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                idx = bisect.bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx   # because the index can be 1,2,3,4 -> then division=4,3,2,1.\n\n            Then we output \"Division \" + str(division)\n\n            But note: the example test cases:\n\n                -789: index = bisect.bisect(b, -789) -> 1 -> division=4 -> \"Division 4\"\n                1299: index=1 -> division=4\n                1300: index=1 -> division=4\n                1399: index=1 -> division=4\n                1400: index=2 -> division=3 -> \"Division 3\"\n                1679: index=3 -> division=2 -> \"Division 2\"\n                2300: index=4 -> division=1 -> \"Division 1\"\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n                from bisect import bisect\n                b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n                for i in range(int(input())):\n                    rating = int(input().strip())\n                    idx = bisect.bisect(b, rating)\n                    division = 5 - idx\n                    print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The missing block is the body of the for loop.\n\n            We are to output the missing code for program2.py.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                idx = bisect.bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx\n                print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n            However, note: the problem says the input for each test case is one integer per line.\n\n            We read the rating for the test case.\n\n            But note: the problem says the first line is t, then t lines each with one integer.\n\n            The for loop is: for i in range(int(input())): so we are iterating t times.\n\n            Then we read one integer per test case.\n\n            Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n            But note: we must import bisect? The code already imported: \"from bisect import bisect\"\n\n            So we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the function `bisect.bisect` is the same as `bisect`? Because we imported `bisect` from the module. Actually, we did: \"from bisect import bisect\", so we have the function `bisect` in the current namespace.\n\n            So we can call `bisect(b, rating)`.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                idx = bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx\n                print(\"Division\", division)   # But the problem says: output in the format \"Division X\"\n\n            We can use:\n\n                print(\"Division \" + str(division))\n\n            or \n\n                print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n            Both are acceptable.\n\n            We'll use: \n\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                idx = bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx\n                print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says the input has one integer per test case. We read with input().strip().\n\n            However, the input might be just one integer per line. So we can do:\n\n                rating = int(input())\n\n            But the problem says: \"The description of each test consists of one line containing one integer\"\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                rating = int(input())\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                rating = int(input())\n                idx = bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx\n                print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says the total test cases t is at most 10000, so this is efficient.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                rating = int(input())\n                idx = bisect(b, rating)\n                division = 5 - idx\n                print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\nNow, we output the result in the required JSON format.\n\nThe JSON structure: \n   {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nFor program1, the completion is the missing block of code? But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". For program1, the missing block is the body of the if statement. We write:\n\n   if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: we must be careful with the indentation. The existing code has:\n\n   for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the code. So the code we write must be indented appropriately.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo for program1, we output:\n\n   if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing if condition is already written: \"if s in d:\". So we are to write the inner block? Actually, the TODO is at the end of the if condition. So we are to write the body of the if.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut wait, the existing code has:\n\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the entire line? Actually, no. The TODO is only for the body. So we write the body as:\n\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing if condition is \"if s in d:\". We are to write the next lines that are the body of that if.\n\nSo the code we write for program1 is:\n\n    if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the indentation level: it should be one level deeper than the for loop. The existing for loop is:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: \n            ...   # we write the body here\n\nSo the body we write must be indented by 8 spaces? Actually, we don't know the exact indentation, but we assume 4 spaces per level. The if is at one level (inside the for loop, which is 4 spaces). Then the body of the if should be 8 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, we write the code as it would appear in the program.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without specifying the exact indentation? But the problem says \"Output the missing code\". We output the code that should be placed at the TODO.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output:\n\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable `r` is defined. And `d` is defined. And `s` is defined. And `idx` is defined.\n\nFor program2, we output:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\nBut note: the entire for loop body? The problem says the missing block for the for loop. The existing code has:\n\n    for i in range(int(input())): # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we are to write the entire body of the for loop.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\nBut note: the indentation: the for loop body should be indented.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print(f\"Division {division}\")\n\nBut with 4 spaces of indentation.\n\nNow, we format the JSON.\n\nWe must escape the newlines and quotes? Actually, we can write:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(f\\\"Division {division}\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has double quotes inside? We use f-strings with double quotes. We can escape the double quotes in the JSON string.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes for the JSON keys and values? The problem does not specify. But the example uses curly quotes? Actually, the example: \u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d -> but that's not valid JSON. Valid JSON uses double quotes.\n\nSo we do:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(f\\\"Division {division}\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut the program2 string has a double quote inside. We must escape the double quotes in the JSON string.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(f\\\"Division {division}\\\")\"\n\nbecomes:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(f\\\"Division {division}\\\")\"\n\nBut we can also use:\n\n    print('Division', division)\n\nto avoid the double quotes? But the problem says the format \"Division X\", and using print with two arguments would output \"Division X\" with a space? That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nBut that outputs: \"Division 1\" -> which is the same as \"Division 1\".\n\nBut the problem says: \"output a single line containing the correct division in the format 'Division X'\"\n\nSo both are acceptable.\n\nTo avoid escaping, we can do:\n\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nThen the string for program2 becomes:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(\\\"Division\\\", division)\"\n\nBut note: the existing code uses f-strings? But we are free to change the print statement? The problem only requires the output to be in the format \"Division X\".\n\nTherefore, we do:\n\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nThen we don't have to escape.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n    print(\"Division \" + str(division))\n\nBut that also works.\n\nWe choose:\n\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nSo the program2 code:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nNow, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(\\\"Division\\\", division)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code has double quotes inside the string. We must escape them in the JSON string? \n\nActually, in JSON, we must escape double quotes with a backslash. But the entire value is in double quotes. So we do:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(\\\"Division\\\", division)\"\n\nBut wait, the string for program2 is:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print(\"Division\", division)\n\nIn JSON, we represent this as:\n\n    \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print(\\\"Division\\\", division)\"\n\nBut we can also use single quotes for the inner string? But in Python, we can use either. However, the problem does not specify.\n\nBut to be safe, we use the same as the example: the example used double quotes for the JSON keys and values.\n\nTherefore, we escape the double quotes in the print statement.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the print statement:\n\n    print('Division', division)\n\nThen we don't need to escape.\n\nSo we do:\n\n    print('Division', division)\n\nThen the JSON string for program2:\n\n    \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print('Division', division)\"\n\nThis is safe.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print('Division', division)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code: we have two lines. The first line is an if condition and the second is an assignment. The indentation: the if condition is at 8 spaces (relative to the for loop) and the assignment is at 12 spaces? \n\nWe write the string with the exact indentation as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut the existing program1 code has:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nSo the entire block for the if body is:\n\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing if condition is already at 8 spaces. Then the body we write must be at 8 spaces (for the outer if body) and then 12 spaces for the inner if body? Actually, the existing if condition is:\n\n        if s in d:\n\nWe are to write the body of that if. So we write:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut wait, that would be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut we can combine:\n\n        if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut the problem does not require that. We can do either.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The missing block is the body of the if. We can write:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nor\n\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n else None   # but that is not very readable.\n\nWe'll do the two-line version.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing if condition is at 8 spaces. The body we write must be at 12 and 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we assume 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the entire program1 completion string is:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut wait, the existing code has:\n\n        if s in d:   # at 8 spaces\n\nThen the body we write must be at 12 spaces? \n\nSo we write:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:   # at 12 spaces\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))   # at 16 spaces\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". We output the code that should be placed at the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable names are the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can write in one line without an if? \n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n: r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut that is less readable.\n\nWe'll do the two-line version.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print('Division', division)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code: the for loop body should be indented by 4 spaces? The existing for loop is:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())): # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we write the body with 4 spaces? Actually, the existing code has no indentation for the for loop body. We are to write the body with 4 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, we write:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print('Division', division)\n\nwith each line indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\nBut the for loop is at the top level? So the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the program2 completion string is:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print('Division', division)\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\nb = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n\nand then the for loop. So the for loop body is at the same level as the assignment to b? No, the for loop is at the top level, so the body must be indented.\n\nTherefore, we write the body with 4 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". We output the code that should be placed at the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    rating = int(input())\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\n    division = 5 - idx\n    print('Division', division)\n\nBut note: the entire block for the for loop body? Yes.\n\nNow, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"    rating = int(input())\\n    idx = bisect(b, rating)\\n    division = 5 - idx\\n    print('Division', division)\"\n}\n\nWe output this JSON."
