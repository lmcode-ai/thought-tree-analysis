In the simulation, we did:\n\n                    time2: inject child2 -> child2 is infected at the end of time2. time3: spread to child3 -> child3 infected at the end of time3. time4: spread to child4 -> child4 infected at the end of time4.\n                    time5: spread to child5 -> child5 infected at the end of time5.

For each child u of v:\n                  Let t = dfs(u)   # the time (from the moment v is infected) to finish the subtree of u? Then we store t.\n\n              Then we sort the list of delays in descending order. Then we set:\n                  ans = 0\n                  for i in range(len(delays)):\n                      ans = max(ans, delays[i] + i + 1)   # because we can only spread one child per time step? Then return ans\n\n          But wait, we also have the possibility to inject? Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Infected Tree\" (which is a binary tree) is:\n\n            def dfs(v):\n                if not children[v]:\n                    return 0\n                delays = []\n                for u in children[v]:\n                    delays.append(dfs(u))\n                delays.sort(reverse=True)\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(len(delays)):\n                    ans = max(ans, delays[i] + i + 1)\n                return ans\n\n          Then the answer for the whole tree is dfs(1) + 1?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given a sorted list of prices. We have computed the prefix sum of the sorted list.\nThe idea is that for a query (x, y): \n  The customer must purchase at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase), \n  the customer would choose the x items that include the y cheapest items as free. However, note that the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased x items.\n  Therefore, the customer would want to have as many expensive items as possible (so that the free items are the cheapest ones) and then the rest should be the cheapest ones that are free.\n\nBut note: the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So the customer would want to avoid having very expensive items in the free set.\nThe optimal strategy is to buy the (n - x + y) most expensive items? Actually, we can think:\n\n  We are going to choose x items. The free ones are the y cheapest of these x. Therefore, the free set will be the smallest y numbers in the chosen set.\n\n  To maximize the free value, we want the free set to be as large as possible (but fixed by y) and as expensive as possible. However, note that the free set must be the cheapest in the purchase.\n\n  Therefore, we can choose the set such that the free set is the y largest among the cheap items that we are forced to include? Actually, we can avoid including some very cheap items by including more expensive ones? \n\n  Alternate approach: \n  We note that the free set must be a contiguous set of y items in the sorted order? Not necessarily, but we can rearrange: the customer can choose any x items. The free set is the y smallest in that set. Therefore, the free set must be a set of y items that are the smallest in the purchase. To maximize the free value, we want these y items to be as large as possible.\n\n  How? We can choose the set to be the (x - y) most expensive items and then the next y cheapest? But note: the next y cheapest after the (x-y) most expensive are actually the next in increasing order? \n\n  Actually, we can split the array into two parts:\n    The free set: we want the largest y items that can be the cheapest in the purchase. The largest y items that can be the cheapest are the y largest items that are not in the (x-y) most expensive? \n\n  Alternatively, we can think: \n    We sort the list in increasing order. Then the free set must be a contiguous segment? Actually, no: but note that if we choose non contiguous items, we can always choose a contiguous segment that is at least as good? \n\n  However, note: the free set is the y smallest in the purchase. Therefore, the free set must be the y smallest in the entire set of x items. To maximize the free set, we want the y smallest in the purchase to be as large as possible. How? We can avoid including the very small items by including more expensive ones? \n\n  Actually, we can leave out the smallest (n - x) items? Why? Because we are going to choose x items. The free set will be the y smallest of the chosen x. To maximize the free set, we want to avoid having the very small items in the purchase. Therefore, we can choose the largest x items. Then the free set would be the smallest y of these largest x items. \n\n  But note: the largest x items are the last x items in the sorted array (if sorted in increasing order). The smallest y of these are the first y of these last x. \n\n  Therefore, the free value is the sum of the items from index (n - x) to (n - x + y - 1) in the sorted array? \n\n  However, note: the array is sorted in increasing order. So the largest x items are at indices [n-x, n-1]. The smallest y of these are the first y in this segment: indices [n-x, n-x+y-1].\n\n  But wait: the example in the note: \n      Input: [5,3,1,5,2] -> sorted: [1,2,3,5,5]\n      Query: x=3, y=2 -> free value = 3+5 = 8? \n      According to our reasoning: \n          n=5, x=3, y=2 -> segment: [5-3=2, 2+2-1=3] -> indices 2 and 3: [3,5] -> sum=8 -> matches.\n\n  Another: x=2, y=1 -> segment: [5-2=3, 3+1-1=3] -> index 3: 5 -> matches.\n\n  Another: x=5, y=3 -> segment: [5-5=0, 0+3-1=2] -> [1,2,3] -> sum=6 -> matches.\n\n  So the plan: \n      Precompute the prefix sum of the sorted list (in increasing order).\n      For a query (x,y):\n          The free set is the segment from index (n-x) to (n-x+y-1). \n          The sum = prefix[n-x+y-1] - (prefix[n-x-1] if n-x-1>=0 else 0)\n\n  However, note the current code:\n\n      l.sort()   # sorts in increasing order\n      for i in range(1,n):\n          l[i] += l[i-1]   # now l is the prefix sum\n\n      Then for a query:\n          actual = n-x+y-1   # this is the last index of the free set: index = n-x+y-1\n          val = l[actual]   # but then we subtract the part before n-x?\n\n      The code currently does:\n          actual = n-x+y-1\n          val = l[actual]\n          if n-x > 0:\n              # TODO: subtract the prefix sum up to n-x-1?\n\n      Actually, we want the sum from index (n-x) to (n-x+y-1) = l[n-x+y-1] - l[n-x-1] (if n-x-1 is at least 0). But if n-x==0, then we don't subtract.\n\n      However, note: the prefix sum array l is 0-indexed. The segment [n-x, n-x+y-1] is contiguous.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n          start_index = n - x\n          end_index = n - x + y - 1\n          total = l[end_index] - (l[start_index-1] if start_index-1>=0 else 0)\n\n      But in the current code, we have:\n          actual = n-x+y-1   -> this is the end_index.\n          Then we set val = l[actual]\n\n      Then if n-x > 0: we subtract l[n-x-1]? \n          Because the segment we want is from index (n-x) to (actual), so we subtract the prefix up to n-x-1.\n\n      However, note: if n-x==0, then we don't subtract. So:\n\n          if n-x == 0:\n              val = l[actual]   # which is l[y-1] because n-x=0 -> actual = y-1\n          else:\n              val = l[actual] - l[n-x-1]\n\n      But wait: the prefix sum at index i includes all from 0 to i. So to get the sum from n-x to actual, we subtract the prefix at n-x-1.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code in the TODO is:\n\n          val = l[actual] - l[n-x-1]\n\n      However, note: what if n-x==0? Then we skip the if block and use val = l[actual] which is correct.\n\n      But the condition is: if n-x > 0 -> then we subtract l[n-x-1]. But note: if n-x==0, then we don't enter the if block and we don't subtract. That is correct.\n\n      However, what if n-x==0? Then we are taking the segment from index0 to actual. We don't subtract anything.\n\n      But what if n-x==1? Then we subtract l[0] to get the segment from index1 to actual.\n\n      Therefore, we can write:\n\n          if n-x > 0:\n              val -= l[n-x-1]\n\n      But note: the variable 'actual' is set to n-x+y-1, which might be beyond the array? \n          Constraints: y<=x, and x<=n, so n-x+y-1 <= n-1? \n          Because: n-x+y-1 <= n-x+x-1 = n-1 -> so it's safe.\n\n      Also, n-x>=0 because x<=n.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n      val -= l[n-x-1]\n\n  However, note: the array l is the prefix sum. The index n-x-1 must be valid when n-x>0. Since n-x>0, then n-x-1>=0.\n\n  But what if n-x==0? Then we don't subtract. Correct.\n\n  Let me test with the example: n=5, x=3, y=2 -> \n      n-x = 2, so we subtract l[1] (because n-x-1 = 1).\n      l = [1, 3, 6, 11, 16]   (for [1,2,3,5,5])\n      actual = 5-3+2-1 = 3 -> l[3]=11\n      subtract l[1] = 3 -> 11-3 = 8 -> correct.\n\n  Another: x=2, y=1 -> \n      n-x=3, subtract l[2] (n-x-1=2) -> actual = 5-2+1-1=3 -> l[3]=11, subtract l[2]=6 -> 5 -> correct.\n\n  Another: x=5, y=3 -> \n      n-x=0 -> no subtraction: actual = 5-5+3-1=2 -> l[2]=6 -> correct.\n\n  So the missing line for program1.py is: \n      val -= l[n-x-1]\n\n  But note: the condition is \"if n-x > 0\", so we do that only when n-x>0.\n\n  Therefore, in program1.py, the missing code is a single line: \n      val -= l[n-x-1]\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given multiple test cases. The input format:\n      t = number of test cases\n      for each test case:\n          n\n          list of n-1 integers: the parent of vertex 2, vertex 3, ... vertex n.\n\n  We are to compute the minimal number of seconds to infect the whole tree.\n\n  The process:\n      Initially: all healthy.\n      Each second:\n          Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can choose at most one additional child to infect (if available) -> meaning we can infect one more child of v in this spreading phase.\n          Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\n  We start at second 0? Actually, the problem says \"each second\" we do two operations: first spreading then injection.\n\n  We note:\n      The root is vertex 1. We can start by infecting the root by injection at second 0? But note: initially all are healthy. Then at second 1:\n          Injection: we can choose the root? Then at the spreading phase: the root has children? But the root is infected in the injection phase of the first second? Then in the spreading phase of the first second, we can spread to one child of the root? Then at the next second (second 2) we can do another injection and then spreading?\n\n  However, the problem says: \"each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation\". So the first second (second 1) we do:\n      Spreading: nothing because no child of any vertex is infected at the start of the second? Then injection: we can infect the root.\n\n  Then at the end of second 1, only the root is infected.\n\n  Then second 2:\n      Spreading: the root has at least one child infected? Actually, no. So we can't spread from the root? Then we do injection: we can infect one more vertex (say a child of the root).\n\n  Then at the end of second 2: two vertices infected.\n\n  Then second 3:\n      Spreading: the root has one child infected -> we can spread to one more child of the root? (if exists) -> so we infect another child of the root? Then injection: we can infect a third vertex.\n\n  But note: we can choose which child to spread and which to inject.\n\n  Alternate approach: we can model the infection as a BFS? \n\n  Insight: \n      We can use a greedy strategy. The infection starts at the root? Actually, we can start anywhere by injection? But note: the root is vertex 1. However, the problem does not require starting at the root? But the tree is rooted at 1. \n\n      However, the problem says: we can choose any healthy vertex in the injection step. But the root is vertex 1. We are free to choose any vertex for injection? \n\n      But note: the spreading operation requires that the parent has at least one child infected? Actually, the problem says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected\" then we can spread to at most one other child. \n\n      How to minimize the time? \n\n  We note that the infection spreads from the root? Actually, we can start by infecting the root in the first injection. Then the root is infected. Then we can spread to one child of the root in the next spreading phase? But wait: the spreading phase in the same second? Actually, the first second (second 1) we do:\n      Spreading: nothing (because at the beginning of second 1, no vertex is infected) -> then injection: we infect the root.\n\n  Then at second 2:\n      Spreading: the root has no child infected at the beginning of second 2? (because we just infected the root at the end of second 1) -> so we cannot spread? Then we do injection: we can infect a child of the root.\n\n  Then at second 3:\n      Spreading: the root has one child infected -> we can spread to one more child of the root? Then we do that. Then injection: we can infect a third vertex (which might be a child of the root or a child of the already infected child?).\n\n  However, note: the spreading operation happens for every vertex v that has at least one child infected. So if we have a vertex v with multiple children, we can spread to one additional child per second (if we have at least one child already infected at the beginning of the second).\n\n  We can model the problem as:\n\n      Let the root be infected at time 1 (by injection at second 1).\n\n      Then we have a set of uninfected children of the root. We can infect one by injection at second 2. Then at second 3, we can use spreading to infect one more child of the root? But note: at the beginning of second 3, the root has one child infected (from second 2) so we can spread to one more child of the root. Then we can also do an injection at second 3 to infect a child of the child we infected at second 2? \n\n      However, we are free to choose the order.\n\n  Alternate known solution for similar problems (like Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) problem D) is:\n\n      We note that the root is infected at time 1.\n\n      Then we consider the children of the root. Let the root have k children. Then we can represent the infection of the children as a sequence of operations.\n\n      The infection of the children of the root can be done in two ways: by injection or by spreading. But note: for a child to be infected by spreading, the parent (the root) must have at least one child already infected. \n\n      We can think: \n          We start by infecting one child by injection at time 2. Then at time 3, we can use spreading to infect one more child? But then we can also inject a third child? \n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          Time 1: infect root (injection)\n          Time 2: inject child1 -> now root has one child infected.\n          Time 3: spreading from root: infect child2 -> now root has two children infected. Then we can inject child3? \n          Time 4: spreading from root: infect child4 -> then inject child5? \n\n      But note: we can also choose to inject a child that is not a direct child of the root? \n\n      However, the problem: we are free to choose the injection target. We want to minimize the total time.\n\n      Known solution:\n\n          Step 1: Build the tree and compute the children for each node.\n\n          Step 2: We note that the root is infected at time 1. Then we consider the children of the root. Let the root have k children. Then we can represent the infection of the children as a list of delays.\n\n          Actually, we can use a DFS to compute the time when each node becomes infected? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n          Let f(v) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree rooted at v, given that v is infected at time 0? But note the process: we start with nothing.\n\n      However, note the problem: the entire tree must be infected. We are allowed to choose the order of injections and the spreading choices.\n\n      Known similar problem: \"Infected Tree\" (but that was a binary tree). \n\n      Insight from known solutions for this problem (from Codeforces):\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let deg(v) be the number of children of v.\n\n            We can use a DFS that returns the time when the entire subtree is infected.\n\n            But note: the problem states that the total n over test cases is 200000.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            We build the tree from the parent array.\n\n            We note that the root is infected at time 0? Actually, we start at time 0? The problem says \"each second\", so the first second is second 1.\n\n          Actually, we can simulate:\n\n            We start at time 0: no infection.\n\n            At time 1: we inject the root -> root infected.\n\n            Then for each child of the root, we can choose to either inject it or wait for spreading. But note: spreading can only happen if the parent has at least one child infected.\n\n          We can use a state: for a node, we know the time when it becomes infected. Then we can schedule the infection of its children.\n\n          However, the problem is asking for the minimal total seconds to infect the whole tree.\n\n          Known solution (from a known contest):\n\n            We do:\n\n              Let a = [] # for the root: we will store the delays for each child's subtree.\n\n              For each child u of v:\n                  Let t = dfs(u)   # the time (from the moment v is infected) to finish the subtree of u? \n                  Then we store t.\n\n              Then we sort the list of delays in descending order.\n\n              Then we set:\n                  ans = 0\n                  for i in range(len(delays)):\n                      ans = max(ans, delays[i] + i + 1)   # because we can only spread one child per time step? \n\n              Then return ans\n\n          But wait, we also have the possibility to inject? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Infected Tree\" (which is a binary tree) is:\n\n            def dfs(v):\n                if not children[v]:\n                    return 0\n                delays = []\n                for u in children[v]:\n                    delays.append(dfs(u))\n                delays.sort(reverse=True)\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(len(delays)):\n                    ans = max(ans, delays[i] + i + 1)\n                return ans\n\n          Then the answer for the whole tree is dfs(1) + 1? (because the root is infected at time 1, and then we start the process for the children)\n\n          However, in this problem the tree is not binary. And the problem statement is similar.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v\". This means that per second, we can spread to one child per vertex that has at least one child infected. \n\n          How does it work for a node v with k children?\n\n            We can start by infecting one child by injection? Then the next second we can spread to one more child? Then the next second we can spread to one more? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let the children be c1, c2, ..., ck.\n\n            We can choose an order to infect the children. We want to minimize the total time.\n\n            We can inject one child at a time? But we are allowed one injection per second and one spreading per vertex that has at least one infected child.\n\n            However, note: the spreading operation happens for every vertex independently. So for the root, once we have at least one child infected, we can spread to one child per second.\n\n            But we can also inject a child at the same second? \n\n            The process for the root's children:\n\n              Second 1: root is infected (by injection at second 1).\n\n              Second 2: \n                  Spreading: not applicable (because at the start of second 2, no child of root is infected) -> skip.\n                  Injection: we inject one child, say c1.\n\n              Second 3:\n                  Spreading: the root has one child infected -> we can spread to one more child, say c2.\n                  Injection: we can inject a child of c1? or a child of c2? or c3? \n\n            But note: we are free to choose. We want to minimize the total time.\n\n            We can also consider: we can use the injection to infect a child of the root? But we have k children. We can use the spreading to cover the remaining children? \n\n            How many injections do we need for the children of the root? \n                We must inject at least one child. Then the rest can be spread? But note: the spreading requires that we have at least one child infected. So we can only spread to k-1 children? \n\n            However, we can also use injections for other branches? \n\n            Actually, the infection of the entire tree requires that we infect every node. The root is done. Then we have k children. We can do:\n\n                Inject one child (say c1) at time 2.\n                Then at time 3: we can spread to c2 (from the root) and also inject a child of c1? \n\n            But note: the spreading operation for the root happens at the same time for all vertices: we can only spread to one child per vertex per second. So at time 3, we can spread from the root to one child (c2) and we can also spread from c1 to one of its children? But wait: at the start of time 3, only c1 is infected (and the root). So for c1: it has not had any child infected? So we cannot spread from c1? \n\n            Therefore, at time 3, we can only spread from the root to c2. Then we can inject a child of c1? \n\n            Then at time 4: \n                Spreading: \n                    The root: has two children infected (c1 and c2) -> we can spread to c3? \n                    c1: has one child infected (by injection at time 3) -> we can spread to one more child of c1? \n                Injection: we can inject a child of c2? \n\n            This becomes complex.\n\n          Known solution from a known contest (Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2), problem D) that matches the problem statement:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))\n                deg = [0] * (n+1)\n                for i in range(2, n+1):\n                    deg[p[i]] += 1\n\n                # The root has deg[1] children, but note: the root is vertex 1.\n                # We start by having the root infected at time 0? Actually, we count the time from 0.\n\n                # We will create a list of the number of children for each node, but we also note that the root is initially infected? \n                # We are going to simulate the infection.\n\n                # We note that the spreading operation: for a node, once it has one child infected, then we can spread to one child per second.\n\n                # But we also have injections.\n\n                # The known solution:\n\n                #   Let f be an array of the degrees (children count) for each node, but we also include the root? \n                #   We start by having the root infected. Then we consider that for each node, we have to \"deal with\" its children.\n\n                #   We start with an initial set: the root is infected. Then we have to account for the children of the root.\n\n                #   We can represent the problem as: we have a multiset of the degrees of the nodes? \n\n                #   Steps:\n\n                #       We start with 1 infected node (the root) and we have a list of the children counts for the infected nodes? \n\n                #       Actually, we start with the root infected. Then we have a list: [deg(1)]? \n\n                #       Then we do:\n\n                #         time = 0\n                #         heap = [-deg(1)]   # we use a max-heap (by negative) for the number of children of infected nodes that are not yet handled? \n\n                #         Then we simulate:\n\n                #           We do:\n                #             time += 1\n                #             We take the largest element from the heap (the one with the most unhandled children) and we reduce it by 1? \n\n                #         But also, we can do injections? \n\n                #   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                #       We start by infecting the root at time 0? Then we have a list of the children counts for each node that is infected? Initially, only the root: [deg(1)].\n\n                #       Then at each second, we do:\n\n                #         Spreading: for each infected node that has at least one uninfected child, we can reduce the number of uninfected children by one? But note: we can only spread one per node per second? \n\n                #         But the problem: the spreading operation: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can spread to at most one other child. \n\n                #         Actually, the spreading operation is: we can choose one child per such vertex to spread. So we can reduce the uninfected children count of each infected node that has at least one uninfected child? \n\n                #         However, note: the condition is \"at least one child is infected\" -> but at the beginning of the second, we have some infected children? \n\n                #         Actually, we are in the middle of the process: we have infected nodes and uninfected nodes. For an infected node, if it has at least one child that is infected (from previous steps) then we can spread to one more child? \n\n                #         But note: the problem does not require that the child that is spread is adjacent to an infected child? It just says \"a child\". \n\n                #         Therefore, we can model: for each infected node, we have a count of uninfected children. Then in the spreading phase, we can reduce the count of uninfected children for one node? Actually, we can reduce one uninfected child per infected node that has at least one infected child? \n\n                #         But note: the condition is \"at least one child is infected\" -> meaning that the node must have at least one child that is already infected. So if a node has no child infected yet, we cannot spread from it? \n\n                #         How do we account for the initial state? \n\n                #       We can use a greedy: we start with the root infected. Then we have a list of the uninfected children counts for each infected node. Initially, the root has deg(1) uninfected children.\n\n                #       Then at time 1:\n\n                #         Spreading: we cannot spread because at the start of time 1, no child of the root is infected? \n                #         Injection: we can choose to inject one node. We choose to inject a child of the root? Then we reduce the uninfected children count of the root by 1, and we add the new node (which has deg(new) uninfected children) to the list.\n\n                #       Then at time 2:\n\n                #         Spreading: the root has one child infected -> we can spread to one more child of the root? So we reduce the uninfected children count of the root by 1? \n                #         Injection: we can inject one more node? \n\n                #       We can simulate with a priority queue: we want to spread from the node that has the most uninfected children? \n\n                #       Algorithm:\n\n                #         Let time = 1   (because we start at second 1: we will inject the root at time0? or not? Let's reframe)\n\n                #         Actually, we start at time0: no infection.\n\n                #         We will maintain a max-heap (priority queue) of the uninfected children counts for each infected node? But note: we also have the possibility to inject.\n\n                #         Step 0: \n                #             We start by infecting the root by injection at time1. So at the end of time1, the root is infected.\n                #             Then we have a list: [deg(1)] for the root.\n\n                #         Then we have a variable `injections` = 0? \n\n                #         Actually, we can do:\n\n                #             Let q = a max-heap (we use negative for min-heap in Python) for the uninfected children counts of infected nodes? \n                #             Initially, we have the root: so we push deg(1) (if deg(1)>0) -> but note: the root might have no children.\n\n                #             Then we set time = 1, and we have infected = 1 (the root).\n\n                #             Then while infected < n:\n\n                #                 time += 1\n                #                 # Spreading phase: we can choose one infected node that has at least one uninfected child and spread to one child? \n                #                 # But note: we can do for every infected node that has at least one infected child? Actually, the problem says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\". \n                #                 # This means that we can spread from multiple nodes in one second? \n\n                #                 However, note: the problem says \"for each vertex v\", meaning independently. So we can spread from every infected node that has at least one child already infected and that still has uninfected children? \n\n                #                 But wait: the problem says \"you can spread\", meaning it is optional and we can choose at most one. So we can choose to spread from any subset of such nodes? \n\n                #                 How to maximize the progress? We would want to spread from the node that has the most uninfected children? \n\n                #                 Actually, we can do:\n\n                #                   In the spreading phase, we can reduce the uninfected children count of the top k nodes? \n\n                #                 But note: we are allowed to spread at most one per node. So we can reduce the uninfected children count of every infected node that has uninfected children? \n\n                #                 However, the condition: the node must have at least one child infected. How do we know which nodes have at least one child infected? \n\n                #                 We can maintain: for each infected node, we have a count of uninfected children and a count of infected children? \n\n                #                 Alternatively, we can note: initially, no node has any child infected. Then when we inject a child of the root, then the root gets one infected child. Then in the next spreading phase, we can spread from the root to one more child? \n\n                #                 But then the root now has two infected children. Then we can spread from the root again in the next spreading phase? \n\n                #                 Therefore, the condition is always satisfied for any infected node that has at least one infected child? And once a node has at least one infected child, it can spread one child per second until all are infected? \n\n                #                 So the spreading phase: we can reduce the uninfected children count of any infected node that has uninfected children? But note: the condition is automatically satisfied if the node has at least one infected child. And initially, we start by injecting one child of the root -> then the root has one infected child -> then we can spread from the root.\n\n                #                 However, for a node that has not been spread or injected any child, we cannot spread from it until we inject one of its children? \n\n                #                 Therefore, the process for a node v:\n\n                #                   To be able to spread from v, we must have infected at least one child of v (by injection or by spreading from v in a previous second) -> then we can spread one per second.\n\n                #                 How to simulate? \n\n                #                   We maintain a max-heap (priority queue) of the uninfected children counts for infected nodes that have at least one child infected? But note: once we inject one child of v, then v becomes eligible for spreading. \n\n                #                 Alternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\n                #                   We note that the only bottleneck is the initial injection to start the spreading in a branch.\n\n                #                   Let f be the number of nodes that require an initial injection? \n\n                #                   Specifically, for the root: we need to inject one child to start the spreading? Then the rest of the children can be spread? \n\n                #                   For a child node that becomes infected (by injection or spreading), then its parent becomes eligible to spread? \n\n                #                 Known solution from a known contest (Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) D) that matches the input format and constraints:\n\n            #             #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            #             using namespace std;\n            #             int main() {\n            #                 ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n            #                 cin.tie(nullptr);\n            #                 int t;\n            #                 cin >> t;\n            #                 while (t--) {\n            #                     int n;\n            #                     cin >> n;\n            #                     vector<int> p(n), deg(n);\n            #                     for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            #                         cin >> p[i];\n            #                         p[i]--;\n            #                         deg[p[i]]++;\n            #                     }\n            #                     deg.push_back(1); // the root\n            #                     sort(deg.rbegin(), deg.rend());\n            #                     while (!deg.empty() && deg.back() == 0) {\n            #                         deg.pop_back();\n            #                     }\n            #                     int ans = deg.size();\n            #                     for (int i = 0; i < deg.size(); i++) {\n            #                         deg[i] = max(deg[i] - (ans - i), 0);\n            #                     }\n            #                     priority_queue<int> q;\n            #                     for (int x : deg) {\n            #                         if (x > 0) {\n            #                             q.push(x);\n            #                         }\n            #                     }\n            #                     int add = 0;\n            #                     while (!q.empty() && q.top() > add) {\n            #                         add++;\n            #                         int x = q.top();\n            #                         q.pop();\n            #                         q.push(x - 1);\n            #                     }\n            #                     ans += add;\n            #                     cout << ans << \"\\n\";\n            #                 }\n            #             }\n\n          But note: the input format in the C++ code: \n              The first integer after t is n, then n-1 integers for p2 to pn.\n\n          In the C++ code:\n\n            deg is initialized to size n (all zeros). Then for i from 1 to n-1:\n                cin >> p[i]   -> then p[i] is the parent of i+1? \n                then deg[p[i]]++   -> but note: p[i] is 1-indexed? The C++ code does p[i]-- -> so it becomes 0-indexed.\n\n            Then they push back 1 for the root? Actually, the root (index0) is not counted in the deg array? \n\n            Then they sort deg in descending order and remove zeros.\n\n            Then ans = deg.size()   -> this is the number of nodes that have at least one child? \n\n            Then they do: \n                for i in range(len(deg)):\n                    deg[i] = max(deg[i] - (ans - i), 0)\n\n            Then they put the positive ones in a priority queue (max-heap).\n\n            Then they do:\n                add = 0\n                while not q.empty() and q.top() > add:\n                    add++\n                    x = q.top(); q.pop()\n                    q.push(x-1)\n\n            Then total = ans + add.\n\n          How does it work?\n\n            The variable 'ans' is set to the number of nodes that have at least one child? Actually, the root is included? \n\n            But note: the root might not be in the deg array initially? They did: deg.push_back(1) for the root? \n\n            Actually, the root is vertex0, and they did not count the root's parent? So they manually add the root: deg.push_back(1) -> meaning the root has one child? But wait, the root might have more than one child. \n\n            Correction: the deg array was built for vertices 0 to n-1. The root is vertex0. They did:\n                for i from 1 to n-1: \n                    p[i] is given, then they do p[i]-- -> then deg[p[i]]++   -> so the parent of vertex i (which is p[i]) gets a child.\n\n            Then after the loop, they do: deg.push_back(1) -> this increases the size of deg by one? \n\n            Actually, the initial deg array has size n. Then they push_back(1) -> now size n+1. Then they remove zeros? \n\n            This seems odd.\n\n          Let me read a known solution from a known contest (Codeforces) for the problem \"The Enchanted Forest\" (but that is not the name) or \"Tree Infection\" (which is the name of a problem in Round #781):\n\n            There is a problem \"Tree Infection\" in Codeforces Round #781 (Div. 2) that matches the description.\n\n            Solution from a known editorial:\n\n                We are given a tree. We can infect one node per second by injection. Also, the spreading: for each node, if at least one child is infected, then in the spreading phase we can infect one more child per second.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Count the frequency of each parent: that is, the number of children for each node.\n\n                  Let f(v) = number of children of v.\n\n                  We are going to consider the following:\n\n                    We must inject at least one node in each group (each group is the children of a common parent) to start the spreading in that group.\n\n                  But note: the root is already infected at time0? Actually, the problem says we start with no infection. We inject the root at time1.\n\n                  Then for a node v with k children, the time to infect the entire group of children of v is:\n\n                    We inject one child at time t0. Then we can spread to the remaining k-1 children at times t0+1, t0+2, ..., t0+k-1.\n\n                  However, we can do injections in different groups in parallel.\n\n                  But the spreading in different groups happens independently.\n\n                  The challenge is to schedule the injections.\n\n                  The known solution:\n\n                    Let a = list of frequencies for each node that has at least one child.\n\n                    Then sort a in descending order.\n\n                    Then we let ans = 0.\n\n                    We then consider that we have to inject one node in each group. So we need at least len(a) seconds for injections for the groups? But also we injected the root? \n\n                    Actually, the root is already injected at time1. Then we have to inject one child in each group (each node that has children) to start the spreading? \n\n                    But note: the root is a group? The root has children. We injected the root at time1. Then we can start spreading in the root's group at time2? \n\n                    However, the children of the root are not necessarily injected at time1? We injected the root, not a child.\n\n                    To start spreading in the root's group, we must have at least one child of the root infected. So we must inject one child of the root at some time.\n\n                    Therefore, for the root's group, we need to inject one child.\n\n                    So we have to inject for every node that has children: one child.\n\n                    Therefore, the number of groups is the number of nodes that have at least one child. Let m = len(a).\n\n                    Then we need at least m seconds for these injections? But we can do one injection per second.\n\n                    However, we also have the root injection at time1. The root is not counted in the groups? The groups are defined by the parent node. The root is one group.\n\n                    So we have m groups.\n\n                    Then the time to finish the group for node i is: (time when we inject the representative of group i) + a[i]   [because we have to spread to a[i]-1 more children, but note: the spreading starts at the next second?]\n\n                  Actually, the editorial of Round #781:\n\n                    https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/102562\n\n                    Solution for problem C: Tree Infection\n\n                    They do:\n\n                      Let cnt be an array of the number of children for each node, but only for nodes that have at least one child.\n\n                      Sort cnt in decreasing order.\n\n                      We then have to assign an injection time for each group. Let t_i be the time when we inject the first child in group i.\n\n                      Then the time when the last child in group i is infected is: t_i + (number of children in group i) \n\n                      Why? \n                          At time t_i: we inject one child -> then we can spread to one child per second. So the next child is infected at t_i+1, then t_i+2, ... until we have infected all children.\n\n                      But note: the spreading phase happens after the injection phase in the same second? Actually, the injection at time t_i happens in the injection phase of second t_i. Then in the spreading phase of second t_i, we cannot spread from that group because at the start of second t_i, the child is not infected? \n\n                      The editorial says: \n                          The infection time for the j-th child in group i (after the first one) is t_i + j.\n\n                      Therefore, the last child is infected at time t_i + (a[i]-1)   [because there are a[i] children, one is injected at t_i, then the next a[i]-1 are spread at t_i+1, t_i+2, ..., t_i+a[i]-1].\n\n                      Then the total time for group i is t_i + a[i] - 1.\n\n                      We want to minimize the maximum over i of (t_i + a[i] - 1) and also the injections are scheduled in increasing t_i.\n\n                      We have to assign the t_i's in increasing order and we can only assign one injection per second.\n\n                      The earliest we can inject the groups is: \n                          We start at time0? But the problem: the first second is second1.\n\n                      Actually, we can start injecting groups at time1.\n\n                      How to assign the injection times to groups? \n                          We want to minimize the maximum (t_i + a[i] - 1). We can use a greedy: assign the earliest available injection time to the group with the largest a[i]? \n\n                      Algorithm:\n\n                          Sort a in descending order.\n\n                          Let m = len(a)\n\n                          We want to assign injection times: 1, 2, 3, ..., m to the groups.\n\n                          But note: we also have the root? The root is infected at time1. The root is not in the groups? Or is it? \n\n                      Actually, the root is a group? The root has children. We must inject one child in the root's group. So the root's group is included in the list.\n\n                      Then the total time is max_{i} (i+1 + a[i] - 1) = max_{i} (a[i] + i)   [if we assign the group i to injection time i+1 (because the first group gets time1, which is i=0: time1 = 0+1)].\n\n                      But wait: if we assign the group i (which is the i-th in the sorted list) to injection time i+1, then the finish time for group i is (i+1) + a[i] - 1 = a[i] + i.\n\n                      Then the total time is max_i (a[i] + i) and then we add 1 for the root? \n\n                      However, the root is injected at time1. But the groups include the root? \n\n                      The editorial says: \n                          We also need to infect the root? But the root is already infected at time0? \n\n                      Actually, the problem: we start with no infection. We infect the root at time1. Then the groups: we have to infect the children of the root and the children of other nodes.\n\n                      But the root's group: we have a[0] = number of children of the root. We inject one child of the root at time2? \n\n                      Then the finish time for the root's group is 2 + a[0] - 1 = a[0] + 1.\n\n                      And for the next group (a[1]) we inject at time3: finish time = 3 + a[1] - 1 = a[1] + 2.\n\n                      Then the total time is max_i (a[i] + i + 1)   [if we start indexing groups at i=0]?\n\n                      But note: the first group (largest a) is injected at time2 (i=0: time = 0+2) -> then finish time = 2 + a[0] - 1 = a[0] + 1.\n\n                      The second group: injected at time3 (i=1: time=1+2) -> finish time = a[1] + 2.\n\n                      So in general: group i (0-indexed) is injected at time i+2, and finishes at time i+2 + a[i] - 1 = a[i] + i + 1.\n\n                      Then the total time is max_i (a[i] + i + 1).\n\n                      But then we also have the root infection at time1. The entire process must wait until the last group finishes.\n\n                      Therefore, the answer = max(1, max_i (a[i]+i+1))? \n\n                      However, the root infection is at time1, and then we start injecting groups at time2.\n\n                      But wait: can we inject a group at time1? No, because at time1 we injected the root. Then at time2 we can inject a group.\n\n                      Therefore, the injection times for the groups are 2, 3, 4, ..., m+1.\n\n                      Then the finish time for group i is (i+2) + a[i] - 1 = a[i] + i + 1.\n\n                      Then the answer = max(1, a[i]+i+1 for all i) \n\n                      But note: the root infection is at time1, and the spreading for the root's group cannot start until we inject a child of the root at time2. \n\n                      However, the problem: the spreading phase in second2: at the start of second2, the root is infected (from time1) and we just injected a child of the root at time2 (in the injection phase of second2) -> then in the spreading phase of second2, can we spread from the root? \n\n                      The spreading phase condition: at the start of second2, the root has no child infected (because the child was just injected in the injection phase of second2, which is after the spreading phase). \n\n                      The problem: the spreading phase happens first, then the injection phase. \n\n                      Therefore, at the spreading phase of second2: the child injected at time2 has not happened yet. So the root has no child infected at the spreading phase of second2. \n\n                      Then the spreading phase of second2 does nothing. Then in the injection phase of second2, we inject a child of the root.\n\n                      Then at the start of second3: the root has one child infected. Then in the spreading phase of second3, we can spread to one more child of the root. \n\n                      Then the finish time for the root's group: \n                          time2: inject one child -> child1 infected.\n                          time3: spread to child2.\n                          time4: spread to child3.\n                          ...\n                          time2 + a[0] - 1 = 2 + a[0] - 1 = a[0] + 1.\n\n                      So the finish time for the root's group is a[0]+1.\n\n                      And for a group i injected at time (i+2): \n                          the last child is infected at time (i+2) + a[i] - 1 = a[i] + i + 1.\n\n                      Therefore, the answer = max_i (a[i] + i + 1)   [for i in range(m)].\n\n                      But what if there is no group? then m=0 -> answer=0? but we have the root infected at time1 -> then answer=1.\n\n                      So we can do: \n                          ans = 0\n                          for i in range(m):\n                              ans = max(ans, a[i] + i + 1)\n\n                          then ans = max(ans, 1)   # but if m==0, then the loop does nothing, and we need to infect the root -> time1.\n\n                      However, if there is at least one group, then the root is included in the groups? \n\n                      Actually, the root is a group? We counted the root's children in the list a? \n\n                      Yes, because we built the list of children counts for every node that has at least one child, and the root has children.\n\n                      Therefore, the answer = max_i (a[i] + i + 1)   for i in range(m), and we don't need to max with 1 because if m>=1, then the first group (i=0) gives a[0]+1, which is at least 1+1=2.\n\n                  But wait: the example in the problem: \n                      \"The first test case contains a tree with 5 vertices: the root 1, and children 2,3,4,5. The parent array: [1,1,1,1] for vertices 2,3,4,5.\"\n\n                      Then a = [4] (only the root has children, and it has 4 children).\n\n                      Then ans = a[0] + 0 + 1 = 4+1 = 5.\n\n                      How does the process go for n=5?\n\n                        Second1: \n                            Spreading: nothing.\n                            Injection: infect the root.\n\n                        Second2:\n                            Spreading: nothing (root has no child infected at the start of second2).\n                            Injection: infect one child of the root (say child2).\n\n                        Second3:\n                            Spreading: the root has one child infected -> we can spread to one more child (child3).\n                            Injection: infect one more child of the root (child4).\n\n                        Second4:\n                            Spreading: the root has three children infected (child2,3,4) -> we can spread to child5.\n                            Injection: we could infect something else, but there is none? \n\n                        Then at the end of second4, all are infected? \n\n                      But our answer is 5.\n\n                      What happens at second5? \n\n                      We don't need to do anything at second5.\n\n                      The entire tree is infected at the end of second4? \n\n                      The problem: we need to infect the whole tree. The last infection (child5) happens at the spreading phase of second4. So the time is 4 seconds.\n\n                      Why did we get 5?\n\n                      We computed: a[0] + 0 + 1 = 4+1 = 5.\n\n                      But the finish time for the root's group is 4 seconds? \n\n                      The finish time for the group is the time when the last child is infected: child5 is infected at second4.\n\n                      So the answer should be 4.\n\n                      The discrepancy: the formula is a[i] + i + 1, but i=0 -> 4+0+1=5, which is too high.\n\n                  Let me reexamine the scheduling for the root's group:\n\n                    We have 4 children.\n\n                    We inject one child at time2: then the spreading happens:\n\n                      time2: inject child2 -> then at the start of time3, child2 is infected.\n                      time3: spreading: infect child3 -> then at the start of time4, child3 is infected.\n                      time4: spreading: infect child4 -> then at the start of time5, child4 is infected.\n                      time5: spreading: infect child5.\n\n                    So the last child is infected at time5.\n\n                    But note: the spreading phase of time3 infects child3 at the end of time3? Then at the start of time4, child3 is infected.\n\n                    Therefore, the spreading phase of time4 can then infect child4.\n\n                    And the spreading phase of time5 infects child5.\n\n                    So the last child is infected at time5.\n\n                    Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\n                  Why do we think it should be 4? \n\n                    The problem says: \n                      Second1: \n                          Spreading: nothing -> then injection: root.\n                      Second2: \n                          Spreading: nothing -> then injection: child2.\n                      Second3:\n                          Spreading: the root has child2 infected -> we can spread to child3.\n                          Injection: child4.\n                      Second4:\n                          Spreading: the root has child2, child3, child4 infected -> we can spread to child5.\n                          Injection: none needed.\n\n                    Then at the end of second4, child5 is infected by spreading? \n\n                    But note: the spreading phase happens before the injection phase. \n\n                    At the start of second4: \n                         infected: root, child2, child3, child4? \n                         But child4 was injected at the injection phase of second3, which is after the spreading phase of second3. \n                         So at the start of second4, child4 is infected? \n\n                    Then in the spreading phase of second4, we can spread from the root to child5.\n\n                    Then in the injection phase of second4, we don't need to inject.\n\n                    Then the tree is fully infected at the end of second4.\n\n                  How does the time work for child5? \n                    It is infected in the spreading phase of second4 -> so at the end of second4.\n\n                  Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\n                  Why the formula gives 5? \n\n                    The formula: a[i] + i + 1 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5.\n\n                  The editorial of Round #781 says: \n                      We assign the injection times to the groups in increasing order, and the injection time for group i is i+1 (if we start at time0 for the first group) but then we have to add the time for the spreading.\n\n                  But note: we cannot inject the groups at time1 because time1 is used for the root. The groups start at time2.\n\n                  In the formula: \n                      group0 (the root's group) is injected at time2 = 0+2.\n                      then the finish time = 2 + 4 - 1 = 5.\n\n                  But we want to express in seconds: the spreading of the last child of the root happens at time4.\n\n                  The finish time for the group is the second when the last child is infected: that is second4.\n\n                  How to compute the finish time for group i:\n\n                    Let t0 = injection time for the group = i+2   (because the first group is injected at second2).\n\n                    Then the last child is infected at: t0 + (number of children - 1)   [because we spread one per second] = (i+2) + (a[i]-1) = a[i] + i + 1.\n\n                  But in our example: a[0]=4, i=0 -> 4+0+1=5, which is the second when the last child is infected.\n\n                  However, the entire process must wait until the last second when any node is infected. \n\n                  Therefore, the answer is the maximum over all groups of (a[i] + i + 1).\n\n                  And in the example, it is 5.\n\n                  But the problem says the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree is 4 in the first example? \n\n                  The first example in the problem note: \n                      The image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.\n\n                  The sample tree in the problem is not provided in text, but the first test case in the sample input is:\n\n                    Input: \n                        2\n                        5\n                        1 1 1 1\n                        3\n                        1 2\n\n                  The sample output for the first test case is 4.\n\n                  Therefore, the formula a[i]+i+1 might be off by one.\n\n                  Let me simulate with the provided example: n=5, parent array = [1,1,1,1]\n\n                    Second1: \n                        Spreading: nothing -> then injection: we inject the root. Infected: {1}\n                    Second2: \n                        Spreading: nothing (root has no child infected at the start) -> injection: we inject child2. Infected: {1,2}\n                    Second3:\n                        Spreading: the root has child2 infected -> we can spread to child3. Infected: {1,2,3}\n                        Injection: we inject child4. Infected: {1,2,3,4}\n                    Second4:\n                        Spreading: the root has child2,3,4 infected -> we can spread to child5. Infected: {1,2,3,4,5}\n                        Injection: none.\n\n                  So the entire tree is infected at the end of second4.\n\n                  Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\n                  Why does the formula give 5? \n\n                  The formula: a[0] + 0 + 1 = 4+1=5.\n\n                  The error: the spreading of the last child (child5) happens in the spreading phase of second4, and that is the last operation. So the time is 4.\n\n                  The finish time for the group is not a[i]+i+1 seconds, but rather the second when the last child is infected.\n\n                  How to compute the second when the last child is infected for group i:\n\n                    We inject the first child at time = t0 = i+2.\n                    Then the spreading for the next child happens in the next seconds: \n                        child1: injected at t0.\n                        child2: spread at t0+1.\n                        child3: spread at t0+2.\n                        ...\n                        child_k: spread at t0 + (k-1).\n\n                    Therefore, the last child is infected at second = t0 + (a[i]-1) = (i+2) + (a[i]-1) = a[i] + i + 1.\n\n                  In the example: a[0]=4, i=0 -> 4+0+1=5.\n\n                  But in our simulation, the last child is infected at second4.\n\n                  What is the value of t0? \n                    i+2 = 0+2 = 2.\n                    then last child at 2 + (4-1) = 2+3=5.\n\n                  Why the discrepancy? \n\n                  In the simulation, we did:\n\n                    time2: inject child2 -> child2 is infected at the end of time2.\n                    time3: spread to child3 -> child3 infected at the end of time3.\n                    time4: spread to child4 -> child4 infected at the end of time4.\n                    time5: spread to child5 -> child5 infected at the end of time5.\n\n                  But wait, we only have 4 children? \n\n                  The group has 4 children: child2, child3, child4, child5.\n\n                  We injected child2 at time2.\n                  Then we spread to child3 at time3, child4 at time4, child5 at time5.\n\n                  So indeed, child5 is infected at time5.\n\n                  However, in our earlier simulation we also injected child4 at time3? \n\n                  We have two ways to infect the children: \n                    We can inject more than one child in a group? \n\n                  The problem: we can only inject one child per group? \n\n                  The strategy: \n                    We must inject one child in each group to start the spreading. The rest can be spread.\n\n                  In the example, we have only one group (the root). We inject one child (child2) at time2. Then we can spread to the remaining 3 children. \n                    child3 at time3, child4 at time4, child5 at time5.\n\n                  But then why in the simulation we injected child4 at time3? \n\n                  We are allowed to inject any healthy vertex. We are not limited to one injection per group. \n\n                  The problem: \n                    \"Tree Infection\" requires that you cannot inject two vertices in the same group? \n\n                  Let me read the problem statement: \n                    \"Tree Infection\" problem: \n                      \" each second you can inject a vertex of your choice, and then the disease spreads from each such vertex to one of its children \"\n\n                  But the problem in our note is different: \n                    \" each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation: \n                      Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice.\n                      Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it. \"\n\n                  In this problem, we can inject any vertex, even in the same group multiple times.\n\n                  Therefore, we are not limited to one injection per group. \n\n                  This changes the strategy.\n\n                  In the example, we can inject two children of the root: \n                    time2: inject child2.\n                    time3: inject child3.\n\n                  Then at time3, after the injection, the root has two children infected. Then in the next second (time4), we can spread to two children of the root? \n\n                  But the spreading operation: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, you can spread to at most one other child. \n\n                  So for the root, we can only spread to one child per second, regardless of how many are already infected.\n\n                  Therefore, even if we inject two children, the spreading from the root is still limited to one per second.\n\n                  So for the root's group of 4 children:\n\n                    Option1: \n                      time2: inject child2.\n                      time3: inject child3.\n                      time4: spread to child4.\n                      time5: spread to child5.\n\n                    -> time5.\n\n                  Option2:\n                      time2: inject child2.\n                      time3: spread to child3.\n                      time4: spread to child4.\n                      time5: spread to child5.\n\n                  Option3:\n                      time2: inject child2.\n                      time3: spread to child3.\n                      time4: inject child4.   // then at time5: we can spread to child5 from the root (because the root has child2,3,4 infected) \n                      -> child5 at time5.\n\n                  Option4 (the one we did earlier that finished at time4):\n                      time2: inject child2.\n                      time3: spread to child3 and inject child4. -> wait, we can only do one injection per second. \n                      time3: \n                          Spreading: from the root (which has child2) -> spread to child3.\n                          Injection: inject child4.\n                      time4:\n                          Spreading: from the root (which has child2,3,4) -> spread to child5.\n                      -> done at time4.\n\n                  How did we spread to child3 and also inject child4 in time3? \n                    The process in one second:\n                      Spreading phase: we can spread to child3.\n                      Then injection phase: we inject child4.\n\n                  Then at the end of time3, child3 and child4 are infected.\n\n                  Then at time4: \n                      Spreading phase: the root has child2,3,4 infected -> we can spread to child5.\n\n                  So the last child is infected at time4.\n\n                  Therefore, the formula must account for the fact that we can inject more than one child in a group, and that can save time.\n\n                  The known solution in the C++ code that I quoted earlier (from a contest) for the problem described in our note is the one that uses the heap.\n\n                  Given the complexity, and that the constraints say the total n over test cases is 200000, we must use an efficient method.\n\n                  The C++ code that I quoted earlier (which uses the heap) is for the problem described in our note.\n\n                  Therefore, for program2.py, we will implement the C++ code in Python.\n\n                  Steps in the C++ code for one test case:\n\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    p = list (map(int, input().split()))   # of length n-1\n\n                    deg = [0]*(n+1)\n                    # the root is vertex1, and we will index from 1 to n.\n                    for i in range(n-1):\n                        parent = p[i]\n                        deg[parent] += 1\n\n                    # But the root might be not in the list of parents? \n                    # The root is vertex1.
