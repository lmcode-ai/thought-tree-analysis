For even n: \n        m = n/2\n        Then we loop: for e in range(2, (3*n+1)//2 + 1, 3):\n            print(e, e + (3*n)//2 + 1) Example: n=2 -> \n        m = 1\n        e in range(2, (3*2+1)//2 + 1 = (7)//2 + 1 = 3+1=4? Actually: (3*2+1)=7, then (7)//2 -> integer division? In Python, 7//2=3, then +1 -> 4. So range(2,4,3) -> only e=2. Then we print: e=2, and then e + (3*2)//2 + 1 = 2 + (6//2) + 1 = 2+3+1=6? So we swap index2 and index6. The string for n=2: \"BANBAN\" -> indices: \n          1: 'B'\n          2: 'A'\n          3: 'N'\n          4: 'B'\n          5: 'A'\n          6: 'N'\n\n        Swap index2 and index6: \n          becomes: B (index1), then swap index2 (which is 'A') and index6 (which is 'N') -> \n          index2 becomes 'N', index6 becomes 'A' So the string: \"B\" + \"N\" + \"N\" + \"B\" + \"A\" + \"A\" -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        This matches the example. For odd n: \n        m = (n+1)//2\n        Then we have a loop: for e in range(2, (3*n+1)//2 + 1, 3):\n            # TODO:",

Then we need to break block2: swap the 'A' in block2 (at5) with the 'N' in block3? but we already swapped the 'N' in block3? Alternatively, we can swap the 'A' in block1 (at2) with the 'N' in block2 (at6) -> then block1: B, N, N -> no BAN; block2: B, A, A -> no BAN?

But wait: \"BAN\" requires B then A then N? So \"BNA\" is not \"BAN\". But is there a subsequence \"BAN\" in the entire string? We have: \n                    block1: B, N, N -> we can take the B and then skip the N's? \n                    block2: B, then we have an A at6? but we swapped: \n                      After op1: \n                        1:B, 2:N (from block3), 3:N\n                        4:B, 5:A, 6:N -> but then we swap5 and6: \n                        4:B, 5:N, 6:A\n                    block3: 7:B, 8:A, 9:A (from block1's A) -> but wait, we swapped2 and9: \n                        9 becomes the A from block1?",

Actually, the first block: positions1,2,3: 'B','N','N' -> no \"BAN\" here? \n                    block2: positions4,5,6: 'B','A','N' -> this is \"BAN\" -> bad. Then swap 5 and 12: \n                  position5: originally 'A' becomes the character at12: 'N'\n                  position12: originally 'N' becomes the character at5: 'A'\n                  Now:\n                    block2: positions4,5,6: 'B','N','N' -> no \"BAN\"\n                    block4: positions10,11,12: 'B','A','A' -> no \"BAN\"\n\n                But what about the entire string? We have: \n                    block1: B, N, N -> no BAN? \n                    block2: B, N, N -> no BAN? \n                    block3: B, A, A -> no BAN? \n                    block4: B, A, A -> no BAN? So it works. Why did we choose 9 and 12? The formula: \n                  for e in the even case: \n                    e: 2, 5, 8, ... -> the 'A' in the first, second, third, ... blocks? then the swap partner: e + (3*n)//2 + 1\n\n                For n=4: \n                  (3*n)//2 = 12//2=6? Then +1 -> 7? Then for e=2: 2+7=9\n                  for e=5: 5+7=12\n\n            How does this formula work? The partner for the k-th 'A' (at position = 3*k+2) is: \n                    position = (3*k+2) + (3*n)//2 + 1\n\n                For k=0: 2 + 3*n//2+1 = 2+ (3*4//2+1)=2+6+1=9? For k=1: 5+6+1=12? \n\n            But note: the total length is 12, and 9 and 12 are valid indices. Now for odd n: \n                We have m = (n+1)//2 operations. The loop: for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n\n                For n=3: \n                    m = (3+1)//2 = 2\n                    e in range(2, (3*3+1)//2+1 = (10)//2+1=5+1=6, step=3) -> e=2,5.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n We are provided with a code skeleton that uses two pointers (i from left, j from right) and two running sums (lsum for Alice, rsum for Bob). The code already sets up:\n   n = number of candies\n   arr = list of candy weights\n\n The while loop runs while i < j. Inside, we have:\n   if lsum < rsum: then move i to the right and add to lsum.\n   if rsum < lsum: then move j to the left and add to rsum.\n   else: (when they are equal) we have a candidate.\n\n In the else block, we need to record the current total candies eaten: (i+1) from the left and (n - j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n - j). We set best to the maximum of the current best and this total.\n\n However, note that after we record, we must continue to look for more possibilities? But note: we are moving the pointers. The problem is that we cannot simply break because there might be a better solution? Actually, the problem says we want the maximum total candies.\n\n But note: the current code does not update the pointers in the else block. We must update to continue. How?\n\n We can do: when we have equality, we record the candidate and then we move both pointers? Because if we don't move, we'll be stuck. We can move one step from both sides? But note: we are allowed to have non-overlapping.\n\n However, the current code does not have an update for the else block. We must add:\n\n   best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n   # Then we move both pointers to continue? But note: we are in the middle. We can do:\n   i += 1\n   j -= 1\n   # But then we must update the sums? We are going to add the new left and new right? But wait: we are already at the current state. We are going to move and then in the next iteration we will add the new candy to the respective sums? However, note that we are breaking the current state? Actually, we can do:\n\n   lsum += arr[i]   # but wait, we are going to move i first? Actually, we can do:\n\n   Option: \n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]   # but note: we are at i, then we move i to i+1, then add arr[i] (which is the new i) -> but this might skip the state? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        # We move one step from the left and then we break the equality? But we can also consider moving both and then continue the while loop? \n\n However, note that the problem has the constraint that the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        # Now we move one step from the left and one from the right? But note: we are going to break the current equality? We can do:\n\n        # Let's move the left pointer: we add the next candy to the left? But then we break the equality? Actually, we can do:\n\n        # We do: \n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:   # to avoid index out of bounds? But the while condition is i<j, so after moving we might break the condition? \n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But wait: what if we don't have enough to move? Actually, we can do:\n\n        # Instead, we can break the current state and then the next iteration will adjust? But note: we are going to add the next candy on the left and the next on the right? That might lead to a new state that we can then adjust? \n\n        However, consider: we are at a state of equality. Then we move both pointers and then we have two new candies. Then we can continue the while loop? \n\n        But note: we might miss a solution that uses the current state and then only moves one pointer? Actually, the problem is that we are trying to maximize the total candies. We have recorded the current state. Then we move both to see if we can get a longer sequence? \n\n        However, the problem does not require contiguous segments? Actually, the segments are contiguous from the left and from the right. And they are non-overlapping. \n\n        But note: if we have an equality at (i, j), then we can also try to extend: we can add one more candy to the left and then see if we can get a bigger total? But that would break the equality? \n\n        Actually, the standard solution for this problem (Two Sum II but with two pointers from ends) is to:\n\n          - When the sums are equal, record and then move both pointers (because if we move only one, the sums will become unequal and we might miss the chance to get a longer sequence? Actually, we can get a longer sequence by having more candies? But note: we are trying to maximize the total number of candies. We can have:\n\n          Example: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] \n          Initially: \n            i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> total = 1 (left) + 1 (right) = 2.\n          Then we move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> then we move j: j=3 -> rsum=1+1+1=3 -> equal -> total = 2 (left: [1,2]) + 2 (right: [1,1]) = 4.\n\n          So we must continue after the equality.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          else:\n              best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n              # We move both pointers to see if we can get a longer sequence? \n              i += 1\n              j -= 1\n              if i < j:   # but we are going to add the new candy in the next iteration? Actually, we break the state and then the next iteration will adjust? \n                  lsum += arr[i]\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n              # But wait, we are already moving the pointers, so we must update the sums? However, note that in the next iteration we are going to check the condition? But we haven't updated the sums for the new pointers? \n\n          Actually, we are updating the sums for the new pointers? But we are adding the new candy at i (which is the new i) and the new candy at j (the new j). \n\n        However, what if we move the pointers and then i>=j? Then we break the loop. So we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n        But note: the initial setup: \n            i=0, j=n-1\n            lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n\n        Then when we move both, we do:\n            i becomes 1, j becomes n-2.\n            Then we add arr[1] to lsum and arr[n-2] to rsum.\n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        However, what if we have an equality and then we move both, but then we break the loop? Then we don't update the sums? But we don't need to because we break.\n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i<j? Then we update the sums and then the while loop continues? \n\n        This seems correct.\n\n        But note: we might have an equality and then we move both, and then we get a new state that might be equal? Then we record again? \n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1] \n          i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> record best = 0+1 + (4-3) = 1+1 = 2? Actually: \n            left: [1] -> 1 candy, right: [1] (the last candy) -> 1 candy, total=2.\n          Then we move: i=1, j=2 -> then we add arr[1] to lsum -> lsum=2, and arr[2] to rsum -> rsum=2 -> equal again -> record: left: [1,1] (2 candies), right: [1,1] (candies at indices 2 and 3? but note: Bob eats from the right: the last two? Actually, Bob eats the two rightmost: indices 2 and 3? But note: we are at j=2, so Bob has eaten from index 3 and 2? -> total = 2 (left) + 2 (right) = 4.\n\n        Then we move: i=2, j=1 -> i>=j -> break.\n\n        So we get 4, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says that they cannot eat the same candy. And we are moving the pointers so that the candies in the middle (if any) are not eaten? Actually, we are only eating the left part from 0 to i and the right part from j to n-1. The middle from i+1 to j-1 is not eaten. But in the above, when i=1 and j=2, then the left part is [0,1] and the right part is [2,3]. The middle is empty? Actually, we have i=1 and j=2: then the left part is indices [0,1] and the right part is [2,3]. So the entire array is eaten? \n\n        But note: the condition is that they eat contiguous segments from the ends. And they cannot overlap. So if i and j cross, then we break. But if they meet, then we break? \n\n        However, the problem says: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous segment starting at the left) and Bob from the right (any contiguous segment starting at the right). They cannot eat the same candy. So if we have i and j such that the segments [0, i] and [j, n-1] do not overlap, then it's valid. \n\n        Therefore, the above update in the else block is:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            # if i==j, then we break and the while loop condition fails.\n\n        But what if we have i==j? Then we break without updating the sums? That's okay because we cannot use the same candy.\n\n        However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i==j? Then we break. But we have already recorded the candidate? \n\n        But note: when we move both, we are effectively skipping the middle candy? Actually, we are not skipping: we are moving the pointers and then the while condition breaks. The middle candy is not eaten? \n\n        That's acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get i and j such that i>j? Then we break. \n\n        However, we are moving one step each, so if we start with i and j and we have i<j, then after moving we have i+1 and j-1. We break when i+1 > j-1? Actually, we break when i>=j? So if we start with i and j adjacent? For example, i=0, j=1: then we have lsum and rsum? Then if they are equal, we record and then we do i=1, j=0 -> then we break. \n\n        So the update is safe.\n\n        But note: what if we have an equality and then we move both, and then we get an index that is out of bounds? We are checking i<j in the while condition, so we break.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the else block is:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        However, note: we might have an equality and then we move both, but then we break the while condition? Then we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we are still in the loop? Then we must update the sums? \n\n        Example: [1,2,1,1,1,1] as above: \n          Step1: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> record best= (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2 -> then i=1, j=4 -> then we update lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> then we go to the next iteration.\n\n        Then we have lsum=3, rsum=2 -> so we do: j moves: j=3, rsum=2+1=3 -> then we have equality again -> record: (1+1)=2 (left: two candies) and (6-3)=3 (right: three candies) -> total=5? But wait: the left has indices0 and 1? and the right has indices3,4,5? But note: the right segment must be contiguous from the right? Bob eats from the right: he must eat the last three? But the last three are indices 3,4,5? Then total=2+3=5? \n\n        However, the example in the note: \n          For the fourth test case: \n            weights: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30 -> total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n        So we are counting the number of candies, not the indices? \n\n        How we compute: \n          left: from index0 to index i -> number of candies = i+1\n          right: from index j to index n-1 -> number of candies = n - j\n\n        So in the example [1,2,1,1,1,1] we have:\n          First equality: i=0, j=5 -> left: 1 candy, right: 1 candy -> total=2.\n          Second equality: i=1, j=3 -> left: 2 candies (indices0,1), right: 3 candies (indices3,4,5) -> total=5.\n\n        But wait: the entire array is 6 candies? How can they eat 5? They cannot eat the candy at index2? That's acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says: they want to be fair: same total weight. And we have left: 1+2=3, right: 1+1+1=3 -> that's fair. And they eat 5 candies? \n\n        But note: the candy at index2 (which is 1) is not eaten? \n\n        So the answer for [1,2,1,1,1,1] is 5? \n\n        However, we can also have: \n          Alice: [1,2,1] -> 4, Bob: [1,1,1] -> 3 -> not equal.\n          Or: \n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> not equal.\n          But we found two states: 2 and 5? \n\n        Why 5? \n          Alice: [1,2] (candies0 and 1) -> 3\n          Bob: [1,1,1] (candies3,4,5) -> 3\n          Total candies: 5.\n\n        So the answer is 5.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the else block is as above.\n\n        But note: what if we have an equality and then we move both, and then we break? Then we have recorded the candidate? \n\n        However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get an out of bounds? We break. \n\n        Also, we must consider: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get i==j? Then we break without updating the sums? Then we have recorded the candidate? \n\n        But note: we are updating the candidate at the moment of equality. Then we move. Then we break. \n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        But note: the initial code sets best=0. And if there is no equality, then best remains 0? That matches the third test case: no way -> 0.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        However, note: we are updating the sums only if i<j? But what if we move and then i==j? Then we break and that's okay. But what if we move and then i<j? Then we must update the sums? \n\n        But wait: in the next iteration, we are going to check the condition? And then we might adjust? \n\n        But note: we are not including the new candies in the sums? We must add them. \n\n        So we do: if i<j, then we add the new candy at i to lsum and the new candy at j to rsum? \n\n        However, note: we have moved the pointers: i becomes i+1 and j becomes j-1. Then we are at the new positions. We must add the candy at the new i to lsum and the new j to rsum? \n\n        But why? Because we are going to consider the new state? \n\n        Actually, the state of the sums must reflect the current segments: \n          lsum = sum of arr[0] to arr[i] (inclusive)\n          rsum = sum of arr[j] to arr[n-1] (inclusive)\n\n        So after moving the pointers, we are including the new i and the new j? \n\n        Therefore, we must add them.\n\n        But note: we are moving the pointers and then we are at the new positions. We haven't included the new candies? So we add them.\n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        But what if we move and then i>=j? Then we break and we don't update the sums? That's okay because we break.\n\n        So the code for the else block is as above.\n\n        However, note: the while loop condition is i<j. So when we move, we might break the condition? Then we break the loop? \n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            # else: break the loop? The while condition will break.\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of the next iteration? Actually, we are in the same iteration? We are updating i and j and then we break the loop? No, we are still in the loop? We break only when the condition fails? \n\n        Actually, the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of the next iteration? So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we write the above.\n\n        But note: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get i==j? Then we break the loop? And we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n        However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get i>j? Then we break? \n\n        So the code is:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But note: we are updating the sums only when i<j? What if we have i==j? Then we break? \n\n        Actually, the while loop condition is i<j, so if i==j, then we break? \n\n        But what if we have i==j-1? Then we move: i becomes i+1, j becomes j-1 -> then i==j? Then we break? \n\n        So we don't update the sums? \n\n        But note: we have already moved the pointers? Then we break? \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the above block.\n\n        However, note: the initial code sets lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then we start the while loop. \n\n        We must be cautious: the while loop condition is i<j. \n\n        We are done for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: We are given n, and we form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (each swap swaps two characters at distinct indices) so that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n We are guaranteed that the total operations in all test cases is at most 10^5, and n<=100, t<=100.\n\n The provided code:\n\n   t = int(input())\n   for i in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        if n == 1:\n            print(1)\n            print(1,2)\n        elif n%2 :   # odd n\n            print(int((n+1)/2))\n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        else :       # even n\n            print(int(n/2))\n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n We see that for n=1, we output 1 operation: swapping indices 1 and 2.\n\n For even n: \n        m = n/2\n        Then we loop: for e in range(2, (3*n+1)//2 + 1, 3):\n            print(e, e + (3*n)//2 + 1)\n\n Example: n=2 -> \n        m = 1\n        e in range(2, (3*2+1)//2 + 1 = (7)//2 + 1 = 3+1=4? Actually: (3*2+1)=7, then (7)//2 -> integer division? In Python, 7//2=3, then +1 -> 4. So range(2,4,3) -> only e=2.\n        Then we print: e=2, and then e + (3*2)//2 + 1 = 2 + (6//2) + 1 = 2+3+1=6? \n        So we swap index2 and index6.\n\n        The string for n=2: \"BANBAN\" -> indices: \n          1: 'B'\n          2: 'A'\n          3: 'N'\n          4: 'B'\n          5: 'A'\n          6: 'N'\n\n        Swap index2 and index6: \n          becomes: B (index1), then swap index2 (which is 'A') and index6 (which is 'N') -> \n          index2 becomes 'N', index6 becomes 'A'\n          So the string: \"B\" + \"N\" + \"N\" + \"B\" + \"A\" + \"A\" -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n For odd n: \n        m = (n+1)//2\n        Then we have a loop: for e in range(2, (3*n+1)//2 + 1, 3):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must output the same number of operations as m? \n\n        How many operations? The loop step is 3, and the start is 2, and the end is (3*n+1)//2 + 1.\n\n        For n=3 (odd): \n            m = (3+1)//2 = 2\n            e in range(2, (3*3+1)//2 + 1 = (10)//2+1 = 5+1=6, step=3) -> e=2,5.\n\n        What to do for each e? \n\n        The example in the problem does not give an odd example? But we can derive.\n\n        The idea: we want to break every occurrence of \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\n        How can we break? Note: the subsequence \"BAN\" requires: a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in order.\n\n        One common solution is to swap the 'A' and the 'N' in each \"BAN\" block? But that would break one block? But note: we have n blocks. However, we can do better: we can swap the 'A' in the first half of the blocks with the 'N' in the second half? \n\n        The provided even case: \n            swaps the second character (which is the 'A' of the first block) with the last character (which is the 'N' of the last block) for the first operation?

\n                  Then for the middle block: swap the A and the N in the middle block? \n\n                But note: the middle block index = (n-1)//2? \n                For n=3: the middle block is the second block (index1 in 0-indexed) -> then we swap the A at 3*1+2=5 and the N at 3*1+3=6? \n\n                So the operations for n=3: \n                  k=0: swap 2 and 3*(3-0)=9 -> swap2 and9.\n                  k=1: we don't do because (n-1)//2 - 1 = (2)//2-1=1-1=0? so we only do k=0?

We are using int() to truncate? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use integer floor division: (3*n+1)//2? \n\n        The provided code uses: int((3 * n + 1)/2) -> but in Python, if we use /, it returns a float? and then we convert to int? which truncates? \n\n        But note: (3*n+1) might be even? because 3*n is odd (since n is odd) -> 3*n+1 is even? so (3*n+1)/2 is integer? \n\n        So we can also write: (3*n+1)//2? \n\n        But the provided code uses int((3 * n + 1)/2) -> that is the same as (3*n+1)//2? \n\n        Actually, for integers, if we do int(x) for a float x that is an integer, it's the same. \n\n        We'll leave it as is.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above block.\n\n        However, note: the even case is already provided? \n\n        But wait: the even case code:\n\n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                print(e, e + int(3*n/2) + 1)\n\n        This is correct? \n\n        For n=2: \n            e=2: print(2, 2 + 3*2//2+1 = 2+3+1=6) -> correct.\n\n        For n=4: \n            e=2: print(2, 2+3*4//2+1=2+6+1=9)\n            e=5: print(5,5+6+1=12) -> correct.\n\n        So we don't change the even case.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n        program1.py: \n            else:\n                best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        program2.py: \n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                k = (e-2)//3\n                if k < (n-1)//2:\n                    j = 3*n - (e-2)\n                else:\n                    j = e+1\n                print(e, j)\n\n        But note: the program2.py code for the odd case is inside the block:\n\n            elif n%2 :\n                print(int((n+1)/2))\n                for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                    # TODO: Your code here   -> we put the above\n\n        And the even case is already provided.\n\n        Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n        Important: we must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        For program1.py: the missing code is the block that goes in the else branch.\n\n        For program2.py: the missing code is the block that goes in the for loop in the odd branch.\n\n        Therefore, the JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\ni += 1\\nj -= 1\\nif i < j:\\n    lsum += arr[i]\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n          \"program2\": \"k = (e-2)//3\\nif k < (n-1)//2:\\n    j = 3*n - (e-2)\\nelse:\\n    j = e+1\\nprint(e, j)\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1.py code must be indented correctly? \n\n        The existing program1.py has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        So the indentation: \n            The else block is at the same level as the if and elif. Then the next lines are indented one level.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py: the for loop body must be indented? \n\n        The existing program2.py has:\n\n            for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            k = (e-2)//3\n            if k < (n-1)//2:\n                j = 3*n - (e-2)\n            else:\n                j = e+1\n            print(e, j)\n\n        So the indentation: \n            The for loop body is one level indented. Then the if-else is two levels.\n\n        We write the code as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". So we write the code as a string with newlines.\n\n        We use the exact code as above.\n\n        But note: in program1.py, we have:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n\n        But note: the variable is named \"best\", and we are updating it.\n\n        And then we update the pointers and the sums.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        Let me write the JSON string.\n\n        Important: the JSON must be valid. We use double quotes.\n\n        We escape the newlines as \\n and the quotes as \\\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\ni += 1\\nj -= 1\\nif i < j:\\n    lsum += arr[i]\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n          \"program2\": \"k = (e-2)//3\\nif k < (n-1)//2:\\n    j = 3*n - (e-2)\\nelse:\\n    j = e+1\\nprint(e, j)\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1.py code has a condition: if i<j: then update the sums. We write that as:\n\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And the program2.py code: \n\n            k = (e-2)//3\n            if k < (n-1)//2:\n                j = 3*n - (e-2)\n            else:\n                j = e+1\n            print(e, j)\n\n        This should be correct.\n\n        We output the JSON."
