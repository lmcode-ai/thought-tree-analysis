    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length multiplied by the sign of the sum (positive: +1, zero: 0, negative: -1).\n\nThe provided code uses a dynamic programming approach with coordinate compression and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to efficiently compute the maximum dp[i] for prefixes.\n\nThe issue in the code is that after updating dp[i], we are supposed to update the global maximum for the prefix sum value at i (dmx[pref[i]]). The TODO says: if dp[i] is greater than the current value for dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), then update dmx[pref[i]] to dp[i].\n\nSo we should add:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has a line above that updates the Fenwick trees. The TODO is in the loop for updating the global maximum per prefix sum.\n\nTherefore, the missing line in program1.py is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nHowever, note that the code already has:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we should set dmx[pref[i]] to dp[i] in that if block.\n\nBut wait: the condition is exactly that dp[i] is greater than the current value for that prefix. So we update.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code might have multiple indices with the same prefix. We want the maximum dp[i] for a given prefix? Actually, the Fenwick trees are used for range maximum queries and we are also maintaining a dictionary dmx that maps a prefix sum to the maximum dp value for that prefix. So we update dmx only when we have a new maximum for that prefix.\n\nSo in the TODO block, we write:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about moving dolls on a grid defined by a non-increasing sequence a. The goal is to compute the minimum number of operations to remove all dolls from white cells.\n\nThe provided code uses combinatorial formulas. The formula given is:\n    ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i + i, i+1)   mod (10^9+7)\n\nBut note: the combinatorial function C(m, n) is defined, and there is a TODO in the function C(m, n): when n<0 or m<n, we should return 0 because the binomial coefficient is 0 in that case.\n\nSo in the function C(m, n), we should check:\n    if n < 0 or m < n: return 0\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n    return 0\n\nBut note: the function already has a return statement after the condition. So we replace the TODO with:\n    return 0\n\nHowever, note that the condition is written as:\n    if n < 0 or m < n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we put:\n    return 0\n\nNow, we output the missing code for both programs in the required JSON format.\n\nImportant: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line: `dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]` in the TODO block.\n\nBut note: the TODO block is inside the loop and inside the condition. We must output the exact code that goes there.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\nBut note: the TODO is in the context of an if block. We are only replacing the TODO comment.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the indentation level. The TODO is inside an if block and inside a for loop. We must preserve the indentation. However, the problem says to output the missing code. We output the line with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is at the same indentation as the condition. So we output:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: the condition is:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the assignment. So the entire block becomes:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the line that is missing: the assignment.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the string: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code in the C function is the return 0 in the condition.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is: \"        return 0\"\n\nBut note: the condition is:\n    if n < 0 or m < n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with a return 0. So the code becomes:\n    if n < 0 or m < n:\n        return 0\n\nWe output the line: \"        return 0\"\n\nNow, we format the answer as a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 500000, and the code in program1.py uses a Fenwick tree and a dictionary. The provided code is already written, and we are only adding one line.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, we are adding one line.\n\nLet's write the JSON string accordingly.\n\nImportant: We must escape the string if necessary. But the strings are simple.\n\nFinal output:\n{\"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"        return 0\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning for each program we output the exact code that is missing. In program1.py, the missing code is one line. In program2.py, the missing code is one line.\n\nHowever, in program1.py, the TODO is in a loop and we are only adding one line. Similarly, in program2.py, we are adding one line.\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the TODO is inside an if block and we are replacing the TODO comment with an assignment. So we output that assignment line with the same indentation.\n\nBut the problem does not require the entire block, just the missing part.\n\nSo we output the string exactly as it should appear in the code.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        return 0\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says the output format is a JSON with the keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", and the values are the completion strings.\n\nWe output that."
