But the decreasing array has the same size as the increasing array. We'll code accordingly. But note: the worst-case value: we use -10**18. But the values of dp[i] can be as low as -n? and n<=500000, so -500000. But we are storing dp[i]-i: which can be as low as -500000 - 500000 = -10^6? So -10**18 is safe. Let's hope. However, note: the problem constraints: a_i in [-10^9, 10^9], and n<=500000, so the prefix sums can be as large as 5e5 * 10^9 = 5e14? But we are compressing, so that's fine.

    },
    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete: program1.py and program2.py.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving a problem where we need to partition an array into contiguous non-empty subarrays to maximize the sum of values defined as:\n  For a subarray [l, r] with sum s: \n      value = (r-l+1) if s>0, \n              0 if s=0, \n              -(r-l+1) if s<0.\n\nThe input has multiple test cases. The total n over test cases <= 500000.\n\nWe note that the problem can be solved by dynamic programming. Let dp[i] be the maximum total value we can get for the prefix ending at i (i.e., considering a[0..i-1] for 0-indexed).\n\nThe recurrence:\n  dp[0] = 0\n  For i from 1 to n:\n      dp[i] = max_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + f(j, i) }\n  where f(j, i) = \n        (i - j) if the sum of a[j:i] > 0,\n        0 if the sum is 0,\n        -(i - j) if the sum < 0.\n\nBut note: the sum of a[j:i] = pref[i] - pref[j] (with pref[0]=0, pref[i]=a0+a1+...+a{i-1}).\n\nSo: \n  f(j,i) = \n        (i-j) if pref[i] - pref[j] > 0,\n        0 if equal to 0,\n        -(i-j) if negative.\n\nWe can rewrite:\n  dp[i] = max_{j in [0, i-1]} { \n        dp[j] + (i-j)   if pref[i] > pref[j],\n        dp[j]           if pref[i] == pref[j],\n        dp[j] - (i-j)   if pref[i] < pref[j]\n  }\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n  dp[i] = max( \n        max_{j: pref[j] < pref[i]} { dp[j] + (i - j) },\n        max_{j: pref[j] == pref[i]} { dp[j] },\n        max_{j: pref[j] > pref[i]} { dp[j] - (i - j) }\n  )\n\nWe can break the term (i-j) as:\n  For the first: dp[j] - j + i\n  For the third: dp[j] + j - i\n\nSo:\n  dp[i] = max( \n        i + max_{j: pref[j] < pref[i]} { dp[j] - j },\n        max_{j: pref[j] == pref[i]} { dp[j] },\n        -i + max_{j: pref[j] > pref[i]} { dp[j] + j }\n  )\n\nWe note that we also have the possibility of having a segment starting at j and ending at i, but note that j runs from 0 to i-1.\n\nWe are going to use three data structures:\n  1. For the condition pref[j] < pref[i]: we want to query the maximum value of (dp[j]-j) for all j with pref[j] < pref[i].\n  2. For pref[j] == pref[i]: we want the maximum dp[j] for j with pref[j] == pref[i].\n  3. For pref[j] > pref[i]: we want the maximum value of (dp[j]+j) for all j with pref[j] > pref[i].\n\nBut note: the constraints: total n <= 500000, but the pref[i] can be as low as -10^9 * 500000 which is too big for direct indexing. So we need to compress the prefix sums.\n\nHowever, note the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5e5\". So the total number of prefix values is at most 500000 (across test cases, but note each test case has its own n, and the total n<=500000). Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 500000\". So we can compress the prefix sums for each test case? But note: the test cases are independent.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases\" meaning the total number of elements in all test cases is <= 500000. So we can do:\n\n  For each test case, we have n (<=500000) and then the array of n integers. The total n over test cases <=500000.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Precompute the prefix array for the current test case: pref[0..n] (n+1 elements).\n  Then compress the array of pref[0..n] for the current test case.\n\nWe then use a segment tree or Fenwick tree for the three queries? Actually, we can use three Fenwick trees? But note we have three different queries. Alternatively, we can use one segment tree that supports range maximum queries? But we have three different arrays to update and query.\n\nAlternatively, we can use three separate Fenwick trees (or segment trees) for:\n  tree1: keyed by compressed prefix value, storing the maximum (dp[j]-j) for each prefix value (and then we query the max over the range [min, pref[i]-1]).\n  tree2: for the same prefix value, we store the maximum dp[j] (for j with that prefix).\n  tree3: for the same prefix value, storing the maximum (dp[j]+j) and then we query the range [pref[i]+1, max].\n\nBut note: we are updating as we go from j=0 to j=n. We are at i, and we update the trees with the value at j=i (which we just computed) for the prefix value pref[i].\n\nHowever, note that when we compute dp[i], we have already computed dp[j] for j=0 to i-1. Then we update the trees with the value for index i.\n\nBut note: the recurrence for dp[i] uses j from 0 to i-1. So we update after computing dp[i].\n\nBut note: the base case: j=0 -> pref[0]=0, and we have dp[0]=0.\n\nWe'll initialize:\n   dp[0] = 0.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n (i.e., for the prefix ending at i, which corresponds to the i-th element in the array, but note our array a is 0-indexed, so pref[1] = a0, pref[2]=a0+a1, ...).\n\nActually, note: \n   pref[0] = 0\n   pref[1] = a0\n   pref[2] = a0+a1\n   ... \n   pref[n] = a0+...+a_{n-1}\n\nAnd we are computing dp[i] for i from 0 to n? Actually, the problem: we are partitioning the entire array of n elements. So we need dp[n].\n\nBut note: the recurrence: \n   dp[i] = max over j in [0, i-1] of (dp[j] + f(j, i))\n\nBut note: the segment from j to i-1? Actually, the segment [j, i-1] in 0-indexed: \n   j: starting index (inclusive) and i: ending index (exclusive) for the segment? \n\nWait, the problem: the array is given as a_1, a_2, ... a_n. We are considering the prefix of length i: a_0 to a_{i-1}. Then the last segment is from j to i-1, and the next segment would start at i? \n\nBut note: the problem says: we are dividing the entire array. So we need to cover [0, n-1]. Therefore, we compute dp[n].\n\nSo the plan for one test case:\n\n  n = input\n  a = list of n integers\n\n  pref = [0]*(n+1)\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n  Compress the array pref (which has n+1 elements) to the range [0, len(unique)-1].\n\n  Initialize:\n      dp[0] = 0\n\n  We'll create three data structures (we'll use Fenwick trees for range maximum queries, but note: Fenwick tree for maximum is not as straightforward as for sums. We can use segment trees? But note the constraints: n<=500000, and total n over test cases <=500000, but note that the total n is the total number of elements in all test cases, so the worst-case test case might have n=500000? So we need an O(n log n) solution per test case? But note: the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can do one test case with n=500000 and then the rest are 0? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 500000\". So we can have up to 500000 test cases? But note: t (the number of test cases) can be up to 500000, but then each test case n=1. So worst-case t=500000, each n=1 -> total n=500000.\n\n  We'll create:\n      tree1: for the values (dp[j]-j) for each compressed prefix value. We want to query the maximum in the range [0, comp(pref[i])-1].\n      tree2: a dictionary for the same prefix? Actually, for the same prefix we only need the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. So we can use a simple dictionary? But note: we are updating as we go, and we want the maximum so far. So we can have an array for the compressed values? But we have to update and query the maximum for a given compressed index? We can do:\n\n          tree2[comp_val] = max(tree2.get(comp_val, -10**18), dp[j])\n\n      But then for the query for the same prefix: we just look up tree2[comp_val]? However, note that we are updating j in increasing order, so we can do that.\n\n      Similarly, for tree3: we want the maximum (dp[j]+j) for compressed prefix values in [comp(pref[i])+1, max_comp]. We can use a Fenwick tree for maximum? But note: we are updating and querying in increasing j? Actually, we are updating as we compute dp[j] for j from 0 to n. We can use a segment tree for the entire compressed range? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use one segment tree that supports point updates and range maximum queries? We can have two segment trees: one for (dp[j]-j) and one for (dp[j]+j). And then for the same prefix we can use a separate array.\n\n  However, note: for the same prefix, we are storing the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. We can update that with a simple array.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let comp = sorted(set(pref))\n      comp_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(comp)}\n\n      Initialize:\n          dp = [-10**18]*(n+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          # For tree1: segment tree for the range [0, len(comp)-1] for (dp[j]-j) -> we initialize with -10**18 for all positions.\n          seg1 = SegmentTree(len(comp))   # for max (dp[j]-j) at a compressed index\n          seg3 = SegmentTree(len(comp))   # for max (dp[j]+j) at a compressed index\n\n          # For tree2: we'll have an array for each compressed index: best2[comp_index] = maximum dp[j] for that prefix so far. Initialize with -10**18.\n\n          best2 = [-10**18] * len(comp)\n\n          # But note: we have to update at j=0:\n          idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]   # which is comp_map[0]\n          seg1.update(idx0, dp[0]-0)   # = 0\n          best2[idx0] = max(best2[idx0], dp[0])   # =0\n          seg3.update(idx0, dp[0]+0)   # =0\n\n      Then for i from 1 to n:\n          idx_i = comp_map[pref[i]]\n\n          # Query for pref[j] < pref[i]: that is compressed indices [0, idx_i-1]\n          q1 = seg1.query(0, idx_i)   # returns max (dp[j]-j) for j in [0, i-1] with pref[j] < pref[i] (by our compression, the indices in the compressed array that are less than idx_i correspond to pref values less than pref[i])\n          # But note: our compression: if we have duplicates, then we have to be careful. Actually, we compressed the set, so the mapping is monotonic: if a<b then comp_map[a] < comp_map[b]. So [0, idx_i-1] are the values strictly less than pref[i].\n\n          # Query for pref[j] == pref[i]: \n          q2 = best2[idx_i]   # the maximum dp[j] for j with pref[j] == pref[i] (so far)\n\n          # Query for pref[j] > pref[i]: compressed indices [idx_i+1, len(comp)-1]\n          q3 = seg3.query(idx_i+1, len(comp))\n\n          Then:\n          candidate1 = i + q1   # if q1 is -10**18, then candidate1 is very small\n          candidate2 = q2\n          candidate3 = -i + q3\n\n          dp[i] = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n          Then update:\n          # Update seg1: at index idx_i, we want to set seg1[idx_i] = max(seg1[idx_i], dp[i]-i)\n          seg1.update(idx_i, dp[i]-i)\n          best2[idx_i] = max(best2[idx_i], dp[i])\n          seg3.update(idx_i, dp[i]+i)\n\n      Then output dp[n]\n\n  However, note: the segment trees we use must support range maximum queries and point updates. We can use a Fenwick tree for maximum? But note: Fenwick tree for maximum is possible, but the update is a bit different: we do a point update and then we update the ancestors. But note: we are only updating at a point and then we want the maximum in a range.\n\n  But note: the Fenwick tree for maximum does not support arbitrary range maximum queries as easily as a segment tree. So we'll use a segment tree.\n\n  However, note the constraints: the compressed array has size = m (<= n+1, which is <=500001). We can build a segment tree with 4*m.\n\n  But note: the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of updates and queries is O(n) per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can build a segment tree for each test case? But the compressed size per test case is at most the number of distinct prefix sums in that test case (which is <= n+1, and n<=500000). But the total n over test cases is 500000, so the worst-case test case might have n=500000, so we build a segment tree of size 4*(500001) which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we have two segment trees per test case? And the total number of test cases t can be up to 500000? But wait: the total n over test cases is 500000, so the maximum t is 500000 (if each n=1). Then we would build 500000 * 2 segment trees? That would be 500000 * 2 * 4 * (1+1) = 4e6 * 2 = 8e6? Actually, for each test case, the compressed size is the number of distinct prefix sums. For n=1, the distinct prefix sums are 2: [0, a0]. So the segment tree would have 8 nodes? Then total memory: 500000 * 2 * 8 = 8e6 nodes? That is acceptable? But 8e6 nodes is about 8e6 * 4 (if each node is an integer) = 32e6 bytes = 32 MB? But we have two segment trees per test case -> 64 MB? And then we have other arrays? But note: the total n is 500000, so the total memory might be acceptable.\n\n  However, worst-case: 500000 test cases, each with n=1 -> 500000 test cases. We build two segment trees per test case, each with 8 nodes -> 500000 * 2 * 8 = 8e6 integers -> 64 MB? That might be acceptable? But we also have the arrays for the test cases: the total n is 500000, so we have 500000 numbers. So overall memory: 500000 (for the numbers) + 8e6 (for the segment trees) = 8.5e6 integers -> 68 MB? That is acceptable.\n\n  But note: worst-case t=500000, and each test case n=1, then we have 500000 test cases. We must be careful about the constant factors.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid building two segment trees for each test case by using a Fenwick tree that supports range maximum queries? Actually, the standard Fenwick tree is for range sums. For maximum, we can do:\n\n      We can use a Fenwick tree that supports point updates and prefix maximum queries? Then for the first query (pref[j] < pref[i]) we can do a prefix query at index idx_i-1. For the third query (pref[j] > pref[i]) we need a suffix maximum? We can build a Fenwick tree for the suffix? Or we can use a segment tree that supports range maximum.\n\n  However, note: we can also use two Fenwick trees: one for the entire array and then for the suffix we can do: we store the array in reverse? But that complicates.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a segment tree that we build once per test case. Since the total number of operations (update and query) per test case is O(n) and the segment tree per test case has O(m) nodes (m = number of distinct prefix sums) and each update/query is O(log m), the total time per test case is O(n log m). Since the total n over test cases is 500000, and the sum of n is 500000, then the total time is O(500000 * log(500000)) which is about 500000 * 19 = 9.5e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: worst-case, we have one test case with n=500000, then m = 500001? Then log2(500001) is about 19, so 500000*19 = 9.5e6 operations, which is acceptable in Pyton? Maybe in C++ but in Python we might be borderline? But note: the constraints say total n over test cases is 500000, so worst-case one test case with n=500000, then we do 500000*19 = 9.5e6 operations. In Python, 10^6 operations per second? Then 9.5e6 is acceptable.\n\n  However, we have two segment trees? So 2 * 9.5e6 = 19e6 operations? That might be acceptable.\n\n  But note: we also have the compression per test case: sorting the prefix array of size n+1 -> O(n log n) per test case. For one test case with n=500000, that is 500000*log2(500000) ~ 500000*19 = 9.5e6 comparisons? Then building the segment trees: each update is O(log m) and we do 2 updates per index (for the two segment trees) and 3 queries per index? Actually, we do 2 updates and 3 queries per index? Actually, per i (from 1 to n) we do 3 queries and 2 updates? So 5 * n * log m -> 5 * 500000 * 19 = 47.5e6 operations? That might be borderline in Python? But note: the operations in the segment tree are just comparisons and array lookups, so it might be acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree for maximum? But Fenwick tree for maximum only supports prefix maximum? Then for the third query (suffix) we can do: we store the array in reverse? \n\n  Let's design:\n\n      For the first part: we want max_{j: pref[j] < pref[i]} (dp[j]-j). We can use a Fenwick tree (for maximum) that supports:\n          update(i, value): set the value at position i to max(current, value)\n          query(i): maximum value in [0, i]\n\n      Then for the first query: we do query(idx_i-1).\n\n      For the third part: we want max_{j: pref[j] > pref[i]} (dp[j]+j). We can use another Fenwick tree for the suffix? But note: we can store the array for the entire range and then for the suffix we can do: we build a Fenwick tree that supports suffix? Actually, we can build a Fenwick tree for the entire array and then for the suffix [idx_i+1, m-1] we can do: we have a Fenwick tree that supports range maximum? But Fenwick tree for maximum does not naturally support arbitrary range maximum. We can do:\n\n          We build a Fenwick tree for the entire array for the array A[0..m-1] for the values (dp[j]+j) at the compressed index. Then to get the maximum in [l, r] we cannot do it directly? \n\n      Alternatively, we can reverse the array for the third part: \n          Let comp_rev = sorted(set(pref), reverse=True)\n          Then for the third part, we map the prefix value to an index in the reversed array? Then the condition pref[j] > pref[i] becomes a prefix condition in the reversed array? \n\n      Specifically, if we define:\n          comp_rev = sorted(set(pref), reverse=True)\n          comp_rev_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(comp_rev)}\n\n      Then for a prefix value x, we have:\n          In the reversed array, the index for x is comp_rev_map[x] = (m-1 - comp_map[x])? Not exactly: because if comp is sorted in increasing order, then comp_rev is decreasing. So the condition x>y in the original becomes comp_rev_map[x] < comp_rev_map[y]? \n\n      Actually, if we have two arrays: \n          comp: [v0, v1, v2, ..., v_{m-1}] in increasing order.\n          comp_rev: [v_{m-1}, v_{m-2}, ..., v0] in decreasing order.\n\n      Then for a value x, let i = comp_map[x] (in the increasing array) and j = comp_rev_map[x] (in the decreasing array). Then j = m-1-i.\n\n      Now, if we have two values: x and y. \n          If x < y, then in the increasing array: i < j, and in the decreasing array: comp_rev_map[x] = m-1-i, comp_rev_map[y] = m-1-j. Since i<j, then m-1-i > m-1-j. So in the decreasing array, x has a higher index than y.\n\n      Therefore, the condition: we want all values y such that y > x. In the decreasing array, these are the values that are greater than x? But note: the decreasing array is sorted from large to small. The values greater than x are the ones that come before x in the decreasing array? Actually, the decreasing array: \n          index0: largest value, index1: next, ... index_{m-1}: smallest.\n\n      So the values greater than x are the ones with index in [0, comp_rev_map[x]-1] in the decreasing array? \n\n      Therefore, we can build a Fenwick tree for the decreasing array for the values (dp[j]+j) and then query the prefix [comp_rev_map[x]-1]? \n\n      But note: we want the maximum in the range [comp_rev_map[x]+1, m-1] in the original increasing array? Actually, in the decreasing array, the indices are from 0 to m-1. The condition y > x corresponds to the indices in the decreasing array that are less than comp_rev_map[x]? Because the decreasing array is sorted from largest to smallest. So the values greater than x are the ones that appear before x in the decreasing array? \n\n      Actually, if we have the decreasing array: [10, 8, 5, 3] and x=5, then comp_rev_map[5]=2. The values greater than 5 are 10 and 8, which are at indices 0 and 1, which are less than 2.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          We build a Fenwick tree for the decreasing array for the entire range [0, m-1] for the values (dp[j]+j). Then for a given x, we query the prefix [comp_rev_map[x]-1] (if comp_rev_map[x]-1 >=0) to get the maximum (dp[j]+j) for y in the set of prefix values that are greater than x.\n\n      But note: if there are duplicates? Our compression for the decreasing array is the same set, so each value appears once. But note: we are storing at the compressed index the maximum value for that prefix value? Actually, we are updating at the compressed index for the prefix value. So we are storing one value per compressed index.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          Let m = len(comp)\n          Build Fenwick trees for maximum for the increasing array for the first part (for the condition <) and for the decreasing array for the third part (for the condition >).\n\n      Steps for one test case:\n\n          Precompute pref[0..n] (n+1 elements)\n          comp_inc = sorted(set(pref))\n          comp_rev = sorted(set(pref), reverse=True)\n          m = len(comp_inc)\n\n          # Map for increasing: \n          comp_inc_map = {}\n          for idx, val in enumerate(comp_inc):\n              comp_inc_map[val] = idx\n\n          comp_rev_map = {}\n          for idx, val in enumerate(comp_rev):\n              comp_rev_map[val] = idx\n\n          # Initialize:\n          dp = [-10**18]*(n+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          # Fenwick tree for the increasing array for (dp[j]-j): we'll call it fenw1, size = m\n          fenw1 = FenwMax(m)\n          # Fenwick tree for the decreasing array for (dp[j]+j): we'll call it fenw3, size = m (for the decreasing array, we use the comp_rev_map index)\n          fenw3 = FenwMax(m)\n\n          # For the same prefix (for the increasing array) we use an array for the increasing compressed index: best2 = [-10**18]*m\n\n          # Update j=0:\n          idx0_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[0]]   # for pref[0]=0\n          idx0_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[0]]   # for 0\n\n          fenw1.update(idx0_inc, dp[0]-0)   # =0\n          best2[idx0_inc] = max(best2[idx0_inc], dp[0])   # =0\n          fenw3.update(idx0_rev, dp[0]+0)   # =0\n\n          Then for i from 1 to n:\n              idx_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[i]]\n              idx_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[i]]\n\n              # Query for <: \n              q1 = fenw1.query(idx_inc-1)   # returns max in [0, idx_inc-1] for (dp[j]-j) for j in [0, i-1] with pref[j] in the set and mapped to index < idx_inc.\n\n              # Query for ==: \n              q2 = best2[idx_inc]\n\n              # Query for >: \n              # We want the maximum (dp[j]+j) for j with pref[j] > pref[i]. In the decreasing array, that corresponds to indices [0, idx_rev-1]? \n              # But note: the decreasing array: the values greater than pref[i] are the ones that come before the current value in the decreasing array? \n              # Actually, the decreasing array: index0: largest, then next, ... so the values greater than pref[i] are the ones with index in the decreasing array from 0 to idx_rev-1.\n              q3 = fenw3.query(idx_rev-1)   # if idx_rev-1 is negative, then we return -10**18.\n\n              candidate1 = i + q1\n              candidate2 = q2\n              candidate3 = -i + q3\n\n              dp[i] = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n              # Update:\n              # Update fenw1: at index_inc, with value = dp[i]-i\n              fenw1.update(idx_inc, dp[i]-i)\n              best2[idx_inc] = max(best2[idx_inc], dp[i])\n              fenw3.update(idx_rev, dp[i]+i)\n\n          Then output dp[n]\n\n      But note: the Fenwick tree for maximum: the update is setting the value at an index to the maximum of the current value and the new value. And the query for a prefix [0, i] returns the maximum in that prefix.\n\n      However, for the third part: we are storing the values in the decreasing array. But note: the same value (dp[j]+j) is stored at the index in the decreasing array corresponding to pref[j]. And we update the Fenwick tree for the decreasing array at the index idx_rev (which is the index in the decreasing array for pref[j]) with the value (dp[j]+j).\n\n      This should work.\n\n  Implementation of Fenwick tree for maximum (FenwMax):\n\n      We'll create an array tree of size m+1 (1-indexed) initialized to -10**18.\n\n      update(i, value): \n          i0 = i+1? Actually, we can do 1-indexed. \n          index = i+1\n          while index <= m:\n              tree[index] = max(tree[index], value)\n              index += index & -index\n\n      query(i): maximum in [0, i] (in the original 0-indexed, so i can be from -1 to m-1). But note: if i<0, we return -10**18.\n\n          if i < 0: return -10**18\n          index = i+1\n          res = -10**18\n          while index>0:\n              res = max(res, tree[index])\n              index -= index & -index\n          return res\n\n  But note: the Fenwick tree for maximum does not support arbitrary range maximum, but we only need prefix maximum.\n\n  However, note: the query for the third part: we are using the decreasing array and we query the prefix [0, idx_rev-1] in the decreasing array? Actually, we defined the Fenwick tree for the decreasing array to be 1-indexed and we store the values at the positions given by comp_rev_map. Then the query for the prefix [0, idx_rev-1] in the decreasing array is the same as the prefix in the Fenwick tree? \n\n  But note: the Fenwick tree for the decreasing array is built on the indices 0..m-1 (mapped to 1..m). So when we update at index i (0-indexed in the decreasing array), we update position i+1. Then query for prefix [0, k] (0-indexed) is the maximum over indices 0 to k.\n\n  So for the third part: we want the maximum for indices [0, idx_rev-1] in the decreasing array? That is the prefix of length idx_rev (if we consider 0-indexed, then from 0 to idx_rev-1). So we call fenw3.query(idx_rev-1).\n\n  But note: if idx_rev==0, then we query fenw3.query(-1) -> we define that to return -10**18.\n\n  We'll define:\n\n      def query(self, i):   # i is 0-indexed, and we want [0, i] (if i<0, return -10**18)\n          if i < 0:\n              return -10**18\n          i += 1\n          s = -10**18\n          while i:\n              s = max(s, self.tree[i])\n              i -= i & -i\n          return s\n\n      But wait: the standard Fenwick tree for maximum: the update is:\n\n          def update(self, i, val):\n              i += 1\n              while i <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[i]:\n                      self.tree[i] = val\n                  i += i & -i\n\n      However, this update is not correct for maximum? Because the Fenwick tree for maximum does not support arbitrary updates: if we update a point to a larger value, then we update the tree. But if we update to a smaller value, we don't? But in our case, we are updating with the maximum? Actually, we are doing:\n\n          fenw1.update(idx, value)   # we want to set the value at idx to the maximum of the current value and the new value.\n\n      So we should do:\n\n          current = ...? But we don't store the current value? We can do:\n\n          We update by propagating the new value and updating the tree if the new value is greater.\n\n      But note: we are updating each index multiple times (for different j that map to the same prefix value). We want the maximum value at that index. So we do:\n\n          When updating, we compare the new value with the current value stored in the Fenwick tree? But the Fenwick tree stores the maximum for the entire segment? Actually, we cannot update to a smaller value? We only update if the new value is larger.\n\n      However, the Fenwick tree for maximum is usually built for the case where we only update each index once? But we update the same index multiple times? That is okay: we update with the maximum value that we have seen so far.\n\n      But note: the Fenwick tree for maximum does not naturally support updating the same index multiple times? Actually, it does: we update the same index with a new value that might be larger. Then we update the tree by propagating the new value to the ancestors. But if the new value is not larger than the current value, we break? Actually, we must update the tree even if the new value is not larger? No, because we are storing the maximum. We only update if the new value is larger than the current value? But we don't know the current value? \n\n      We can store an array base[0..m-1] for the current maximum at each index? Then when updating index i with value v, we compare v with base[i]. If v>base[i], then we update the tree and set base[i]=v. Otherwise, we skip.\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid storing base by doing a query at the single index? But that would be O(log m) to query the current value? Then we update only if the new value is larger? \n\n      But note: we are updating the same index multiple times? And we want the maximum value at that index. So we can do:\n\n          We maintain an array base of length m (for each compressed index) for the current maximum for that index? Then we update the Fenwick tree only if the new value is greater than the current base.\n\n      However, we are already storing best2 for the increasing array for the same purpose? But for the Fenwick trees, we are storing two different quantities: \n          fenw1: stores (dp[j]-j) for the increasing array index of pref[j]\n          fenw3: stores (dp[j]+j) for the decreasing array index of pref[j]\n\n      And we update when we compute a new j. So we can do:\n\n          When updating fenw1 at index i (in the increasing array) with value v = dp[j]-j:\n              if v > current_base1[i]:\n                  current_base1[i] = v\n                  fenw1.update(i, v)   # which propagates the update\n\n          Similarly for fenw3.\n\n      But then we need two arrays: base1 and base3? \n\n      Alternatively, we can update unconditionally? But that would be inefficient? Because the update in Fenwick tree for maximum is O(log m) and we do it for every j? And the total n is 500000, so total updates 500000*2 = 1e6, which is acceptable? But note: the update in Fenwick tree for maximum: we update the entire tree? Actually, the update is O(log m). So 1e6 * log2(500000) ~ 1e6 * 19 = 19e6, which is acceptable.\n\n      But note: if we update unconditionally, then we are updating even if the new value is not larger? Then the Fenwick tree will store the last value? But we want the maximum. So we must update only if the new value is larger? \n\n      How to do without storing base? We can't. So we store base1 and base3.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          base1 = [-10**18] * m   # for the increasing array for fenw1: base1[i] = max (dp[j]-j) for j that map to compressed index i (so far)\n          base3 = [-10**18] * m   # for the decreasing array for fenw3: base3[i] = max (dp[j]+j) for j that map to compressed index i (so far)\n\n          Then when updating fenw1 at index i (in the increasing array) with value v:\n              if v > base1[i]:\n                  base1[i] = v\n                  fenw1.update(i, v)\n\n          Similarly for fenw3.\n\n      But note: we are updating the same index multiple times? And we want the maximum? So we do the above.\n\n  However, we are already storing best2 for the same prefix for the increasing array? But best2 is for dp[j] (without subtracting j). So we cannot reuse.\n\n  So we'll have:\n\n      base1 = [-10**18] * m   # for fenw1: (dp[j]-j) at increasing index\n      base3 = [-10**18] * m   # for fenw3: (dp[j]+j) at decreasing index\n\n      And best2 = [-10**18] * m   # for the same prefix (in the increasing array) for dp[j]\n\n  Then for each j (from 0 to n) we update:\n\n      base1[i] = max(base1[i], dp[j]-j)\n      then update fenw1 at i with base1[i]? Actually, we update only if we have a new maximum? \n\n      Alternatively, we can update base1 and then update the Fenwick tree? But we want to update the Fenwick tree only when base1[i] increases? \n\n  We'll do:\n\n      v1 = dp[j]-j\n      if v1 > base1[i_inc]:\n          base1[i_inc] = v1\n          fenw1.update(i_inc, v1)\n\n      Similarly for base3 and fenw3.\n\n  And for best2:\n      if dp[j] > best2[i_inc]:\n          best2[i_inc] = dp[j]\n\n  Then we don't need to update the Fenwick trees every time? Only when we get a larger value.\n\n  But note: we are updating j in increasing order. It is possible that we get a larger value later? So we do the above.\n\n  However, note: we are updating j in increasing order, and we are updating the same compressed index multiple times? For example, if we have multiple j with the same pref[j], then we update the same compressed index multiple times.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the Fenwick tree update is O(log m) per update, and the total number of updates is at most n (each j updates at most two Fenwick trees) and n<=500000, so worst-case 500000*2 = 1e6 updates, and each update O(log m) -> 1e6 * 19 = 19e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, worst-case: one test case with n=500000, and all prefix values are distinct? Then we update each index once -> 500000*2 = 1e6 updates? Actually, 500000 for fenw1 and 500000 for fenw3 -> 1e6 updates? Then 19e6 operations? That is acceptable.\n\n  But note: worst-case, the same prefix value appears many times? Then we update the same index in the Fenwick tree many times? But the number of updates per index is the frequency of that prefix value. The total updates is n, so worst-case 500000 updates per Fenwick tree? Then 500000*log(m) per Fenwick tree? Then total 500000*19*2 = 19e6? That is acceptable.\n\n  So we'll implement:\n\n      class FenwMax:\n          def __init__(self, size):\n              self.n = size\n              self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)   # 1-indexed\n\n          def update(self, i, val):   # i is 0-indexed\n              # update the tree: we want to set the value at i to at least val? But we are storing the maximum. We update the tree so that the prefix maximums are updated.\n              # But note: we are updating only when we have a new maximum for the base at i? Then we update the tree.\n              idx = i+1\n              while idx <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[idx]:\n                      self.tree[idx] = val\n                  else:\n                      # if we don't update, we still break? No, because we might need to update ancestors? Actually, we must update ancestors even if we don't update the current node? \n                      # But if the current node is not updated, then the ancestors might be? Actually, the Fenwick tree for maximum: we update the current node and then the ancestors? But if we don't update the current node, then the ancestors might be updated? Actually, no: because the new value is not greater than the current value at this node, then it won't affect the ancestors? \n                      # But wait: the ancestors cover multiple nodes. The new value might be greater than the current value in an ancestor? But we are updating from the leaf: if the leaf doesn't get updated, then the ancestors won't get updated? \n                      # Actually, we break out? But the update procedure for Fenwick tree for maximum: we update the current node and then the ancestors. We don't break early? \n                      # However, if we don't update the current node, then we don't need to update the ancestors? Because the new value is not greater than the current value at the leaf, so it cannot be greater than the ancestors? \n                      # But consider: the ancestors are the maximum of a range that includes this leaf. If the new value is not greater than the current value at the leaf, then the maximum of the range that includes the leaf might not change? \n                      # So we can break? \n                      # Actually, we can break? But the standard update for Fenwick tree for maximum does not break? It updates the entire chain? But if we break, then we don't update the ancestors? \n                      # However, we are updating only when we have a new maximum at the leaf? Then we must update the entire chain? \n                      # But if we break, then we skip updating the ancestors? \n                      # Actually, we must update the entire chain? Because the current node might be updated? But we did update the current node? We did: if val>self.tree[idx]: then set self.tree[idx]=val. Then we update the ancestors? \n                      # But if we don't update the current node, then we break? \n                      # Actually, we can break? \n                      # But the standard update does not break? \n                      # Let me check: \n                      #   while idx <= self.n:\n                      #       if val > self.tree[idx]:\n                      #           self.tree[idx] = val\n                      #       idx += idx & -idx\n                      # This is the standard update? \n                      # But that is not correct: because if we update a leaf to a larger value, we update the leaf and then the ancestors? But if we update to a smaller value, we skip? \n                      # Actually, the standard update for maximum is: \n                      #   while i <= n:\n                      #       tree[i] = max(tree[i], value)\n                      #       i += i & -i\n                      # So we update every node along the chain? \n                      # Why? Because even if the new value is not greater than the current node, it might be that the current node is the maximum of a segment that includes other leaves? And we are updating a leaf? But if we update a leaf to a value that is not greater than the current maximum of the segment, then the segment maximum doesn't change? \n                      # So we can break? \n                      # Actually, we can break if we are updating only when we have a new maximum at the leaf? But wait: we are updating the leaf only when we have a new maximum at that leaf? Then we must update the ancestors? \n                      # But if we break, then we don't update the ancestors? \n                      # So we must update the ancestors unconditionally? \n                      # Actually, no: because the leaf is updated to a new maximum, then we update the ancestors: we set the current node to the new value, and then we update the ancestors: we set the ancestors to the maximum of their children? But the Fenwick tree for maximum does not store the maximum of the children? It stores the maximum of a range that is the union of disjoint segments? \n                      # The Fenwick tree for maximum is not standard? \n\n      Actually, the Fenwick tree for maximum is not as straightforward as for sums. The update must update every node that covers the leaf? And we set tree[i] = max(tree[i], value) for every node that covers the leaf? \n\n      But that is O(log n) per update? And we do it unconditionally? \n\n      However, if we update unconditionally, then we do O(log n) per update? And the total updates is n, so total O(n log n) per test case? Which is acceptable.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          def update(self, i, val):\n              i += 1\n              while i <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[i]:\n                      self.tree[i] = val\n                  i += i & -i\n\n      But note: this update might be inefficient if we update the same leaf many times and the value is not increasing? But in our case, we update only when we have a new maximum? Actually, we are updating with increasing values? Because we update the same leaf only when we get a larger value? \n\n      But wait: we are updating the same leaf (same compressed index) with values that might be increasing? Then we update the leaf and the ancestors only when we get a larger value? But the update procedure above updates the entire chain every time? \n\n      However, we are updating only when we have a new maximum at that leaf? Then we do:\n\n          base1 = [-10**18] * m\n          for each j:\n              v1 = dp[j]-j\n              if v1 > base1[i_inc]:\n                  base1[i_inc] = v1\n                  fenw1.update(i_inc, v1)   # and in the update, we update the entire chain? \n\n      But then the update is O(log m) per update, and the total number of updates is at most n (because each j updates at most one leaf) -> total O(n log m) per test case? \n\n      Alternatively, we can update without storing base1? We can update the Fenwick tree unconditionally? But then we update every j? And the update is O(log m) per j? Then total O(n log m) per test case? \n\n      And we are already doing O(n log m) for the queries? \n\n      So we can skip storing base1 and base3? We update the Fenwick trees for every j? \n\n      Then we don't need base1 and base3? \n\n      But note: the update for the Fenwick tree for maximum: we update the entire chain? And we do it for every j? Then the total time per test case is O(n log m) for the updates and O(n log m) for the queries? Then total O(n log m) per test case? \n\n      And the total n over test cases is 500000, so worst-case one test case with n=500000, then m<=500001, log m ~ 19, so 500000*19*4 (two Fenwick trees: two updates and two queries per j? Actually, per j we do: \n          update fenw1: O(log m)\n          update fenw3: O(log m)\n          query fenw1: O(log m)\n          query fenw3: O(log m)\n          and also update best2: O(1)\n      So 4 * O(log m) per j? Then 500000 * 4 * 19 = 38e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we can do without base1 and base3? \n\n  But note: the update for the Fenwick tree for maximum: we update the entire chain even if the new value is not greater than the current value in the tree? \n\n  However, the tree might have a value from a previous j that is larger? Then we don't need to update if the new value is not greater? But we don't know the current value in the tree? \n\n  We can store the current value at the leaf? Then we can avoid updating if the new value is not greater? \n\n  But then we are back to storing base1? \n\n  Alternatively, we can update unconditionally? But then we do:\n\n      In the update function for fenw1: \n          i0 = i+1\n          while i0 <= n:\n              if val > tree[i0]:\n                  tree[i0] = val\n              i0 += i0 & -i0\n\n      This is the standard update for maximum Fenwick tree. It updates the entire chain, but if the new value is not greater, it doesn't change the tree? \n\n      But note: it might be that the new value is not greater than the current tree[i0], but it might be that tree[i0] is from a different leaf? And we are updating a leaf that is covered by this segment? Then we don't update? \n\n      Actually, the tree[i0] stores the maximum of a segment that includes the leaf i. If we update leaf i to a value that is not greater than the current maximum of the segment, then we don't update? \n\n      But that is correct: we only update if we have a new maximum for the segment? \n\n      However, the leaf i might be updated multiple times? And we want the tree to reflect the maximum value at leaf i? But the tree does not store the leaf value? It stores the maximum of a segment. \n\n      The update procedure is correct: it updates every segment that contains leaf i, setting the segment maximum to the maximum of the current segment maximum and the new value? \n\n      So we can update unconditionally? \n\n      But then we update every j? \n\n      And the update is O(log m) per j? \n\n      And we have two Fenwick trees? So 2 * n * log m per test case? \n\n      And the total n over test cases is 500000, so worst-case one test case with n=500000, then 2 * 500000 * 19 = 19e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      class FenwMax:\n          def __init__(self, size):\n              self.n = size\n              self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)\n\n          def update(self, i, val):\n              # i: 0-indexed\n              idx = i+1\n              while idx <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[idx]:\n                      self.tree[idx] = val\n                  idx += idx & -idx\n\n          def query(self, i):\n              # i: 0-indexed, we want max in [0, i] (if i<0, return -10**18)\n              if i < 0:\n                  return -10**18\n              idx = i+1\n              s = -10**18\n              while idx:\n                  if self.tree[idx] > s:\n                      s = self.tree[idx]\n                  idx -= idx & -idx\n              return s\n\n  Then for the test case:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          # Compute prefix\n          pref = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          # Compress the prefix array for the current test case\n          comp_inc = sorted(set(pref))\n          comp_rev = sorted(set(pref), reverse=True)\n          m_inc = len(comp_inc)\n          m_rev = len(comp_rev)   # same as m_inc\n\n          # Create mapping\n          comp_inc_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(comp_inc)}\n          comp_rev_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(comp_rev)}\n\n          # Initialize data structures\n          fenw1 = FenwMax(m_inc)   # for increasing array: stores (dp[j]-j) at the increasing index of pref[j]\n          fenw3 = FenwMax(m_rev)   # for decreasing array: stores (dp[j]+j) at the decreasing index of pref[j]\n          best2 = [-10**18] * m_inc   # for the increasing array: stores the maximum dp[j] for each compressed index\n\n          dp = [-10**18]*(n+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          # Update j=0:\n          idx0_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[0]]\n          idx0_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[0]]\n\n          fenw1.update(idx0_inc, dp[0]-0)\n          best2[idx0_inc] = max(best2[idx0_inc], dp[0])\n          fenw3.update(idx0_rev, dp[0]+0)\n\n          for i in range(1, n+1):   # i from 1 to n: we are computing dp[i] for the prefix ending at i (which is the i-th prefix, with length i)\n              idx_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[i]]\n              idx_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[i]]\n\n              q1 = fenw1.query(idx_inc-1)   # for pref[j] < pref[i]\n              q2 = best2[idx_inc]            # for pref[j] == pref[i]\n              q3 = fenw3.query(idx_rev-1)    # for pref[j] > pref[i]: in the decreasing array, the indices [0, idx_rev-1] correspond to values greater than pref[i]\n\n              candidate1 = i + q1\n              candidate2 = q2\n              candidate3 = -i + q3\n\n              dp[i] = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n              # Update for this i (which is the j for future indices)\n              # Update fenw1: with (dp[i]-i) at index_inc\n              fenw1.update(idx_inc, dp[i]-i)\n              if dp[i] > best2[idx_inc]:\n                  best2[idx_inc] = dp[i]\n              fenw3.update(idx_rev, dp[i]+i)\n\n          # Output dp[n] for this test case\n          print(dp[n])\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=500000, so we are doing a loop over n for each test case? And the sum of n over test cases is 500000, so the total operations is 500000 * (log m) * 4? And m is at most the number of distinct prefix sums in the test case, which is at most n+1, and the total n is 500000, so the worst-case m is 500001? Then log2(500001) ~ 19, so 500000*19*4 = 38e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n  However, worst-case: 500000 test cases, each with n=1? Then the total n=500000, and for each test case we do:\n      n=1: \n          pref = [0, a0] -> m_inc=2, m_rev=2.\n          Then we do:\n              dp[0]=0, then update.\n              then i=1: \n                  q1 = fenw1.query(idx_inc-1)   # idx_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[1]] = comp_inc_map[a0]. \n                  q2 = best2[idx_inc]   # which is -10**18? because we haven't updated for this index? \n                  But we updated for j=0: which is pref[0]=0. \n                  For i=1: pref[1]=a0.\n                  If a0 != 0, then idx_inc for a0 is not the same as for 0? \n                  Then best2[idx_inc] is -10**18? \n                  q3 = fenw3.query(idx_rev-1)   # similarly.\n\n          But note: we updated for j=0 at index0_inc (for 0) and index0_rev (for 0). \n          For i=1: \n              candidate1: i + q1 = 1 + fenw1.query(comp_inc_map[a0]-1)\n                  We need to know: are there any j (which is j=0) with pref[j] < pref[1]? \n                  That is: 0 < a0? \n                  If a0>0, then comp_inc_map[0] < comp_inc_map[a0]? \n                  Then q1 = fenw1.query(comp_inc_map[a0]-1) = the maximum in [0, comp_inc_map[a0]-1] -> which includes the index for 0? \n                  So q1 = dp[0]-0 = 0.\n                  candidate1 = 1+0 = 1.\n              candidate2: best2[comp_inc_map[a0]] = -10**18 -> skip.\n              candidate3: -1 + fenw3.query(comp_rev_map[a0]-1) \n                  comp_rev_map[a0]: if a0>0, then in the decreasing array: [a0, 0]? \n                  comp_rev_map[a0] = 0? \n                  then query(0-1) = query(-1) = -10**18.\n              so dp[1]=1.\n\n          Then we update for j=1: \n              fenw1.update(comp_inc_map[a0], dp[1]-1 = 0)\n              best2[comp_inc_map[a0]] = max(-10**18, 1) = 1\n              fenw3.update(comp_rev_map[a0], dp[1]+1 = 2)\n\n          Then output dp[1] = 1.\n\n          But what is the expected? \n          The array has one element: a0.\n          We have only one partition: [a0]. \n          The value = 1 if a0>0, 0 if a0==0, -1 if a0<0.\n          But we computed dp[1]=1? \n          If a0>0, that is correct. \n          If a0<0, then we computed candidate1: \n              pref[1]=a0<0, then we need to check: \n                  j=0: pref[0]=0, which is > a0? -> then in the third part: \n                  q3 = fenw3.query(comp_rev_map[a0]-1): \n                      comp_rev_map[a0]: in the decreasing array [0, a0]? \n                      comp_rev_map[0]=0, comp_rev_map[a0]=1? \n                  Then we query comp_rev_map[a0]-1 = 0? \n                  q3 = fenw3.query(0) = the maximum in [0,0] in the decreasing array? \n                  We updated for j=0: at comp_rev_map[0]=0: value = dp[0]+0=0.\n                  So q3=0.\n                  candidate3 = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\n          Then dp[1] = max( candidate1, candidate2, candidate3 ) = max( 1 (if a0>0) or ...? \n          Actually, for a0<0: \n              candidate1: we query for j with pref[j] < a0: none? because a0 is the smallest? so q1 = -10**18 -> candidate1 = -10**18.\n              candidate2: best2[comp_inc_map[a0]] = -10**18? \n              candidate3: -1 + 0 = -1.\n          So dp[1] = -1.\n\n          That is correct.\n\n          For a0=0:\n              candidate1: j with pref[j] < 0: none -> q1 = -10**18.\n              candidate2: best2[comp_inc_map[0]] = 0? because we updated j=0 at comp_inc_map[0] with dp[0]=0.\n              candidate3: j with pref[j] > 0: none? so q3 = -10**18.\n              dp[1]=0.\n\n          Correct.\n\n  Therefore, we'll implement as above.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=500000, so we must be careful to not do an O(n^2) solution.\n\n  However, we are doing O(n log m) per test case, and the total n over test cases is 500000, so it's acceptable.\n\n  But note: the worst-case might be one test case with n=500000, then we do 500000 * 19 * 4 = 38e6 operations? That is acceptable in Pyton? We hope.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can read the entire input at once? \n\n  We are reading:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  But the total n is 500000, so we can read all test cases? \n\n  But note: the total n is the sum of the n's of the test cases, so we can read:\n\n      import sys\n      data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n      t = int(data[0])\n      index = 1\n      results = []\n      for i in range(t):\n          n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n          a = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n          index += n\n          # then process\n\n  This is faster.\n\n  But the problem says the total n over test cases <=500000, so we can do that.\n\n  We'll do that to avoid slow input.\n\n  However, the problem also says t can be up to 500000, but then each n=1, so the total numbers to read is 500000*2 = 1e6? Then reading 1e6 numbers is acceptable.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      import sys\n      data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n      t = int(data[0])\n      index = 1\n      out_lines = []\n      for i in range(t):\n          n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n          a = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n          index += n\n\n          # Compute prefix\n          pref = [0] * (n+1)\n          for j in range(1, n+1):\n              pref[j] = pref[j-1] + a[j-1]\n\n          # Compress the prefix array\n          comp_inc = sorted(set(pref))\n          comp_rev = sorted(set(pref), reverse=True)\n          m_inc = len(comp_inc)\n          m_rev = len(comp_rev)\n\n          comp_inc_map = {}\n          for idx, val in enumerate(comp_inc):\n              comp_inc_map[val] = idx\n          comp_rev_map = {}\n          for idx, val in enumerate(comp_rev):\n              comp_rev_map[val] = idx\n\n          # Initialize data structures\n          fenw1 = FenwMax(m_inc)\n          fenw3 = FenwMax(m_rev)\n          best2 = [-10**18] * m_inc\n\n          dp = [-10**18] * (n+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          # Update j=0\n          if pref[0] in comp_inc_map:   # it must be\n              idx0_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[0]]\n          else:\n              # should not happen\n              idx0_inc = 0\n          if pref[0] in comp_rev_map:\n              idx0_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[0]]\n          else:\n              idx0_rev = 0\n\n          fenw1.update(idx0_inc, dp[0]-0)\n          best2[idx0_inc] = max(best2[idx0_inc], dp[0])\n          fenw3.update(idx0_rev, dp[0]+0)\n\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              # Get the compressed indices for pref[i]\n              if pref[i] in comp_inc_map:\n                  idx_inc = comp_inc_map[pref[i]]\n              else:\n                  # should not happen\n                  idx_inc = 0\n              if pref[i] in comp_rev_map:\n                  idx_rev = comp_rev_map[pref[i]]\n              else:\n                  idx_rev = 0\n\n              q1 = fenw1.query(idx_inc-1)\n              q2 = best2[idx_inc]\n              q3 = fenw3.query(idx_rev-1)\n\n              candidate1 = i + q1\n              candidate2 = q2\n              candidate3 = -i + q3\n\n              dp[i] = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n              # Update for j=i\n              fenw1.update(idx_inc, dp[i]-i)\n              if dp[i] > best2[idx_inc]:\n                  best2[idx_inc] = dp[i]\n              fenw3.update(idx_rev, dp[i]+i)\n\n          out_lines.append(str(dp[n]))\n\n      print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n  We must define FenwMax.\n\n  But note: the FenwMax for the decreasing array: the size is m_rev, which is the same as m_inc? \n\n  We'll define FenwMax as above.\n\n  However, note: the FenwMax for the decreasing array: the query for the prefix [0, idx_rev-1] is defined in the decreasing array's index space. But the decreasing array has the same size as the increasing array.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the worst-case value: we use -10**18. But the values of dp[i] can be as low as -n? and n<=500000, so -500000. But we are storing dp[i]-i: which can be as low as -500000 - 500000 = -10^6? So -10**18 is safe.\n\n  Let's hope.\n\n  However, note: the problem constraints: a_i in [-10^9, 10^9], and n<=500000, so the prefix sums can be as large as 5e5 * 10^9 = 5e14? But we are compressing, so that's fine.\n\n  We'll run on the sample: \n      Test case 1: [1,2,-3] -> n=3\n      pref = [0,1,3,0]\n\n      We expect dp[3]=1.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          comp_inc = sorted(set([0,1,3,0])) = [0,1,3]\n          comp_rev = [3,1,0]\n\n          comp_inc_map: 0->0, 1->1, 3->2\n          comp_rev_map: 3->0, 1->1, 0->2\n\n          dp[0]=0.\n\n          Update j=0: \n              idx0_inc = comp_inc_map[0]=0\n              idx0_rev = comp_rev_map[0]=2\n              fenw1: update index0 with 0-0=0 -> tree1: [0] at index0? \n              best2[0]=0\n              fenw3: update index2 (in the decreasing array) with 0+0=0.\n\n          i=1: pref[1]=1\n              idx_inc = 1, idx_rev = 1 (because comp_rev_map[1]=1)\n              q1 = fenw1.query(0) = fenw1.query(0) = the maximum in [0,0] = 0? \n                  candidate1 = 1+0 = 1.\n              q2 = best2[1] = -10**18\n              q3 = fenw3.query(0) = the maximum in [0,0] in the decreasing array? \n                  The decreasing array: we have updated index2 (for 0) but not index0 (for 3) or index1 (for 1). \n                  So at index0: -10**18, index1: not updated? \n                  But we only updated index2. \n                  The query for [0,0] (in the decreasing array) is the value at index0? which is -10**18? \n                  So q3 = -10**18.\n              dp[1]=1.\n\n              Then update for i=1:\n                  fenw1.update(1, 1-1=0)   # so at index1 in increasing array: set to 0.\n                  best2[1] = max(-10**18, 1) = 1\n                  fenw3.update(1, 1+1=2)   # at index1 in decreasing array: set to 2.\n\n          i=2: pref[2]=3\n              idx_inc=2, idx_rev=0\n              q1 = fenw1.query(1)   # [0,1]: we have index0=0, index1=0 -> max=0? \n                  candidate1 = 2+0=2\n              q2 = best2[2] = -10**18\n              q3 = fenw3.query(-1) = -10**18   # because idx_rev-1 = -1\n              dp[2]=2\n\n              update:\n                  fenw1.update(2, 2-2=0)\n                  best2[2]=2\n                  fenw3.update(0, 2+2=4)\n\n          i=3: pref[3]=0\n              idx_inc=0, idx_rev=2\n              q1 = fenw1.query(-1) = -10**18   # because idx_inc-1 = -1\n              q2 = best2[0] = 0   # because we updated j=0: best2[0]=0, and then we haven't updated it again? \n              q3 = fenw3.query(1)   # in the decreasing array: we want [0,1]? \n                  The decreasing array: \n                      index0: 4 (from i=2)\n                      index1: 2 (from i=1)\n                  so q3 = max(4,2)=4? \n                  candidate3 = -3+4 = 1.\n              dp[3]=max(0,1)=1.\n\n          So we get 1.\n\n      Test case 2: [0, -2, 3, -4] -> n=4\n          pref = [0,0,-2,1,-3]\n\n          comp_inc = sorted(set([0,0,-2,1,-3])) = [-3,-2,0,1]\n          comp_rev = [1,0,-2,-3]\n\n          comp_inc_map: -3->0, -2->1, 0->2, 1->3\n          comp_rev_map: 1->0, 0->1, -2->2, -3->3\n\n          dp[0]=0 -> update:\n              idx0_inc = comp_inc_map[0]=2 -> fenw1: update index2 with 0\n              best2[2]=0\n              idx0_rev = comp_rev_map[0]=1 -> fenw3: update index1 with 0\n\n          i=1: pref[1]=0 -> idx_inc=2, idx_rev=1\n              q1 = fenw1.query(1) -> [0,1]: \n                  We have updated only index2? \n                  So we query [0,1]: \n                      In the increasing array: \n                         index0: -10**18, index1: -10**18 -> max = -10**18? \n                  candidate1 = 1 + (-10**18) = -10**18\n              q2 = best2[2]=0\n              q3 = fenw3.query(0) -> [0,0] in the decreasing array: \n                  We have updated index1 (for 0) and not index0? \n                  The decreasing array: \n                      index0: not updated -> -10**18\n                  so q3 = -10**18\n              dp[1]=0\n\n              update:\n                  fenw1.update(2, 0-1 = -1)   # but we already have 0 at index2? Then we update to 0? No: we update to max(0, -1)? \n                  But our update: \n                      In FenwMax.update: we update the entire chain: \n                         We set tree at index2+1=3? and then ancestors? \n                  But note: we are updating with -1? which is less than 0? So the tree remains 0? \n                  But we want to store the maximum? So it remains 0? \n                  However, we are updating with a new value that is not greater? Then the tree remains? \n                  But we want to store the maximum for the leaf? \n                  But we have a new j (j=1) that has the same prefix value 0? and we want the maximum (dp[j]-j) for that leaf? \n                  We have two j: j=0: 0, j=1: -1 -> the maximum is 0? \n                  So we don't need to update? \n                  But our update function: \n                      It updates the tree only if the new value is greater? \n                  So we don't update? \n                  But then we lose the fact that we have a new j? \n                  Actually, we don't: because we are storing the maximum per leaf? \n                  So we should update only if the new value is greater? \n                  But we did not store the base? \n\n          We see the problem: we are updating the Fenwick tree unconditionally? But the Fenwick tree stores the maximum over the segment. We are updating with the new value? But if the new value is not greater than the current maximum in the segment, we don't update? \n          However, the leaf might be part of a segment that has a maximum from a different leaf? \n\n          Actually, the Fenwick tree stores the maximum of the entire segment. We are updating a leaf? Then we want to update the segments that contain that leaf to the maximum of the leaf? But if the leaf has multiple values (from different j) then we want the maximum of the leaf? \n\n          How do we get that? We must update the leaf to the maximum value that we have seen so far? \n\n          Therefore, we must store the current maximum for the leaf? And update the Fenwick tree only when we have a new maximum for the leaf? \n\n          So we go back to storing base1 and base3? \n\n          We'll store:\n              base1[i] = current maximum of (dp[j]-j) for the leaf i (in the increasing array)\n              base3[i] = current maximum of (dp[j]+j) for the leaf i (in the decreasing array)\n\n          Then when we update, we do:\n\n              if v > base1[i]:\n                  base1[i] = v\n                  fenw1.update(i, v)\n\n          Similarly for base3.\n\n          And for best2: we are already storing the maximum dp[j] for the leaf.\n\n          Then we update the Fenwick tree only when we have a new maximum for the leaf? \n\n          This is necessary.\n\n  Therefore, we change:\n\n      base1 = [-10**18] * m_inc\n      base3 = [-10**18] * m_rev   # note: m_rev = m_inc, but the indices are different\n\n      Then for j=0:\n          v1 = dp[0]-0 = 0\n          if v1 > base1[idx0_inc]:\n              base1[idx0_inc] = v1\n              fenw1.update(idx0_inc, v1)\n          Similarly for base3 and fenw3.\n\n      Then for i in range(1, n+1):\n          ... compute dp[i] ...\n\n          v1 = dp[i]-i\n          if v1 > base1[idx_inc]:\n              base1[idx_inc] = v1\n              fenw1.update(idx_inc, v1)\n\n          if dp[i] > best2[idx_inc]:\n              best2[idx_inc] = dp[i]\n\n          v3 = dp[i]+i\n          if v3 > base3[idx_rev]:\n              base3[idx_rev] = v3\n              fenw3.update(idx_rev, v3)\n\n  Note: for base3, we are storing in the decreasing array index space.\n\n  But note: the same leaf in the increasing array and the decreasing array are different indices? \n      For a value x, we have:\n          idx_inc = comp_inc_map[x]\n          idx_rev = comp_rev_map[x]\n      They are different.\n\n  So we need two base arrays: base1 for the increasing array and base3 for the decreasing array? \n\n  But note: the leaf in the increasing array and the leaf in the decreasing array for the same value x are different. And we update both? \n\n  However, we are updating the same value x with two different quantities: \n      base1: for the increasing array, we store the maximum (dp[j]-j) for j with pref[j]=x.\n      base3: for the decreasing array, we store the maximum (dp[j]+j) for j with pref[j]=x.\n\n  And we update the Fenwick trees accordingly.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Let's run the sample [0, -2, 3, -4] again:\n\n      pref = [0,0,-2,1,-3]\n\n      comp_inc = [-3,-2,0,1] -> m=4\n      comp_rev = [1,0,-2,-3]\n\n      base1 = [-10**18]*4   # for increasing array\n      base3 = [-10**18]*4   # for decreasing array\n      best2 = [-10**18]*4   # for increasing array: dp[j]\n\n      j=0: \n          x = pref[0]=0 -> idx_inc = 2, idx_rev = comp_rev_map[0]=1.\n          v1 = 0-0=0 -> base1[2]=0, update fenw1 at 2 with 0.\n          best2[2]=0\n          v3 = 0+0=0 -> base3[1]=0, update fenw3 at 1 with 0.\n\n      i=1: pref[1]=0\n          idx_inc=2, idx_rev=1.\n          q1 = fenw1.query(1) = maximum in [0,1] in the increasing array? \n              The increasing array: \n                 index0: base1[0] = -10**18 -> not updated? \n                 index1: base1[1] = -10**18\n              So q1 = -10**18? \n          q2 = best2[2]=0\n          q3 = fenw3.query(0) = maximum in [0,0] in the decreasing array? \n              base3[0] = -10**18 -> not updated? \n              so q3 = -10**18\n          dp[1]=0\n\n          Then update:\n              v1 = 0-1 = -1 -> compare with base1[2]=0 -> not greater, so skip.\n              best2[2] = max(0,0)=0 -> remains 0.\n              v3 = 0+1=1 -> compare with base3[1]=0 -> greater, so update:\n                  base3[1]=1\n                  fenw3.update(1,1)\n\n      i=2: pref[2]=-2\n          idx_inc = 1, idx_rev = comp_rev_map[-2]=2.\n          q1 = fenw1.query(0) = base1[0]? -> -10**18? \n          q2 = best2[1] = -10**18\n          q3 = fenw3.query(1) = maximum in [0,1] in the decreasing array? \n              base3[0] = -10**18, base3[1]=1 -> so q3=1\n          candidate3 = -2 + 1 = -1\n          dp[2] = -1\n\n          update:\n              v1 = -1-2 = -3 -> compare with base1[1] (-10**18) -> update: base1[1]=-3, fenw1.update(1,-3)\n              best2[1] = -1\n              v3 = -1+2=1 -> compare with base3[2] (-10**18) -> update: base3[2]=1, fenw3.update(2,1)\n\n      i=3: pref[3]=1\n          idx_inc=3, idx_rev=0.\n          q1 = fenw1.query(2) = maximum in [0,2] in the increasing array? \n              base1[0]=-10**18, base1[1]=-3, base1[2]=0 -> max=0\n          candidate1 = 3+0=3\n          q2 = best2[3] = -10**18\n          q3 = fenw3.query(-1) = -10**18\n          dp[3]=3\n\n          update:\n              v1 = 3-3=0 -> compare with base1[3] (-10**18) -> update: base1[3]=0, fenw1.update(3,0)\n              best2[3]=3\n              v3 = 3+3=6 -> update base3[0]=6, fenw3.update(0,6)\n\n      i=4: pref[4]=-3\n          idx_inc=0, idx_rev=3.\n          q1 = fenw1.query(-1) = -10**18\n          q2 = best2[0] = -10**18\n          q3 = fenw3.query(2) = maximum in [0,2] in the decreasing array? \n              base3[0]=6, base3[1]=1, base3[2]=1 -> max=6\n          candidate3 = -4+6=2\n          dp[4]=2\n\n          But expected is 2? \n\n          However, the sample says: the optimal partition is [0,-2,3] and [-4] -> value = 3 (for [0,-2,3]: length=3, sum=1>0) + (-1) (for [-4]: length=1, sum=-4<0) = 2.\n\n          So we output 2.\n\n  Therefore, we'll implement with base arrays.\n\n  Summary for program1.py:\n\n      We'll define a class FenwMax that does not store base, but we will store base arrays separately and update the Fenwick tree only when we have a new maximum for the leaf.\n\n      We'll read the entire input at once.\n\n      We'll output the answer for each test case.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=500000, so we are safe.\n\n  We'll output the missing code for program1.py as a string.\n\n  But note: the provided code for program1.py already has some code?
