But note the conditions are checked in order. Since we already checked for >=1900 (which is Division 1), then the next condition (>=1600) will cover ratings from 1600 to 1899. So we just need to print 'Division 2' in that block. So the missing line for program1.py is:\n        print('Division 2') But note: the code for program1.py is already provided and we are only to fill in the missing part.

So to fix one element we need one swap (and we have to fix (n-m) elements). But we can also use multiple clones? Actually, the known solution (from the sample) is:\n\n          Let m = max frequency. if m == n:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              cnt = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  cnt += 1   # this is for a clone\n                  # Then we can swap: we can use the clone to provide up to m x's?

But the swaps are already accounted for by (n-m)? Actually, the provided code sets ans = n-m initially. Then in the while loop, we are going to add the clone operations? How many clone operations? The same k as above. So we can do:\n\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n              m *= 2\n\n          Then total ans = (n-m_initial) + (number of clones) But in the example: n=6, m=2 -> ans initially = 4. Then in the while loop:\n            m=2 -> 2<6 -> ans=5, m=4. m=4<6 -> ans=6, m=8 -> break. Then print(6) -> correct. In the small example: n=3, m=1 -> ans initially=2. Then while loop:\n            m=1<3 -> ans=3, m=2. m=2<3 -> ans=4, m=4 -> break. Then print(4) -> correct. But wait: why is the clone operation added once per iteration? And why do we double m?

But the clone A1 after the first swap becomes [2,2,3] and doesn't have a 1? So we must do: Operation1: clone -> A0=[1,2,3], A1=[1,2,3]\n          Operation2: swap A0[1] (2) with A1[0] (1) -> A0=[1,1,3], A1=[2,2,3] Then we need to fix the 3 in A0. We don't have a 1 in A1? So we need to clone again? Operation3: clone A0 -> A2 = [1,1,3] (but we want 1's, so we can use A2 to fix A0? but A2 has two 1's and one 3). Operation4: swap A0[2] (3) with A2[0] (1) -> A0 becomes [1,1,1] -> done. So 4 operations. Therefore, the formula: total operations = (number of clones) + (number of swaps) = 2 (clones) + 2 (swaps) = 4. But note: the number of clones is k=2, and the number of swaps is (n-m)=2. So the total operations = k + (n-m) = 2+2=4. However, the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n          ans = n - m   # which is 2\n          while (m < n):\n              # TODO:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code is almost complete. We are missing the condition for Division 2.\nThe current code:\n  if int(z) >= 1900: Division 1\n  elif int(z) >= 1600: [TODO]\n  elif int(z) >= 1400: Division 3\n  else: Division 4\n\nNote that the condition for Division 2 is: 1600 <= rating <= 1899.\nBut note the conditions are checked in order. Since we already checked for >=1900 (which is Division 1), then the next condition (>=1600) will cover ratings from 1600 to 1899. So we just need to print 'Division 2' in that block.\n\nSo the missing line for program1.py is:\n        print('Division 2')\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py is already provided and we are only to fill in the missing part. The missing part is in the block for the condition \"elif int(z) >= 1600:\". We just need to output the print statement.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about making a copy of the array that has all elements equal with minimal operations.\n\nThe operations are:\n1. Clone an array (each clone operation counts as one operation).\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (each swap counts as one operation).\n\nWe are given the array and we can do any number of swaps and clones.\n\nThe idea from the note: \n- In the first test case, all are already equal -> 0 operations.\n- In the second test case, we did 6 operations.\n\nThe provided code in program2.py:\n  from collections import Counter\n  for li in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # This skips the first two lines? Actually, the input format: first integer t, then for each test case: n and then the array. So [2::2] takes every second line starting from index 2 (i.e., the array lines).\n      n = len(li := li.split())   # This splits the line and sets n to the number of elements? But note: the array has n elements, so this is correct.\n      m = max(Counter(li).values())   # m is the frequency of the most common element.\n\n      ans = n - m   # This sets ans to the number of elements that are not the most frequent.\n\n      while (m < n):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      print(ans)\n\nWe need to complete the while loop.\n\nExplanation of the approach:\n\nWe start with one copy. We want to create a copy that has all elements equal. We can do:\n\n1. If the array is already all equal (m == n), then we need 0 operations.\n\nOtherwise, we can think:\n\nOperation 1: We can clone the array (1 operation). Then we have two copies.\n\nNow, we can swap elements between the copies. The goal is to have one copy that becomes all the same.\n\nNote: We are allowed to swap any two elements from any two copies (and any positions). So we can use the other copies as a reservoir to get the desired element.\n\nBut note: we are not limited to two copies? We can do multiple clones.\n\nThe minimal number of operations:\n\nWe can do the following:\n\n- First, we note that we can use the following strategy:\n\n  Let m be the maximum frequency of any element.\n\n  Step 1: We start with one copy. We want to have a copy that has all the same element (say x, which is the most frequent). We have m copies of x in the initial array.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  Operation 1: Clone the array. Now we have two copies.\n\n  Then we can swap one of the non-x elements in the first copy with an x from the second copy. This swap operation will increase the count of x in the first copy by 1 (and decrease in the second, but we don't care about the second). \n\n  But note: we can do multiple swaps and multiple clones.\n\n  Actually, the known solution for this problem:\n\n  Let m = max frequency.\n\n  We start with one copy. We need to get a copy that has n copies of x (the most frequent element). We are missing (n - m) of x.\n\n  How do we get them? We can use cloning and swapping.\n\n  Operation steps:\n\n  - Initially, we have one copy: A0.\n\n  - We clone to get A1. Then we can swap an element in A0 that is not x with an element in A1 that is x. This gives A0 one more x. We used 2 operations (clone and swap) to get one more x in A0.\n\n  But wait, we can do better: after we have two copies, we can do multiple swaps? Actually, we can do one clone and then multiple swaps? However, note that each swap is one operation.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  Operation 1: clone -> now we have two copies. Then we can swap as many as we want? But note: we can only swap one pair per operation.\n\n  However, we can also clone again to get more copies to have more x's to swap.\n\n  The known solution from similar problems (like Codeforces Round 751 (Div. 2), problem B) is:\n\n      if m == n:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          operations = 0\n          while m < n:\n              operations += 1   # for the clone operation\n              # Then we can swap: we can take min(m, n-m) x's from the clone to the main array? \n              # Actually, after cloning, we have two copies. Then we can swap at most m non-x elements in the main array with x's in the clone? But note: the clone also has m x's? Actually, the clone is identical so it has m x's.\n\n              # How many swaps can we do? We can swap at most m non-x elements in the main array? Actually, we can swap as many as we have x's in the clone? But we don't want to take all because then we break the clone? Actually, we can use the clone as a reservoir: we can take up to m x's from the clone to put into the main array.\n\n              # But note: we can do multiple swaps in one go? Actually, each swap is one operation. However, the problem does not restrict the number of swaps per operation? Actually, each swap is one operation.\n\n          So the above while loop in the provided code is:\n\n          ans = n - m   # initially, we have to fix (n-m) elements.\n\n          while m < n:\n              # We do one clone operation: that gives us one more copy (with m x's in it). Then we can use that copy to swap? But how many swaps can we do? We can do as many swaps as we have x's in the clone? Actually, we can do at most m swaps (because the clone has m x's) and that would fix m elements? But wait, we can only fix one element per swap? Actually, each swap fixes one element in the target array (the one we want to make all x) by bringing one x to it.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to do multiple swaps arbitrarily? But each swap is one operation.\n\n          But the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n          Let m = max frequency.\n          if m == n:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              ans = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n                  # Then we can swap: we can use the clone to provide x's to the main array. How many? We can swap up to m elements (because the clone has m x's) in one set of swaps? But note: we are allowed to do as many swaps as we want, but each swap is one operation.\n\n                  # However, the known solution is more efficient: after cloning, we can swap to fix m elements? Actually, we can fix m elements at the cost of m swaps? But then the total operations for this step would be 1 (clone) + m (swaps) = m+1.\n\n                  # But then we update m: we have increased the number of x in the main array by m? Actually, we started with m, then we get m more from the clone? Then m becomes 2*m? But wait, we are not limited to one clone.\n\n          Actually, the known solution (from the sample code of the problem) is:\n\n          ans = 0\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1   # this is for the clone\n              # Then we can swap: we can use the current available x's (which is m) to swap and fix m elements? But note: we can fix m elements in the main array by swapping each non-x with an x from the clone? Then the main array becomes: m (original) + m (from the clone) = 2*m? But wait, we cannot get more than the entire clone's x's? Actually, we can only get m x's from the clone.\n\n              # Then the main array now has m (original) + m (from the clone) = 2*m? But note: we are swapping one non-x in the main array with one x in the clone. So each swap increases the count of x in the main array by 1. So after m swaps, the main array has m + m = 2*m x's.\n\n              # Then we set m = 2*m? \n\n              m *= 2\n\n          Then the total operations: ans (for clones) + (number of swaps). But wait, we did m swaps for each clone? And we are counting the clone as one operation, but the swaps are additional operations? \n\n          However, in the provided code, we have:\n\n          ans = n - m   # This is set to the number of non-x? But then we are going to do a while loop and update ans? Actually, the provided code sets ans = n-m initially, which is the number of non-x? But that doesn't match.\n\n          Let me look at the known solution from Codeforces for the problem \"Two Arrays\" (or similar). Actually, the problem is from Codeforces Round 751 (Div. 2), problem B: \"Divine Array\".\n\n          The known solution for the minimal operations:\n\n          We start with one array. We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone (1 op) -> now we have two arrays.\n\n          Then we can swap: we can take x's from the second array to replace non-x's in the first array. Each swap is one op. So to fix one element we need one swap (and we have to fix (n-m) elements). But we can also use multiple clones? \n\n          Actually, the known solution (from the sample) is:\n\n          Let m = max frequency.\n          if m == n:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              cnt = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  cnt += 1   # this is for a clone\n                  # Then we can swap: we can use the clone to provide up to m x's? So we can fix m elements? Then the number of fixed elements becomes m + m = 2*m? \n                  m *= 2\n              print(cnt)\n\n          But wait, that doesn't account for the swaps? The problem says each swap is an operation. In the above, we are only counting the clone operations.\n\n          However, note the example: \n          Test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (for 0? but note: 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice -> so m=2). \n          Then according to the while loop:\n            m=2 -> less than 6 -> cnt=1, then m=4.\n            m=4 < 6 -> cnt=2, then m=8 (which is >=6) -> so cnt=2.\n\n          But the example says 6 operations. \n\n          Alternatively, the known solution from the editorial:\n\n          The minimal number of operations is:\n\n          Let m = max frequency.\n\n          We start with one array. We need to have an array with all x. We are missing (n-m) x's.\n\n          How do we get them? We can clone the array and then swap. Each clone gives us a new array that has m x's. Then we can swap one non-x in the target array with one x in the clone. Each such swap is one operation. But we can also use the same clone for multiple swaps? \n\n          However, we can also clone again to get more x's? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          Operation 1: clone -> 1 operation, now we have two arrays. Then we can swap up to m times (because the clone has m x's) to get m more x's in the target array. Then the target array now has 2*m x's. The cost: 1 (clone) + m (swaps) = m+1.\n\n          Then if 2*m < n, we do again: clone again (so we have three arrays) and then we can swap up to 2*m times (because the target now has 2*m x's? Actually, no: the target is the one we are building, and we are going to use the other clones? Actually, we can use the original or the first clone? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following strategy:\n\n          Step 1: We have the original array A0. We want to build a copy that is all x. We can create a clone A1 (1 op). Then we swap non-x in A0 with x in A1. We can do up to m swaps (because A1 has m x's). Then A0 now has m + m = 2*m x's. The cost so far: 1 (clone) + m (swaps) = m+1.\n\n          Step 2: If 2*m < n, we create another clone A2 (from A0? but A0 now has 2*m x's) -> 1 op. Then we swap non-x in A0 with x in A2: we can swap up to 2*m times? But wait, we only need (n - 2*m) more x's? Actually, we can swap as many as we can (up to 2*m) to get 2*m more? Then A0 becomes 4*m? The cost for step2: 1 (clone) + 2*m (swaps) = 2*m+1.\n\n          Then total cost = (m+1) + (2*m+1) = 3*m+2? \n\n          But the example: n=6, m=2.\n\n          Step1: clone (1 op) and then 2 swaps -> total 3 operations. Then A0 becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> but wait, we swapped two non-x? Actually, we swapped two non-x (the 1 and 7) with two zeros from A1? Then A0 becomes [0,0,3,3,0,0] -> that has 4 zeros? So now m0 = 4.\n\n          Step2: we need 2 more zeros. We clone A0 to get A2 (which has 4 zeros) -> 1 op. Then we swap two non-x (the two 3's) in A0 with two zeros in A2? Then A0 becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> done. The swaps: 2 operations. Total: 1 (first clone) + 2 (first swaps) + 1 (second clone) + 2 (second swaps) = 6.\n\n          So the total operations = 6.\n\n          How to compute this without simulation?\n\n          We note that after k steps, the number of x's in the target array is: m * (2^k) ? Actually, at step1: 2*m, step2: 4*m, ... until we have at least n.\n\n          But the operations per step:\n\n          Step0: we have m x's.\n          Step1: we do 1 clone and m swaps -> cost = m+1, and we get 2*m x's.\n          Step2: we do 1 clone and 2*m swaps? Actually, we can only swap as many as we need? But we can swap up to the current number of x's in the clone (which is the same as the current x's in the target array from the previous step? Actually, when we clone the target array at step1, the clone has 2*m x's. Then we can swap up to 2*m non-x's in the target array? But the target array at step1 has 2*m x's and (n - 2*m) non-x's. So we only need to swap (n - 2*m) non-x's? \n\n          However, we can do as many swaps as we have x's in the clone? But we don't need to swap more than necessary. So the number of swaps in step i is min(remaining, current_available_x) where current_available_x = m * (2^(i-1))? \n\n          But the problem says we can do any number of swaps arbitrarily? So we can do exactly the number of swaps we need? \n\n          Therefore, the total operations would be:\n\n          Let k be the number of clone operations. Then the total operations = (number of clone operations) + (number of swaps).\n\n          The number of swaps is the total number of non-x we fix? But note: we start with m x's, and we need to fix (n-m) non-x's. So the total swaps is (n-m)? \n\n          But wait: we can fix multiple non-x's in one clone step? Actually, in the first clone step we fix m non-x's? Then in the next we fix 2*m? But that would be more than needed? \n\n          Actually, we fix:\n\n          Step0: fixed = m\n          Step1: we fix min(m, n-m) -> but we can fix up to m? Then fixed becomes m + min(m, n-m) = min(2*m, n)\n          Step2: we fix min(2*m, n - fixed) -> but we can fix up to 2*m? \n\n          Alternatively, we can fix as many as we have in the clone? But we don't need to fix more than the remaining.\n\n          Therefore, the total swaps is exactly (n - m) because we need to replace (n-m) non-x's? \n\n          And the clone operations: we do one clone to get a new array, and then we use that array to swap. But note: we can use the same clone for multiple swaps? But we can also do multiple clones? \n\n          However, we can use one clone to fix up to the number of x's in that clone? Then we might need multiple clones.\n\n          The minimal number of clones: we need to have enough x's to cover the non-x's. We start with m. Then we clone to get m more? Then we can fix m non-x's. Then we have 2*m. Then we clone again to get 2*m more? Then we can fix 2*m non-x's? \n\n          Actually, the number of clones is the minimal k such that: m * (2^k) >= n.\n\n          Then the total operations = k (for clones) + (n - m) (for swaps) ? \n\n          But wait: in the example, k=2 because 2*(2^1)=4 < 6, and 2*(2^2)=8>=6 -> k=2. Then total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 2+4=6. This matches.\n\n          Why? Because we need to do k clones, and then we do (n-m) swaps? But note: we are not limited by the clone's x's? Actually, we have k clones, but we can use each clone to swap as many as we want? Actually, we can use the same clone multiple times? The problem says: we can swap two elements from any two copies. So we can use one clone to swap multiple times? \n\n          Therefore, we don't need to do a clone for every swap. We do:\n\n          - One clone: then we can use that clone to swap up to m times (because the clone has m x's). Then we have fixed m non-x's.\n\n          - Then we do a second clone: then we can use that clone to swap up to 2*m times? Actually, the second clone is taken from the current state of the target array? After the first swaps, the target array has 2*m x's? Then the second clone has 2*m x's? Then we can swap up to 2*m non-x's? But we only have (n - 2*m) non-x's left? \n\n          So the total swaps is the total non-x's: (n-m). And the clones: we need to have at least one clone for each time we want to double the available x's? The minimal k such that m * (2^k) >= n.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations = k + (n-m) ?\n\n          But wait: in the example, k=2 and n-m=4 -> 6, which matches.\n\n          However, let me test with a small example: n=3, m=1 (array [1,2,3] and we choose 1 as the most frequent? Actually, all are distinct so m=1). Then we need to fix 2 non-1's.\n\n          k: minimal k such that 1 * (2^k) >= 3 -> k=2 (because 2^2=4>=3).\n\n          Then total operations = 2 + (3-1) = 2+2=4.\n\n          How?\n          Step1: clone -> 1 op. Then we swap one non-1 (say 2) in the target with the 1 in the clone? Then the target becomes [1,1,3] -> now m0=2. Then we do a second clone? Then we swap the 3 in the target with a 1 in the second clone? Then the target becomes [1,1,1]. Total: 1 (clone1) + 1 (swap1) + 1 (clone2) + 1 (swap2) = 4.\n\n          But wait, the formula: k=2 (clones) and swaps=2 -> total 4.\n\n          However, note: we don't need to do a clone for every swap? We can do:\n\n          Operation1: clone -> now two arrays: A0=[1,2,3], A1=[1,2,3].\n          Operation2: swap A0[1] (which is 2) with A1[0] (which is 1) -> A0 becomes [1,1,3], A1 becomes [2,2,3]? \n          Operation3: swap A0[2] (which is 3) with A1[0] (which is 2) -> but wait, A1[0] is now 2? We want a 1? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the same clone for multiple swaps? But the clone A1 after the first swap becomes [2,2,3] and doesn't have a 1? \n\n          So we must do:\n\n          Operation1: clone -> A0=[1,2,3], A1=[1,2,3]\n          Operation2: swap A0[1] (2) with A1[0] (1) -> A0=[1,1,3], A1=[2,2,3]\n          Then we need to fix the 3 in A0. We don't have a 1 in A1? So we need to clone again? \n\n          Operation3: clone A0 -> A2 = [1,1,3] (but we want 1's, so we can use A2 to fix A0? but A2 has two 1's and one 3). \n          Operation4: swap A0[2] (3) with A2[0] (1) -> A0 becomes [1,1,1] -> done.\n\n          So 4 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the formula: total operations = (number of clones) + (number of swaps) = 2 (clones) + 2 (swaps) = 4.\n\n          But note: the number of clones is k=2, and the number of swaps is (n-m)=2.\n\n          So the total operations = k + (n-m) = 2+2=4.\n\n          However, the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n          ans = n - m   # which is 2\n          while (m < n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          Then we update ans? \n\n          How do we update? We know we need to add the number of clones? \n\n          Actually, the while loop condition is m < n. We are going to double m until it becomes >= n. The number of clones is the number of times we double? \n\n          But note: in the while loop, we are going to do:\n\n          while m < n:\n              # We do one clone: so we add one operation? But wait, the problem: the clone is one operation and then we do swaps? But the swaps are already accounted for by (n-m)? \n\n          Actually, the provided code sets ans = n-m initially. Then in the while loop, we are going to add the clone operations? \n\n          How many clone operations? The same k as above.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n          while m < n:\n              ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n              m *= 2\n\n          Then total ans = (n-m_initial) + (number of clones)\n\n          But in the example: n=6, m=2 -> ans initially = 4. Then in the while loop:\n            m=2 -> 2<6 -> ans=5, m=4.\n            m=4<6 -> ans=6, m=8 -> break.\n          Then print(6) -> correct.\n\n          In the small example: n=3, m=1 -> ans initially=2. Then while loop:\n            m=1<3 -> ans=3, m=2.\n            m=2<3 -> ans=4, m=4 -> break.\n          Then print(4) -> correct.\n\n          But wait: why is the clone operation added once per iteration? And why do we double m? \n\n          Explanation: \n          - The initial ans = n-m: that is the number of swaps we will do (each swap fixes one non-x). \n          - Then we add one operation for each clone we do. And the doubling of m represents that after a clone we can use the clone to swap up to the current m (which then becomes 2*m) but we don't actually use the entire m? We are just accounting for the fact that we are going to double the available x's in the target array? \n\n          However, note: the number of clones is the minimal k such that m_initial * (2^k) >= n. And we are adding k to the initial ans (which is n-m_initial). \n\n          Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n          while (m < n):\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          But note: the condition in the while loop is m < n, and we update m to 2*m. This is the same as counting the number of clones needed.\n\n          However, let me test with the example from the note: \n          First test case: all equal -> m = n, so skip the while loop -> ans = n-m = 0 -> output 0.\n\n          Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (if we choose 0? but note: 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice -> m=2). Then ans = 6-2 = 4. Then while: \n            m=2 -> 2<6 -> ans=5, m=4.\n            m=4<6 -> ans=6, m=8 -> break. Output 6.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          while (m < n):\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          But note: the problem says the total number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps. The initial ans = n-m (which is the number of swaps) and then we add the number of clones (which is the number of times we enter the loop). \n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, note: the doubling of m is just to simulate the condition for breaking the loop? We are not actually using m for anything else? \n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          And for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n              print('Division 2')\n\n          But note: in program1.py, the condition for Division 2 is the block that is currently a TODO. We must output the exact code that goes in that block.\n\n          Therefore, the answer in JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"        print('Division 2')\",\n            \"program2\": \"        ans += 1\\n        m *= 2\"\n          }\n\n          However, note the indentation: in program1.py, the missing line is at the same indentation level as the other print statements. In the provided code, it is indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside two loops: the for loop and the if). But the existing print statements are indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code:\n\n          for i in range(int(x)):\n              z = input()\n              if ...:\n                  print(...)   # indented by 8 spaces: 4 for for, 4 for if\n              elif ...:\n                  # TODO -> then we need to put a print with the same indentation.\n\n          So we output \"        print('Division 2')\" (with 8 spaces).\n\n          For program2.py, the existing code:\n\n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to put two lines: \n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          But note: the existing code has the while loop body indented. We should use the same indentation? The existing code uses 4 spaces per level. The while loop is already indented (from the for loop) by 4, then the body should be 8? But the existing code has:\n\n          for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              n=len(li:=li.split());\n              m = max(Counter(li).values())\n              ans =n-m\n              while(m<n):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The body of the while loop should be indented by 4 more? So 8 spaces? But the initial code uses 4? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n          The existing code: the for loop body is indented by 4, and the while loop body is also indented by 4 (relative to the while). So the TODO is at 8 spaces? Actually, no: the for loop body is 4, then the while loop is 4, then the body of the while is 8? \n\n          But the provided code in the problem for program2.py has:\n\n          for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              n=len(li:=li.split());\n              m = max(Counter(li).values())\n              ans =n-m\n              while(m<n):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the while body is indented by 4 relative to the while. Therefore, we should output:\n\n          \"        ans += 1\\n        m *= 2\"\n\n          (with 8 spaces: 4 for the for loop, 4 for the while, and then 4 for the body? Actually, the for loop body is already at 4, then the while is at 4 (so the while is at 4, then the body of the while is 8). But the existing code has the while condition at the same level as the body? Actually, the while condition is at the same level as the for body? Then the body of the while is indented by 4 more? So 8 in total.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\n          Since the TODO comment is at the same indentation level as the body of the while, we use 8 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use one tab? But the problem says to output the missing code. We'll use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n          Therefore, the two lines for program2.py should be indented by 8 spaces (two levels of 4).\n\n          But note: the initial code for program2.py has:\n\n          for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              n=len(li:=li.split());\n              m = max(Counter(li).values())\n              ans =n-m\n              while(m<n):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The while body is currently one line (a comment). We are replacing that with two lines. So:\n\n          while(m<n):\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          But the existing code has a semicolon after the n=len(...) and a comma in the for loop? We don't change that.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              ans += 1\n              m *= 2\n\n          with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the while loop body is indented by 4 relative to the while. The while is at 4 (relative to the for). So the body should be 8 relative to the top.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"        print('Division 2')\",\n            \"program2\": \"        ans += 1\\n        m *= 2\"\n          }\n\n          However, note: the program1.py code has the condition for Division 2 as:\n\n          elif int(z) >= 1600:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with a print statement. We must not break the existing structure.\n\n          And for program2.py, we are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n          But note: the program2.py code has a while loop that currently has a comment. We are replacing that comment with two lines? Actually, we are replacing the entire block of the TODO? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the line with the comment with two lines.\n\n          Alternatively, we can leave the comment and add the two lines? But the problem says \"fill in\" the missing lines. We should remove the comment? But the problem does not specify. However, the example output does not include the comment.\n\n          We'll output the two lines without the comment.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer."
