    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is its length if the sum is positive, negative of its length if the sum is negative, and 0 if the sum is zero.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum sum. The missing part is inside the loop for i in range(1, n+1). After updating dp[i], we are supposed to update the dictionary `dmx` (which stores the best dp value for a given prefix sum) if the current dp[i] is greater than the current value for the prefix sum at i.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the problem constraints are high and we are using a Fenwick tree and a dictionary. The dictionary `dmx` is used for the case when we have the same prefix sum. We want to store the maximum dp value for a given prefix.\n\nHowever, note that the condition in the code already has:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we should update `dmx[pref[i]]` to be at least dp[i]. But note that the condition checks if dp[i] is greater than the current value. So we can simply set:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if there are multiple indices with the same prefix? We want the maximum dp value for that prefix. The condition ensures that we only update when we have a better value. So we can do:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is only true when dp[i] is greater than the current value. So we set it to dp[i]. However, it is possible that we have an even larger value from a previous index? Actually, we are iterating from 0 to n, and we update as we go. The condition checks the current value and updates only if we have a new maximum. So that is safe.\n\nBut note: the condition is written as:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we need to update the dictionary. We can write:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so updating the dictionary is O(1) per operation.\n\nTherefore, the missing line in program1.py is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has a line above that updates the Fenwick trees. The missing part is only the update of the dictionary.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is a stone game on a circle. The key is to analyze the game when the number of piles is even or odd.\n\nIn the provided code, for even n, they split the piles into two sets: the odd-indexed (0-indexed) and even-indexed. Then they compute:\n    m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1   [where i1 is the index of the minimum in a1]\n    m2 = min(a2) * len(a2) + i2\n\nThen they compare m1 and m2 to decide the winner.\n\nBut note: the note in the problem says that in the second test case (which is even) Joe wins. The second test case: [1,1] -> Joe wins. The code for even is already implemented.\n\nFor odd n (the else branch), we have to implement.\n\nThe key idea for the odd case: since Mike goes first and the number of piles is odd, Mike can force a win? Actually, note that the game is symmetric except that the piles are in a circle and the moves are forced in order.\n\nHowever, known solution for this problem (Circular Stone Game) is:\n\nIf n is odd, then Mike wins. Why? Because Mike can take the first pile entirely in his first move. Then the circle becomes a line starting from the next pile. But note: the next move is Joe on the second pile. However, the known solution is:\n\n  if n is odd: Mike wins\n  if n is even: then we compare the minimums on even and odd positions? Actually, the provided even case does:\n\n      a1 = [A[i] for i in range(0, N, 2)]   # even indices? Actually, 0-indexed: index0, index2, ... (which are the odd positions in 1-indexed? Actually, the problem says pile1, pile2, ...)\n\nBut note: the problem states: \"the first line of each test case contains a single integer n, the next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... an\".\n\nThe piles are arranged in a circle: pile1, pile2, ... pile n, then pile1 again.\n\nThe provided even case does:\n\n    a1 = [A[i] for i in range(0, N, 2)]   # indices 0,2,4,... (which correspond to pile1, pile3, ...)\n    a2 = [A[i] for i in range(1, N, 2)]   # indices 1,3,5,... (which correspond to pile2, pile4, ...)\n\nThen it finds the index of the minimum in a1 and a2 (the first occurrence). Then it computes:\n\n    m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1\n    m2 = min(a2) * len(a2) + i2\n\nBut note: the purpose of this is to break ties? Actually, the known solution for even n is:\n\n  if the minimum in the even-indexed piles (0-indexed: odd positions) is less than the minimum in the odd-indexed piles, then Joe wins? Or vice versa?\n\nBut the note: \"In the second test case, Joe can just copy Mike's moves every time.\" -> the second test case: [1,1] -> even. The code prints \"Mike\" if m1>m2, else \"Joe\". For [1,1]:\n  a1 = [1] (from index0), a2=[1] (from index1)\n  min(a1)=1, min(a2)=1\n  i1 = 0, i2=0\n  m1 = 1*1+0 = 1\n  m2 = 1*1+0 = 1 -> so m1 is not greater than m2 -> prints \"Joe\", which is correct.\n\nBut what if the minima are equal? Then we break by the index? Actually, the known solution is to compare the index of the first occurrence of the minimum in the even positions and the odd positions? The code uses:\n\n    m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1\n    m2 = min(a2) * len(a2) + i2\n\nThis is a way to assign a value that breaks ties: if the minima are equal, then the one with the smaller index (i1 or i2) in its own array will have a lower value? But note: we are adding the index. Actually, the index here is the position in the array (0-indexed in the subarray). \n\nBut the known solution for even n is: \n  if the minimum value in the even-indexed piles (0-indexed) is greater than the minimum in the odd-indexed piles, then Mike wins? Actually, no.\n\nWait, the known solution is:\n\n  if n is odd: Mike wins.\n  if n is even: \n        we find the minimum value and the first occurrence of that minimum. If the first occurrence is at an even index (0-indexed: meaning pile1, pile3, ...) then Mike wins? Or Joe?\n\nActually, the solution is: \n  if n is odd: Mike wins.\n  if n is even: \n        let m0 = min(a0, a2, a4, ...) and m1 = min(a1, a3, ...)\n        if m0 > m1: then Joe wins? \n        or if m0 < m1: then Mike wins? \n\nBut the sample [1,1] -> Joe wins. So when the minima are equal, Joe wins? \n\nBut the code does: \n        print(\"Mike\" if m1 > m2 else \"Joe\")\n\nIn [1,1]: m1=1, m2=1 -> so it prints \"Joe\", which is correct.\n\nBut what if the minima are different? \nExample: [1,2] (n=2, even)\n  a1 = [1] (from index0), a2=[2] (from index1)\n  m1 = 1*1+0 = 1\n  m2 = 2*1+0 = 2\n  then m1 < m2 -> so we print \"Joe\". \n\nBut is that correct? \n  Piles: [1,2] in a circle. \n  Mike goes first. He can take 1 stone from pile1 (index0) -> then pile1 becomes 0. Then Joe must play on pile2 (index1). Joe can take 1 stone from pile2 (leaving 1) or take 2 stones. \n  If Joe takes 2 stones, then he wins because then Mike has no stone to remove on the next turn? But wait: after Joe removes 2, pile2 becomes 0. Then the next move is Mike on pile1? But pile1 is 0 -> Mike loses. So Joe wins.\n\nSo [1,2] -> Joe wins -> correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,1] (n=2)\n  a1 = [2] -> m1 = 2*1+0 = 2\n  a2 = [1] -> m2 = 1*1+0 = 1\n  then m1>m2 -> print \"Mike\". \n\nBut what happens?\n  Mike goes first. He can take 1 stone from pile1 (leaving 1) or take 2 stones. \n  If he takes 2 stones, then pile1 becomes 0 -> then Joe must play on pile2. Joe can take 1 stone and wins? Then Mike loses -> so that move is bad.\n  If Mike takes 1 stone from pile1, leaving 1. Then Joe must play on pile2. Joe can take 1 stone, leaving 0. Then Mike must play on pile1: he can take the remaining 1 and wins? Then Joe must play on pile2 (which is 0) -> Joe loses. So Mike wins.\n\nSo [2,1] -> Mike wins -> correct.\n\nTherefore, the even case is implemented correctly.\n\nNow for the odd case: the known solution is that Mike wins. Why?\n  Because Mike can take the entire first pile. Then the circle becomes a line starting from the second pile. Now, Joe is forced to play on the second pile, and then Mike on the third, and so on. But note: the number of piles is now even? Actually, we started with odd, and we remove one pile -> even. Then the game becomes a linear game? \n\nHowever, there is a known solution for this problem: \n  if n is odd: Mike wins.\n  else: \n        find the minimum element and its index. If the index is even (0-indexed) then Mike wins? Actually, no.\n\nBut the known solution in codeforces for \"C. Circular Stone Game\" is:\n\n  if n is odd: print \"Mike\"\n  else: \n        find the minimum element in the entire array. If the first occurrence of the minimum is at an even index (0-indexed) then Joe wins? Actually, no.\n\nWait, let me check known problems: \n  Problem \"Circular Stone Game\" from Codeforces Round # 797 (Div.3) (problem C) has the solution:\n\n  if n is odd: Mike wins.\n  if n is even: \n        we find the minimum stone count and the first index where it occurs. If that index is even (0-indexed) then Joe wins, else Mike wins? \n\nBut our provided even case does not do that. It splits the array and compares the two arrays.\n\nActually, the solution in the provided even case is:\n\n  m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1   [where i1 is the index in the subarray a1 (so the first occurrence of the minimum in a1 is at position i1 in a1, which corresponds to the original index = 2*i1?)]\n  similarly, m2 = min(a2)*len(a2)+i2.\n\nThen compare m1 and m2. This is equivalent to:\n\n  We want to compare the two subarrays by:\n      (min_value, index_in_original) \n  but note: the index in the original array for a1 is 2*i1, and for a2 is 2*i2+1.\n\n  The expression min(a1)*len(a1)+i1 is a way to encode the minimum value and the index in the subarray. Since the minimum value is multiplied by the length of the subarray (which is at least 1 and at most 25) and then we add the index (which is at most 24), then if min(a1) < min(a2), then m1 < m2? Not necessarily: because if min(a1)=1 and min(a2)=2, then m1 = 1 * (n//2) + i1, m2 = 2 * (n//2) + i2. Since n//2 is at least 1, then 1*(n//2) <= 2*(n//2) - (n//2) ... actually, 1*(n//2) < 2*(n//2) because 2*(n//2) = n, and 1*(n//2) = n//2. So m1 < m2.\n\n  But if min(a1)=min(a2), then we compare i1 and i2? Actually, the expression becomes: \n        m1 = min_val * (n//2) + i1\n        m2 = min_val * (n//2) + i2\n  then we compare i1 and i2? But note: the code does \"Mike\" if m1>m2 -> so if i1>i2 then Mike wins? \n\nBut in the sample [1,1]: \n        a1=[1], a2=[1] -> i1=0, i2=0 -> m1=1*1+0=1, m2=1*1+0=1 -> so m1 is not greater -> Joe wins.\n\nBut what if we have [1,1,2] (n=3, odd) -> then we use the odd branch.\n\nThe known solution for odd is that Mike wins. So we just print \"Mike\".\n\nBut why is that? \n  Because Mike can take the entire first pile. Then the circle becomes: \n        [1,2] (and the next move is Joe on the second pile). \n  Now, the game is on two piles (even) and the state is [1,2]. We know from above that in [1,2] Joe wins? Then Mike would lose? \n\nWait, that contradicts. \n\nActually, after Mike takes the entire first pile (pile1 becomes 0), then Joe must play on pile2. Joe can take 1 stone from pile2 (leaving 0) -> then Mike must play on pile3? But pile3 is 2. Mike takes 2, then Joe must play on pile1 (which is 0) -> Joe loses. So Mike wins.\n\nAlternatively, Joe could take 2 stones from pile2? Then pile2 becomes 0. Then Mike must play on pile3: he takes 2, then Joe must play on pile1 (0) -> Joe loses.\n\nSo Mike wins.\n\nBut what if the piles are [1,2,3]? \n  Mike takes the entire pile1 (1 stone) -> then the state is [0,2,3]. \n  Joe must play on pile2: he can take 1 stone (leaving 1) or take 2 (leaving 0). \n  If Joe takes 1 from pile2: then state [0,1,3]. Then Mike can take 1 from pile3? But wait, the next move after pile2 is pile3. Then Mike can take 1 from pile3? Then state [0,1,2]. Then Joe must play on pile1 (0) -> Joe loses. \n  Alternatively, if Joe takes 2 from pile2: then state [0,0,3]. Then Mike takes 3 from pile3, and Joe must play on pile1 (0) -> loses.\n\nSo Mike wins.\n\nBut what if the piles are [2,1,3]? \n  Mike takes the entire pile1 (2 stones) -> state [0,1,3]. \n  Joe must play on pile2: he can take 1 (leaving 0) -> then Mike must play on pile3: he can take 3, then Joe loses. \n  So Mike wins.\n\nTherefore, the solution for odd n is that Mike wins.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py in the odd branch is:\n\n    print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the problem says that the test cases are multiple. We must output the winner for each test case.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n    print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the code structure: we are in an else branch for when n is even? Actually, the condition is:\n\n    if N % 2 == 0:\n        ... (even case)\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we must output the winner for the odd case.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the code must not output anything else. And we are in the solve function.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the even case prints either \"Mike\" or \"Joe\". The odd case should print \"Mike\".\n\nHowever, what if the piles are [1] (n=1)? \n  Mike takes the entire pile and wins. So \"Mike\" is correct.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nFor program2.py: the missing line is:\n    print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has an else branch and we must write the code for the odd case. The missing block is just one line.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n  \"program2\": \"    print(\\\"Mike\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation. In program1.py, the missing line is at the same indentation level as the condition. In the condition, we have:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we need 8 spaces (or the same as the condition) for the line. The condition is inside a for loop that is inside the test case loop.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the else branch is at the same level as the if branch. The if branch has 8 spaces (if we count the function body). The function body is indented by 4. Then the if block is indented by 4 more (so 8). The else branch should be at the same level.\n\nBut the provided code in program2.py for the even case is:\n\n        a1 = [A[i] for i in range(0, N, 2)]\n        a2 = [A[i] for i in range(1, N, 2)]\n\n        i1, i2 = a1.index(min(a1)), a2.index(min(a2))\n        m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1\n        m2 = min(a2) * len(a2) + i2\n\n        print(\"Mike\" if m1 > m2 else \"Joe\")\n\nSo the else branch should have the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the even case has 8 spaces at the beginning of the print. The else branch should have the same.\n\nHowever, the TODO is at the same level as the even case code. So we write:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut the entire else branch is:\n\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the TODO is a comment. We remove the comment and put the print.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\n    else:\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut the even case has multiple lines. The odd case only has one line.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the even case has a blank line after the print? Actually, no. We just need to output the code that goes in the else branch.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(\\\"Mike\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the condition is:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is indented by 8 (inside the for loop). The TODO is at 12. So the missing line should be at 12.\n\nBut the provided condition has 8 spaces for the if, and then the TODO is at 12. So we write:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the condition is:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace the TODO with:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nTherefore, the program1 missing line is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is true only when we have a new maximum for that prefix. So we update the dictionary.\n\nSo the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n  \"program2\": \"        print(\\\"Mike\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code: the even case has 8 spaces for the body. The else branch should have the same. The print statement in the even case is at 8 spaces. The else branch code should be at 8 spaces. However, the else branch is at the same level as the if. The body of the else should be indented one more level (so 8 spaces). The even case body is 8 spaces. So the print in the else should be 8 spaces.\n\nBut the provided even case code is:\n\n        a1 = [A[i] for i in range(0, N, 2)]\n        a2 = [A[i] for i in range(1, N, 2)]\n\n        i1, i2 = a1.index(min(a1)), a2.index(min(a2))\n        m1 = min(a1) * len(a1) + i1\n        m2 = min(a2) * len(a2) + i2\n\n        print(\"Mike\" if m1 > m2 else \"Joe\")\n\nEach line is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the function). So the odd branch should have:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n        print(\"Mike\")\n\nBut note: the even case has multiple lines. The odd branch has one line. The indentation level is the same.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"        print(\\\"Mike\\\")\"}\n\nBut note: we must escape the quotes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON string to avoid escaping? But the problem says to output the code as a string.\n\nWe'll use double quotes for the JSON keys and values, and escape the double quotes inside the string.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
