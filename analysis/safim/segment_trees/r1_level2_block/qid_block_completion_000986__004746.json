They can be repeated. But wait: is that all? Let me test with the example: n=6, a = [1,1,2,1,4,3].

The partitions of 6 with at least 3 parts:\n\n          (4,1,1) -> but note: we cannot have two 1's? Actually, the group sizes: we can have a group of size 4, and two groups of size 1. \n          (3,2,1)\n          (3,1,1,1) -> but wait, we have 4 groups? Actually, the partition (3,1,1,1) has 4 parts (which is >=3) and the sum is 6.\n          (2,2,2)\n          (2,2,1,1)\n          (2,1,1,1,1)\n          (1,1,1,1,1,1)\n\n        How many? The example says: the possible multisets M are: \n            {1,1,1,1,1,1} -> (1,1,1,1,1,1) -> 6 parts\n            {1,1,1,1,2} -> (2,1,1,1,1) -> 5 parts\n            {1,1,1,3} -> (3,1,1,1) -> 4 parts\n            {1,1,2,2} -> (2,2,1,1) -> 4 parts\n            {1,1,4} -> (4,1,1) -> 3 parts\n            {1,2,3} -> (3,2,1) -> 3 parts\n            {2,2,2} -> (2,2,2) -> 3 parts So we have 7. Now, the partitions of 6 with at least 3 parts: \n            k=3: (4,1,1), (3,2,1), (2,2,2) -> 3\n            k=4: (3,1,1,1), (2,2,1,1) -> 2\n            k=5: (2,1,1,1,1) -> 1\n            k=6: (1,1,1,1,1,1) -> 1\n            total = 3+2+1+1 = 7. So it matches. Therefore, the answer is the number of integer partitions of n with at least m parts, where m = max(frequency of any value in a).",

But note: the recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]\n\n            However, we must have i>=j. Then we compute:\n            ans = 0\n            for k from m to n:\n                ans = (ans + dp[n][k]) % mod\n\n   But note: the standard recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts is:\n\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for i from 1 to n:\n            for j from 1 to i:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j] [if i>=j]\n\n        However, note: the recurrence dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j] is for partitions where the parts are at least 1 and we are counting by the smallest part? Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            dp[i][j] = number of partitions of i into j parts (each part at least 1). Then we can generate by the first part:\n\n                The first part (largest) can be from 1 to i. But we can use:\n\n                    dp[i][j] = sum_{k=1}^{i} dp[i-k][j-1]   for k from 1 to i, but then we don't have a direct recurrence. The recurrence I wrote above is standard:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j] This recurrence is based on:\n                - If the smallest part is 1, then we remove one part of 1: we get a partition of i-1 into j-1 parts -> dp[i-1][j-1]\n                - If the smallest part is at least 2, then we subtract 1 from every part: we get a partition of i-j (because we subtract j ones) into j parts -> dp[i-j][j]\n\n            This recurrence is valid for i>=j and j>=1. Example: n=3, j=2:\n            dp[3][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] \n            dp[2][1] = 1 (because [2])\n            dp[1][2] = 0 (because 1<2, so we don't have two parts for 1) -> so dp[3][2] = 1 -> which is (1,2) -> but wait, the partition (1,2) has smallest part 1? Then we remove the 1: we get (2) for i=2 and j=1 -> that is dp[2][1]=1. Then the other case: smallest part at least 2: then we subtract 1 from each part: (1,2) becomes (0,1) -> not valid? Actually, the recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts with the condition that the parts are non-increasing and at least 1 is:\n\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]   for i>=j, and dp[i][j]=0 for i<j.\n\n        But for (3,2):",

Step 3: ans = sum_{j = m}^{n} dp[n][j] mod 998244353 However, note: the maximum j we need is n, and n<=2000, so we can do O(n^2). But note: the recurrence:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i from 1 to n:\n                for j from 1 to i:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + (dp[i-j][j] if i>=j else 0)) % mod\n\n            However, in the recurrence we have dp[i-j][j] only if i>=j. But j<=i, so we can write:\n\n            for i from 1 to n:\n                for j from 1 to i:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                    if i>=j:\n                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            But note: the recurrence for the second term requires i>=j? Actually, we have j<=i by the loop, so we can do:\n\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    # Option 1: the smallest part is 1 -> then we remove one part of 1: so we have i-1 and j-1\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                    # Option 2: the smallest part is at least 2 -> then we subtract 1 from every part: so we have i - j (because we subtract j ones) and j parts\n                    if i >= j:\n                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            However, note: in the second term, we subtract j from i, so we require i>=j. But our j is from 1 to i, so i>=j is always true? Actually, j<=i, so we can write:\n\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            But wait: what if i-j < 0? Then we skip? But j<=i, so i-j>=0. However, if i-j==0, then we have dp[0][j]. We defined dp[0][0]=1, but for j>=1, dp[0][j] should be 0? So we can initialize dp[0][0]=1, and for i>0, dp[0][i]=0. Then for i=1, j=1: \n                dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[0][1] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> correct (partition [1])\n\n            for i=2, j=1: \n                dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] -> but wait, j=1, so we do:\n                    dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] But we don't have dp[1][0]? We have j from 1 to i, so j=1: we do dp[1][0] -> which is 0? Actually, we should note: the recurrence for j=1: \n                dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] \n                But dp[i-1][0] is 0 for i-1>0? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                dp[i][j] = 0 for j>i, and for j=0: dp[i][0]=0 for i>0, and dp[0][0]=1. Then for j from 1 to i:\n\n            But note: the recurrence for the second term: we use dp[i-j][j]. For j=1, i>=1: then we use dp[i-1][1]. Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] \n                if i>=j: \n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-j][j] But we can write without the if because j<=i.",

Possibility 2: merge the two sets: {1,2} -> size=2 -> multiset {2}. So two distinct multisets: {1,1} and {2}. Therefore, 2. But our method: \n            m = max(frequency) = 1 (since each appears once) Then we count partitions of 2 with at least 1 part: \n                k=1: (2) -> 1\n                k=2: (1,1) -> 1\n                total=2.

But note: we initialized dp[0][0]=1, and for any i>0, dp[0][j]=0 for j>=1. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    # We are going to compute dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]\n                    # But note: if i-j < 0, we skip?

But when i-j>0, we have computed dp[i-j][j] in a previous i (since i-j < i). Therefore, we can do. Let me test for i=1, j=1: \n            dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[0][1] = 1+0=1 -> correct. i=2, j=1: \n            dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] = 0+1=1 -> correct. i=2, j=2: \n            dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[0][2] = 1+0=1 -> correct.\n\n        i=3, j=1: 0+dp[2][1]=1 -> 1\n        i=3, j=2: dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] = 1+0=1 -> 1\n        i=3, j=3: dp[2][2] + dp[0][3] = 1+0=1 -> 1\n\n        i=4, j=2: dp[3][1] + dp[2][2] = 1+1=2 -> correct. So it matches. Therefore, we write:\n\n            mod = 998244353\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            m = max(freq)   # freq for values from 1 to n? \n            # But note: we built freq for indices 1..n, but we have to consider: \n            #",

Specifically, we can compute:\n\n                    t1 = (b_{i-1} // a_i) + 1   # the smallest integer t such that t*a_i > b_{i-1} for t>=0? But if b_{i-1} is negative, then (b_{i-1} // a_i) is negative or zero? Example: b_{i-1} = -3, a_i=2: \n                        floor(-3/2) = -2 (in Python, floor division for negative: -3//2 = -2) then t1 = -2+1 = -1 -> which is negative, not positive. We want the smallest nonnegative t: \n                    if b_{i-1} < 0, then t=0 is a candidate: 0 > b_{i-1} (which is negative) -> true. so the smallest nonnegative t is 0. For negative t: \n                    if b_{i-1} < 0, then we can also use negative t. \n                    we want the smallest s (positive) such that -s * a_i > b_{i-1} \n                    -> s < -b_{i-1}/a_i. the smallest s is 1, then 2, ... but we want the smallest |t| = s, so s=1 is the best. But compare: \n                        t=0: |t|=0, and b_i=0.\n                        t=-1: |t|=1, and b_i = -2.\n                    so t=0 is better. Therefore, for b_{i-1} < 0, we choose t=0. If b_{i-1} >=0, then:\n                    positive t: t1 = floor(b_{i-1}/a_i)+1, and then b_i = t1 * a_i, moves = t1. negative t: we require -s * a_i > b_{i-1} -> s < -b_{i-1}/a_i. But b_{i-1}>=0, then -b_{i-1}/a_i <=0, so s<0 is not possible for s>0. So no negative candidate. But wait: if b_{i-1}>=0, then negative t would give b_i<0, and then we require b_i> b_{i-1} (>=0) -> which is false. So negative t is not allowed. Therefore, for b_{i-1}>=0, we must use positive t: the smallest t such that t*a_i > b_{i-1} is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i)+1. However, what if b_{i-1} is 0? then t1 = floor(0/a_i)+1 = 0+1 = 1, so b_i = a_i, moves=1. But could we use t=0? then b_i=0, but 0>0 is false. So we cannot. Therefore, the rule for index i (0-indexed) is:\n\n                if i==0:\n                    we can choose b0 = 0? but then for the next element we require b1>0. But we can also choose b0 = -a0 (by one negative move) or b0 = a0 (by one positive move) or 0 (by zero moves). However, if we choose b0=0, then for the next element we require b1>0, which will cost at least 1 move (if we set b1 = a1). But if we choose b0 = -a0, then we require b1 > -a0. We can then choose b1=0?",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are counting the number of distinct multisets M (which are the sizes of the sets after any sequence of operations) that can be formed.\n\n The key idea:\n We note that the process is similar to building a forest of trees where each initial set is a leaf, and each union operation merges two disjoint sets. The multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the trees (or connected components) at the end.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire merging history but only the multiset of sizes. Also, the initial sets are given as one-element sets, but note: there can be duplicate values? Actually, the array a can have duplicates. But note: the sets are initially one-element sets, but the elements in the array are the values. However, if two sets have the same value, they are still distinct sets? Actually, the problem says: \"For each i, write the one-element set {a_i}\". So if a_i = a_j, then we have two sets: {a_i} and {a_j}. But note: when we merge, we require disjointness. However, if we have two sets {1} and {1}, they are not disjoint? Because they both contain 1? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"Choose two different sets S and T on the whiteboard such that S \u2229 T = \u2205\". So if we have two sets {1} and {1}, they are not disjoint? Because the element 1 is in both. Therefore, we cannot merge two sets that have the same element? \n\n This is a critical point. The sets are built from the array a. Initially, each set is {a_i}. Therefore, if two indices i and j have the same value (a_i = a_j), then the sets {a_i} and {a_j} are not disjoint (they both contain the same number). So we cannot merge them.\n\n Therefore, we can only merge sets that have distinct numbers? \n\n But note: after merging, a set might contain multiple numbers. Then we can merge two sets that have no common numbers. \n\n How does the merging work? \n Example: [1,1,2,1,4,3] as in the example. \n Initially: {1}, {1}, {2}, {1}, {4}, {3}. \n We cannot merge two sets that contain 1? So we cannot merge any two of the {1}'s? \n However, the example does: \n   Operation 1: {1} and {3} -> {1,3} (they are disjoint because 1 and 3 are different)\n   Then we have: {1}, {1}, {2}, {4}, {1,3}\n   Then merge {2} and {4} -> {2,4}\n   Then merge {1,3} and {2,4} -> {1,2,3,4}\n\n But note: we cannot merge two sets that contain the same element? For example, we cannot merge two sets that both contain 1? So we cannot merge {1} and {1,3} because they share 1? \n\n Therefore, the merging is constrained: we can only merge sets that have no common elements.\n\n This implies that the entire process is building a forest of trees where each tree is built from sets that have distinct numbers. Moreover, the numbers in a tree must be distinct.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of numbers that appear in the array must be partitioned into disjoint groups (each group being a set of distinct numbers). Then the multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of these groups.\n\n However, note: the initial array might have duplicates. But if a number appears multiple times, then each occurrence is in a separate set and cannot be merged with any set that already contains that number? Actually, we cannot merge two sets that share a common element. So if we have two sets that both contain 1, then we cannot merge them. Moreover, if we have a set that already contains 1, we cannot merge it with any other set that contains 1? \n\n Therefore, the groups (trees) must be such that each group does not contain any duplicate numbers. But note: the entire group must be built from sets that are disjoint. So the group is a set of distinct numbers. \n\n However, the initial sets are {a_i}. So if we have multiple ones, then each one must end up in a separate group? Because we cannot merge two sets that both contain 1. \n\n Therefore, the entire process partitions the indices (each index has a value a_i) into groups such that within a group, the values are distinct. \n\n But note: we can merge two sets that do not share a common element. For example, we can merge {1} and {2} to get {1,2}. Then we can merge {1,2} and {3} to get {1,2,3}. But we cannot merge {1,2} with another {1} because they share 1.\n\n Therefore, the condition for a group is that it is a set of distinct numbers. And each group must contain at most one occurrence of each number? Actually, it must contain distinct numbers. \n\n However, the same number might appear multiple times in the entire array, but in the same group? No, because if a group contains two 1's (from two different initial sets) then that group would have two 1's? But that is not allowed because the group must be a set of distinct numbers? Actually, the group is a set (so no duplicates). Therefore, we cannot have two 1's in the same group.\n\n Therefore, the groups are disjoint in terms of the numbers. So each group is a set of distinct numbers, and the same number cannot appear in two different groups? Actually, the same number can appear in different groups? But wait: if we have two initial sets with 1, then we have two groups: one group containing one of the 1's and the other group containing the other 1? And we cannot merge them. So each group must contain distinct numbers, and also, the same number cannot be in two groups? Actually, the entire set of numbers in the array is partitioned: each occurrence of a number must be in exactly one group? But note: the groups are built from the initial sets. Each initial set is assigned to one group. And the group is the union of the sets that are merged. Since the sets are disjoint, the same number (from different initial sets) must be in different groups.\n\n Therefore, the multiset M we get is a partition of the multiset of initial sets (n sets) into groups (each group being a set of distinct numbers). The size of the group is the number of initial sets that were merged to form that group? Actually, no: the size of the group as a set is the number of distinct numbers in the group. But note: the problem says the multiset M contains the sizes of the sets. The size of a set is the number of distinct elements in that set? Yes.\n\n However, note: the example: \n   Initial: {1}, {1}, {2}, {1}, {4}, {3} -> then one possibility is to have groups: \n        Group1: {1} (from one of the ones) -> size=1\n        Group2: {1} (another one) -> size=1\n        Group3: {1} (the last one) -> size=1\n        Group4: {2,4} -> size=2\n        Group5: {3} -> size=1\n        Group6: ... but wait, we merged {1,3} and {2,4}? Actually, the example did three operations and ended with three sets: two singletons and one set of size 4.\n\n But note: the example ended with: \n        {1}, {1}, and {1,2,3,4} -> so the multiset M is {1,1,4}. \n\n How did they get the two singletons? They left two of the ones as singletons? But then the group {1,2,3,4} contains the numbers 1,2,3,4. But note: there are three initial sets with 1. The group {1,2,3,4} must have taken one of the ones? So the other two ones are left as singletons.\n\n Therefore, the groups are:\n\n   Group1: {1} (from the first or second or third one) -> size=1\n   Group2: {1} (another one) -> size=1\n   Group3: {1,2,3,4} (which uses the third one, the 2, the 3, and the 4) -> size=4\n\n But note: the group {1,2,3,4} uses one of the ones. So the entire set of numbers that appear in the array is partitioned? Actually, the numbers 2,3,4 appear only once, so they can only be in one group. The number 1 appears three times, so we have three groups that each contain one occurrence of 1? But wait: the group {1,2,3,4} contains the number 1, and then the other two groups contain the number 1? Then the same number 1 appears in three groups? That is not a problem because the groups are disjoint? Actually, the groups are disjoint in terms of the initial sets? But the initial sets are merged only if they are disjoint. However, the same number 1 from different initial sets are in different groups? Yes, because each initial set is a separate occurrence.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: \n   We partition the n initial sets (each containing one number) into groups. Each group is a set of distinct numbers? Actually, the group is the union of the initial sets in that group. But if two initial sets in the same group have the same number, then the group would have duplicate? But note: the group is a set, so duplicates are removed. However, the problem does not say that the group is stored as a set? It is the union of the sets. The union of sets is a set (so no duplicates). Therefore, the size of the group is the number of distinct numbers in the initial sets of that group.\n\n But note: if a group contains two initial sets with the same number, say two 1's, then the union of the sets in that group would have the number 1 only once? But wait: if we try to merge two sets that both contain 1, that is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot put two initial sets with the same number in the same group. \n\n Therefore, the condition for a group is: \n   The group must contain distinct numbers. So each group is a set of distinct numbers, and we cannot have two initial sets with the same number in the same group.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n   We have a multiset of numbers (the array a). We wish to partition the indices (each index has a value a_i) into groups such that in each group, the values are distinct. \n\n   Then the multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the groups (where the size of a group is the number of distinct numbers in that group, which is the same as the number of initial sets in that group? Actually, no: the size of the group as a set is the number of distinct numbers. But note: in a group, we have several initial sets. The union of the sets in the group is the set of distinct numbers that appear in the initial sets of that group. The size of the group (as a set) is the number of distinct numbers. However, the number of initial sets in the group is the number of indices in that group. \n\n   But note: the problem says that the multiset M contains the sizes of the sets. The set written on the whiteboard is the union of the initial sets in that group. So the size is the number of distinct numbers in that group.\n\n   Therefore, for a group that contains k initial sets, the size of the set is the number of distinct numbers in the k initial sets. \n\n   However, we have the constraint that in the same group, we cannot have two initial sets with the same number. Therefore, the k initial sets in the same group must have distinct numbers. Therefore, the size of the set for that group is exactly k (because each initial set contributes one distinct number). \n\n   But wait: what if the group has two initial sets with the same number? Then we cannot form that group. So we require that in the same group, all the numbers are distinct. Therefore, the size of the set for the group is the number of initial sets in that group.\n\n   Therefore, the multiset M is simply the multiset of the sizes of the groups (where the size of a group is the number of initial sets in that group) and the constraint is that in each group, the numbers from the initial sets are distinct.\n\n   However, note: we can have a group of size 1: that is just one initial set. There is no constraint (it is always distinct). \n\n   Therefore, the problem becomes:\n\n        We wish to partition the n indices (each with value a_i) into groups such that in each group, the values of a_i are distinct (i.e., no two indices in the same group have the same value).\n\n        Then the multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the groups (the count of indices in each group).\n\n        How many distinct multisets M can we get?\n\n   But note: the multiset M is a multiset of positive integers that sum to n. However, the constraint is that we cannot put two indices with the same value in the same group.\n\n   Therefore, the same value must be in different groups. So if a value appears k times, then we must have at least k groups? Actually, no: we can have one group per occurrence? Actually, we must assign each occurrence to a different group? Because if two occurrences of the same value are in the same group, that group would have duplicate? But that is not allowed. Therefore, each occurrence of a value must be in a distinct group.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: the groups must form a partition of the indices such that for each value, all the indices with that value are in distinct groups.\n\n   This is equivalent to: we can assign each index to a group, and the same value cannot appear twice in the same group.\n\n   How to count the distinct multisets M? \n\n   Note: The multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the groups. The groups are unlabelled. So two partitions that have the same multiset of group sizes are considered the same.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require the groups to be non-empty? They are non-empty by definition.\n\n   We can use generating functions and the concept of partitions of the set of indices with the distinctness constraint. But note: the constraint is that each group must have distinct values. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming.\n\n   Let f[i] be the frequency of the value i. Then the constraint is that the number of groups must be at least max(f[i])? Actually, the maximum frequency of any value, say f_max, must be at least the number of groups? Actually, we need at least f_max groups? Because the value that appears f_max times must have each occurrence in a separate group. Therefore, the minimum number of groups is the maximum frequency of any value.\n\n   Now, we wish to count the distinct multisets of group sizes (which are positive integers) that sum to n and such that the multiset has at least f_max groups? Actually, the condition is that the number of groups must be at least the maximum frequency? Actually, no: the condition is that for each value, the frequency of the value must be at most the number of groups? Because each occurrence of the same value must be in a different group. Therefore, the number of groups must be at least the maximum frequency (over the values). \n\n   Therefore, we are counting the distinct multisets (partitions of the integer n) that have at least k parts, where k = max(f_i). But note: the parts are the group sizes. However, the multiset of group sizes does not record the order. \n\n   But wait: is that sufficient? Consider two different partitions that have the same multiset of group sizes. They are the same. However, the constraint is that the partition must have at least k groups? \n\n   However, note: the constraint is not only on the total number of groups. It is also that we can assign the indices to groups such that no two indices with the same value are in the same group. This is equivalent to: the partition must have at least k groups (where k = max frequency) and also, for every value that appears f times, we must have at least f groups? Actually, no: we need at least f groups? But we already have at least k (which is the maximum f) so that condition is automatically satisfied? \n\n   Actually, for a value that appears f times, we need at least f groups? And k = max(f) is the largest f. So if we have at least k groups, then we have at least f groups for every value. Therefore, the condition is that the partition must have at least k groups.\n\n   However, is that sufficient? \n\n   Consider: we have two values: value A appears 3 times, value B appears 3 times. Then we need at least 3 groups. But if we have exactly 3 groups, then we can assign: \n        Group1: A and B -> but then we cannot assign the other A and the other B? \n        Actually, we have three groups. We must assign each occurrence of A to a distinct group and each occurrence of B to a distinct group. This is equivalent to a bipartite matching: groups are one set, and the occurrences are the other set? Actually, we have three groups and we have to assign each occurrence to a group. The constraint: for A, the three A's must go to three different groups, and the three B's must go to three different groups. \n\n   But note: we have only three groups. Then we can assign:\n        Group1: A and B\n        Group2: A and B\n        Group3: A and B\n\n   Then each group has two elements: one A and one B. The set in group1 is {A,B} (size=2), group2: {A,B} (size=2), group3: {A,B} (size=2). The multiset M is {2,2,2}. \n\n   How do we assign? \n        We have three A's: we assign one to group1, one to group2, one to group3.\n        We have three B's: we assign one to group1, one to group2, one to group3.\n\n   This is possible. \n\n   Therefore, the condition is that the number of groups must be at least the maximum frequency. \n\n   But note: what if we have value A: 3 times, value B: 4 times? Then we need at least 4 groups. \n\n   Therefore, the condition is: the partition must have at least m groups, where m = max_{x} (frequency of x).\n\n   Now, the problem reduces to: count the number of distinct multisets (i.e., partitions of the integer n) that have at least m parts? \n\n   However, note: the partition of the integer n into parts that sum to n, and the multiset of parts is what we care about. But the condition is on the number of parts: we require at least m parts. \n\n   But note: the multiset of parts does not record the order. However, the condition \"at least m parts\" is equivalent to: the partition has at least m parts. \n\n   How to count the distinct multisets (partitions) of n with at least m parts? \n\n   We can use the generating function for partitions. The generating function is:\n\n        P(x) = \u220f_{k>=1} 1/(1-x^k)\n\n   But we want the number of partitions of n that have at least m parts. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the recurrence for partitions. However, note: the problem has n up to 2000.\n\n   But note: the problem does not ask for the number of partitions with at least m parts? Actually, we must be cautious: the multiset M is the multiset of the sizes of the groups. The group sizes are positive integers. The condition is that the number of groups (which is the number of parts) is at least m. \n\n   However, the same multiset of group sizes can be arranged in any order? So we are counting the distinct multisets (which are partitions) that have at least m parts? \n\n   But note: the partition (3,2,1) is the same as (1,2,3) as a multiset? Actually, the multiset is unordered. So we are counting the distinct partitions (in the integer partition sense) that have at least m parts? \n\n   However, wait: the partition of n into parts is usually defined as a non-increasing sequence. The condition \"at least m parts\" is the same as the length of the partition being at least m.\n\n   Therefore, we wish to count the number of integer partitions of n that have at least m parts.\n\n   But note: the entire set of partitions of n is the same as the set of partitions of n with at most n parts? \n\n   We know: \n        p(n, k) = number of partitions of n into exactly k parts.\n        Then the answer would be: sum_{k=m}^{n} p(n,k)\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require the parts to be distinct? They can be repeated. \n\n   But wait: is that all? \n\n   Let me test with the example: n=6, a = [1,1,2,1,4,3]. \n        The frequencies: \n            1: 3 times\n            2: 1\n            3: 1\n            4: 1\n        so m = 3.\n\n        The partitions of 6 with at least 3 parts:\n\n          (4,1,1) -> but note: we cannot have two 1's? Actually, the group sizes: we can have a group of size 4, and two groups of size 1. \n          (3,2,1)\n          (3,1,1,1) -> but wait, we have 4 groups? Actually, the partition (3,1,1,1) has 4 parts (which is >=3) and the sum is 6.\n          (2,2,2)\n          (2,2,1,1)\n          (2,1,1,1,1)\n          (1,1,1,1,1,1)\n\n        How many? \n\n        The example says: the possible multisets M are: \n            {1,1,1,1,1,1} -> (1,1,1,1,1,1) -> 6 parts\n            {1,1,1,1,2} -> (2,1,1,1,1) -> 5 parts\n            {1,1,1,3} -> (3,1,1,1) -> 4 parts\n            {1,1,2,2} -> (2,2,1,1) -> 4 parts\n            {1,1,4} -> (4,1,1) -> 3 parts\n            {1,2,3} -> (3,2,1) -> 3 parts\n            {2,2,2} -> (2,2,2) -> 3 parts\n\n        So we have 7.\n\n        Now, the partitions of 6 with at least 3 parts: \n            k=3: (4,1,1), (3,2,1), (2,2,2) -> 3\n            k=4: (3,1,1,1), (2,2,1,1) -> 2\n            k=5: (2,1,1,1,1) -> 1\n            k=6: (1,1,1,1,1,1) -> 1\n            total = 3+2+1+1 = 7.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the number of integer partitions of n with at least m parts, where m = max(frequency of any value in a).\n\n   However, note: what if there are multiple values? The condition is that the number of groups must be at least the maximum frequency. And we argued that this is sufficient. \n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        m = max(cnt)   where cnt is the frequency array for the values.\n\n        Then we want: \n            ans = sum_{k = m}^{n} p(n,k)\n\n        where p(n,k) is the number of partitions of n into exactly k parts.\n\n   How to compute p(n,k) for n up to 2000? \n\n        We can use dynamic programming:\n\n            dp[i][j] = number of partitions of i into exactly j parts.\n\n        Recurrence:\n\n            We can use: \n                dp[0][0] = 1\n                for i from 1 to n:\n                    for j from 1 to i:\n                        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]   [if i>=j]\n\n            Explanation:\n                The recurrence for partitions: \n                    We consider the smallest part:\n                      - If the smallest part is 1, then we remove one part of 1 and we have a partition of i-1 into j-1 parts.\n                      - Otherwise, we subtract 1 from every part (so we get a partition of i-j into j parts, and then add 1 to each part to get parts at least 2).\n\n            But note: the recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]\n\n            However, we must have i>=j.\n\n        Then we compute:\n            ans = 0\n            for k from m to n:\n                ans = (ans + dp[n][k]) % mod\n\n   But note: the standard recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts is:\n\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        for i from 1 to n:\n            for j from 1 to i:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]   [if i>=j]\n\n        However, note: the recurrence dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j] is for partitions where the parts are at least 1 and we are counting by the smallest part? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            dp[i][j] = number of partitions of i into j parts (each part at least 1).\n\n            Then we can generate by the first part:\n\n                The first part (largest) can be from 1 to i.\n\n                But we can use:\n\n                    dp[i][j] = sum_{k=1}^{i} dp[i-k][j-1]   for k from 1 to i, but then we don't have a direct recurrence.\n\n            The recurrence I wrote above is standard:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]\n\n            This recurrence is based on:\n                - If the smallest part is 1, then we remove one part of 1: we get a partition of i-1 into j-1 parts -> dp[i-1][j-1]\n                - If the smallest part is at least 2, then we subtract 1 from every part: we get a partition of i-j (because we subtract j ones) into j parts -> dp[i-j][j]\n\n            This recurrence is valid for i>=j and j>=1.\n\n        Example: n=3, j=2:\n            dp[3][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] \n            dp[2][1] = 1 (because [2])\n            dp[1][2] = 0 (because 1<2, so we don't have two parts for 1) -> so dp[3][2] = 1 -> which is (1,2) -> but wait, the partition (1,2) has smallest part 1? Then we remove the 1: we get (2) for i=2 and j=1 -> that is dp[2][1]=1. Then the other case: smallest part at least 2: then we subtract 1 from each part: (1,2) becomes (0,1) -> not valid? \n\n        Actually, the recurrence for partitions into exactly j parts with the condition that the parts are non-increasing and at least 1 is:\n\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]   for i>=j, and dp[i][j]=0 for i<j.\n\n        But for (3,2): \n            The partition (2,1) is the only one. \n            How does the recurrence work?\n                i=3, j=2: \n                    dp[3][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] \n                dp[2][1] = 1 (the partition [2])\n                dp[1][2] = 0 (since 1<2) -> so 1.\n\n            Now, for (2,2,2) for n=6, j=3:\n                dp[6][3] = dp[5][2] + dp[3][3]\n                dp[5][2] = dp[4][1] + dp[3][2] = 1 + dp[3][2] = 1 + (dp[2][1] + dp[1][2]) = 1 + (1+0)=2\n                dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + dp[0][3] \n                    dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[0][2] = 1 + 0 = 1? but wait, the partition of 2 into 2 parts: (1,1) -> so that is 1.\n                    dp[0][3] = 1? because if we have 0 and 3 parts, we can represent as an empty partition? But we require nonnegative parts? Actually, the recurrence: when we subtract 1 from every part in the case of no 1's, we get a partition of i-j into j parts. For (2,2,2): subtract 1 from each: (1,1,1) which is a partition of 3 into 3 parts? But then we have dp[3][3] = 1? \n                So dp[6][3] = 2 + 1 = 3? \n                But the partitions of 6 into 3 parts: \n                    (4,1,1), (3,2,1), (2,2,2) -> 3. So it matches.\n\n            Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the frequency array for the array a, and let m = max(frequency)\n\n            Step 2: Precompute dp[0..n][0..n] for partitions of i into exactly j parts.\n\n            Step 3: ans = sum_{j = m}^{n} dp[n][j] mod 998244353\n\n        However, note: the maximum j we need is n, and n<=2000, so we can do O(n^2).\n\n        But note: the recurrence:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i from 1 to n:\n                for j from 1 to i:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + (dp[i-j][j] if i>=j else 0)) % mod\n\n            However, in the recurrence we have dp[i-j][j] only if i>=j. But j<=i, so we can write:\n\n            for i from 1 to n:\n                for j from 1 to i:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                    if i>=j:\n                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            But note: the recurrence for the second term requires i>=j? Actually, we have j<=i by the loop, so we can do:\n\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    # Option 1: the smallest part is 1 -> then we remove one part of 1: so we have i-1 and j-1\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                    # Option 2: the smallest part is at least 2 -> then we subtract 1 from every part: so we have i - j (because we subtract j ones) and j parts\n                    if i >= j:\n                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            However, note: in the second term, we subtract j from i, so we require i>=j. But our j is from 1 to i, so i>=j is always true? \n\n            Actually, j<=i, so we can write:\n\n            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            But wait: what if i-j < 0? Then we skip? But j<=i, so i-j>=0.\n\n            However, if i-j==0, then we have dp[0][j]. We defined dp[0][0]=1, but for j>=1, dp[0][j] should be 0? \n\n            So we can initialize dp[0][0]=1, and for i>0, dp[0][i]=0.\n\n            Then for i=1, j=1: \n                dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[0][1] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> correct (partition [1])\n\n            for i=2, j=1: \n                dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] -> but wait, j=1, so we do:\n                    dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] \n                But we don't have dp[1][0]? We have j from 1 to i, so j=1: we do dp[1][0] -> which is 0? \n\n            Actually, we should note: the recurrence for j=1: \n                dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] \n                But dp[i-1][0] is 0 for i-1>0? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                dp[i][j] = 0 for j>i, and for j=0: dp[i][0]=0 for i>0, and dp[0][0]=1.\n\n            Then for j from 1 to i:\n\n            But note: the recurrence for the second term: we use dp[i-j][j]. For j=1, i>=1: then we use dp[i-1][1]. \n\n            Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] \n                if i>=j: \n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-j][j]\n\n            But we can write without the if because j<=i.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: when i-j < j? That doesn't matter because we defined dp for all i,j.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n                dp[0][0] = 1\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    for j in range(1, i+1):\n                        # j from 1 to i\n                        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]   # smallest part is 1\n                        if i >= j:\n                            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            But note: the recurrence for the second term: we use dp[i-j][j] which is defined for i-j>=0 and j>=1. Since i>=j, i-j>=0, and j is at least 1, but note: if i-j==0, then we use dp[0][j] which is 0 for j>=1? Actually, we defined dp[0][0]=1, but for j>=1, dp[0][j]=0. So that's fine.\n\n            Example: i=2, j=1: \n                dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] (which is 0) + dp[2-1][1] = dp[1][1] = 1 -> so 1? \n                But the partition of 2 into 1 part: [2] -> so 1, correct.\n\n            i=2, j=2:\n                dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[0][2] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> which is (1,1) -> correct.\n\n            i=3, j=1: dp[3][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] = 0 + 1 = 1 -> [3] -> correct.\n            i=3, j=2: dp[3][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> (1,2) -> correct? But wait, (1,2) is the only one? Actually, (2,1) is the same as (1,2) in partition? But we are counting the multiset of parts? Actually, the partition is represented as non-increasing: so (2,1) is the same as (1,2) but we represent as (2,1). The recurrence counts the non-increasing representation. The number of partitions of 3 into 2 parts: only (2,1) -> so 1.\n\n            i=3, j=3: dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + dp[0][3] = 1 + 0 = 1 -> (1,1,1) -> correct.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        Then:\n\n            m = max(frequency of the array a)\n\n            ans = 0\n            for j in range(m, n+1):\n                ans = (ans + dp[n][j]) % mod\n\n        But note: what if n=0?

The problem says n>=1.\n\n        Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the example in the problem: \n            n=6, m=3 -> ans=7.\n\n        But the sample input: \n            \"6\"\n            \"1 1 2 1 4 3\"\n\n        We compute:\n            frequencies: \n                a = [1,1,2,1,4,3] -> \n                1:3, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 -> m=3.\n\n            Then we compute the partitions of 6 with at least 3 parts: 7.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"the possible multisets M are {1,1,1,1,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,2}, {1,1,1,3}, {1,1,2,2}, {1,1,4}, {1,2,3}, and {2,2,2}\"\n\n        So 7.\n\n        However, wait: the example also says: \n            \"As an example, let's consider a possible sequence of operations ... the multiset M that is constructed is {1,1,4}\"\n\n        So we are counting that.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the number of distinct multisets M\". \n\n        Therefore, we output 7.\n\n        However, let me test with the second example: \n            Input: \n                3\n                1 1 1\n            Then m = 3.\n            The partitions of 3 with at least 3 parts: \n                only (1,1,1) -> 1 partition.\n            So answer=1.\n\n        But what are the possible multisets? \n            We have three sets: {1}, {1}, {1}. \n            We cannot merge any two because they are not disjoint? \n            So the only multiset is {1,1,1}. \n\n        Therefore, 1.\n\n        Another example: \n            n=2, a=[1,1]\n            m=2.\n            Partitions of 2 with at least 2 parts: (1,1) -> 1.\n            So answer=1.\n\n        And if a=[1,2]:\n            m=1 (each frequency=1).\n            Partitions of 2: \n                with at least 1 part: \n                    (2) -> 1 part\n                    (1,1) -> 2 parts\n                so 2.\n\n            How?\n                Possibility 1: leave as two sets: {1} and {2} -> multiset {1,1}? \n                    But wait: the sets are {1} and {2}.

We set all to 0 initially? \n\n            We initialized dp[0][0]=1, and the rest to 0? \n\n            Then for i=1, j=1: \n                dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] (which is 1) + dp[0][1] (which is 0) -> 1.\n\n            For i=2, j=1: \n                dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] (which is 0) + dp[1][1] (which is 1) -> 1? \n                But we also have the second term: we do if i>=j -> 2>=1 -> then we add dp[2-1][1] = dp[1][1]=1 -> so total 1? \n                Actually, we did:\n\n                    dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] (which is 0) \n                    then we add dp[1][1] -> so 1.\n\n            j=2: \n                dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] (1) + dp[0][2] (0) -> 1.\n\n            So dp[2][1]=1, dp[2][2]=1.\n\n            Then for n=2, m=1: \n                ans = dp[2][1] + dp[2][2] = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the recurrence in the inner loop: we are using dp[i-j][j]. We must ensure that we have computed dp[i-j][j] for all j<=i. \n\n        We iterate i from 1 to n, and for each i, j from 1 to i. Then when we compute dp[i][j], we need dp[i-j][j]. Since i-j < i, we have already computed it? \n\n        Yes.\n\n        Therefore, we can code.\n\n        But note: the problem says the array a has n elements.

But n>=1, so m>=1? \n            Actually, the minimum frequency is 0? But we have n elements, so the maximum frequency is at least 1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Let me test with n=1: \n            a = [1]\n            freq[1]=1 -> m=1.\n            dp[1][1] = 1 -> ans=1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem has multiple test cases? \n            The problem says: \n                \"The first line contains a single integer n\"\n                Then the next line has n integers.\n\n            And the sample input: \n                6\n                1 1 2 1 4 3\n\n            But the code template has:\n\n                t = getInt()\n                t = 1   # so only one test case.\n\n            So we do one test case.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            freq = [0]*(n+1)\n            for x in a:\n                freq[x] += 1\n            m = max(freq)\n\n            mod = 998244353\n            # dp[i][j] for i in [0, n], j in [0, n]\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            ans = 0\n            for j in range(m, n+1):\n                ans = (ans + dp[n][j]) % mod\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the recurrence for dp[i][j] uses dp[i-j][j]. We must ensure that i-j is nonnegative? We have j<=i, so i-j>=0.\n\n        We run the example n=6, m=3: we get 7.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array a has n integers. We built freq for indices 1..n. \n\n        But what if there is a value that does not appear? Then freq[x] for that x is 0. But we only care about the maximum frequency.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"The second line contains n integers a1,a2,\u2026,an (1\u2264ai\u2264n).\" so every value is between 1 and n, and we have an array of length n. \n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem has a code template that includes:\n\n            t = getInt()\n            t = 1\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n                solve()\n\n        We'll put our code in the solve function.\n\n        But the template also has:\n\n            input = sys.stdin.readline\n            inf = float('inf')\n\n            def getInt():\n                return int(input())\n\n            def getStr():\n                return input().strip()\n\n            def getList(split=True):\n                s = getStr()\n                if split:\n                    s = s.split()\n                return map(int, s)\n\n        We can use:\n\n            n = getInt()\n            a = list(getList())\n\n        So we write:\n\n            n = getInt()\n            a = list(getList())\n            freq = [0] * (n+1)\n            for x in a:\n                freq[x] += 1\n            m = max(freq)\n\n            mod = 998244353\n            dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in range(1, i+1):\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-j][j]) % mod\n\n            ans = 0\n            for j in range(m, n+1):\n                ans = (ans + dp[n][j]) % mod\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        Let me run the example n=2, a=[1,2]: \n            m = max(freq) = max(freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1) = 1.\n            dp[2][1] = (dp[1][0] + dp[1][1]) % mod = (0+1) % mod = 1\n            dp[2][2] = (dp[1][1] + dp[0][2]) % mod = (1+0) % mod = 1\n            ans = dp[2][1] + dp[2][2] = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", but the template already has:\n\n            n = getInt()\n            a = list(getList())\n            ... and then the rest.\n\n        But the template also has:\n\n            cnt = [0] * n\n            for i in a:\n                cnt[i-1] += 1\n\n            lim = [0] * (n+1)\n            col = 0\n            f = [0] * (n+1)\n            for i, j in enumerate(cnt):\n                col += j > 0\n                f[j] += 1\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                lim[i] = lim[i-1] + col\n                col -= f[i]\n\n            dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n            dp[0][0] = 1\n            for x in range(n, 0, -1):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if j * x > n:\n                        break\n                    for i in range(n-x+1):\n                        if i + x <= lim[j+1]:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n            print(sum(dp[n]) % M)\n\n        This template is different from our solution.\n\n        We must fill in the missing code? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n        And the output format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        But we are only given one program: program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        But we are only shown program2.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        And the example: \n            \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So we have two programs? \n\n        But the problem only provided one program: program2.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py and then for program2.py.\n\n        But we are only given the description for program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem has two parts: \n\n          First, we are given program1.py and program2.py. \n\n          Then, we are shown the code for program2.py? \n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in the problem statement we only see program2.py.\n\n        And the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" for both.\n\n        How to proceed?\n\n        We have two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        The command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        We must complete both.\n\n        But the problem only provided the code for program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem says:\n\n          # program1.py\n          ... (description for program1)\n\n          # program2.py\n          ... (code for program2)\n\n        But we don't see program1.py? \n\n        Looking back: \n\n          The problem has two descriptions:\n\n          First: \n            \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem: \n             Description: You are given an array ... and an array b ... minimum number of moves ... \n             Input Specification: ... \n             Output Specification: ... \n             Notes: ... \n             Code: ... (with a TODO in the inner loop)\"\n\n          Then:\n\n          Second:\n            \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n             Description: ... \n             Input Specification: ... \n             Output Specification: ... \n             Notes: ... \n             Code: ... (with a TODO in the inner loop)\"\n\n        So we have two programs to complete.\n\n        We must output a json: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion for program1\", \"program2\": \"completion for program2\"}\n\n        We have already solved program2? \n\n        But wait, the second program is program2.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", and then we are shown two code snippets? \n\n        The first code snippet is for program1.py? and the second for program2.py? \n\n        But the first code snippet has:\n\n            n=int(input())\n            a=list(map(int,input().split()))\n            b=[int(0) for _ in range(n)]\n            m=1e18\n            for i in range(n):\n                c=0\n                p=0\n                for j in range(i+1,len(b)):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                p=0\n                for j in range(i-1,-1,-1):\n                    p+=a[j]-p%a[j]\n                    c+=p//a[j]\n                m=min(m,c)\n\n            print(m)\n\n        And the second code snippet is the one we just worked on.\n\n        Therefore, we have two programs to complete.\n\n        We have already completed program2.py? \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" for each program.\n\n        For program1.py, we must complete the TODO block? \n\n        For program2.py, we must complete the TODO block? \n\n        However, in program2.py, we have a completely different approach? \n\n        We must complete program1.py and program2.py so that when we run \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\", it runs correctly.\n\n        How are they connected? \n\n        The command: program1.py outputs something, and program2.py reads from stdin.\n\n        What is program1.py doing? \n\n        It is solving the first problem: minimum moves to make b increasing.\n\n        And program2.py is solving the second problem: distinct multisets M.\n\n        But the output of program1.py is the input to program2.py? \n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So the output of program1.py is the input to program2.py.\n\n        What is the input to program1.py? \n\n        The first problem: \n            Input: first line n, second line n integers.\n\n        What is the output of program1.py? \n            The minimum number of moves.\n\n        Then program2.py reads from stdin: \n            It reads n and then the array a? \n\n        But the output of program1.py is a single integer (the minimum moves). \n\n        Then program2.py would read that integer as n? and then try to read an array of n integers? \n\n        That would be an error.\n\n        Therefore, the two programs are not directly connected? \n\n        The problem says: \"runs correctly\". \n\n        But the two problems are independent? \n\n        The problem statement has two separate problems.\n\n        How to interpret? \n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        And then we are shown two separate programs.\n\n        And the command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So we must complete both programs so that the pipe works.\n\n        But what is the overall goal? \n\n        The problem does not say. \n\n        However, the first program (program1.py) outputs the minimum moves for its problem, and the second program (program2.py) outputs the number of distinct multisets M for its problem.\n\n        And the command pipes the output of program1 to program2.\n\n        But the second program does not use the output of the first program? \n\n        Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the input to program1.py is the same as the input to program2.py? \n\n        But the input to program1.py is: \n            n\n            a1 a2 ... an\n\n        and the input to program2.py is:\n            n\n            a1 a2 ... an\n\n        But when we run \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\", the input is only given to program1.py? Then program2.py reads from the pipe (which is the output of program1.py).\n\n        So program2.py must be able to read the output of program1.py as its input.\n\n        What is the output of program1.py? \n            A single integer.\n\n        What is the input of program2.py?\n            The first line is n, then the second line is n integers.\n\n        Therefore, we must change program1.py to output not only the answer but also the input? \n\n        Or change program2.py to read the output of program1.py as its input? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are not allowed to change the existing code arbitrarily.\n\n        We can only fill in the TODO blocks.\n\n        How can we make the pipe work? \n\n        The only possibility: program1.py must output the input it read? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output Specification: Print a single integer, the minimum number of moves\"\n\n        So we cannot output anything else.\n\n        Then program2.py will read a single integer and then try to read n integers? \n\n        This will fail.\n\n        Therefore, the two programs are not intended to be connected by the pipe in terms of the same input? \n\n        The problem might be: the output of program1.py is the input to program2.py, and the input to program1.py is not the same as the input to program2.py. \n\n        But the problem does not specify the input to the entire command.\n\n        Another possibility: the input to the pipe is the input for program1.py, and program2.py uses the output of program1.py to solve its problem.\n\n        What is the second problem? \n            It is about an array a of n integers.\n\n        What is the output of program1.py? \n            A single integer: the minimum moves.\n\n        How can that be the input to program2.py? \n            program2.py expects: \n                first line: n\n                second line: n integers\n\n            But it gets a single integer.\n\n        This does not match.\n\n        Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        And we have two independent problems.\n\n        The only logical explanation is that the input to program1.py is the same as the input to program2.py, and we are to run both programs on the same input, but the pipe is not used for the main data flow? \n\n        But then why pipe? \n\n        Perhaps program1.py is intended to output the answer for the first problem, and program2.py is intended to output the answer for the second problem, and the pipe is just to run them in sequence on the same input? \n\n        But how do they share the input? \n\n        In a pipe, the input to program1.py is from stdin, and program2.py reads from the pipe (which is the stdout of program1.py). \n\n        So if we want both to read the same input, we must provide the input only once, and then program1.py must forward the input to program2.py? \n\n        How? \n\n        We can have program1.py read the input, then print the answer for the first problem, and then print the input again for program2.py.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output Specification: Print a single integer\" for program1.py.\n\n        So we cannot print more than one integer.\n\n        Alternatively, program1.py could print the input after printing the answer? \n\n        But that would be two integers: the answer and then n? \n\n        Then program2.py would read the first integer as n, and then read n integers? \n\n        But the first integer is the answer of program1.py, not the n of the input.\n\n        This is messy.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the two problems are independent, and the TODO blocks are in separate parts, I think the problems are independent and the pipe is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output two completions.\n\n        Therefore, we will complete each program independently as per their own problem.\n\n        For program1.py: \n            We have to complete the TODO block.\n\n        For program2.py: \n            We have to complete the TODO block.\n\n        And hope that when run in sequence with the same input, program1.py outputs its answer and program2.py outputs its answer, and the pipe is not used for data flow between them beyond the output of program1.py being the input to program2.py, which doesn't work, but perhaps the problem expects program2.py to read the input from stdin independently? \n\n        But in a pipe, the stdin of program1.py is the only stdin. program2.py reads from the pipe, which is the stdout of program1.py.\n\n        So if we want program2.py to read the original input, we must have program1.py output the original input after its answer.\n\n        But the problem for program1.py says: \"Output a single integer\".\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Given the confusion, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we will complete the TODO blocks for each program as per their own problem, and not worry about the pipe.\n\n        For program1.py: \n\n            The problem: minimum moves to make b increasing.\n\n            We are given an array a of n positive integers.\n            Initially, b is [0,0,...,0].\n            In one move, we can choose an index i and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\n\n            We want b to be strictly increasing: b1 < b2 < ... < bn.\n\n            What is the minimum number of moves?\n\n            Example: \n                Input: n=5, a = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n                Output: 4\n\n            How to solve?\n\n            We can change b_i arbitrarily by multiples of a_i (by doing multiple moves on the same i). But each move is one operation.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                b_i = k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (positive or negative).\n\n            We require:\n                b1 < b2 < ... < bn.\n\n            We wish to minimize the total moves: sum_i |k_i|.\n\n            Note: k_i can be zero? But initially b_i=0, and if we do nothing, then k_i=0. But then b_i=0, and we require strictly increasing: 0<0 is false. So we cannot have two zeros.\n\n            Therefore, we must have b_i nonzero? \n\n            But we can do negative moves: so b_i can be negative.\n\n            We are allowed to do multiple moves on the same i.\n\n            We can also do a mix of positive and negative? But that would be inefficient. Typically, we would choose either to make b_i positive or negative.\n\n            However, the problem does not restrict the sign.\n\n            We need to assign k_i (an integer, not necessarily positive) such that:\n\n                k_0 * a_0 < k_1 * a_1 < ... < k_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\n\n            and minimize sum_i |k_i|.\n\n            This is a classic greedy or DP problem.\n\n            We can try to build the sequence from left to right.\n\n            We want b_i to be as close to 0 as possible to minimize the moves, but we have the constraint that b_i > b_{i-1}.\n\n            We can use dynamic programming:\n\n                Let dp[i][x] = minimum total moves for the first i+1 elements such that b_i = x.\n\n            But x can be very large? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy: \n\n            We know that we can always make b_i very large by using many positive moves, or very negative by many negative moves.\n\n            But we want to minimize the total moves.\n\n            We can try to make b_i as small as possible in absolute value while satisfying the increasing condition.\n\n            However, the condition is relative.\n\n            Insight: \n\n                We can choose the sign arbitrarily. For a fixed i, the smallest absolute value we can achieve for b_i is 0? But then we require b_i > b_{i-1}. If b_{i-1} is negative, then 0 might be greater than b_{i-1} and we use 0 moves? But wait, if we do nothing, b_i=0. But if b_{i-1} is negative, then 0 > b_{i-1} is true. But then we can have b_i=0. But then for the next element, we require b_{i+1} > 0. \n\n                However, we can also make b_i = a_i (by one positive move) or -a_i (by one negative move), or 0 (by zero moves), or 2*a_i, etc.\n\n            But note: we can only do multiples of a_i.\n\n            We wish to minimize the total moves.\n\n            We can use a greedy from left to right:\n\n                Let b0 be chosen as the multiple of a0 that minimizes |b0| and is at least ...? But there is no left constraint for b0.\n\n                However, we have to consider the future.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy from right to left? \n\n            Or use DP with state i and the current b_i, but b_i can be very large.\n\n            We need a better approach.\n\n            Note: the moves on an index i can be done independently, but the constraint is on the relative values.\n\n            We can try to make b_i as small as possible (in terms of absolute value) that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\n            For index i, given b_{i-1}, we wish to choose the smallest nonnegative integer k such that there exists an integer t (which can be negative) with:\n\n                b_i = t * a_i   (so t is the net number of moves: positive for adding, negative for subtracting)\n\n                and b_i > b_{i-1}\n\n                and we minimize |t|.\n\n            But note: we can also do positive moves only? Or negative moves only? \n\n            We wish to minimize |t|.\n\n            How to choose t? \n\n                We want the smallest |t| such that t * a_i > b_{i-1}.\n\n                But t can be negative? \n\n                If we use negative t, then b_i is negative. We require b_i > b_{i-1}. If b_{i-1} is negative, then we might be able to use a negative t that is greater than b_{i-1} (which is also negative).\n\n                But note: if we use a negative t, then b_i = t * a_i is negative. And if b_{i-1} is also negative, then we require t * a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\n                The smallest |t| might be achieved by a positive or negative t.\n\n            We can consider:\n\n                Let candidate1 = the smallest integer t such that t * a_i > b_{i-1} and t>=0.\n                Let candidate2 = the largest integer t such that t * a_i > b_{i-1} and t<0.\n\n                But note: if t is negative, then t * a_i is negative. And we require t * a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\n                The smallest |t| for a positive t: \n                    t_min_positive = floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) + 1   [if b_{i-1} is not negative, this might be positive]\n\n                For negative t: \n                    We require t * a_i > b_{i-1}  -> t > b_{i-1}/a_i.\n                    Since a_i>0, we can write: t > ceil(b_{i-1}/a_i) ??? \n\n                Actually, let d = b_{i-1} // a_i   (floor division) and r = b_{i-1} % a_i.\n\n                But if b_{i-1} is negative, floor division in Python is floor towards -infinity.\n\n                We want the smallest nonnegative |t|. \n\n                We can try:\n\n                    candidate = []\n\n                    # positive t: \n                    #   t >= ceil((b_{i-1}+1)/a_i)   -> because t*a_i > b_{i-1} -> t > b_{i-1}/a_i.\n                    #   let t0 = floor(b_{i-1}/a_i) + 1   -> then t0 is the smallest integer greater than b_{i-1}/a_i.\n\n                    # negative t:\n                    #   t must be negative, so let t = -s, s>0.\n                    #   then: -s * a_i > b_{i-1}  -> s < -b_{i-1}/a_i   [because multiplying by -1 reverses inequality] -> s < ceil(-b_{i-1}/a_i) ? \n                    #   but note: s must be an integer, so the largest s that satisfies s < -b_{i-1}/a_i is floor(-b_{i-1}/a_i - 1e-9) -> then the smallest s is 1, then 2, ... but we want the smallest |t| = s, so s=1,2,... up to floor(-b_{i-1}/a_i - 1e-9) are candidates? \n                    #   but note: we require s < -b_{i-1}/a_i, so s can be 1,2,..., floor((-b_{i-1}-1)/a_i) ??? \n\n                    This is messy.\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate over the two possibilities: the closest positive multiple and the closest negative multiple.\n\n                Specifically, we can compute:\n\n                    t1 = (b_{i-1} // a_i) + 1   # the smallest integer t such that t*a_i > b_{i-1} for t>=0? \n                    But if b_{i-1} is negative, then (b_{i-1} // a_i) is negative or zero? \n\n                    Example: b_{i-1} = -3, a_i=2: \n                        floor(-3/2) = -2 (in Python, floor division for negative: -3//2 = -2)\n                        then t1 = -2+1 = -1 -> which is negative, not positive.\n\n                We want the smallest nonnegative t: \n                    if b_{i-1} < 0, then t=0 is a candidate: 0 > b_{i-1} (which is negative) -> true.\n                    so the smallest nonnegative t is 0.\n\n                For negative t: \n                    if b_{i-1} < 0, then we can also use negative t. \n                    we want the smallest s (positive) such that -s * a_i > b_{i-1} \n                    -> s < -b_{i-1}/a_i.\n                    the smallest s is 1, then 2, ... but we want the smallest |t| = s, so s=1 is the best.\n\n                    But compare: \n                        t=0: |t|=0, and b_i=0.\n                        t=-1: |t|=1, and b_i = -2.\n                    so t=0 is better.\n\n                Therefore, for b_{i-1} < 0, we choose t=0.\n\n                If b_{i-1} >=0, then:\n                    positive t: t1 = floor(b_{i-1}/a_i)+1, and then b_i = t1 * a_i, moves = t1.\n                    negative t: we require -s * a_i > b_{i-1} -> s < -b_{i-1}/a_i. But b_{i-1}>=0, then -b_{i-1}/a_i <=0, so s<0 is not possible for s>0. So no negative candidate.\n\n                But wait: if b_{i-1}>=0, then negative t would give b_i<0, and then we require b_i> b_{i-1} (>=0) -> which is false. So negative t is not allowed.\n\n                Therefore, for b_{i-1}>=0, we must use positive t: the smallest t such that t*a_i > b_{i-1} is floor(b_{i-1}/a_i)+1.\n\n                However, what if b_{i-1} is 0? \n                    then t1 = floor(0/a_i)+1 = 0+1 = 1, so b_i = a_i, moves=1.\n\n                But could we use t=0? then b_i=0, but 0>0 is false. So we cannot.\n\n            Therefore, the rule for index i (0-indexed) is:\n\n                if i==0:\n                    we can choose b0 = 0? but then for the next element we require b1>0. \n                    But we can also choose b0 = -a0 (by one negative move) or b0 = a0 (by one positive move) or 0 (by zero moves). \n                    However, if we choose b0=0, then for the next element we require b1>0, which will cost at least 1 move (if we set b1 = a1).\n                    But if we choose b0 = -a0, then we require b1 > -a0. We can then choose b1=0? which is > -a0 (if a0>0) and cost 0 moves? \n                    Then total moves = 1 (for b0) + 0 (for b1) = 1.\n                    If we choose b0=0 and b1=a1, cost=1.\n                    Or b0 = a0, then b1 must be at least a0+1? which might cost more.\n\n                    So we have to consider the future.\n\n            This is complex.\n\n            We need a solution that works for the entire array.\n\n            We can use DP with the state being the value of b_i, but the state space is huge.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy that goes from left to right and chooses the smallest possible |b_i| that is > b_{i-1}. \n\n            For i=0:\n                the smallest |b0| that is possible is 0, but then b0=0.\n                However, we can also do b0 = a0 (|b0|=a0) or b0 = -a0 (|b0|=a0). \n                But 0 is smaller in absolute value.\n\n                However, if we choose b0=0, then for i=1, we require b1>0. The smallest |b1| that is >0 is 0? not possible. The next is a1 (if we do one positive move) or -a1 (but then b1=-a1<0, which is not >0). So we must use b1 = a1, cost=1.\n\n                Total cost = 0 (for b0) + 1 (for b1) = 1.\n\n                If we choose b0 = -a0, then for i=1, we require b1 > -a0. The smallest |b1| that is > -a0 is 0? because 0 > -a0 (since a0>0) and |0|=0. \n                So we can set b1=0, cost=0.\n\n                Total cost = 1 (for b0) + 0 = 1.\n\n                So both are the same.\n\n            Therefore, for i=0, we can choose either 0 or -a0? both yield total cost 1.\n\n            But note: we might have more elements.\n\n            For i=2, if we have a2, and if we have b1=0, then we require b2>0, so we must use at least one move for b2.\n\n            If we have"
