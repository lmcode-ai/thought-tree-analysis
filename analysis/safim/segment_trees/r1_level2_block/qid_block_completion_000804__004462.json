Now, what about n=5? \n  n=5: odd, and a1=4 -> divisible by 4? yes. Then we output (4, 1, 1, 1)? But wait: 4+1+1+1=7, not 5. Actually, k = (5-1)//4 = 1. Then we output (2*k, k, k, 1) = (2,1,1,1) -> 2+1+1+1=5. Check: gcd(2,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But the example for n=5?

The example says: output (2,2,2,1) for n=7? Actually the example says: \"In the second test case: 2+2+2+1=7\" and gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> matches. But the example output for n=7 in the note is (2,2,2,1). Our code for n=7 would output (2,2,2,1).

So the missing code for program2.py is:\n            k = a1 // 4\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1) But wait: the code already has an if condition for a1%4==0, so we are in that block. Therefore, we can write that. However, note: the condition above in the odd branch is:\n    if a1%3==0: ... \n    elif a1%4!=0: ... elif a1%4==0: ...

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The provided code has a while loop that uses two pointers (l and h) and two accumulators (a for Alice from the left, b for Bob from the right). The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (which is l + (n-1-h)) such that the total weights eaten by Alice and Bob are equal.\n\nThe current code does:\n  while(l<=h):\n      if(a>b):\n          b = b + l1[h]\n          h = h-1\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      if(a==b):\n          ans = l + (n-1-h)   # because l is the count from left (0-indexed, so l candies on left) and from right: n-1-h candies.\n\nWe note that the condition in the else block is when a <= b. In that case, we should take a candy from the left for Alice.\n\nSo we can complete the else block as:\n          a = a + l1[l]\n          l = l+1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the condition (a==b) check must be done after every update. However, the current code does the check after the update. So the else block should update a and l.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the condition (a==b) might be updated multiple times and we want the maximum total candies. The problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and the note says that the answer is the total number of candies (which is the count).\n\nBut note: the while loop condition is (l<=h). We are updating either the left or the right. We must update the left in the else block.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is:\n          a += l1[l]\n          l += 1\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so this two-pointer approach is efficient.\n\nHowever, note that the current code does not break when we have updated and then a==b? It continues until l<=h. And we update ans every time a==b. So the last time a==b might not be the maximum? Actually, we are traversing the entire array and updating ans whenever a==b. Since we are moving the pointers, we are capturing every possible moment when a==b. And because we are moving from the ends inward, the total candies eaten at a moment when a==b is l + (n-1-h). We want the maximum such total. However, note that the problem says \"maximum number of candies\", and we are updating ans every time we have equality. Since we are traversing the entire array, we will get the last equality? But note: we might have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total candies. However, the total candies is l + (n-1-h). As we move the pointers, l increases and h decreases, so the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) might not be monotonic? Actually, when we take from the left, l increases and when we take from the right, h decreases. The total candies is l + (n-1-h) = (l - h) + (n-1). Since l increases and h decreases, (l - h) increases. So the total candies increases as we proceed? Actually, no: because when we take from the left, l increases by 1 and the term (n-1-h) remains the same? Actually, no: the term (n-1-h) is fixed until we take from the right. Similarly, when we take from the right, h decreases by 1 so (n-1-h) increases by 1? Actually, when h decreases by 1, then (n-1-h) becomes (n-1 - (h-1)) = (n-1-h) + 1. So each time we take a candy (either left or right) the total count of candies eaten increases by 1. Therefore, the last time we have a==b will be the maximum total candies? But note: we are not necessarily having a==b at the end. We break when l>h. We update ans every time we have a==b. So we want the last time we have a==b? Actually, the problem does not require the last time, but the maximum total candies. Since the total candies increases by one each step, the last time we have a==b is the maximum.\n\nBut note: it is possible that we have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total candies. Since the total candies is increasing (because we are eating one candy at a time) then the last time we have a==b is the maximum. Therefore, we can update ans every time we have a==b and then at the end we have the maximum.\n\nHowever, the current code does not break the loop when we have updated and then a==b? It continues. That is correct because we might get a higher total later.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200,000, so the while loop runs at most 200,000 steps per test case? Actually, the constraint says the sum of n over test cases is 200,000. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is the else block that updates a and l.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the four integers problem. The provided code already handles:\n  - If n is divisible by 4: then we output (n//4, n//4, n//4, n//4)\n  - Else, if n is odd (a%2==1) then we have two cases:\n        if (a-1) is divisible by 3: then we output ( (a-1)//3, (a-1)//3, (a-1)//3, 1 )\n        else if (a-1) is not divisible by 4: then we do a1 = a-2 and output (a1//2, a1//2+1, 1, 1)\n        else if (a-1) is divisible by 4: then we have a TODO.\n\nAlso, for even n (the else branch) we do: a1 = a-2, then output (a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1, 1)\n\nWe need to complete the case when a is odd and (a-1) is divisible by 4.\n\nExample: the note says for n=9: output (2,4,2,1) -> but note that 2+4+2+1=9 and gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2. However, our code for n=9 (which is odd) would go to the odd branch. Then a1 = 9-1 = 8. 8 is divisible by 4? Yes. So we are in the TODO case.\n\nBut the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1). How can we produce that?\n\nWe have to assign a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\nWe note that the example uses: a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1. Then gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a different split.\n\nThe problem says the answer always exists.\n\nIn the TODO case: we have n (which is odd) and we set a1 = n-1, and a1 is divisible by 4. So a1 = 4*k for some k>=1 (because n>=4, and n is odd so n>=5, then a1>=4).\n\nWe need to split 4*k+1 into four positive integers.\n\nWe have already used the split (k, k, k, 1) for the case when a1 is divisible by 3? But now a1 is divisible by 4, so we cannot use the same as the divisible by 3 case.\n\nWe need to find four positive integers a, b, c, d such that:\n  a+b+c+d = 4*k+1\n  and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d)\n\nWe can try to set:\n  a = 2*k, b = 2*k, c = 1, d = 1? Then total = 2*k+2*k+1+1 = 4*k+2, which is too big (we need 4*k+1).\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n  a = 2*k, b = k, c = k, d = 1? Then total = 2*k + k + k + 1 = 4*k+1. Now check:\n      gcd(2*k, k) = k\n      lcm(k,1) = k\n  So we have gcd(a,b)=k and lcm(c,d)=k. This works.\n\nBut note: k = a1//4 = (n-1)//4.\n\nSo we can output: (2*k, k, k, 1) = ( (n-1)//2, (n-1)//4, (n-1)//4, 1 )? But wait: (n-1)//2 = 2*k, and (n-1)//4 = k.\n\nBut note: (n-1) is divisible by 4, so k is an integer.\n\nExample: n=9 -> a1=8, k=2. Then we output (2*2, 2, 2, 1) = (4,2,2,1). But the example output is (2,4,2,1). However, note that the order of a and b does not matter? The problem says \"output any four positive integers\". Also, the example output is (2,4,2,1) which is the same as (4,2,2,1) in terms of the condition: gcd(4,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2. So both are acceptable.\n\nBut note: the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1). We are outputting (4,2,2,1). The problem does not require a specific order? The problem says \"output 4 positive integers a, b, c, d\". The order is a, b, c, d. The example output is a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1. We are outputting a=4, b=2, c=2, d=1. This is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"It is possible to show that the answer always exists.\" and we can output any.\n\nBut note: the problem also has an example for n=10: output (3,5,1,1). In our code, for n=10 (which is even) we go to the else branch and output (a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1, 1) with a1=10-2=8 -> (8//2-1, 8//2+1, 1, 1) = (4-1,4+1,1,1) = (3,5,1,1). That matches.\n\nNow, what about n=5? \n  n=5: odd, and a1=4 -> divisible by 4? yes. Then we output (4, 1, 1, 1)? But wait: 4+1+1+1=7, not 5. \n  Actually, k = (5-1)//4 = 1. Then we output (2*k, k, k, 1) = (2,1,1,1) -> 2+1+1+1=5. \n  Check: gcd(2,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut the example for n=5? The example says: \n  In the fifth test case: gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10 -> that's for n=10.\n\nFor n=5, we have an example? The problem does not provide one, but our solution (2,1,1,1) is valid.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1 is positive.\n\nHowever, note: the example for n=7 (second test case) is handled by the first condition in the odd branch? \n  n=7: odd -> a1=6 -> divisible by 3? yes -> then output (6//3, 6//3, 6//3, 1) = (2,2,2,1). \n  The example says: output (2,2,2,1) for n=7? Actually the example says: \"In the second test case: 2+2+2+1=7\" and gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> matches.\n\nBut the example output for n=7 in the note is (2,2,2,1). Our code for n=7 would output (2,2,2,1). \n\nNow, what about n=13 (odd and a1=12, divisible by 4)? \n  k=12//4=3 -> output (2*3, 3, 3, 1) = (6,3,3,1) -> 6+3+3+1=13. \n  Check: gcd(6,3)=3, lcm(3,1)=3 -> works.\n\nTherefore, for the TODO in program2.py, we can write:\n        if a1 % 4 == 0:\n            k = a1 // 4\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\n\nBut note: the variable a1 is set to a-1 (which is n-1). So we have k = (n-1)//4.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n            k = a1 // 4\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\n\nBut wait: the code already has an if condition for a1%4==0, so we are in that block.\n\nTherefore, we can write that.\n\nHowever, note: the condition above in the odd branch is:\n    if a1%3==0: ... \n    elif a1%4!=0: ... \n    elif a1%4==0: ... \n\nBut note: if a1 is divisible by 3, we use the first branch. If not, then we check if a1%4 !=0? Then we do the second branch. Then if a1%4==0, we do the third branch. This is correct.\n\nBut note: what if a1 is divisible by both 3 and 4? Then we use the first branch? Because the condition is if-elif. So we use the first branch. But that is acceptable because we have a solution for the divisible by 3 case. However, the problem does not require a unique solution. And the divisible by 3 case is valid.\n\nBut note: the example n=5: a1=4 -> divisible by 4? yes, but not by 3 -> so we skip the first branch and then the second branch condition is a1%4!=0 -> false, so we go to the third branch.\n\nSo the code is structured correctly.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n            k = a1 // 4\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\n\nBut note: the variable a1 is defined as a1 = a-1 (which is n-1) in the odd branch.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nImportant: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the else block. We are replacing the comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" with two lines.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the block for the elif a1%4==0.\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py in the TODO part is already in an elif block, so we just need to write the two lines.\n\nLet's write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        a += l1[l]\\n        l += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"            k = a1 // 4\\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code.\n\nIn program1.py, the else block is at the same indentation as the if block above. The if block in the while loop has two lines (the condition and the update). The else block should have two lines as well.\n\nIn program2.py, the TODO is inside the elif block, so we need to indent one more level.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py for the TODO is:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with two lines that are indented by the same amount (which is 12 spaces? Actually, the code is indented by 4 spaces per level). The current block is:\n\n        if a%2==1:\n            a1=(a-1)\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                a1=a-2\n                print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with two lines that are indented by 4 more spaces (so 16 spaces total). But in the provided code, the print statements above are at 16 spaces. So we do the same.\n\nTherefore, the two lines for program2 should be indented by 16 spaces (or 4 more than the current elif). But in the JSON string we must represent the newlines and the exact spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nFor program1: the two lines are exactly as in the code above.\n\nBut note: the code in program1 has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and we are replacing that with two lines. We must not include the comment.\n\nSo the missing code for program1 is:\n        a += l1[l]\n        l += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code in the else block is only the comment. We are replacing the entire else block? Actually, the else block currently has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the two lines (the else: and the comment) with:\n\n        else:\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output only the two lines that go in the else block (without the else: and without the comment). However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". And the example output format is the string that replaces the TODO.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo for program1, we output the two lines that are the body of the else block (without the else:). The else: is already present.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we output the two lines that are the body of the elif block (without the elif condition).\n\nTherefore, the two lines for program1 are:\n        a += l1[l]\n        l += 1\n\nAnd for program2, the two lines are:\n            k = a1 // 4\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\n\nBut note: the variable a1 is already defined above (as a1 = a-1). So we don't need to redefine it.\n\nNow, we write the JSON.\n\nImportant: We must escape the newlines and quotes? The problem says to output the JSON.\n\nWe can write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        a += l1[l]\\n        l += 1\", \"program2\": \"            k = a1 // 4\\n            print(2*k, k, k, 1)\"}\n\nBut note: the program2 code has a print statement that outputs four numbers. The numbers are: 2*k, k, k, 1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output 4 positive integers a, b, c, d\". The order is a, b, c, d. We are outputting (2*k, k, k, 1). This is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: the example for n=9: we output (4,2,2,1). The example output in the note is (2,4,2,1). But the problem does not require a specific order? The condition is symmetric in a and b? Actually, the condition is gcd(a,b) and lcm(c,d). The gcd is symmetric, so (a,b) can be swapped? Similarly, the lcm is symmetric? But note: the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1). Our output is (4,2,2,1). This is different. However, the problem says \"output any four positive integers\". So both are acceptable.\n\nBut the example output for n=5: (2,1,1,1) -> 2+1+1+1=5, and gcd(2,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. This is valid.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
