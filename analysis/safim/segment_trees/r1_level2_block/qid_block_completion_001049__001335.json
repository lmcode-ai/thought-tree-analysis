    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length of the subarray multiplied by the sign of its sum (positive: +1, zero: 0, negative: -1).\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum sum. The missing part is inside the loop for i in range(1, n+1). After updating dp[i], we have:\n\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to update the dictionary `dmx` which maps a prefix sum to the best dp value we have seen so far for that prefix.\n\nSo we should set:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the problem says that if we have the same prefix sum, we want to remember the best (largest) dp value for that prefix because that might help in future transitions.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nHowever, note that the condition is: if dp[i] is greater than the current value for the same prefix, then update. So we are already doing the update conditionally.\n\nBut what if the key doesn't exist? We use `dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)`, so if it doesn't exist we get -INF and then we update.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has the condition. We just need to fill the TODO.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about making the price n*k (with 1<=k<=m) as round as possible (maximizing trailing zeros) and then if multiple, choose the maximum n*k.\n\nThe code factors n into 2^a * 5^b * c. Then it tries to balance the exponents of 2 and 5 by multiplying by 5 (if a>b) or by 2 (if b>a) as long as the factor t (which we are going to multiply by) does not exceed m.\n\nThe missing part is in the branch for when b>a. We are to multiply by 2 until we balance or until we exceed m.\n\nSo the missing code for the branch `elif b > a` is:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop: we are multiplying t by 2 and increasing a until a becomes equal to b? Actually, we are increasing a until it equals b? But note: we are in the case b>a, so we want to increase a until it is at least b? Actually, we are only doing one step at a time. The goal is to balance the exponents? Actually, the roundness is determined by the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. So if we have more 5s (b>a), then we can multiply by 2 to increase a until it equals b? But note: we don't necessarily have to make them equal? Actually, we are allowed to multiply by 10s as well. The idea is to first balance the exponents as much as possible without exceeding m, and then multiply by 10 as long as we can.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop: we are multiplying t by 2 and then updating a (which is the exponent of 2) by 1. This is because each multiplication by 2 adds one exponent of 2.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nNote: The entire program must not be output, only the missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing part is a single line: `dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]`\n\nFor program2.py, the missing part is two lines: \n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code. The provided code for the 2 branch has an indentation level of 8 (because it is inside a while loop that is inside an if-elif block). However, the existing code for the 5 branch has:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo the missing two lines should be at the same indentation level as the two lines in the 5 branch.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program2.py, we output two lines with the same indentation.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON.\n\nSo we write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"}\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the line we are replacing is a comment that says \"# TODO: Your code here\". We are replacing that entire line with the code. The existing code has 8 spaces of indentation at that point? Actually, the code block for the for-loop is:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the existing line has 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the for-loop is at 4 spaces, then the body is 8, then the if-block is 12. So we need 12 spaces? However, the provided code in the problem has 4-space indentation. But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code in the if-block is at 12 spaces. So we output:\n\n    \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nBut wait, the existing line we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire line. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the existing code for the 5 branch has:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nAnd the missing part for the 2 branch is:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with two lines. The existing two lines in the 5 branch are at 12 spaces of indentation. So the two lines we write should be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", so we output two lines. However, we are to put them in a JSON string. We must escape newlines.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines as a single string with a newline in between.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"}\n\nBut wait, the program2.py code has:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe existing while loop in the 5 branch has two lines at 12 spaces. The missing part in the 2 branch should be two lines at 12 spaces. So the two lines we output for program2.py are:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the existing code in the 5 branch uses 8 spaces for the while loop and 12 for the body? Actually, the while loop is at 8 (because it's inside the if-elif) and the body is at 12. So the two lines we write are at 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 500000, so the program1.py code is efficient. And the program2.py code is for t up to 10000, so it's efficient.\n\nLet me double-check the program2.py: after balancing, we then multiply by 10 as long as we can? Yes, the next while loop is:\n\n    while 10 * t <= m:\n        t *= 10\n\nThen we compute k = m - (m % t) and then output n * k.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nSo we output the JSON as above."
