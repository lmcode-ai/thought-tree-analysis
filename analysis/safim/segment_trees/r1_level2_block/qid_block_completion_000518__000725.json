    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: We have n items and q queries. We are given the prices of the items and then q queries (x, y). \n The promotion: if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free.\n We are to compute, for each query, the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\n Important note: The customer can choose which items to purchase (as long as at least x items). Therefore, the strategy is to choose a set of items that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest items in that set. However, note that the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So we want the y cheapest in the chosen set to be as large as possible.\n\n How?\n Since we can choose any set, we would want to have as many high-priced items as possible, but note: the free items are the cheapest ones in the set. Therefore, we want to have a set of exactly x items (because buying more than x might force us to include cheaper items that would then be included in the free part? Actually, we can always choose to ignore extra items. But note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we can choose any number >= x. However, if we choose more than x, then we are including more items and the y cheapest might become smaller? Actually, we can always choose exactly x items. Why? Because if we choose more than x, then the free items are the y cheapest in the entire set. But if we choose exactly x, then the free items are the y cheapest in that set. \n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose any set. So we can choose a set of exactly x items. Then the free items are the y cheapest in that set. To maximize the free sum, we want the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible. How? We can choose the set to be the x largest items? But then the y cheapest in that set are the last y of the sorted (ascending) of that set. Alternatively, we can sort the entire list of prices in descending order.\n\n Approach:\n Sort the prices in descending order. Then consider: if we choose the top x items (the x most expensive), then the free items are the last y items in this set (which are the smallest in the set). But note: we are free to choose any set. However, it turns out that the optimal set is exactly the top x items. Why? Because if we replace any item in the top x with a cheaper one, then the free items (which are the y cheapest) might become even cheaper. Therefore, the best is to take the top x items.\n\n Then the free sum is the sum of the smallest y items in the top x? Actually, in the top x (which are sorted in descending order), the smallest y items are the last y in the descending order, which are the first y in the ascending order? But note: we have sorted in descending order. So the top x items are: [p0, p1, ..., p_{x-1}] (with p0 being the largest). Then the smallest y items in this set are the last y: [p_{x-y}, p_{x-y+1}, ..., p_{x-1}]. \n\n However, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the descending sorted array? But note: we need the sum of a contiguous segment at the end of the top x? Actually, we can precompute the prefix sum for the descending array.\n\n Let p_sorted_desc = sorted(p, reverse=True)\n Precompute an array s such that:\n   s[0] = 0\n   s[i] = p_sorted_desc[0] + p_sorted_desc[1] + ... + p_sorted_desc[i-1]\n\n Then for a query (x, y):\n   The free items are the last y in the top x, which are the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending array? \n   But note: our array is 0-indexed. The top x items are indices 0 to x-1. The smallest y in this set are the last y, which are indices (x-y) to (x-1). The sum of these is s[x] - s[x-y].\n\n However, let me check with the example in the note:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, q=3, p = [5,3,1,5,2] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n   Query1: x=3, y=2 -> free sum = 3+5? But note: the example says \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\". However, in the set of three items: the customer can choose the two 5's and the 3? Then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? But wait, 3 and 5: that's 8? But in our descending array for the top 3: [5,5,3]. The last two are 5 and 3 -> sum=8. Correct.\n\n   How do we compute: \n        s[3] = 5+5+3 = 13\n        s[3-2] = s[1] = 5\n        Then the free sum = s[3] - s[1] = 8.\n\n   Query2: x=2, y=1 -> free sum = 5? \n        We take top 2: [5,5]. The last 1: 5 -> sum=5.\n        s[2] = 5+5 = 10, s[2-1]=s[1]=5 -> 10-5=5.\n\n   Query3: x=5, y=3 -> free sum = 1+2+3=6? \n        Top 5: [5,5,3,2,1]. The last 3: 3,2,1 -> sum=6.\n        s[5]=5+5+3+2+1=16, s[5-3]=s[2]=5+5=10 -> 16-10=6.\n\n Therefore, the formula for a query (x,y) is: \n        free_sum = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n But note: our prefix sum array s is defined for the descending array, and we have:\n        s[0]=0\n        s[1]=p0\n        s[2]=p0+p1\n        ... \n\n However, in the code provided, we have:\n        p = sorted(Y())[::-1]   # This sorts in ascending and then reverses -> descending.\n        s = [0]\n        for i in p: \n            s += [s[-1] + i]\n\n Then s[i] is the sum of the first i items in the descending array (i.e., the top i items).\n\n Therefore, for a query (x,y):\n        We want the sum of the last y in the top x -> which is the same as the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending array? \n        But note: the entire top x is from index0 to index x-1. The last y are from index x-y to x-1. The sum of these y items is the total of the top x minus the top (x-y) items? \n        So: free_sum = (sum of top x) - (sum of top (x-y)) \n                   = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n However, note: the example above: \n        x=3, y=2: s[3] - s[1] = (5+5+3) - (5) = 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, for each query, we do:\n        O.append(str(s[x] - s[x-y]))\n\n But note: the problem says that the input has q queries, each with two integers x_i and y_i.\n\n However, the code provided for program1.py:\n\n        Y=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n        O=[];n,q=Y();p=sorted(Y())[::-1];s=[0]\n        for i in p:s+=[s[-1]+i]\n        for _ in[0]*q:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print('\\n'.join(O))\n\n So we need to fill the for loop for the queries.\n\n For each query, we read x and y, then compute s[x] - s[x-y] and append that as a string to O.\n\n But note: the constraints: n, q up to 200,000. The array s has length n+1. The computation for each query is O(1). So it's efficient.\n\n However, note: the indices. Our array s is 0-indexed for the prefix sums. The element at index k in s is the sum of the first k items in the descending array. So for x, we use s[x] (which is the sum of the first x items). Similarly, s[x-y] is the sum of the first (x-y) items.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        for _ in [0]*q:\n            x, y = Y()\n            # We have to compute: free_sum = s[x] - s[x-y]\n            O.append(str(s[x] - s[x-y]))\n\n But note: the input order: the first line is n,q, then the list of prices, then q lines each with x and y.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the variable Y is a function that returns a map of integers from input().split(). So we can do: x, y = Y().\n\n But note: the example input:\n\n        \"5 3\"\n        \"5 3 1 5 2\"\n        \"3 2\"\n        \"2 1\"\n        \"5 3\"\n\n So for the first query: x=3, y=2 -> we compute s[3] - s[1] = 13 - 5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n However, what if x-y is 0? Then we use s[0]=0 -> that's safe.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is the two lines inside the for loop.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: t test cases. For each test case, an integer rating. We have to output the division.\n\n The divisions:\n   Division 1: rating >= 1900\n   Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n   Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n   Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n We note: the divisions are mutually exclusive and cover all integers.\n\n We can use if-else:\n\n   if rating >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n   elif rating >= 1600:   # and rating <= 1899 (because if it were >=1900 we would have taken the first branch)\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n   elif rating >= 1400:   # and rating <= 1599\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n   else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\n However, the code provided:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n The input: the first line is t, then t lines each with a rating.\n\n The variable n in the loop is a string from the input (including newline). We need to convert it to an integer.\n\n We can do: rating = int(n)\n\n Then we can use the conditionals.\n\n But note: the example test cases: \n        -789 -> Division 4\n        1299 -> Division 4\n        1300 -> Division 4\n        1399 -> Division 4\n        1400 -> Division 3\n        1679 -> Division 2\n        2300 -> Division 1\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            r = int(n)\n            if r >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif r >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif r >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n However, note: the problem says the rating can be from -5000 to 5000, and the divisions are defined as above.\n\n But note: the condition for Division 4: rating <= 1399. The conditionals above: the else branch catches everything below 1400, which is exactly Division 4.\n\n Therefore, we can write the conditionals as above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"For each test case, output a single line\". So we are printing one line per test.\n\n However, the code provided does not have any other output. We are replacing the TODO.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above if-elif-else block.\n\n But note: the code is reading from open(0) and the first element (index0) is the first line (which is t), and we skip it with [1:].\n\n So we are processing each test case.\n\n Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n Example output:\n   {\"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\", \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"}\n\n However, note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code.\n\n For program1.py: the for loop is:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are to put two lines of code. The current indentation level is 0 (since the for loop is at the same level as the previous lines). But the for loop body must be indented.\n\n The provided code uses 4 spaces per indent? Actually, the problem does not specify. But the existing code uses no spaces? Actually, the existing code:\n\n        O=[];n,q=Y();p=sorted(Y())[::-1];s=[0]\n        for i in p:s+=[s[-1]+i]\n\n This is written in a compact form. The for loop is one line. But the next for loop is:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are going to write two lines? Then we must break the for loop into multiple lines.\n\n We can do:\n\n        for _ in [0]*q:\n            x, y = Y()\n            O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\n But note: the existing code has a colon at the end of the for loop? Actually, the provided code has:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n This is a syntax error because the body is missing. We are going to replace the comment with two lines of code. We must indent the next two lines by 4 spaces.\n\n Similarly, for program2.py, the for loop is:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are going to write multiple lines. We must indent the body.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        x, y = Y()\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\n And for program2.py:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the entire code for program2.py must be without extra indentation? Actually, the for loop body must be indented. The provided code has the for loop at the top level. So we indent the next lines by 4 spaces.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n We are to output the missing code for each program as a string in the JSON.\n\n We must be cautious about the newlines and quotes.\n\n We'll escape the quotes in the strings.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the code for program2.py without the for loop? We are only to fill the body of the for loop? The TODO is inside the for loop. So we only need the body of the for loop.\n\n But note: the TODO in program1.py is at the end of the for loop line. We are to write the body of the for loop? The body of the for loop is two lines.\n\n Therefore, the JSON we return:\n\n   {\n      \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n      \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n   }\n\n But note: the indentation level for the body of the for loop in program1.py: the existing code does not have any indentation. We must add one level of indentation (say 4 spaces) for the two lines.\n\n Similarly, for program2.py, the existing for loop is at the top level, so the body must be indented by 4 spaces. And the conditionals inside the if-else must be indented one more level (so 8 spaces for the print statements).\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the style. Since the provided code in program1.py uses no spaces? Actually, the provided code in program1.py is written without indentation? \n\n But note: the for loop for building the prefix sum is written as:\n\n        for i in p:s+=[s[-1]+i]\n\n This is a one-liner. The next for loop is also written as a one-liner? But we are breaking it. We must use the same indentation as the rest? Actually, the problem does not specify. But in Python, we must have consistent indentation.\n\n Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we assume that the surrounding code is already indented appropriately. We are to write the body of the for loop for the queries in program1.py, so we need to indent the two lines by one level (4 spaces). Similarly, for program2.py, the body of the for loop must be indented by 4 spaces, and the conditionals by 8 and 12? Actually, the conditionals are blocks.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the entire block for program2.py without worrying about the outer indentation? Actually, the existing for loop in program2.py is:\n\n        for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are to write the body of the for loop. The body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop. Then the conditionals inside the if-else should be indented by 4 more spaces.\n\n But note: the example output in the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. We'll use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is two lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n For program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n        r = int(n)\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n And each line of this block should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop. But the conditionals (if, elif, else) are at the same level as the assignment to r? Then the print statements are indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 in total).\n\n However, the entire block is the body of the for loop. So:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            r = int(n)\n            if r >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif r >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif r >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above 7 lines, each line (except the first) starting with 4 spaces? Actually, the first line (r = int(n)) is at 4 spaces, then the if, elif, else are at 4 spaces, and the prints are at 8.\n\n But note: the conditionals (if, elif, else) are at the same level as the assignment? Then they are at 4 spaces. The body of the if (the print) is at 8.\n\n So the string for program2.py is:\n\n        \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n And for program1.py:\n\n        \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n\n But note: the for loop in program1.py is written without a body? We are adding two lines. The first line reads the query, the second appends the result.\n\n However, the existing code for the for loop is:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are replacing the comment with two lines? Actually, we are writing the body of the for loop. We break the line after the colon? The existing code has the comment at the end of the same line. We can write:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:\n            x, y = Y()\n            O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\n So the two lines we write are indented by 4 spaces.\n\n Therefore, the JSON:\n\n   {\n      \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n      \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n   }\n\n But note: the quotes inside the string for program2.py must be escaped. We use backslash to escape the double quotes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the outer JSON and then double quotes inside without escaping? But the problem says to output JSON. The outer JSON uses double quotes. So we must escape the inner double quotes.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"    x, y = Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n      \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n However, the program2.py code has multiple lines. We use \\n to separate them.\n\n But note: the last line of program2.py has 8 spaces? Actually, the else branch and the print are at 4 and 8 respectively.\n\n We write the string exactly as the code would be written, with the same indentation.\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces? We assume 4 per indent.\n\n Let me write the program2.py block as a string:\n\n        Line1: 4 spaces + \"r = int(n)\"\n        Line2: 4 spaces + \"if r >= 1900:\"\n        Line3: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\"\n        Line4: 4 spaces + \"elif r >= 1600:\"\n        Line5: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n        Line6: 4 spaces + \"elif r >= 1400:\"\n        Line7: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n        Line8: 4 spaces + \"else:\"\n        Line9: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n So the string is:\n\n        \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Now, we output the JSON."
