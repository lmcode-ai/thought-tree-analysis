Then fifth line: \n        ctr = [2,1,1] -> min is 1 at index1 and index2, say index1.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+1+1) - 1) = 2*3 = 6 -> cnt[5] = 10+6 = 16. Then sixth line: \n        ctr = [2,2,1] -> min is 1 at index2.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+2+1) - 1) = 2*4 = 8 -> cnt[6] = 16+8 = 24. Then seventh line: \n        ctr = [2,2,2] -> min is 2, so i=0.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+2+2) - 2) = 2*4 = 8 -> cnt[7] = 24+8 = 32. Then eighth line: \n        ctr = [3,2,2] -> min is 2 at index1 and index2, say index1.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (3+2+2) - 2) = 2*5 = 10 -> cnt[8] = 32+10 = 42. So for n=1: we need k=2? because k=0 -> 0, k=1 -> 0, k=2 -> 2 (which is >=1) -> so k=2. For n=2: k=2 -> 2, so k=2. For n=3: we need k=3? because k=3 gives 6 which is >=3 -> k=3. But the problem says: \n        \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed.\" -> meaning n=1 and n=2? \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\" -> meaning n=3? but wait, the example says: \n            \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\" So for n=1: we need 2 lines? because 2 lines give 2 triangles (which is >=1). For n=2: 2 lines give 2 triangles -> so k=2. For n=3: we need 3 lines because 2 lines only give 2, and 3 lines give 6. So the cnt array we built: \n        k=0: 0\n        k=1: 0\n        k=2: 2\n        k=3: 6\n        k=4: 10\n        etc. The problem: we are to find the minimum k such that cnt[k] >= n.\n\n   The function solve(sn) is defined to do a binary search on the cnt array? The code:\n\n        def solve(sn):\n            t = int(sn)   # actually, this is the n for the test case? but the variable name is confusing? but we are using t as the test case value? \n            s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1   # we are going to search in the cnt array for the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t. while s < e:\n                m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Count pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\n The input: t test cases, each with n strings (each string is two letters from 'a' to 'l'? note: 97 to 108 is 'a' to 'l')\n However, note the description says from 'a' to 'k' (which is 97 to 107). But the code uses 97 to 108 (which is 'a' to 'l'). \n But the note says: \"consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\", so we have 11 letters? Actually, the code uses 12 letters (a to l). \n Let me check: the problem says from 'a' to 'k' -> that's 11 letters. But the code initializes for 12 letters (from 97 to 108 inclusive: 108-97+1=12). \n This might be an error. However, the problem says the string consists of letters from 'a' to 'k', so we don't have 'l'. \n But the code is generating keys for all pairs from 'a' to 'l'. This will include 'l' which is not in the input. \n However, the input guarantee is from 'a' to 'k', so we won't see 'l'. But in the loop, we are generating neighbors by changing one character to any from 'a' to 'l'. \n This might be a problem because we are generating strings that are not in the input? \n\n Actually, the approach is: for each string s, we consider two positions (l=0 and l=1). For each position, we change the character to every letter from 'a' to 'l' (which is 12 letters) and then look up the count of that string in the dictionary. But note: we are only counting pairs that have been seen before? And we are updating the dictionary as we go.\n\n However, the current code has a TODO and a line that is not complete.\n\n The current code for a string s does:\n   for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):   # 109 is exclusive, so 97 to 108 -> 12 letters\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n Then it does d1[s] += 1.\n\n The problem: when a == s (i.e., we didn't change the string at all) then we are going to count the same string? But note, we are iterating over all m and when m is the same as the current character, we get a==s. We don't want to count the same string? Because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. So we should skip when a==s.\n\n Also, note that we are counting pairs (i, j) with i<j. The dictionary d1 counts the frequency of each string that has been processed (so for the current string, we haven't added it yet). \n\n The idea: for the current string s, we want to count all the previous strings that differ in exactly one position. How?\n   We can generate all the strings that differ in exactly one position: for the first character changed (and the second same) and for the second character changed (and the first same). But note: if we change the first character to something else, we get a string that has the same second character and a different first. Similarly for the second.\n\n However, the current loop does:\n   for each position l (0 and 1):\n        for each letter m from 'a' to 'l':\n            generate a string a by replacing the l-th character of s with chr(m)\n\n Then we add d1[a] (the count of that string in the dictionary so far) to ans1.\n\n But note: this counts every pair that has the current string and a previous string that is a. However, if we change both positions, then that pair would be counted twice? Actually, no: because we are only changing one position at a time. But wait: we are generating two sets of strings: those that differ in the first character and those that differ in the second. However, if we change the first character and then the second, that would be two separate changes? And we are not generating the string that differs in both.\n\n But note: we are only changing one character at a time. So each generated string a differs from s in exactly one position. However, we are also generating the same string s (when m equals the current character). We should skip that.\n\n Also, note: we are iterating over 12 letters for each position. But the input only uses 11 letters? However, the dictionary d1 was initialized for all 12 letters? But the input doesn't have 'l', so d1 for any string containing 'l' will be 0? So it's safe? But we are generating strings with 'l'? and then looking them up? and since they are not in the input (except if the input had 'l', but the problem says only up to 'k') then it's 0. So it's safe.\n\n However, the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k'. So we don't have 'l'. Therefore, we can avoid generating 'l'? But the problem doesn't require that. The current code generates 12 letters. But we can change the inner loop to 97 to 108? Actually, the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we can generate only 11 letters? But note: the current string s is from 'a' to 'k', so when we change a character, we are generating a string that might be in the set of allowed letters? But the problem doesn't say the generated string must be in the input? We are just counting the frequency of the generated string in the previous strings. And if the generated string is not in the input, then d1[a] is 0? But we initialized d1 for all 12*12=144 strings to 0. So it's safe.\n\n However, the issue is: we are counting the same string when m equals the current character. We should skip that.\n\n So the TODO: we should skip the case when a==s. We can do:\n\n   if a == s:\n        continue\n\n But note: the current code has an if block and then a comment TODO. Then after the if block, we do ans1 += d1[a]. So we are adding d1[a] even when a==s? That would be wrong because we are going to count the same string (which we haven't added yet, but if there are duplicates, then we might have previous same strings?).\n\n Actually, we don't want to count the same string because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. So we should skip when a==s.\n\n Therefore, we can replace the TODO with a continue? But note: the code after the if block is executed regardless. So we want to skip the addition for a==s.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if a != s:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the current code does:\n\n        if a == s:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n So we have two options: either skip the addition for a==s, or do nothing in the if and then avoid adding for a==s? Actually, we can break out of the inner loop for that particular m? But no, we just want to skip the current a.\n\n We can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # but note: we are in the middle of the loop and we want to skip the rest of the block for this a.\n\n But the code has the addition after the if. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n However, the current code does not have the addition inside an else. So we can change the code to:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But note: the original code has the addition outside the if. So we can simply add a continue in the TODO and then the addition will be skipped for a==s.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if a != s:\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the problem: the TODO is only for the case a==s. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            pass   # do nothing, but then we still add d1[a] which is the same as the current string? which we don't want.\n\n So we must avoid adding d1[a] when a==s.\n\n Since we cannot change the structure (because the problem says \"fill in the missing lines or blocks\"), we must put something in the TODO that will skip the addition for a==s.\n\n We can use:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n\n But note: the continue will skip the rest of the current iteration of the inner loop? and then we won't do the addition. That's what we want.\n\n However, the code after the if is the addition. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # this will skip the addition for this a\n\n But the continue will skip the addition and go to the next m.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if a == s:\n            pass\n        else:\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the problem says we can only fill in the TODO block. We cannot change the existing line that does the addition? because it's not in the TODO.\n\n Actually, the TODO is only inside the if block. So we can write:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # this will skip the rest of the current iteration\n\n But note: the addition is after the if block, so we cannot skip it by a continue? because the continue would skip the entire rest of the inner loop iteration.\n\n Actually, the code for the inner loop is:\n\n        for m in range(97,109):\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n We want to skip the addition for a==s. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # skip the addition for this a\n\n But then the continue will skip the addition and go to the next m.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            pass\n        else:\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But we cannot change the existing line? The problem says \"fill in the missing lines or blocks\". The existing line \"ans1 += d1[a]\" is already there. We cannot remove it. So we must skip it for a==s by using a continue.\n\n Therefore, in the TODO block, we can write:\n\n            continue\n\n But note: the continue is inside the if and then the next line (the addition) is executed only if we don't continue. So for a==s, we do the continue and skip the addition. For a != s, we do the addition.\n\n However, what if we have multiple same strings? For example, if we have two identical strings, then when we process the second one, we will generate the same string (by not changing anything) and then skip it? But we also generate the same string by changing a character to the same character? and then skip. But we also generate the same string by changing the other character to the same? so we skip two times? But that doesn't matter because we are only skipping the same string.\n\n But note: we are also generating the same string in two different ways? for l=0 and l=1? Actually, for each position, we set the character to the same as it is? so we get the same string twice? and we skip twice? and then we do the addition for the other 11*2 = 22 possibilities? which is correct.\n\n However, we are also counting pairs that differ in one position? but note: if we have two identical strings, then they are not counted because we skip when a==s. But we are not looking for identical strings? we are looking for strings that differ in exactly one position. So identical strings are not counted.\n\n But what about pairs of two different strings that are identical? They are not counted because we skip a==s? but note: when we process the second occurrence of a string s, we are going to count the first occurrence? because we generate the string s (by not changing) and skip? but we also generate the same string by changing a character to the same? and skip. But we also generate the same string by changing the other character to the same? and skip. But we don't generate the same string by changing a character to a different one? because then it would be a different string.\n\n Actually, we are not counting pairs of identical strings at all? and that's correct because they don't differ in exactly one position.\n\n However, the problem: we are counting pairs that differ in exactly one position. The current approach:\n\n   For the current string s, we generate every string a that differs from s in exactly one character (by changing one character to any of the 12 letters, but skipping when we don't change). Then we add the frequency of a in the dictionary (which counts the previous strings).\n\n   Then we add the current string s to the dictionary.\n\n This counts the pair (previous occurrence of a, current s) for every a that is one change away. And we do this for every string.\n\n But note: if we have two strings that are the same, then when we process the second one, we don't count the first one because we skip a==s? and we are generating a==s? and skip. But we are not generating the same string? Actually, we are generating the same string when we set the changed character to the same as it is? but we skip. So we don't count the pair (first, second) because they are the same? and we don't want to count them.\n\n So the approach is correct.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, we fill the TODO with:\n\n            continue\n\n But note: the code has an indentation. The TODO is inside the if block. So we write:\n\n            continue\n\n However, we must be cautious: the continue will break out of the inner loop? No, it will only skip the rest of the current iteration of the inner loop (for the current m) and move to the next m.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is: \"continue\"\n\n But wait: what if we have a string that is not in the dictionary? Actually, we initialized the dictionary for all 144 strings to 0. So every string a we generate is in the dictionary.\n\n However, the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k', so we don't have 'l'. But we are generating strings with 'l'. And we initialized the dictionary for all 12 letters, so d1[a] is defined.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n The problem: We are to find the minimum number of lines (let it be k) such that the number of equilateral triangles created is at least n.\n\n We are given: \n   ctr = [0,0,0]   # three counters? \n   cnt = [0]        # list of counts of triangles for k lines? \n\n Then we have a while loop that builds the cnt array until the last element is at least 10^9.\n\n The loop:\n\n   i = ctr.index(min(ctr))\n   cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n   ctr[i] += 1\n\n What does this do?\n\n The note: \"Adding two red lines results in two new yellow equilateral triangles.\" and then the example: 2 lines -> 2 triangles.\n\n Also, the example: 3 lines -> 6 triangles? Actually, the note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below.\" and the example below (in the image) has 6 triangles? But the problem says: \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\" and then for 3 lines, we get 6? \n\n How does the recurrence work?\n\n The problem is about hexagonal grid and adding lines in three directions (parallel to the edges). The three directions are 0, 60, 120 degrees? \n\n The idea: when we add a line in one direction, it can form triangles with lines in the other two directions. \n\n The recurrence in the code:\n\n   We have three counters (ctr) for the three directions. The next line to add is in the direction that currently has the minimum count (to balance?).\n\n   Then the number of new triangles added by adding a line in direction i is: 2 * (sum(ctr) - ctr[i])\n\n   Why? \n      The new line will intersect with all existing lines in the other two directions. And each pair of lines (one from each of the other two directions) will form two triangles? (because the triangle can be above and below the new line? or left and right?).\n\n   Actually, the factor 2 might be because each pair of lines (from the other two sets) forms two triangles with the new line.\n\n   So the total triangles after adding this line is the previous count plus 2*(number of pairs of lines from the other two sets). The number of pairs of lines from the other two sets is: (number of lines in the other two sets) = (ctr[j] + ctr[k]) = sum(ctr) - ctr[i].\n\n   Then we update: ctr[i] += 1.\n\n   We start with ctr = [0,0,0] and cnt[0]=0 (0 lines -> 0 triangles).\n\n   Then for the first line: \n        i = index of min(ctr) -> all are 0, so i=0 (the first one).\n        new_triangles = 2*(0+0+0 - 0) = 0 -> so cnt[1] = 0.\n        then ctr[0] becomes 1.\n\n   Then second line: \n        ctr = [1,0,0] -> min is 0, so i=1 (or i=2? but the min is at index1 and index2). The index function returns the first index? \n        new_triangles = 2*( (1+0+0) - 0) = 2*1 = 2 -> cnt[2] = 0+2 = 2.\n        then ctr[1] becomes 1.\n\n   Then third line: \n        ctr = [1,1,0] -> min is 0 at index2.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (1+1+0) - 0) = 2*2 = 4 -> cnt[3] = 2+4 = 6.\n\n   Then fourth line: \n        ctr = [1,1,1] -> min is 1 at any, say index0.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (1+1+1) - 1) = 2*2 = 4 -> cnt[4] = 6+4 = 10.\n\n   Then fifth line: \n        ctr = [2,1,1] -> min is 1 at index1 and index2, say index1.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+1+1) - 1) = 2*3 = 6 -> cnt[5] = 10+6 = 16.\n\n   Then sixth line: \n        ctr = [2,2,1] -> min is 1 at index2.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+2+1) - 1) = 2*4 = 8 -> cnt[6] = 16+8 = 24.\n\n   Then seventh line: \n        ctr = [2,2,2] -> min is 2, so i=0.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (2+2+2) - 2) = 2*4 = 8 -> cnt[7] = 24+8 = 32.\n\n   Then eighth line: \n        ctr = [3,2,2] -> min is 2 at index1 and index2, say index1.\n        new_triangles = 2*( (3+2+2) - 2) = 2*5 = 10 -> cnt[8] = 32+10 = 42.\n\n   So for n=1: we need k=2? because k=0 -> 0, k=1 -> 0, k=2 -> 2 (which is >=1) -> so k=2.\n   For n=2: k=2 -> 2, so k=2.\n   For n=3: we need k=3? because k=3 gives 6 which is >=3 -> k=3.\n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed.\" -> meaning n=1 and n=2? \n        \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines\" -> meaning n=3? but wait, the example says: \n            \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\" \n        So for n=1: we need 2 lines? because 2 lines give 2 triangles (which is >=1). \n        For n=2: 2 lines give 2 triangles -> so k=2.\n        For n=3: we need 3 lines because 2 lines only give 2, and 3 lines give 6.\n\n   So the cnt array we built: \n        k=0: 0\n        k=1: 0\n        k=2: 2\n        k=3: 6\n        k=4: 10\n        etc.\n\n   The problem: we are to find the minimum k such that cnt[k] >= n.\n\n   The function solve(sn) is defined to do a binary search on the cnt array? \n\n   The code:\n\n        def solve(sn):\n            t = int(sn)   # actually, this is the n for the test case? but the variable name is confusing? but we are using t as the test case value? \n            s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1   # we are going to search in the cnt array for the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t.\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            return str(s)\n\n   After the binary search, we return str(s) which is the minimal k.\n\n   But note: the binary search is set up to find the first index where cnt[index] >= t.\n\n   The loop:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: set s to something?\n\n   We want to find the smallest k such that cnt[k] >= t. \n\n   The invariant: s is the lower bound (currently not satisfying) and e is the upper bound (satisfying)? \n\n   Actually, we start with s=0 and e=len(cnt)-1. We want to narrow down until we find the minimal k.\n\n   The standard binary search for lower bound:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\n   Then at the end, s is the first index such that cnt[s] >= t.\n\n   So the TODO: we set s = m+1.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n                else:\n                    s = m+1\n\n   Then we return str(s).\n\n   But note: the cnt array is built for k from 0 to ...? and the index in the cnt array is the number of lines? \n        cnt[0] = 0 -> k=0\n        cnt[1] = 0 -> k=1\n        cnt[2] = 2 -> k=2\n        ...\n\n   So the index in the cnt array is the number of lines? \n\n   Therefore, the function returns the minimal number of lines.\n\n   However, note: the example: \n        n=1 -> we need k=2 -> so the index in cnt is 2? and cnt[2]=2>=1 -> so the binary search should return 2.\n\n        How does the binary search work for n=1?\n            s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (which is at least 2? because we built until cnt[-1]>=10^9, so for n=1, we have at least 2 in the array).\n            m = (0+2)//2 = 1 -> cnt[1]=0 < 1 -> so we set s = 1+1 = 2? \n            then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\n        For n=2:\n            m= (0+2)//2=1 -> 0<2 -> s=2 -> then break -> return 2.\n\n        For n=3:\n            We need k=3 -> cnt[3]=6>=3.\n            s=0, e= (say) at least 3? \n            m = (0+3)//2 = 1 -> 0<3 -> s=2.\n            then m = (2+3)//2 = 2 -> cnt[2]=2<3 -> s=3.\n            then break -> return 3.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, we fill the TODO with:\n\n                    s = m+1\n\n   But note: the code has an indentation. The TODO is inside the else block. So we write:\n\n                    s = m+1\n\n   However, the problem says: the answer for the test cases must be the minimum number of lines. And we are returning the index in the cnt array, which is the number of lines? \n\n   But note: the cnt array is built such that:\n        cnt[0] = 0 -> 0 lines\n        cnt[1] = 0 -> 1 line\n        cnt[2] = 2 -> 2 lines\n        cnt[3] = 6 -> 3 lines\n\n   So the index is the number of lines.\n\n   Therefore, we return the index.\n\n   But note: the function returns str(s) and s is the index (which is the number of lines).\n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is: \"s = m+1\"\n\n However, we must be cautious: the binary search might be off by one? but the standard lower_bound algorithm uses:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)//2\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we have:\n\n        program1: \"continue\"\n        program2: \"s = m+1\"\n\n   But note: the problem says to output in json format: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n   We must output the exact code that goes in the TODO blocks.\n\n   For program1, the code to put in the TODO block is: \"continue\"\n\n   For program2, the code to put in the TODO block is: \"s = m+1\"\n\n   However, note that in program1, the TODO block is inside an if and we are writing a single statement. And in program2, the TODO block is inside an else and we are writing a single statement.\n\n   But what if the code requires multiple lines? In this case, each is one line.\n\n   Also, note: the program1 code has an indentation level of 12 (or 8) for the TODO block? We just write the code as a string.\n\n   We output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"continue\", \"program2\": \"s = m+1\"}\n\n   But wait: in program1, the code after the TODO is an addition. We are skipping that addition by the continue. So the continue must be in the same block.\n\n   Alternatively, we could write:\n\n        program1: \"continue\"\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that goes in the missing part.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   So we output the two strings.\n\n   But note: the program1 code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then we are replacing that with \"continue\". So we output \"continue\".\n\n   Similarly, for program2, we output \"s = m+1\".\n\n   However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program1, it's one line. In program2, it's one line.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"continue\", \"program2\": \"s = m+1\"}\n\n   But wait: in program1, the code after the TODO is:\n\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n   and we are skipping that by the continue. So the continue must be placed exactly in the TODO block.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   Let me test program1 with the example:\n\n        Example 1: \n            strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"cc\", \"db\", \"aa\"]\n            We expect 5 pairs.\n\n        How does the code work?\n\n        We initialize d1 for all 144 strings to 0.\n\n        Then we process each string:\n\n        For \"ab\":\n            l=0: change first char to 'a' to 'a' -> \"ab\" -> skip (because a==s)\n                     to 'b' -> \"bb\" -> d1[\"bb\"]=0 -> add 0\n                     ... up to 'l' -> 11 other letters -> 11 strings -> each gives 0.\n            l=1: change second char to 'a' to 'a' -> \"aa\" -> skip? no, because \"aa\" != \"ab\"? -> actually, we change the second char to 'a' -> \"aa\" -> which is not the same as \"ab\", so we add d1[\"aa\"]=0 -> then we change to 'b' -> \"ab\" -> same -> skip? \n                     Actually, we change the second char to every letter from 'a' to 'l'. \n                     When we change to 'b' -> \"ab\" -> same -> skip.\n                     When we change to any other letter, we get a string that is not in the dictionary? so 0.\n\n            Then we do d1[\"ab\"] += 1 -> now d1[\"ab\"]=1.\n\n        For \"cb\":\n            Similarly, we generate:\n                l=0: change first char to every letter: \n                    'a' -> \"ab\": d1[\"ab\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    'b' -> \"bb\": 0\n                    'c' -> \"cb\": same -> skip.\n                    ... others 0.\n                l=1: change second char to every letter:\n                    'a' -> \"ca\": 0\n                    'b' -> \"cb\": same -> skip.\n                    ... others 0.\n            Then we add 1 (from \"ab\") -> so ans1=1.\n            Then d1[\"cb\"]=1.\n\n        For \"cc\":\n            l=0: \n                change first char: \n                    'a' -> \"ac\": 0\n                    'b' -> \"bc\": 0\n                    'c' -> \"cc\": same -> skip.\n                    ... \n                l=1:\n                    change second char:\n                    'a' -> \"ca\": 0\n                    'b' -> \"cb\": d1[\"cb\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    'c' -> \"cc\": same -> skip.\n                    ... \n            So we add 1 -> ans1=2.\n            Then d1[\"cc\"]=1.\n\n        For \"db\":\n            l=0:\n                change first char: \n                    'a'->\"ab\": d1[\"ab\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    'b'->\"bb\":0\n                    'c'->\"cb\": d1[\"cb\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    'd'-> same -> skip.\n                    ... \n                l=1:\n                    change second char: \n                    'a'->\"da\":0\n                    'b'-> same -> skip.\n                    ... \n            So we add 1+1 = 2 -> ans1=4.\n            Then d1[\"db\"]=1.\n\n        For \"aa\":\n            l=0:\n                change first char: \n                    'a'-> same -> skip.\n                    'b'->\"ba\":0\n                    'c'->\"ca\":0\n                    'd'->\"da\":0\n                    ... \n                l=1:\n                    change second char: \n                    'a'-> same -> skip.\n                    'b'->\"ab\": d1[\"ab\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    ... \n            So we add 1 -> ans1=5.\n\n        Then we print 5.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Example 2: \n            strings: [\"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"aa\"]   # note: the example says: the pairs are (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> but note: the example has two \"aa\"? \n\n            Actually, the example input: \n                n=4\n                aa\n                cc\n                ac\n                ca\n\n            But the example says: the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> but wait, (\"aa\", \"ac\") and (\"ac\", \"aa\") are the same pair? because (i,j) with i<j. \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                    (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\n\n            This seems to have 6 pairs? but note: the example has two \"aa\"? \n\n            The input: \n                aa\n                cc\n                ac\n                ca\n\n            Then the pairs (i<j) are:\n\n                (0,1): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> differ in two positions -> skip.\n                (0,2): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> differ in second position? -> one difference -> count.\n                (0,3): \"aa\" and \"ca\" -> differ in first position? -> one difference -> count.\n                (1,2): \"cc\" and \"ac\" -> differ in first position? -> one difference -> count.\n                (1,3): \"cc\" and \"ca\" -> differ in second position? -> one difference -> count.\n                (2,3): \"ac\" and \"ca\" -> differ in both positions -> skip.\n\n            So we have 4 pairs? but the example says 6.\n\n            The example also lists (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")? but these would be (2,0) and (3,0) which are not allowed because i<j? \n\n            Actually, the example input might be:\n\n                aa\n                ac\n                ca\n                cc\n\n            But the example says: \n                the pairs: \n                    (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n            This is confusing. \n\n            However, the problem says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\"\n\n            But note: the example lists 6 pairs? and the input has 4 strings? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"the second test case\" -> the input: \n                    n=4\n                    aa\n                    cc\n                    ac\n                    ca\n\n            But then the pairs (i<j) are 6? but we only have 6 pairs? and we counted 4 that differ in one position? \n\n            The example lists 6? \n\n            Let me recount the pairs:\n\n                (0,1): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> two differences -> skip.\n                (0,2): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> one difference (second char: 'a' vs 'c') -> count.\n                (0,3): \"aa\" and \"ca\" -> one difference (first char: 'a' vs 'c') -> count.\n                (1,2): \"cc\" and \"ac\" -> one difference (first char: 'c' vs 'a') -> count.\n                (1,3): \"cc\" and \"ca\" -> one difference (second char: 'c' vs 'a') -> count.\n                (2,3): \"ac\" and \"ca\" -> two differences -> skip.\n\n            So 4 pairs.\n\n            But the example says 6? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\"\n\n            This has two pairs for \"aa\" and \"ac\": one as (\"aa\",\"ac\") and one as (\"ac\",\"aa\")? but that would be the same pair? and we only count once? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j. So the pair (0,2) is (\"aa\",\"ac\") and the pair (2,0) is not allowed because i<j requires i=0 and j=2, not j=0 and i=2.\n\n            So the example must have duplicate strings? \n\n            The example input: \n                The first line of the test case: n=4? \n                Then the strings: \n                    aa\n                    cc\n                    ac\n                    ca\n\n            But the example output is 6? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"For the second test case\" -> the example input: \n                    Input: \n                        2\n                        4\n                        aa\n                        cc\n                        ac\n                        ca\n                        2\n                        aa\n                        aa\n\n            Actually, the problem says: \n                \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n            Then the second test case might be the one with two \"aa\"? \n\n            The example says: \n                \"For the second test case\" -> meaning the second test case? \n\n            The example input has two test cases? \n\n            The first test case: \n                n=4: \n                    aa\n                    cc\n                    ac\n                    ca   -> 4 pairs? \n\n            The second test case: \n                n=2: \n                    aa\n                    aa   -> pairs: (0,1): \"aa\" and \"aa\" -> not counted? so 0? \n\n            But the example says the second test case has 6 pairs? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... 6 pairs\"\n\n            So the second test case must be the one with 4 strings? \n\n            But we computed 4 pairs.\n\n            I see the problem: the example output for the second test case is 6? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... 6 pairs\"\n\n            But our code computed 4 for the first test case (with 4 distinct strings) and 0 for the second test case (with two \"aa\")? \n\n            How can we get 6? \n\n            Let me check the example: \n                The example says: \n                    (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n            This is 6? but note: the same pair of distinct strings is counted twice? if the same string appears twice? \n\n            Actually, the example input for the second test case might be:\n\n                5\n                aa\n                cc\n                ac\n                ca\n                aa\n\n            Then we have 5 strings. The pairs:\n\n                (0,1): \"aa\",\"cc\" -> skip.\n                (0,2): \"aa\",\"ac\" -> count.\n                (0,3): \"aa\",\"ca\" -> count.\n                (0,4): \"aa\",\"aa\" -> skip.\n                (1,2): \"cc\",\"ac\" -> count.\n                (1,3): \"cc\",\"ca\" -> count.\n                (1,4): \"cc\",\"aa\" -> skip? because two differences? \n                (2,3): \"ac\",\"ca\" -> skip.\n                (2,4): \"ac\",\"aa\" -> count? because they differ in the second character? \n                (3,4): \"ca\",\"aa\" -> count? because they differ in the first character? \n\n            So we have: \n                (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4) -> 6 pairs.\n\n            Therefore, the example input for the second test case has n=5? \n\n            But the problem says: \n                \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\n            Then the example says: \n                \"For the second test case\" -> the first line is 5? \n\n            However, the example output for the second test case is 6? \n\n            But the problem says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... 6\"\n\n            So the example input for the second test case must have 5 strings? \n\n            But the problem statement says: \n                \"Then follows n lines, the i-th of which containing a single string ...\"\n\n            And the example input: \n                \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"aa\"\n\n            So n=5.\n\n            Therefore, our code must handle duplicates.\n\n            How does our code handle duplicates? \n\n            We have a dictionary d1 that counts the frequency of each string.\n\n            For the last string \"aa\" (the fifth string) in the example:\n\n                We are going to count:\n\n                    For the first character:\n                        change to every letter: \n                            'a' -> \"aa\": same -> skip.\n                            'b'->\"ba\": d1[\"ba\"]=0 -> skip.\n                            ... \n                            'c'->\"ca\": d1[\"ca\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                            ... \n                    For the second character:\n                        change to every letter:\n                            'a'-> same -> skip.\n                            'b'->\"ab\": d1[\"ab\"]=0 -> skip.\n                            ...\n                            'c'->\"ac\": d1[\"ac\"]=1 -> add 1.\n\n                So we add 1+1 = 2.\n\n            Then we update d1[\"aa\"]: it was 2 (because we had two \"aa\" already? but we haven't added the fifth one) -> so before processing the fifth string, d1[\"aa\"]=2? \n\n            How did we get two \"aa\"? \n                The first string: \"aa\" -> we processed and then d1[\"aa\"]=1.\n                The fifth string: we haven't processed yet.\n\n            So when processing the fifth string, the dictionary has:\n                \"aa\": 2? because we had the first string and the fourth string? no, the fourth string is \"ca\". \n\n            Actually, the strings:\n\n                index0: \"aa\" -> d1[\"aa\"] becomes 1.\n                index1: \"cc\" -> d1[\"cc\"] becomes 1.\n                index2: \"ac\" -> d1[\"ac\"] becomes 1.\n                index3: \"ca\" -> d1[\"ca\"] becomes 1.\n                index4: \"aa\" -> \n\n            So when processing the fifth string (index4, \"aa\"):\n\n                d1[\"aa\"] = 1 (from the first string) and d1[\"ca\"]=1, d1[\"ac\"]=1.\n\n                Then for the fifth string \"aa\":\n                    l=0: \n                        change to 'c': \"ca\" -> d1[\"ca\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    l=1:\n                        change to 'c': \"ac\" -> d1[\"ac\"]=1 -> add 1.\n\n                So we add 2.\n\n            Then we update d1[\"aa\"] to 2.\n\n            The total ans1 for the test case:\n\n                index0: 0\n                index1: 0 (because when processing \"cc\", we didn't find any one-difference string in the dictionary? because the only string so far is \"aa\", and \"cc\" and \"aa\" differ in two positions? so we don't generate \"aa\" by changing one character? because we change one character of \"cc\" to get a string that is one away: \n                    l=0: change to 'a' -> \"ac\": not in the dictionary? \n                    l=0: change to 'b' -> \"bc\": not in the dictionary?\n                    ... \n                    l=0: change to 'a'? -> \"ac\": not in the dictionary? \n                    l=1: change to 'a' -> \"ca\": not in the dictionary?

but we expected 6.\n\n            What's missing?\n\n            For index2: \"ac\" -> \n                l=0: change to 'a' -> \"aa\": count=1 -> add 1.\n                l=0: change to 'c' -> \"cc\": which is in the dictionary?

\n\n            But wait: we are iterating over m from 97 to 108? so we do 12 letters for each position.\n\n            For \"ac\" at index2:\n\n                l=0: \n                    m=97: 'a' -> \"a\" + 'c' -> \"ac\" -> same? skip? -> no, because we change the first char to 'a'? the first char is already 'a'? so we get \"ac\" -> same -> skip? \n                    m=98: 'b' -> \"bc\" -> d1[\"bc\"]=0 -> skip.\n                    m=99: 'c' -> \"cc\" -> d1[\"cc\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    ... others 0.\n\n                l=1:\n                    m=97: change second char to 'a' -> \"aa\" -> d1[\"aa\"]=1 -> add 1.\n                    m=98: \"ab\" -> 0\n                    m=99: \"ac\" -> same -> skip.\n                    ... \n\n                So we get 1 (from \"cc\") and 1 (from \"aa\") -> total 2.\n\n            Then for index3: \"ca\" -> \n                l=0: \n                    m=97: 'a' -> \"aa\" -> 1 -> add 1.\n                    m=98: \"ba\" -> 0\n                    m=99: \"ca\" -> same -> skip.\n                    ... \n                l=1: \n                    m=97: \"ca\" -> change to 'a' -> \"ca\" -> same?

Then the binary search uses the cnt array. We are confident.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer."
