Then: s1=7, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1, R=7-1=6? -> R becomes 6? Then: s1=7, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1+11=12, R=5. Then: s1=7, s2=12 -> s1<=s2? -> s1=7+3=10, L=2. Then: s1=10, s2=12 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=10+20=30, L=3. Then: s1=30, s2=12 -> s1>s2 -> s2=12+8=20, R=4. Then: s1=30, s2=20 -> s1>s2 -> s2=20+10=30, R=3. Then: we check: s1==s2 -> 30==30 -> set ans = L (which is 3) + (n - R - 1) = 3 + (8-3-1)=3+4=7. Then: we break? because L=3, R=3 -> then we do: \n                if s1<=s2? 30<=30 -> true -> s1 += a[3] = 30+5=35, L=4 -> then we break because L>R? Then output 7. So it works. Therefore, we can change the code to:\n\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          lsum = 0\n          rsum = 0\n          best = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if lsum <= rsum:\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n                  j -= 1\n              if lsum == rsum:\n                  best = i + (n - j - 1)\n\n          print(best)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total number of test cases t, and the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so this O(n) per test case is acceptable.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weight and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The current code sets up:\n   t test cases, and for each test case:\n      n: number of candies\n      arr: list of candy weights\n\n We have two pointers, i starting at 0 and j starting at n-1.\n We have lsum (Alice's current total) starting with arr[0] and rsum (Bob's current total) starting with arr[n-1].\n We have a variable 'best' to record the maximum total candies eaten (i.e., when lsum == rsum, then the total candies eaten is (i+1) from the left and (n-j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n-j) = i + (n-1-j) + 2? Actually, note: \n   - Alice has eaten from index 0 to i (inclusive) -> (i+1) candies.\n   - Bob has eaten from index j to n-1 (inclusive) -> (n - j) candies.\n   So total = (i+1) + (n - j) = i + n - j + 1.\n\n But note in the code: when they are equal, they do:\n      best = i + (n-1-j) + 2 \n   which is the same as: (i+1) + (n-1 - j + 1) = (i+1) + (n - j) -> correct.\n\n However, the current code has a while loop that runs while i < j.\n\n The current code does:\n   if lsum < rsum: \n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n   else if rsum < lsum: \n        # TODO: Your code here\n   else: \n        best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n\n But note: in the else branch, after setting best, we move i and add to lsum. However, we must also consider that after moving i, we break the condition? And also, we might have more possibilities? Actually, the idea is to try to extend the current equal sum by moving the left pointer and then continue.\n\n However, the problem is that the current code does not handle the case when rsum < lsum. We should do similarly to the lsum < rsum case: move j to the left and add to rsum.\n\n Also note: the initial condition sets lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then we enter the loop with i=0, j=n-1.\n\n But what if the array has only one candy? Then we skip the loop and print 0? That is correct because they cannot both eat the same candy? Actually, they cannot share the same candy. So if there's one candy, they cannot both eat and the answer is 0.\n\n However, note the example: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> meaning two candies? Actually, the first test case has two candies? The example says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\".\n\n The problem says: \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000) \u2014 the number of candies on the table.\"\n\n So the first test case has n=2? Then we have two candies.\n\n The code for the missing part in the else if (rsum < lsum) should be symmetric to the lsum < rsum case.\n\n We should do:\n   j -= 1\n   rsum += arr[j]\n\n But note: j is currently at position j. We are going to move j to the left, so we do j -= 1 and then add arr[j] (which is the new candy Bob eats).\n\n However, we must be cautious: the while loop condition is i < j. After moving j, we have j = j-1, and then we check again.\n\n Also, note that we are updating best only when we have an equality. But we might have multiple equalities? And we want the maximum total candies? So we update best when we get an equality and then continue? Actually, we can have multiple equalities and we want the maximum.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum over the entire process.\n\n But note: when we have an equality, we record the total candies at that moment and then we try to extend? Actually, after we record, we move the left pointer and then continue. Why? Because we might get another equality? But note: if we have an equality, we can't just stop because we might be able to extend by both moving one step? Actually, the problem does not require contiguous segments to be non-overlapping? They are from the two ends. But if we have an equality, we can then try to add one more candy to Alice and then see if we can get Bob to match again? \n\n However, the example: \n   n=6, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> wait, the example says: \n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n   How does that work? \n        Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30. Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n   But note: the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? Actually, the example says: \n        \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n   The example output for the fourth test case is 7.\n\n   How do we get that? \n        We start:\n          i=0, j=7 (0-indexed, last index=7)\n          lsum = 7, rsum = 1 -> lsum>rsum -> move j: j=6, rsum=1+11=12 -> still lsum=7 < rsum=12? Then move i: i=1, lsum=7+3=10 -> now lsum=10, rsum=12 -> move i: i=2, lsum=10+20=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=12 -> then we move j: j=5, rsum=12+8=20 -> then j=4, rsum=20+10=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=30 -> then we set best = i (which is 2) + (n-1 - j) + 2 = 2 + (7-4) + 2 = 2+3+2=7? \n        But note: n=8? Then n-1=7. So j=4 -> (n-1-j)=7-4=3 -> 2+3+2=7? Actually, the formula: \n            total = (i+1) + (n - j) = 3 (because i=2 -> 0,1,2 -> 3 candies) and (n - j) = 8-4=4? -> 3+4=7. \n        But in the code: \n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2 \n            i is 2, n-1 is 7, j is 4 -> 2 + (7-4) + 2 = 2+3+2=7 -> correct.\n\n        Then we do: i+=1 -> i=3, lsum=30+5=35 -> then we break the condition? because i=3 and j=4 -> i<j -> then we continue. Then we have lsum=35, rsum=30 -> so we move j: j=3 -> but wait, j is 4 and we move to 3? then rsum=30+5=35? -> then we have lsum=35, rsum=35 -> then we set best = 3 + (7-3) + 2 = 3+4+2=9? -> that would be 9? but that is not possible because total candies are 8? \n\n        So we must avoid moving j to 3 because that would be the same candy that Alice just ate? Actually, we cannot eat the same candy twice.\n\n        The problem: when we move i to 3, we are including the candy at index 3 (which is 5). Then Bob moves to index 3? that same candy? -> that would be overlapping.\n\n        Therefore, we must break when i and j meet? Actually, the condition is i < j. When we set j=3, then i=3 and j=3 -> then we break the loop? because i is not less than j? \n\n        So after setting best=7, we do:\n            i += 1 -> i=3\n            lsum += arr[3] -> 30+5=35\n        Then we check the condition: i=3, j=4 -> 3<4 -> true.\n        Then we compare: 35 vs 30 -> 35>30 -> so we do the else if (rsum<lsum) branch: \n            j -= 1 -> j=3\n            rsum += arr[3] -> 30+5=35\n        Then we break the loop because now i=3 and j=3 -> i<j is false.\n\n        Then we print best=7.\n\n        But wait, we had an equality at i=3 and j=3? Actually, we set j=3 and then the loop condition fails. We don't check the equality? \n\n        How can we fix that? We might miss the update at the moment when i and j meet? But note: if i and j meet, then we cannot have both Alice and Bob eating that candy. So we cannot count that candy twice.\n\n        Therefore, we should not update best when i and j meet? Actually, the update in the else branch is done when we have an equality and then we move the left pointer. Then we continue. But we might get another equality? \n\n        However, in the example above, we did get an equality again at i=3 and j=3? but we didn't record it because we moved the left pointer and then the right pointer and then the loop ended? \n\n        But note: the condition in the else branch: we update best and then we move the left pointer. Then we continue. Then we get an equality again? Actually, we don't because after moving the left pointer we break the condition? \n\n        Alternatively, we can update best at every equality and then we can move either pointer? But the problem is that we are moving the left pointer in the else branch. Why not move the right pointer? Or why not move both? \n\n        Actually, the standard solution for this problem (known as \"Two Sum\" in a way, but for maximizing the count) is to use two pointers and:\n\n          while i < j:\n            if lsum == rsum:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # total candies eaten so far\n                # Then we can try to extend? Actually, we can move both pointers? \n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                j -= 1\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            elif lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But wait, in the example above, we would have:\n\n          Initially: i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> lsum>rsum -> j becomes 6, rsum=1+11=12.\n          Then: lsum=7, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1, lsum=7+3=10.\n          Then: 10<12 -> i becomes 2, lsum=10+20=30.\n          Then: 30>12 -> j becomes 5, rsum=12+8=20.\n          Then: 30>20 -> j becomes 4, rsum=20+10=30 -> now equal.\n          Then we set best = (2+1) + (8-4) = 3+4=7.\n          Then we do: i becomes 3, lsum=30+5=35; j becomes 3, rsum=30+5=35 -> then we break because i=3 and j=3 -> i<j fails? \n          Then we break.\n\n        But then we have an equality again? at i=3 and j=3? but we cannot set best again because we broke the loop? \n\n        However, note: we set best=7 and then we break. But if we set best=7, that's the maximum? because we have 7 candies? \n\n        But wait: the total candies is 8. We are using 7 candies: 3 from the left and 4 from the right. Then we have one candy in the middle (at index 3) that is not eaten. That's acceptable.\n\n        However, the example says: \"the answer is 7\".\n\n        But what if we can get 8? That would require both eating 4 candies and the total weight being equal? But then we would have to include the middle candy? which is 5. Then Alice would have [7,3,20,5] and Bob would have [5,10,8,11,1]? but wait, Bob starts from the right: [1,11,8,10,5]? Then Bob's total: 1+11+8+10+5=35, and Alice: 7+3+20+5=35. Then total candies=4+5=9? which is more than 8? impossible.\n\n        So 7 is the maximum.\n\n        However, the above algorithm would set best=7 and then break? and then output 7.\n\n        But note: the above algorithm does not update best again? because after the last update we moved the pointers and then the loop condition fails.\n\n        How about if we update best only when we have an equality? and we do that at every equality? and then we move both pointers? \n\n        But we must be cautious: we might have multiple equalities? and we want the maximum total? so we take the maximum over all equalities? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          if lsum == rsum:\n              best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total\n              # Then we move both pointers to see if we can get a larger total? \n              i += 1\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              j -= 1\n              rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But note: we are moving both pointers and then we continue. Then we might get another equality? and then we update best again? and we take the last one? but the last one might be larger? \n\n        Actually, the total candies at the next equality would be: (i+1) + (n - j) = (i_prev+2) + (n - (j_prev-1)) = (i_prev+1+1) + (n - j_prev + 1) = (i_prev+1) + (n - j_prev) + 2 -> so it increases by 2? \n\n        But we are adding two candies? one from the left and one from the right? and we require the sums to be equal again? \n\n        However, the problem does not require that the segments are contiguous? They are contiguous from the ends. \n\n        But note: we are moving the pointers independently? Actually, we are moving both. \n\n        But the example: \n          [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n          Initially: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal, best= (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2? \n          Then we move both: i=1, j=4: lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equal, best= (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4? \n          Then we move both: i=2, j=3: lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> equal, best= (2+1)+(6-3)=3+3=6? \n          Then we break because i=2 and j=3 -> i<j? no, because 2<3 -> true? then we continue? \n          Then we have lsum=6, rsum=6 -> then we update best=6? and then move: i=3, j=2 -> then i>j -> break.\n\n          Then we output 6? but the total candies is 6? and they are all eaten? \n\n          However, the problem: Alice eats from the left: [1,2,3] and Bob eats from the right: [1,2,3]? but wait, the array is [1,2,3,3,2,1]. \n          Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [1,2,3] (from the right: the last three) -> 6. \n          But note: the two 3's in the middle? Alice ate the first three, Bob ate the last three? they don't overlap? \n          Actually, the array: \n            indices: 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:3, 4:2, 5:1.\n          Alice: indices 0,1,2 -> [1,2,3]\n          Bob: indices 3,4,5 -> [3,2,1] -> total 6? \n          So total candies eaten: 6.\n\n          But the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So 6 is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, we should update best at every equality and then move both pointers? \n\n        However, the original code only moved the left pointer? \n\n        Why did the original code only move the left pointer? \n\n        The note in the code: \n            else:\n                best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\n        That might be a bug? because we are not moving the right pointer? \n\n        Let me test with the example [1,1]: \n          n=2, arr=[1,1]\n          i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> set best = 0 + (2-1-1) + 2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then i becomes 1 -> then we break the loop? because i=1 and j=1 -> i<j fails? then output 2 -> correct.\n\n        But what if we have [1,2,2,1]? \n          Original code:\n            i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (4-1-3) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2? \n            Then we do: i=1, lsum=1+2=3.\n            Then we have i=1, j=3: 3 vs 1 -> 3>1 -> then we do the else if: \n                j -= 1 -> j=2, rsum=1+2=3 -> then we have i=1, j=2: 3==3 -> then we set best = 1 + (4-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (1) + 2 = 4? \n            Then we do: i=2, lsum=3+2=5 -> then i=2, j=2 -> break -> output 4? which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the total candies: \n            Alice: indices 0,1 -> 1+2=3, then we updated to 0,1,2? -> no, in the second equality we set best=4: \n                Alice: indices 0,1,2? -> but we moved i to 2? and then we break? \n            Actually, the best update at the second equality: \n                i=1, j=2 -> then best = 1 + (4-1-2) + 2 = 1 + (1) + 2 = 4 -> meaning: \n                    Alice: from 0 to 1 -> 2 candies? but wait: the formula: \n                    i=1 -> so she has eaten indices 0 and 1? -> 2 candies.\n                    j=2 -> Bob has eaten indices 2 and 3? -> 2 candies? total=4? \n                But the array: [1,2,2,1] -> Alice: [1,2] and Bob: [2,1] -> but wait, the Bob part: the last two? [2,1] -> but the array is [1,2,2,1] -> Bob eats from the right: first the last one (index3:1) and then the next (index2:2) -> so [1,2] for Bob? \n                Then total=4? and the sums: Alice: 1+2=3, Bob: 1+2=3? -> correct.\n\n        However, the original code in the else branch only moves the left pointer? and then we continue? \n\n        But in the example [1,2,2,1] we got two equalities? and we updated best twice? and the last one was 4? which is the maximum.\n\n        But what if we have [1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n          We want to get 6? \n          Steps:\n            i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best= (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2? -> then we move i to 1, lsum=2.\n            Then: i=1, j=5: 2 vs 1 -> move j: j=4, rsum=1+1=2 -> equal -> best= (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4? -> then we move i to 2, lsum=3.\n            Then: i=2, j=4: 3 vs 2 -> move j: j=3, rsum=2+1=3 -> equal -> best= (2+1)+(6-3)=3+3=6? -> then we move i to 3 -> break? \n          Then output 6? correct.\n\n        But note: the original code in the else branch only moves the left pointer? and then we continue? and then we might get an equality again? \n\n        However, the problem: we are not moving the right pointer in the else branch? but we are moving the left pointer? and then in the next iteration we might have to move the right pointer? \n\n        But the symmetric case: we only move the left pointer when we have an equality? and then we continue? \n\n        Why not move both? \n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from known contests) is:\n\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          lsum = 0\n          rsum = 0\n          best = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if lsum < rsum:\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n                  i += 1\n              elif rsum < lsum:\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n                  j -= 1\n              else:\n                  best = (i) + (n-1-j)   # because we haven't added the current candy? \n                  # Actually, wait: if we start with zeros, then we add one candy to the left and then we get an equality? \n                  # But the problem: they start at the ends? \n\n          Alternatively, we can start with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1] and then pointers at 0 and n-1? \n\n        But the known solution from Codeforces (for example, problem name: \"Candies for Two\") is:\n\n          l = 0\n          r = n-1\n          sum1 = 0\n          sum2 = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while l <= r:\n              if sum1 <= sum2:\n                 sum1 += arr[l]\n                 l += 1\n              else:\n                 sum2 += arr[r]\n                 r -= 1\n              if sum1 == sum2:\n                 ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n\n        But note: at the end, we output ans? \n\n        However, the problem says: the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice ate (l) and the number of candies Bob ate (n - 1 - r)? -> total = l + (n - 1 - r) -> but wait, Bob ate from r+1 to n-1? that's (n-1 - r) candies? \n\n        Actually, if we have r, then Bob has eaten from index r+1 to n-1? that's (n-1 - (r+1) + 1) = n-1-r? \n\n        But note: the above known solution does not start with the first candy? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          l = 0\n          r = n-1\n          sum1 = 0\n          sum2 = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while l < r:\n             if sum1 < sum2:\n                 sum1 += arr[l]\n                 l += 1\n             else:\n                 sum2 += arr[r]\n                 r -= 1\n             if sum1 == sum2:\n                 ans = l + (n - r - 1)\n\n        But then we output ans? \n\n        However, the problem: we must start with the first candy? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. They don't have to eat one by one? but the two pointers simulate the cumulative sum.\n\n        But note: the known solution that passes: \n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            L = 0\n            R = n-1\n            s1 = 0\n            s2 = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while L <= R:\n                if s1 < s2:\n                    s1 += a[L]\n                    L += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += a[R]\n                    R -= 1\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    ans = L + (n - R - 1)\n            print(ans)\n\n        But wait: what if we have an equality? we update ans? and then we continue? \n\n        Let me test with [1,1]:\n          Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> then we go to else? (because s1==s2) -> then we do s2 += a[1] -> s2=1, R=0 -> then we break? because L=0, R=0 -> then we check: s1==0, s2=1 -> then we don't update? and then we break? then we output 0? -> but we want 2.\n\n        So we must update when we have an equality? \n\n        Actually, we update at every step? \n\n        How about:\n\n          while L <= R:\n              if s1 <= s2:   # if we do <= then in the first step: s1=0, s2=0 -> we do s1 += a[0] -> L=1, s1=1 -> then check: s1==s2? no -> then next: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do s2 += a[1] -> R=0, s2=1 -> then we break? and then we check: s1==s2? -> yes -> then set ans = L (which is 1) + (n - R - 1) = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2 -> then output 2.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          while L <= R:\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                 s1 += a[L]\n                 L += 1\n              else:\n                 s2 += a[R]\n                 R -= 1\n              if s1 == s2:\n                 ans = L + (n - R - 1)\n\n        Then output ans? \n\n        But what if we never have an equality? then ans remains 0? which is correct.\n\n        However, the problem: the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8? \n          We want to get 7.\n\n        How does the known solution work?\n\n          We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=7, L=1.\n          Then: s1=7, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1, R=7-1=6? -> R becomes 6? \n          Then: s1=7, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1+11=12, R=5.\n          Then: s1=7, s2=12 -> s1<=s2? -> s1=7+3=10, L=2.\n          Then: s1=10, s2=12 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=10+20=30, L=3.\n          Then: s1=30, s2=12 -> s1>s2 -> s2=12+8=20, R=4.\n          Then: s1=30, s2=20 -> s1>s2 -> s2=20+10=30, R=3.\n          Then: we check: s1==s2 -> 30==30 -> set ans = L (which is 3) + (n - R - 1) = 3 + (8-3-1)=3+4=7.\n          Then: we break? because L=3, R=3 -> then we do: \n                if s1<=s2? 30<=30 -> true -> s1 += a[3] = 30+5=35, L=4 -> then we break because L>R? \n          Then output 7.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we can change the code to:\n\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          lsum = 0\n          rsum = 0\n          best = 0\n          while i <= j:\n              if lsum <= rsum:\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n                  j -= 1\n              if lsum == rsum:\n                  best = i + (n - j - 1)\n\n          print(best)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total number of test cases t, and the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so this O(n) per test case is acceptable.\n\n        However, the original code started with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]? and then pointers at 0 and n-1? \n\n        We can do either? \n\n        But the known solution starts with zeros and then adds the first element? \n\n        We must change the initialization? \n\n        But the problem: the original code had:\n\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          lsum = arr[i]\n          rsum = arr[j]\n\n        and then the while loop: while i < j.\n\n        We are going to change the logic? \n\n        However, the problem says: we must fill in the missing part? and the missing part is only the else if (rsum < lsum) branch? \n\n        So we cannot change the entire while loop? \n\n        Therefore, we must complete the else if branch:\n\n          elif rsum < lsum:\n              j -= 1\n              rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And then we must also consider: what if we have an equality? we update best and then we move the left pointer? \n\n        But the known solution moves both pointers independently? \n\n        However, the known solution updates best at every equality? and then continues? \n\n        But the original code only updates best in the else branch? and then moves the left pointer? \n\n        Why not update best at every equality? and then move the left pointer? \n\n        But the known solution does not move the pointer only in the equality branch? it moves the pointer in the condition of the sums? \n\n        Actually, the original code structure:\n\n          while i < j:\n              if lsum < rsum:\n                  i += 1\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n              elif rsum < lsum:\n                  j -= 1\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n              else:   # equal\n                  best = i + (n-1-j) + 2   # because we have i+1 from the left and n-1-j+1 from the right? \n                  i += 1\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n\n        But note: in the else branch, we update best and then we move the left pointer? we don't move the right pointer? \n\n        This might miss some opportunities? \n\n        However, the example [1,2,2,1] worked? \n\n        But what about [1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n          Start: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (6-1-5) + 2 = 0+0+2=2? \n          Then we move i to 1, lsum=1+1=2.\n          Then: i=1, j=5: 2 vs 1 -> then we do the else if: rsum<lsum -> j=4, rsum=1+1=2 -> then we have i=1, j=4: 2==2 -> then best = 1 + (6-1-4) + 2 = 1+1+2=4? \n          Then we move i to 2, lsum=2+1=3.\n          Then: i=2, j=4: 3 vs 2 -> j=3, rsum=2+1=3 -> then we have i=2, j=3: 3==3 -> best = 2 + (6-1-3) + 2 = 2+2+2=6? \n          Then we move i to 3 -> then i=3, j=3 -> break? \n          Then output 6? correct.\n\n        So it works? \n\n        But why move only the left pointer in the else branch? \n\n        Actually, we are moving the left pointer to break the equality? and then we continue? \n\n        But we are updating best at every equality? and then we move the left pointer? and then we might get another equality? \n\n        So the code for the missing part in the else if branch is:\n\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And we leave the else branch as is? \n\n        However, note: the condition in the while loop: i < j. When we move the pointers, we must ensure we don't go out of bounds? \n\n        But the code: \n          In the else if branch: we do j -= 1 -> then we add arr[j]. But j was at least i+1? then j-1 is at least i? and then we continue? \n\n        But what if j-1 becomes i? then we break the loop? \n\n        Actually, the condition is while i < j. After j-=1, we have j = j-1. Then we check the condition? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else if branch is:\n\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But note: the variable name is 'rsum', not 'r_sum'? and the array is 'arr'. \n\n        So we write:\n\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\n        However, the code in the else branch does:\n\n          best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n\n        But what if after i+=1, i becomes j? then the next iteration we break? \n\n        But that's acceptable.\n\n        But what if i becomes greater than j? then we break? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing part is two lines.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n          We have a stamp that colors two adjacent cells: either BR or RB. We can use the stamp multiple times, and it must fit entirely. We start with all white (W). We are given a target string of length n (characters: 'W','R','B'). We must determine if it is possible to achieve the target.\n\n        Approach:\n          We note that the stamping operation always colors two adjacent cells, one red and one blue. Also, we can stamp multiple times on the same cell, which will flip the color? \n\n          How does flipping work?\n            The stamp has two forms: BR and RB.\n            If we stamp on a cell that is already colored, then:\n              For example, if we have a cell that is B and we stamp it again as the left part of a BR stamp, then the left cell becomes B? but wait, the stamp operation recolors both cells. \n\n          Actually, the operation is not additive? It sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. \n\n          But note: the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". \n\n          So if we stamp a segment that has been stamped before, the new stamp will set the two cells to the new colors.\n\n          Important observations:\n\n          1. The entire process must result in contiguous segments of non-white cells? Actually, no: we can have white in the middle? \n\n          But note: the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So if we have a white cell, it means that cell was never stamped? \n\n          Therefore, the target picture: any white cell must be untouched. So we can split the string by the white cells? and then consider contiguous non-white segments.\n\n          2. For a contiguous segment of non-white cells (with no white), we must check if it can be produced by the stamp.\n\n          What are the properties of a contiguous segment of length L (with L>=1) produced by the stamp?\n\n          - If L==1: impossible? because the stamp covers two cells. So we cannot have a single non-white cell? -> so the segment must have at least two cells? \n\n          - But note: we can stamp multiple times? and a cell can be stamped multiple times. However, we cannot stamp a single cell? because the stamp covers two adjacent cells. So a segment of length 1 is impossible? \n\n          However, what if the segment is isolated? for example, the entire string is of length 1? then we cannot use the stamp? so if the target is non-white? then impossible? \n\n          Therefore, we can split the string by 'W' and then for each contiguous segment of non-white:\n\n            - If the segment has length 1: then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n\n            - Also, note: the stamping operation always produces at least one R and one B? Actually, each stamp produces one R and one B. \n\n          But what about a segment of length 2? \n            Possibilities: \"RR\" -> impossible? because the stamp must produce one R and one B? \n            Similarly, \"BB\" -> impossible? \n            Only \"RB\" or \"BR\" are possible? \n\n          What about a segment of length 3?\n            Possibilities: \n              \"RRR\" -> impossible? \n              \"RBR\" -> possible? \n              \"BRB\" -> possible? \n              \"BBB\" -> impossible? \n\n          How can we check? \n\n          Known solution: \n            We note that the stamping operation is reversible? We can think of removing a stamp? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming? but the constraints: total n over test cases <= 100000.\n\n          Another known solution from Codeforces (problem name: Stamp) is:\n\n            We split the string by 'W'\n            For each segment in segments:\n                if segment == \"\": skip\n                if len(segment)==1: return \"NO\"\n                Check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B? -> but wait, what if the segment is \"RR\"? that is invalid? \n\n          Actually, we note:\n\n            The stamp always alternates the colors? \n\n          But we can do multiple stamps? \n\n          Known insight: \n            The entire non-white segment must be colorable in such a way that the colors alternate? \n\n          However, note: we can use the stamp arbitrarily? and the same cell can be stamped multiple times? \n\n          But observe: the parity of the number of stamps on a cell? \n            Each stamp flips the color? \n\n          Actually, the stamp sets the color. So if we stamp a cell an even number of times, it will be the same as the initial (white) -> but wait, we start with white? and then we stamp and set it to a color? then if we stamp again, we set it to a new color? \n\n          But note: the stamp sets two adjacent cells to specific colors. \n\n          Alternate approach: \n            We note that the entire process must satisfy:\n              - The pattern must be such that in any contiguous non-white segment, it is impossible to have all the same color? and also, the segment must have at least two colors? \n\n          But wait: what about \"R\" (length1) -> invalid. \n          What about \"RR\" -> invalid? \n          What about \"RB\" -> valid? \n          What about \"RBR\" -> valid? \n          What about \"RRB\" -> invalid? \n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy: \n            We can simulate from left to right? \n\n          Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #712 (Div. 2), problem B): \n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if n % 2 == 1:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n                # Actually, no: the problem does not require even length? \n\n            Instead, we split by W:\n\n            segments = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segments:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                # Check if the segment has both R and B?\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            if valid:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n          But wait: what if the segment is \"RRB\"? \n            It has both R and B? but is it valid? \n            How to make \"RRB\"? \n              We start: WWW -> \n                Step1: stamp the middle and last: W then stamp the last two: W BR -> becomes W B R? -> but wait, we have \"WBR\" -> but we want \"RRB\" on the last three? \n\n          Alternatively, we can have:\n            Step1: stamp the first two: as RB -> becomes R B W\n            Step2: stamp the last two: but the last two are B and W? -> we cannot stamp a white and a non-white? because the stamp sets both? and we start with white? \n\n          Actually, the stamp must be applied to two white cells? or can we apply to a white and a non-white? \n\n          The problem: \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\" and \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells\". \n\n          So we can stamp over non-white cells? \n\n          Example: \n            WWW -> \n              Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> becomes R B W\n              Step2: stamp the second and third: we can stamp on B and W? -> the stamp sets the two cells: for example, if we use BR: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R R B? \n\n          So we can get \"RRB\"? \n\n          But wait: the segment \"RRB\" has two R's at the beginning and then a B? and we have both R and B? so the condition would say valid? \n\n          However, the condition we used: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B? then \"RRB\" has both -> valid.\n\n          But what about \"RR\" (length2)? \n            It does not have B? -> invalid -> which is correct.\n\n          What about \"R\" (length1)? invalid.\n\n          What about \"RBR\" (length3)? has both R and B -> valid.\n\n          What about \"RRR\" (length3)? has no B -> invalid.\n\n          What about \"RBB\" (length3)? has both -> valid.\n\n          But wait: can we make \"RRR\"? \n            We cannot because we need at least one B? \n\n          How about \"RRBB\" (length4)? \n            We can: \n              Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> R B W W\n              Step2: stamp the last two: BR -> R B W B -> then we stamp the middle two: as RB -> then the middle two become R and B? -> then we have R R B B? \n            But we want \"RRBB\": \n              Actually, we can do:\n                Step1: stamp positions 1 and 2 as RB: becomes W, R, B, W\n                Step2: stamp positions 0 and 1: as RB: becomes R, B, B, W -> not RRBB.\n                Alternatively: \n                  Step1: stamp positions 0 and 1: as RR? -> no, the stamp is either RB or BR -> so we get either RB or BR? \n            How to get two R's at the beginning? \n              Step1: stamp positions 0 and 1: as BR? -> then we get B R W W -> \n              Step2: stamp positions 0 and 1 again: as RB? -> then we get R B W W -> \n              Step3: stamp positions 0 and 1 again: as BR? -> then we get B R W W -> we are flipping? \n\n            Actually, we cannot get two R's in a row? \n\n          Therefore, the condition: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B? is sufficient? \n\n          But what about the pattern? \n\n          Actually, the known solution from Codeforces for this exact problem (problem name: Stamp) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if 'R' not in s and 'B' not in s:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '':\n                        continue\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          However, we must consider: what if the entire string is white? then we split and get all empty? -> valid -> YES.\n\n          But what if the string is \"W\"? then we split: ['',''] -> valid -> YES? \n          But the problem: we have a picture of length 1: \"W\". \n          We don't need to use the stamp? so it is possible -> YES.\n\n          What if the string is \"R\"? \n            We split: ['R'] -> then we check: 'R' has no 'B'? -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          What if the string is \"RW\"? \n            We split: ['R', ''] -> then we check 'R': has no 'B'? -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          What if the string is \"RB\"? \n            We split: ['RB'] -> has both -> YES.\n\n          What if the string is \"RWB\"? \n            We split: ['R','B'] -> \n              'R': has no 'B'? -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          But wait: can we make \"RWB\"? \n            We have three cells: \n              Step1: we can only stamp two adjacent? \n              Possibilities: \n                Stamp the first two: then we get (for example) RB and then the third is W? -> \"RBW\" -> not \"RWB\".\n                Stamp the last two: then we get W and then (for example) BR -> \"WBR\" -> not \"RWB\".\n            How about multiple stamps? \n              Step1: stamp the last two: set to BR -> then we have W, B, R? -> \"WBR\" -> not \"RWB\".\n              Step2: then we stamp the first two: set to RB -> then we have R, B, R? -> not \"RWB\".\n\n            It seems impossible? \n\n          Therefore, the condition is: every contiguous non-white segment must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          But note: the example in the problem: \n            Example 5: \"BRB\" -> n=3, s=\"BWB\" -> wait, the example says: \n                \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> BRB\"\n\n            Actually, the fifth test case: \n                n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> but wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n            How do we split \"BRB\" by 'W'? -> there is no 'W'? so the entire string is one segment: \"BRB\" -> which has both 'B' and 'R'? -> valid.\n\n          Example 6: \"RBB\" -> n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> valid? \n            The example says: \n                \"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> RBB\" -> so s=\"RBB\" -> valid.\n\n            We split: \"RBB\" -> one segment, has 'R' and 'B'? -> valid.\n\n          Example 7: \"W\" -> valid.\n\n          Example 2,3,4: \n            The problem says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          What are these? \n            The second test case: n=2, s=\"BB\" -> \n                We split: \"BB\" -> one segment, has no 'R'? -> invalid -> NO.\n            The third test case: n=2, s=\"BR\" -> \n                But wait, the problem says \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" -> meaning they are trying to make a picture that has a single cell? \n                Actually, the examples: \n                  second: n=2, s=\"BB\" -> invalid -> NO.\n                  third: n=2, s=\"BR\" -> valid? because we can do: \n                      Step1: stamp the two as BR -> then we get BR? -> valid -> YES? \n                But the problem says \"NO\" for the second, third, and fourth.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          This might be a misunderstanding? \n\n          Let me read the sample inputs? \n\n          The problem does not specify the sample inputs? \n\n          But the note says:\n\n            For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\n\n          This means: in these test cases, there is a single cell that is non-white? \n\n          For example, the second test case: n=1, s=\"B\" -> then we split: ['B'] -> invalid -> NO.\n          The third test case: n=1, s=\"R\" -> invalid -> NO.\n          The fourth test case: n=2, s=\"W\" -> then we have two white? -> valid? but wait, the problem says NO? \n\n          Actually, the fourth test case: \n            The problem says: \"For the fourth test case, it is not possible\" -> and the answer is \"NO\".\n\n          How about n=2, s=\"WW\" -> valid? \n          n=2, s=\"WB\" -> invalid? because we split: ['','B'] -> the segment 'B' has length1 -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          So the fourth test case might be n=2, s=\"WB\" -> then we have two segments: ['','B'] -> then we check the segment 'B': invalid -> NO.\n\n          Therefore, the solution: \n            Split the string by 'W'\n            For each segment, if the segment is non-empty and (it does not contain 'R' or it does not contain 'B'), then it's invalid.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is \"R\" or \"B\" (length1) -> invalid.\n          What if the segment is \"RR\" (length2) -> invalid because no 'B'? \n          What if the segment is \"RB\" (length2) -> valid.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                # If the entire string is white? then we are done? \n                # But note: we can have white in the middle? \n                # We split by 'W'\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '':\n                        continue\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          However, note: the input has t test cases, and the first line of each test case is n, then the string? \n\n          The code: \n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n                # This skips the first two lines? \n                # Actually, the input: \n                #   first line: t\n                #   then for each test case: \n                #        first line: n\n                #        second line: the string\n                #   so [*open(0)] is a list of lines: \n                #        index0: t\n                #        index1: n1\n                #        index2: string1\n                #        index3: n2\n                #        index4: string2\n                #        ...\n                #   then [2::2] takes from index2, then index4, index6, ... -> that is, every second line starting at index2 -> which are the strings.\n\n          But wait: the first test case: \n                line0: t\n                line1: n1\n                line2: s1\n                line3: n2\n                line4: s2\n                ...\n\n          So [2::2] gives: line2, line4, ... -> the strings.\n\n          Then we process each string.\n\n          However, we also need the n? but we don't use n? because we get the length from the string.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                ...\n\n          But note: the string might have newline? so we strip.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for part in parts:\n                if part == '':\n                    continue\n                if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, we must output for each test case? \n\n        But note: the code is inside the loop over the test cases.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for p in parts:\n                  if p != '' and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the condition: \n            if p != '' and (('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)): \n          -> if the segment is non-empty and (it has no 'R' OR it has no 'B'), then invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if p and not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n\n        But the condition we want: if the segment is non-empty and (it does not have both R and B) -> then invalid.\n\n        So:\n\n            if p and ( 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p ):\n\n        This is equivalent to: if the segment is non-empty and (it has no R OR it has no B) -> then invalid.\n\n        Therefore, we break and set valid=False.\n\n        But note: what if we have multiple segments? we break at the first invalid segment.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for p in parts:\n                  if p:   # non-empty\n                      if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        However, we can write more concisely? \n\n        But the problem: we must output the missing code? \n\n        The original code for program2.py is:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we replace the TODO with the above.\n\n        But note: we must not output the entire program? only the missing code? \n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is two lines for the else if branch.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n        We output in JSON format:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"j -= 1\\nrsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p:\\n            if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"}\n\n        But note: the program2 code must be indented? \n\n        Actually, the for loop in program2.py is:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              ...   # 4 spaces or one tab? \n\n        We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the variable 'valid'? \n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              for p in parts:\n                  if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                      print('NO')\n                      break\n              else:\n                  print('YES')\n\n        But note: the else clause of the for loop? \n\n        Alternatively:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              parts = s.split('W')\n              if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in parts):\n                  print('NO')\n              else:\n                  print('YES')\n\n        But the problem: the total n over test cases <= 100000, and the split might be O(n), so we can do:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              if any(part and ( 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part ) for part in s.split('W')):\n                  print('NO')\n              else:\n                  print('YES')\n\n        This is concise.\n\n        But note: the condition: \n            any( ... for part in s.split('W')) \n          returns True if there is at least one segment that is non-empty and (without R or without B).\n\n        Then we output \"NO\", else \"YES\".\n\n        This is equivalent.\n\n        We can write:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              if any(part and not ('R' in part and 'B' in part) for part in s.split('W')):\n                  print('NO')\n              else:\n                  print('YES')\n\n        But the condition: \n            part and not ('R' in part and 'B' in part) \n          is the same as: \n            part and ( 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part )\n\n        So we can use either.\n\n        However, the problem: we must output the code? \n\n        We choose the concise version.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        For program2.py, the entire body of the for loop is missing? \n\n        So we write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\n              print('NO')\n          else:\n              print('YES')\n\n        But note: the for loop variable is 's' for the string? and we are using the same variable for the stripped string? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          parts = s.split('W')\n          for p in parts:\n              if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                  print('NO')\n                  break\n          else:\n              print('YES')\n\n        But this will break the outer loop? \n\n        Actually, the break breaks the inner for loop? and then we continue? but we want to print only one answer per test case.\n\n        The above code: \n          for p in parts: \n              if ...: \n                 print('NO')\n                 break   # breaks the inner for loop, then we exit the inner for loop and then we go to the next test case? \n          else: \n              print('YES')\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But the problem: the total n over test cases <= 100000, and the inner loop over the segments: the total length of all segments over test cases is <= 100000? because the sum of n over test cases <= 100000.\n\n        So we can do.\n\n        However, the one-liner with any is also efficient? \n\n        We choose the any version for simplicity.\n\n        But note: the any version:\n\n          if any( (p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p)) for p in s.split('W') ):\n\n        This is a generator expression? and it will break at the first invalid segment? \n\n        So it's efficient.\n\n        Therefore, we write for program2.py:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\n              print('NO')\n          else:\n              print('YES')\n\n        But note: the condition: p and ... -> if p is non-empty and (without R or without B) then we return True.\n\n        Then we print 'NO'. Otherwise, we print 'YES'.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition in the any is: \n            (p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p))\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n            (p != '') and (p has no R OR p has no B)\n\n        Then if there is at least one such segment, we output 'NO', else 'YES'.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n          program1: two lines: \n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n          program2: \n            s = s.strip()\n            if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\n                print('NO')\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n        But note: the program2 code must be indented? because it is the body of the for loop.\n\n        We output in JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n          }\n\n        The indentation: \n          For program1: the missing code is in the elif branch, which is indented by 8 spaces? (the current code: the if and elif are at 8 spaces, then the code inside is 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the current program1.py:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    # TODO: Your code here   -> we are at 12 spaces? \n                else:\n                    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n          So we should output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we write: \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\" -> but note: the existing code in the if branch has two lines at 12 spaces? so we do the same.\n\n          For program2: the for loop body: we start at 4 spaces? \n\n          The original program2.py:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with the code, which should be at 4 spaces? \n\n          But the code we are writing is multiple lines? so we need 4 spaces for the first level, then 8 for the if, etc.\n\n          Actually, the entire body of the for loop is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            if ...:\n                print('NO')\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n          So we write:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n          The first line: 4 spaces? but the for loop is already at 0? \n\n          Actually, the for loop is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n          Then the body must be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n          Then the code we write:\n\n            line1: 4 spaces: s = s.strip()\n            line2: 4 spaces: if ...: \n            line3: 8 spaces: print('NO')\n            line4: 4 spaces: else:\n            line5: 8 spaces: print('YES')\n\n          But the if and else are at the same level? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\n                    print('NO')\n                else:\n                    print('YES')\n\n          So the code we output for program2 should be:\n\n            \"s = s.strip()\\nif any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n    print('NO')\\nelse:\\n    print('YES')\"\n\n          But wait, the for loop already has the colon and the body must be indented? \n\n          The original code: \n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with the body? \n\n          Actually, we can write:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                ... \n\n          So the body must be at 4 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we write the code for program2 as:\n\n            \"s = s.strip()\\nif any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n    print('NO')\\nelse:\\n    print('YES')\"\n\n          But note: the entire body is one string? and we are replacing the TODO? \n\n          Actually, the TODO is at the end of the for loop line? so we can write the body on the next lines? \n\n          How about:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                if ...:\n                    print('NO')\n                else:\n                    print('YES')\n\n          So we write:\n\n            program2: \n                \"s = s.strip()\\nif any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n    print('NO')\\nelse:\\n    print('YES')\"\n\n          But the first line: \"s = s.strip()\" is at 4 spaces? and the rest as well? \n\n          Actually, in the JSON string, we don't include the initial 4 spaces? because the for loop line is already there? and we are writing the body? \n\n          The body must be indented by 4 spaces? so we write the code as:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n          But wait, the for loop line ends with a colon? so the next line must be indented? \n\n          The original code: \n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with the body? but the body must be on the next lines? \n\n          We can write:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                ... the body ...\n\n          So the body must be at 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n          Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n          But then the total indentation: \n            for ...:   -> 0 spaces\n            then the body: 4 spaces for the first level? \n\n          Actually, the code we are writing is the entire body? so we write each line of the body with 4 spaces? \n\n          However, the condition in the if has a long line? we can break it? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write without the any? \n\n          We choose the version with the for loop over the segments? because it is more efficient? \n\n          But the any version is efficient? \n\n          We'll use the any version.\n\n        Final JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the program1 code: we have to put two lines? and the existing code in the if branch has two lines at 12 spaces? so we write:\n\n            \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n          meaning: each line is indented by 4 spaces relative to the elif? \n\n          Actually, the elif is at 8 spaces? then the code inside should be 12 spaces? \n\n          But the existing code in the if branch:\n\n                i += 1\n                lsum += arr[i]\n\n          is at 8+4=12 spaces? \n\n          So we write:\n\n            \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n          with two lines of 12 spaces? \n\n          How? \n\n          We output the string exactly as it should appear? \n\n          The current program1.py has:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                else:\n                    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n          So the two lines should be at the same indentation as the two lines in the if branch.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n          meaning: each line has 4 extra spaces? but the entire block is already indented by 8? so the total is 12? \n\n          Actually, the existing code in the if branch is written as:\n\n            \"i += 1\\nlsum += arr[i]\"\n\n          but in the program it is at 12 spaces? \n\n          How did they get that? \n\n          The original code:\n\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n          The first line of the if branch: 8 spaces for the if, then 4 more for the body? \n\n          So we do the same for the elif branch.\n\n        Therefore, we output the two lines for program1 with two lines of 4 spaces each? but that would be 8+4=12? \n\n        Actually, the code we output for program1 is inserted at the TODO, which is at the same level as the if branch's body? \n\n        So we write the two lines without extra indentation? \n\n        But the TODO is at 8 spaces? and we are replacing the comment? \n\n        We write:\n\n          elif rsum < lsum:\n              j -= 1\n              rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But the existing code has the elif at 8 spaces? and the two lines we insert should be at 12 spaces? \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n        meaning: each line is prefixed by 4 spaces? so that the total indentation is 8+4=12.\n\n        Similarly, for program2, the body of the for loop is at 4 spaces? so we output each line of the body with 4 spaces? \n\n        But the for loop is at 0 spaces? so the body should be 4 spaces? \n\n        We write for program2:\n\n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n        This means:\n          The first line: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\" -> 4 spaces at the beginning? \n          The next line: 4 spaces: \"    if ...\" -> 4 spaces at the beginning? \n          Then inside the if: 8 spaces: \"        print('NO')\" -> 8 spaces? \n\n        But wait, the condition is long? we can break it? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          parts = s.split('W')\n          for p in parts:\n              if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                  print('NO')\n                  break\n          else:\n              print('YES')\n\n        Then the code for program2:\n\n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            print('NO')\\n            break\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n        This is 7 lines? \n\n        But the any version is shorter.\n\n        We'll use the any version.\n\n        Final decision:\n\n          program1: \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\"\n          program2: \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n        We output the JSON.\n\n        Note: the quotes and newlines must be escaped? \n\n        But the problem: we output a JSON string? \n\n        We can use a raw string? \n\n        Actually, we write:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n          }\n\n        This is valid JSON? \n\n        We must escape the newlines and the quotes? \n\n        But the problem: we output a string? \n\n        We can use triple quotes? but the problem says output only the code? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write the string with escaped newlines.\n\n        But the problem: we output a JSON object? \n\n        We'll use the standard JSON encoding.\n\n        However, the problem does not require the JSON to be pretty? \n\n        We write:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    if any(p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) for p in s.split('W')):\\n        print('NO')\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"}\n\n        This is a valid JSON string.\n\n        We output that."
