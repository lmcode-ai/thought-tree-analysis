    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is defined by:\n  (length) if the sum is positive, 0 if zero, and -(length) if negative.\n\nThe approach in the provided code uses dynamic programming and coordinate compression with Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to efficiently compute the maximum dp[i] for the prefix ending at i.\n\nThe provided code has a TODO in the loop for dp[i]:\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe note that dmx is a dictionary that stores the best dp value for a given prefix sum. So when we compute a new dp[i], we should update dmx for the current prefix sum pref[i] if dp[i] is greater than the current value.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the problem states that the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so using a dictionary is acceptable.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are solving the problem of making a binary string \"good\" by minimum operations. A string is good if when divided into contiguous segments of same characters, each segment has even length.\n\nThe provided code uses a while loop to traverse the string and count the segments. The variable `c` is used to track the current length of the segment modulo 2. The idea is to break the string into segments of same characters, and then if the segment length is odd, we can merge two consecutive segments (by changing one character) to make the total length even? Actually, the problem allows changing any character arbitrarily.\n\nHowever, note the provided code structure:\n\n    res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        d = s[i]\n        while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are traversing the string. The inner while loop is for the current segment of consecutive same characters.\n\nWe need to count the length of the current segment. We can do:\n\n    j = i\n    while j < len(s) and s[j] == d:\n        j += 1\n    length = j - i\n\nBut note the code already has a while condition. We can update `i` and `c` appropriately.\n\nActually, the variable `c` is being used to accumulate the current segment length modulo 2? But note the code after the inner loop: `c = c & 1` and then `res += 1 if c else 0`. This suggests that `c` is the current segment length modulo 2? But we are processing multiple segments.\n\nLooking at the problem: we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily. The goal is to have the entire string partitioned into contiguous segments of same characters with even lengths.\n\nWe can think greedily: we traverse and form segments. When we have a segment, if its length is even, then we are happy. If it is odd, then we can break it at the last character and make the segment (without the last character) even, and then the next segment starts at that last character? But note the next segment must be of the opposite bit? Actually, we can change the last character to the opposite, then we break the segment and the next segment (starting at that position) will be of the opposite and we can merge with the following? However, the problem does not require the segments to be alternating? They just have to be contiguous same.\n\nBut note: the partition must be contiguous and each segment has same character. So if we have an odd-length segment, we can break it by changing the last character to the opposite, then the segment becomes even (by taking all but the last) and then the next segment starts at the last character. However, the next segment might be of the same as the new character? Then we can merge? But the problem says we can change arbitrarily, so we can also break arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm that traverses the string and whenever we have two consecutive same characters, we can form a segment of two? But note: the problem does not require the segments to be of length 2, but even. However, we can break arbitrarily.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from known problems like Codeforces Round #789, problem A) is:\n\nWe traverse the string and break it into segments. We can note that if we have two consecutive segments that are of the same character, we can merge them? But the problem requires each segment to be of same character and contiguous.\n\nThe known solution: \n  We traverse the string and group consecutive same characters. Then, we traverse the groups and for each group, we can reduce the problem by considering the parity of the group length.\n\nBut note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n).\n\nThe provided code structure:\n\n    res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        d = s[i]\n        while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can do:\n\n        j = i\n        while j < len(s) and s[j] == d:\n            j += 1\n        length = j - i\n        # Then we can process the segment of length `length`\n\nBut note the variable `c` is being used. The code after the inner loop does:\n\n        c = c & 1\n        res += 1 if c else 0\n\nThis does not seem to account for multiple segments. Actually, the variable `c` is being used to accumulate the current run length modulo 2? And then we add 1 to `res` if `c` is 1? But then what about the next segment?\n\nAlternatively, known solutions for similar problems (like Codeforces Round #789 A) use:\n\n  We break the string into segments of consecutive same characters. Then, we traverse the segments and for each segment, we can take as many even parts as possible? But note the problem: we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily, and we want the entire string partitioned into contiguous segments of even length.\n\nActually, the intended solution:\n\n  We can note that the entire string must be partitioned, and each segment must be of even length. Therefore, we can combine adjacent segments arbitrarily? But we can change characters arbitrarily.\n\n  Alternate known solution (from Codeforces Round #789, problem A1, which is similar but without the minimum number of segments requirement in the easy version):\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          s = input().strip()\n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(0, n, 2):\n              if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                  ans += 1\n\n  But wait, that solution is for a different problem? Actually, in that problem, the operation was to change one character to make adjacent pairs equal? \n\n  However, note the problem statement: we can change any character arbitrarily, and we want the entire string to be partitioned into contiguous segments of same characters with even lengths.\n\n  Insight: \n      We can break the string arbitrarily. We can also change characters arbitrarily. The key is that we can merge two adjacent segments if they are the same? But we can change characters arbitrarily so we can force adjacent segments to be same or different.\n\n  Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n      We want to have segments of even length. We can break the string arbitrarily. We can change a character to break a segment and then form even segments.\n\n      However, note: the problem does not require the segments to be of minimum number? Actually, the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\" and then we require each segment to be even. But note: the problem says we can change the string arbitrarily, and then we consider the partition that minimizes the number of contiguous segments of same characters? Actually, the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" \u2014 that is the natural partition (by consecutive same). Then we require that in that natural partition, every segment has even length.\n\n      But we are allowed to change the string arbitrarily. We are not forced to use the natural partition? Actually, the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\" \u2014 that is the standard run-length encoding. So we are going to change the string so that when we break it in the minimal way (by runs), each run has even length.\n\n      How to minimize the operations? We can note that if we change a character, we might break a run or merge two runs? Actually, changing a character in the middle of a run will break the run into two, and also might merge with adjacent runs if we change to the same as an adjacent run.\n\n      However, the problem is known: Codeforces Round #789, problem A (the easy version). The solution:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              # We traverse and form groups of consecutive same characters.\n              groups = []\n              i = 0\n              while i < n:\n                  j = i\n                  while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                      j += 1\n                  groups.append(j-i)\n                  i = j\n\n              # Now, we can note that we can change a character to break a group? But we want every group to be even.\n              # Actually, we can combine adjacent groups arbitrarily by changing the boundary? But note: the minimal operations.\n\n          However, the known solution for the easy version (from the editorial) is:\n\n          We traverse the string two characters at a time. We only care about adjacent pairs? Actually, the known solution:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input()\n              ans = 0\n              i = 0\n              while i < n:\n                  if i+1 < n and s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                      # then we can form a segment of two? but we are not forced to break at two? \n                      # Actually, we are counting operations? \n                      # The known solution: \n                      #   We break the string into pairs. For each pair, if the two characters are the same, then we can leave them as they are? \n                      #   But if they are different, we change one of them to make them same? \n                      #   However, note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily and then we break the string arbitrarily? \n                      #   Actually, the minimal operations: we can change one character in a pair that is different to make them same, and then we can form a segment of two? \n                      #   But what about longer segments? \n                      #   The key: after we change the string, we can break the entire string arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not require the minimal number of segments? It requires the minimal operations so that the natural partition (by consecutive same) has even segments.\n\n          Actually, the known solution for the easy version (from submissions) is:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input()\n              cnt = 0\n              i = 0\n              while i < n:\n                  if i+1 < n:\n                      if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                          cnt += 1\n                          i += 2\n                      else:\n                          cnt += 1\n                          i += 2\n                          while i < n and s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                              i += 1\n                  else:\n                      i += 1\n              print(cnt)\n\n          But that doesn't match the sample: \n          Sample: \"1110011000\" -> operations=3? \n          How does the above work for \"1110011000\"?\n\n          Alternatively, the known solution from the editorial of Round 789 (Div. 2) for problem A1 (easy version) is:\n\n          We note that we can break the string arbitrarily. We can form segments of two. But we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily. The minimal operations is the number of indices i (for even i) such that s[i] != s[i+1]? \n\n          Actually, the sample: \n            s = \"1110011000\", n=10.\n            We break into pairs: \n                (0,1): '11' -> same -> no op? \n                (2,3): '10' -> different -> we change one? so 1 op for this pair? \n                (4,5): '01' -> different -> 1 op? \n                (6,7): '10' -> different -> 1 op? \n                (8,9): '00' -> same -> no op.\n            Total op = 3.\n\n          But then the partition? \n            We can break after every two? Then we have segments: \n                \"11\", \"10\" (changed to, say, \"00\"), then \"01\" (changed to \"00\"), then \"10\" (changed to \"00\"), then \"00\" -> becomes \"11\", \"00\", \"00\", \"00\", \"00\" -> each segment of length 2, which is even.\n\n          So the solution: \n            We break the string into pairs. For each pair, if the two characters are the same, we don't need to change. If they are different, we change one of them to make them same, which costs 1.\n\n          However, what if we have a segment of length 3? We can break it by changing the middle? But note: we are breaking every two? \n\n          But the problem does not require the segments to be of length 2. They can be of any even length. However, we can break the entire string arbitrarily? Actually, we are forced to break at every two? \n\n          The problem: we are allowed to change arbitrarily, and then the natural partition (by consecutive same) must have even lengths. \n\n          How does changing one character in a pair help? \n\n          Consider: \n            Original: \"00\" -> natural partition: one segment of length 2 -> even -> no op.\n            Original: \"01\" -> natural partition: two segments of length 1 -> both odd -> we change one character to make it \"00\" or \"11\", then natural partition: one segment of length 2 -> even.\n\n          But what about \"000\"? \n            Natural partition: one segment of length 3 -> odd. \n            We can change the middle character to the opposite? Then we get \"010\", which partitions as \"0\",\"1\",\"0\" -> three segments of length 1 -> odd. \n            Or we change the last character: \"001\" -> partitions as \"00\" and \"1\" -> two segments: 2 (even) and 1 (odd) -> not good.\n            Alternatively, we change the last two: \n                Option: change the last character to '0': \"000\" -> one segment of length 3 -> odd -> not good.\n                Change the middle to '1': \"010\" -> three segments of length 1 -> odd -> not good.\n                Change the first to '1': \"100\" -> then we have \"1\",\"00\" -> 1 (odd) and 2 (even) -> not good.\n\n          How about two operations? \n            Change the middle and last: \"011\" -> then we have \"0\",\"11\" -> 1 and 2 -> not good.\n            Change the first and last: \"101\" -> then we have \"1\",\"0\",\"1\" -> three segments of 1 -> not good.\n\n          Actually, we can change the entire string arbitrarily? \n\n          But note: the problem says the total n is even. So we can break the entire string into segments of two? \n\n          The known solution in the editorial: \n            \"In fact, we can change the whole string to the form '010101...' or '101010...' by at most n/2 operations. But we can do better: we can break the string into blocks of two. For each block, if the two characters are the same, we don't need to change. If they are different, we change one of them to make them same, which costs 1. Then the entire string becomes composed of blocks of two same characters. Then the natural partition will be segments of even length (each block is two, and we can merge consecutive same blocks arbitrarily? but note: consecutive same blocks will be merged? \n\n          However, if we have consecutive blocks of same character, they will be merged. For example, if we have \"00\" and then next block \"00\", then the entire becomes \"0000\", which is one segment of length 4 -> even. \n\n          But what if we have \"00\" then \"11\"? Then we have two segments: \"00\" and \"11\", each of length 2 -> even. \n\n          So the entire string becomes a sequence of blocks of two same characters. Then the natural partition will break at the boundaries between different characters, and each segment will be of even length (because it is a contiguous sequence of blocks of two, and the entire segment is of the same character, and the length is 2 * (number of blocks) -> even).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations is the number of pairs (i, i+1) for even i (i.e., each block) that are different? \n\n          But wait: what if we have a block that is \"00\", that's good. A block that is \"11\", good. A block that is \"01\" or \"10\", we change one character to make it \"00\" or \"11\", costing 1.\n\n          Therefore, the solution for the easy version is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input().strip()\n                ans = 0\n                # traverse by step 2\n                for i in range(0, n, 2):\n                    if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        ans += 1\n                print(ans)\n\n          However, the sample: \n            Example 1: \"1110011000\" -> n=10, we break into pairs: \n                i=0: '1' and '1' -> same -> 0\n                i=2: '1' and '0' -> different -> 1\n                i=4: '0' and '1' -> different -> 1\n                i=6: '1' and '0' -> different -> 1\n                i=8: '0' and '0' -> same -> 0\n                total = 3 -> matches.\n\n          But the provided code structure is:\n\n            res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n            while i < len(s):\n                d = s[i]\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                c = c & 1\n                res += 1 if c else 0\n\n          How to fit the known solution into this structure? \n\n          Actually, the provided code structure is different. It seems to be grouping consecutive same characters? \n\n          The variable `c` is being used to accumulate the length of the current segment? Then we take modulo 2? Then if it is odd, we add 1 to `res`? \n\n          But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of operations. How does this relate?\n\n          Let me read the code:\n\n            res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n            while i < len(s):\n                d = s[i]\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    # We are traversing the current segment.\n                    # We need to update i and c.\n                    c += 1\n                    i += 1\n                # Then after the inner loop, we do:\n                c = c & 1   # so c becomes 0 or 1, meaning the current segment length mod 2.\n                res += 1 if c else 0   # if the segment mod2 is 1, then we add 1 to res.\n\n          But what is `res`? It is being incremented by 1 for every segment that has odd length? \n\n          Then what is the meaning? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the hard version (which requires the minimum number of segments) uses a different idea. But the problem says this is the easy version.\n\n          However, the problem statement: \"This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.\"\n\n          So the easy version only asks for the minimum operations.\n\n          The known solution for the easy version is the one with the pairs. \n\n          But the provided code structure does not match the known solution. \n\n          Alternatively, there is a known solution that uses grouping:\n\n            groups = []\n            i = 0\n            while i < n:\n                j = i\n                while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                    j += 1\n                groups.append(j-i)\n                i = j\n\n            # Then, we traverse the groups. For each group, we can reduce the length mod2.\n            # We want to have even groups. So for a group of length L, we can change some characters to break the group? \n            # Actually, we can change a character to break a group and then merge with adjacent? \n            # But note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily, so we can also change the entire group to the opposite? \n\n          However, the minimal operations? \n\n          The known solution from the editorial of Round 789 for the easy version is the one with pairs. \n\n          Therefore, we must complete the provided code in program2.py to use the grouping method? \n\n          But the provided code does:\n\n            res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n            while i < len(s):\n                d = s[i]\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    # We are inside the current segment of consecutive d's.\n                    # We need to update c and i.\n                    c += 1\n                    i += 1\n                # Then we set c = c & 1, meaning we are only interested in the parity of the segment length.\n                c = c & 1\n                # Then we add 1 to res if c is 1? \n                res += 1 if c else 0\n\n          What is the meaning of `res`? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the hard version (which is problem B in that round) uses:\n\n            We traverse the groups and we can merge two consecutive groups of the same parity? \n\n          But the easy version only asks for the operations. \n\n          How does the parity of the segment length relate to the operations? \n\n          Note: we can change a character to break a segment? But we can also change a character to merge two segments? \n\n          Actually, the minimal operations is the total number of operations to make all segments even. \n\n          How to compute it? \n\n          We can note:\n\n            The entire string is partitioned into groups. The current group has length L. We can change a character in the group to break it into two groups? But then we have two groups: one of length k and L-k. We can choose k arbitrarily? \n\n          However, we are allowed to change arbitrarily, so we can change a character to the opposite, which breaks the group at that point. But then the two new groups will be adjacent to groups of the opposite? \n\n          Actually, we can break the group at any point. The minimal operations to make a group even is: we can break it at positions that are even? \n\n          But note: we can also change multiple characters arbitrarily. \n\n          Insight: \n            We can break the entire string arbitrarily. The minimal operations is independent of the grouping? \n\n          Actually, the known solution (pairs) is simpler. \n\n          But the provided code structure is grouping. \n\n          After reading the editorial of Round 789, we see:\n\n            The answer for the easy version is the number of pairs (i for i even) such that s[i] != s[i+1]? \n\n          However, the provided code does not use pairs. \n\n          How to reconcile? \n\n          The problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the provided code uses a while loop that groups consecutive same characters. \n\n          The intended solution for the easy version in the editorial is the pairs method. \n\n          But the provided code structure is different. \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the minimal operations is also equal to the total length of the string divided by 2 minus the number of groups we would have if we break the string arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the hard version (which is also in the same round) uses:\n\n            The minimal operations is (n - groups) / 2? \n\n          But wait, the problem: \n            We are allowed to change a character arbitrarily. After the change, the natural partition (minimal segments) must have even lengths.\n\n          The minimal number of segments in the natural partition is the number of groups. We want to minimize the operations and also (in the hard version) the number of segments? \n\n          The easy version only asks for the operations.\n\n          The known solution for the easy version (from the editorial) is:\n\n            Let k be the number of indices i (0-indexed, even i) such that s[i] != s[i+1]. Then the answer is k.\n\n          But the provided code does not use pairs. \n\n          How to compute k with grouping? \n\n          Actually, we can note that the pairs method does not require grouping. \n\n          Therefore, we must change the provided code to use the pairs method? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n          The provided code for program2.py is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                _, s = input(), input()\n                res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n                while i < len(s):\n                    d = s[i]\n                    while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    c = c & 1\n                    res += 1 if c else 0\n                print(res)\n\n          We cannot change the entire structure. We must fill in the inner while loop.\n\n          What is the variable `c`? It is initially 0. Then for each segment, we are going to set `c` to the length of the segment modulo 2. Then we add 1 to `res` if the segment length is odd? \n\n          But then what? \n\n          How does that relate to the operations? \n\n          Consider: \n            We have a segment of length L. We can break it by changing one character in the segment to the opposite. This breaks the segment into two. But then we have two segments: one of length k and L-k-1. We can choose k arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, we can break the segment at any point. We want to make the entire segment even. \n\n          The minimal operations to fix one segment of length L: \n            If L is even, we don't need to do anything? \n            If L is odd, we can break it by one operation: change one character in the segment to the opposite. Then we get two segments: one of even length and one of odd length? \n\n          But then the odd length segment remains? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the entire string by breaking every segment of odd length into segments of even length by one break per segment? \n\n          However, note: if we break a segment of odd length, we create two segments: the first part of even length and the second part of length 1 (odd). Then we break the next segment of odd length similarly? \n\n          But then we have many segments of length 1. \n\n          We can merge adjacent segments of the same character? But the natural partition will merge consecutive same characters. \n\n          Actually, if we break a segment of odd length by changing one character in the middle to the opposite, then we get:\n\n            Example: \"000\" (length=3, odd) -> change the middle to '1': \"010\". Then the natural partition: \n                [0], [1], [0] -> three segments, all of length 1 (odd) -> not good.\n\n          So we cannot fix one segment independently.\n\n          Another idea: \n            We can break the entire string into segments of two. We can change a character to make the entire string composed of pairs of same characters. The cost is the number of pairs that are not same.\n\n          How to relate to grouping? \n\n          The grouping method: \n            The natural partition initially has groups. The minimal operations to make the entire string have even groups is: \n\n              operations = 0\n              current_parity = 0   # meaning we are at an even segment so far? \n              for each group:\n                  L = group length\n                  if L % 2 == 1:\n                      # we can break this group by one operation? \n                      # Actually, we can break it by changing the last character to the opposite of the next group? \n                      # Then we merge the next group? \n                      operations += 1\n                      # and then we skip the next group? \n\n          But the known solution in the editorial for the hard version (which is problem B) is:\n\n            We traverse the groups and we merge two consecutive groups of the same parity? \n\n          Specifically, the solution for the easy version of the operations count is:\n\n            We count the number of groups that have odd length. Then the minimal operations is that count divided by 2? \n\n          But wait: \n            Example: \"000\" (one group of length 3, odd) -> we change one character to break it? But then we get two groups: one of length 2 (even) and one of length 1 (odd). Then we have to fix the length 1 group? \n\n          Alternatively, we can change the last character of the first group to the same as the next group, then we merge the two groups? \n\n          Example: groups: [3] -> change one character in the middle? doesn't help. \n          But if we have two consecutive groups of odd length, we can change the boundary character to merge them into one even group? \n\n          Specifically, if we have two consecutive groups of odd length, we can change one character at the boundary to make them merge into one group of even length (because odd+odd-1 = even? because we changed one character at the boundary, which then merges the two groups) -> then the total length is (odd1-1) + (odd2-1) + 2 = even? \n\n          Actually, if we change the boundary character, then the two groups become one group? \n\n          Example: \n            \"000\" and then \"111\" (two groups of length 3). Change the last character of the first group to '1': then we have \"00111\", which is one group of length 5? -> not even.\n\n          Alternatively, change the first character of the second group to '0': then we have \"0000\" and \"11\" -> two groups: even and even. \n\n          But then we broke the second group? \n\n          Actually, we changed one character and then the groups become:\n            first group: length 4, second group: length 2 -> both even.\n\n          How many operations? 1.\n\n          Therefore, one operation can fix two consecutive odd groups. \n\n          So the minimal operations is ceil(odd_group_count / 2)? \n\n          But note: we can also fix one odd group by one operation if it is alone? \n\n          Let's test with one group of odd length: \n            \"000\" -> we change one character in the middle to '1': then we have \"0\", \"1\", \"0\" -> three groups: two of length 1 (odd) and one of length 1 (odd) -> still three odd groups. \n            Then we can fix two of them by one more operation? \n\n          Alternatively, we can change the last character to '1': then we have \"001\", which is groups: \"00\" and \"1\" -> even and odd. \n            Then we change the last character to '0': then we have \"000\", which is one group of length 3 -> not fixed.\n\n          How about two operations: \n            Change the last two to '1': then we have \"011\", which is groups: \"0\", \"11\" -> odd and even. \n            Then we change the first character to '1': then we have \"111\", which is one group of length 3 -> not fixed.\n\n          It seems we need two operations for one group? \n\n          But wait, we can change two characters in the group to break it into even segments? \n            \"000\" -> change the last two to '1': then we have \"011\", groups: \"0\", \"11\" -> then we have one odd and one even. \n            Then we change the first character to '1': then we have \"111\", which is one group of length 3 -> not fixed.\n\n          Alternatively, change the first character to '1' and the last to '1': then we have \"101\", groups: \"1\",\"0\",\"1\" -> three groups of length 1.\n\n          We then have three groups of odd length. Then we can fix two of them by one operation: change the middle to '1': then we have \"111\", one group of length 3 -> not fixed.\n\n          It seems we need at least two operations for a single group? \n\n          But the known solution for the easy version using pairs: for a group of length 3, we have two pairs: \n            indices0: (0,1): '0','0' -> same -> 0\n            indices2: (2) is not paired? -> wait, the group of length 3: \n                positions: 0,1,2 -> pairs: (0,1) and then (2) is left? \n\n          Actually, the string of length 3: \n            We break into pairs: (0,1) and then (2) is not paired? but the string length is 3, which is not even? \n\n          But the problem states n is even. So we don't have this issue.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code structure might be for the hard version? \n\n          Given the confusion, and since the problem says the easy version, and the known solution is the pairs method, but the provided code structure is grouping, we must complete the inner while loop as intended by the grouping method for the easy version? \n\n          The intended grouping method for the easy version (operations) is:\n\n            We traverse the groups. We want to count the number of groups that have odd length. But then the minimal operations is the number of groups that have odd length? \n\n          But our earlier example: \n            \"000\" (one group of length 3) -> requires 1 operation? but we saw it might require 2.\n\n          After reading the editorial of Round 789, we see:\n\n            The answer for the easy version is the number of indices i (0-indexed, even i) such that s[i] != s[i+1].\n\n          And the answer for the hard version (which also asks for the minimum number of segments) is computed by:\n\n            Let the initial grouping have groups g1, g2, ..., gk.\n            Then the minimum number of segments after operations is the number of groups after merging consecutive groups of the same parity? \n\n          But the easy version only asks for the operations.\n\n          Therefore, we must output the known solution for the easy version, but the provided code structure is for grouping. \n\n          How to compute the number of pairs (i, i+1) for even i that are different using grouping? \n\n          We can note that within a group, the characters are the same. Therefore, the only pairs that are different are at the boundaries between groups. \n\n          Specifically, consider two consecutive groups: \n            Group1: length L1, character c1\n            Group2: length L2, character c2 (c1 != c2)\n          The boundary is at index = start_index + L1 - 1 (last of group1) and start_index + L1 (first of group2). \n          The pair (start_index+L1-1, start_index+L1) is a pair of consecutive indices that are different. But note: the pairs we care about are (even, even+1). The boundary might not be at an even index? \n\n          Example: \n            Group1: \"00\" (length 2) -> ends at index1 (0-indexed: index0 and index1). \n            Group2: \"11\" (length 2) -> starts at index2.\n            The boundary is between index1 and index2 -> the pair (1,2) is not a pair we consider because we only consider even indices: (0,1) and (2,3).\n\n          Therefore, the boundary between groups does not necessarily fall in the even-indexed pairs.\n\n          How many even-indexed pairs are there? n/2.\n\n          How many of these even-indexed pairs are within a group? \n            Within a group of length L, the number of even-indexed pairs that lie entirely within the group is floor(L/2)? \n\n          But note: the even-indexed pairs are (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), ... \n\n          In a group of length L, the starting index of the group is i0. \n          The even-indexed pairs that lie in the group: \n            The first pair: (i0, i0+1) -> if i0 is even, then this pair is even-indexed.\n            The next: (i0+2, i0+3), etc.\n\n          The number of even-indexed pairs in the group is (L // 2) if the group starts at an even index? \n          But wait, the starting index of the group might be even or odd. \n\n          Example: \n            Group starting at index0 (even) and length 3: \n                pairs: (0,1) -> within the group, (2,3) -> but index2 is within the group, index3 is not? \n                So only one pair.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the number of even-indexed pairs that are not homogeneous as:\n\n            total_pairs = n//2\n            homogeneous_pairs = 0\n            start = 0\n            for each group of length L and character c:\n                # within the group, the even-indexed pairs: \n                #   The starting index of the group is `start`.\n                #   The even indices in the group: \n                #       if start is even: then the even indices in the group are: start, start+2, start+4, ... \n                #       if start is odd: then the even indices in the group are: start+1, start+3, ... \n                #   But note: a pair (i, i+1) is defined by i being even. The pair uses indices i and i+1.\n                #   In the group, the consecutive same, so every pair within the group is homogeneous.\n                homogeneous_pairs += L // 2   # because there are L//2 complete pairs? \n                # But wait: if L is odd, then the last character is not in a pair? \n                #   Example: L=3: we have one complete pair and one leftover.\n                #   So homogeneous_pairs += L//2   -> 3//2 = 1.\n                start += L\n\n            then heterogeneous_pairs = total_pairs - homogeneous_pairs\n\n          Therefore, the operations = heterogeneous_pairs = total_pairs - homogeneous_pairs.\n\n          But total_pairs = n//2.\n          homogeneous_pairs = sum_{groups} (L//2)\n\n          Example: \"1110011000\", n=10, total_pairs=5.\n          Groups: \n            \"111\" -> L=3 -> 3//2 = 1\n            \"00\" -> L=2 -> 2//2 = 1\n            \"11\" -> L=2 -> 1\n            \"000\" -> L=3 -> 1\n          homogeneous_pairs = 1+1+1+1 = 4.\n          operations = 5-4 = 1 -> but expected is 3.\n\n          This does not match.\n\n          Alternatively, homogeneous_pairs should be the number of pairs that are homogeneous. In the group, every pair is homogeneous. So homogeneous_pairs = number of pairs that lie entirely within a group = for a group of length L, the number of pairs is floor(L/2) if the group starts at an even index? and floor((L+1)/2) if the group starts at an even index? \n\n          Let's do it by hand for \"1110011000\":\n\n            Group1: \"111\", start=0 (even). \n                pairs: (0,1): homogeneous -> count=1.\n                       (2,3): but index2 is in the group, index3 is not? -> no, because the group goes from 0 to 2 (inclusive). \n                So only one pair.\n\n            Group2: \"00\", start=3 (odd). \n                pairs: we consider even indices: the next even index is 2 (already done) and then 4. \n                But the group is at indices 3,4. \n                The pair (4,5): but 4 is even -> this pair is (4,5): '0' and '0' -> homogeneous. \n                So count=1.\n\n            Group3: \"11\", start=5 (which is even? 5 is odd) -> wait, indices: \n                Group1: 0,1,2 -> then group2: 3,4 -> then group3: 5,6 -> start=5 (odd index).\n                The even indices in this group: the next even index after 4 is 4+2=6? but 6 is the next even index? \n                The pair (5,6) is not even-indexed? because 5 is odd -> we consider even indices for the start of the pair: 0,2,4,6,8.\n                So the pair (5,6) is not considered? \n\n            Group4: \"000\", start=7 (which is even? 7 is odd) -> indices 7,8,9.\n                even indices: 6,8 -> \n                pair (6,7): not in this group? \n                pair (8,9): in the group, homogeneous -> count=1.\n\n            Total homogeneous_pairs = 1 (group1) + 1 (group2) + 0 (group3) + 1 (group4) = 3.\n            operations = 5-3 = 2 -> not 3.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the known solution is the pairs method, and the provided code structure is grouping, and the problem says the easy version, I think the intended solution for the easy version in the provided code structure might be different.\n\n          After re-thinking: \n            The variable `res` in the provided code is being incremented by 1 for every segment that has odd length (after processing the segment, we set c = c & 1, and then if it's 1, we add 1).\n\n          Then the final answer is the number of segments that have odd length. \n\n          But the sample: \"1110011000\" has groups: [3,2,2,3] -> two groups of odd length -> res=2. But expected operations is 3.\n\n          So that doesn't match.\n\n          Another known solution from a submission for the easy version (from a contestant in Round 789) for the easy version:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                s = input()\n                ans = 0\n                last = None\n                for i in range(0, n, 2):\n                    if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        ans += 1\n                    else:\n                        if last is None:\n                            last = s[i]\n                        else:\n                            if last != s[i]:\n                                ans += 1\n                                last = s[i]\n                print(ans)\n\n          This is not the same as the editorial solution.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem says the easy version, and the known editorial solution is the pairs method, and the provided code structure is grouping, I think there might be a mistake.\n\n          However, the problem statement for program2.py says: \"This is the easy version of the problem.\"\n\n          And the sample: \n            Input: \n                5\n                2\n                00\n                2\n                11\n                4\n                0000\n                4\n                1100\n                8\n                11100110\n            Output:\n                0\n                0\n                0\n                0\n                3\n\n          For the last: \"11100110\", the known solution by pairs: \n            pairs: \n                (0,1): '11' -> same -> 0\n                (2,3): '10' -> different -> 1\n                (4,5): '01' -> different -> 1\n                (6,7): '10' -> different -> 1\n            total = 3.\n\n          How to compute 3 with the grouping method in the provided code? \n\n          Groups for \"11100110\": \n            \"11\" -> length=2 -> even -> c=0, res=0.\n            \"00\" -> length=2 -> even -> c=0, res=0.\n            \"11\" -> length=2 -> even -> c=0, res=0.\n            \"0\" -> length=1 -> odd -> c=1, res=1.\n            -> then res=1, not 3.\n\n          This does not match.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code structure might be for the hard version? \n\n          The hard version asks for the minimum number of segments as well. The easy version only asks for the operations.\n\n          The problem statement for program2.py: \n            \"For each test case, print a single line with one integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations to make s good.\"\n\n          So it is the easy version.\n\n          Given the provided code structure, and the sample does not match, I think the intended solution within the provided code is to count the number of segments that have odd length, and then the operations is that number? \n\n          But the sample \"1110011000\" has two groups of odd length (3 and 3) -> res=2, but expected operations is 3.\n\n          Unless the operations is not the number of odd segments.\n\n          Another idea: \n            In the provided code, the variable `c` is not reset between segments. It is set to the parity of the current segment, and then used in the next segment? \n\n          The code:\n\n            res, i, c = 0, 0, 0\n            while i < len(s):\n                d = s[i]\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    c += 1\n                    i += 1\n                c = c & 1\n                res += 1 if c else 0\n\n          For \"11100110\":\n            Group1: \"11\" -> c=2 -> c=0, res=0.\n            Group2: \"00\" -> c=0+2=2 -> then c=0, res=0.\n            Group3: \"11\" -> c=0+2=2 -> c=0, res=0.\n            Group4: \"0\" -> c=0+1=1 -> c=1, res=1.\n\n          res=1.\n\n          For \"1110011000\":\n            Group1: \"111\" -> c=0+3=3 -> c=1, res=1.\n            Group2: \"00\" -> c=1+2=3 -> c=1, res=2.\n            Group3: \"11\" -> c=1+2=3 -> c=1, res=3.\n            Group4: \"000\" -> c=1+3=4 -> c=0, res=3.\n\n          So then res=3, which matches the sample.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code is: \n            We are not resetting c between segments. We are carrying over the parity of the cumulative length modulo 2.\n\n          Why is this the number of operations? \n\n          Explanation from the editorial of the hard version: \n            We can carry over the parity. When we have a group, if the carried over parity is 0, then we start the group. The length of the group modulo 2 is (carry + L) mod 2. \n            Then, if the new parity is 1, we increment res by 1, and then the carry for the next group is 1.\n\n          But how does this relate to operations? \n\n          Note: \n            The carry is the leftover from the previous group. If the previous group had an odd length, then we have one extra character that is not paired. This extra character will be merged with the next group if the next group has the same character? \n\n          But we are not changing any characters yet. \n\n          The variable `res` is counting the number of times we have an odd segment in the natural partition after we have fixed the string? \n\n          However, the problem asks for the minimum number of operations. \n\n          But in the sample, it matches. \n\n          Therefore, the missing code in the inner while loop is:\n\n            c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n          And then the rest of the code is as provided.\n\n          Let me test with the provided examples in the problem:\n\n            Example 1: \"1110011000\" -> res=3 -> matches.\n            Example 2: \"00\" -> groups: one group of length 2: \n                c=0+2=2 -> c=0, res=0 -> matches.\n            Example 3: \"11\" -> similarly res=0.\n            Example 4: \"0000\" -> one group of length 4: \n                c=0+4=4 -> c=0, res=0.\n            Example 5: \"1100\" -> one group of length 2, then one group of length 2: \n                group1: c=0+2=2 -> c=0, res=0.\n                group2: c=0+2=2 -> c=0, res=0.\n            Example 6: \"0\" (n=2 is not possible, but n=2: \"01\" -> groups: \"0\",\"1\": \n                group1: c=0+1=1 -> c=1, res=1.\n                group2: c=1+1=2 -> c=0, res=1.\n                -> res=1, which is the operations for \"01\": change one character to make \"00\" or \"11\", cost=1.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            inside the inner while loop: \n                c += 1\n                i += 1\n\n          And then after the inner loop, we do:\n                c = c & 1\n                res += 1 if c else 0\n\n          This matches the sample.\n\n          So for program2.py, the missing code is two lines:\n\n            c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n          But note: the inner while loop condition is: while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n\n          We must increment i and update c.\n\n          Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the inner while loop should also advance the index i. \n\n          The provided code already has the condition and the while loop. We just need to do the two lines inside.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing line is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          But note: the line is inside the if condition:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          So we only update if it's greater.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          And for program2.py, the missing code inside the inner while loop is:\n            c += 1\n            i += 1\n\n          But note: the inner while loop in program2.py might be intended to be:\n\n            while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                c += 1\n                i += 1\n\n          So we fill in the two lines.\n\n          We output in the required JSON format.\n\n          Note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          For program1.py, the missing part is one line: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n          For program2.py, the missing part is two lines: \"c += 1\" and \"i += 1\", but note the indentation.\n\n          We output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    c += 1\\n    i += 1\"\n          }\n\n          However, the provided code in program2.py has the inner while loop with a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", and then the two lines should be at the same indentation level.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output the block for program2.py as a string with two lines.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so for program2.py it is a block of two lines.\n\n          Let's write the JSON.\n\n          Important: the string might need escaping, but we are not using any quotes in the code.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"        c += 1\\n        i += 1\"\n\n          because the inner while loop is indented by 8 spaces? \n\n          But the provided code in the problem for program2.py has:\n\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is indented by 8 spaces. So the two lines should be at the same indentation.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we should match the surrounding.\n\n          Since the surrounding is 8 spaces, we output 8 spaces for each line.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          We output only the missing part.\n\n          For program1.py, it is one line. For program2.py, it is two lines.\n\n          Final output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        c += 1\\n        i += 1\"\n          }\n\n          But wait, in program1.py, the line is inside an if-block that is already indented. The surrounding code:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n                pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n                nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is at an indentation level of 8 spaces. So the missing line should be indented by 8 spaces (or 4 more) -> 12 spaces? \n\n          But the if-block is at 8 spaces, so the inside should be 12 spaces.\n\n          However, the provided code in the problem for program1.py has:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the missing line should be at 8+4=12 spaces.\n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact spaces, but we should match the style.\n\n          Since the previous lines in the for-loop are at 8 spaces, and the if-block is at 8 spaces, the inside should be 12 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing line is:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          with 12 spaces.\n\n          However, the problem does not require the exact spaces? It is Python, so indentation matters.\n\n          To be safe, we output the same indentation as the surrounding. In the provided code for program1.py, the for-loop body is indented by 4 spaces, and the if is indented by 8 spaces, so the inside of the if should be 12 spaces.\n\n          But the problem's provided code for program1.py has:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                dp[i] = ... \n                pfen.modify(...)\n                nfen.modify(...)\n                if ...:\n                    # TODO\n\n          The TODO is at 8 spaces (relative to the for-loop, which is 4 spaces). \n\n          In Python, one level is typically 4 spaces. So the for-loop body is 4 spaces, the if is 8 spaces, and the inside of the if should be 12 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing line is:\n\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          with 12 spaces.\n\n          For program2.py, the inner while loop body should be at 8 spaces (because the while loop is at 4 spaces inside the outer while, which is at 4 spaces inside the for-loop). \n\n          The provided code for program2.py:\n\n            while i < len(s):\n                d = s[i]\n                while i < len(s) and s[i] == d:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is at 8 spaces. So the two lines should be at 8 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        c += 1\\n        i += 1\"\n          }\n\n          But wait, in program1.py, the line is at 12 spaces, but we are outputting 4 spaces? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n            The for-loop: at 4 spaces indentation.\n            the if: at 8 spaces.\n            the missing line: at 12 spaces.\n\n          How to represent 12 spaces? We can do 12 spaces, or we can do three tabs? But the problem uses spaces.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we output 4 spaces for each level.\n\n          program1.py: \n            for-loop: 4 spaces\n            if: 8 spaces\n            missing line: 12 spaces -> which is 12 spaces.\n\n          But in the string, we can do: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" (12 spaces at the beginning) or \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" with 4 spaces? \n\n          The provided code in the problem for the for-loop body is 4 spaces, so the if is 8 spaces, and the missing line should be 12 spaces.\n\n          We output 12 spaces.\n\n          However, the problem's sample input for program1.py has:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces. So the missing line should be at the same indentation: 8 spaces? \n\n          But that would be the same as the if-statement, which is not valid in Python.\n\n          In Python, the body of the if must be indented more.\n\n          Therefore, the missing line in program1.py should be at 12 spaces.\n\n          We output a string with 12 spaces at the beginning.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a tab of 4 spaces three times.\n\n          We'll do: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          For program2.py, the inner while loop body should be at 8 spaces, so we output two lines each with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n          We'll do: \"        c += 1\" and \"        i += 1\", and then combine with a newline.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        c += 1\\n        i += 1\"\n          }\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so for program1.py it is one line, and for program2.py it is two lines.\n\n          We output in JSON.\n\n          Let's hope."
