Looking at the update: \n  For the left boundary: (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n-i+1) * (i-1) For i=1: i-1=0 -> so the term becomes 0. Similarly, for the right boundary when i=n: (n - (n+1)+1) = (n - n) = 0, so the term is 0. Therefore, the boundaries at the ends (with the sentinels) do not contribute because the multiplier (i-1) for the left boundary at i=1 is 0, and for the right boundary at i=n the multiplier (n-i) is 0.

It is list2[1] when val=0 -> a0. What is int(list[val+1])? This is a1 when val=0. So diff = a0 - a1 for val=0. Then if diff>=0, we do something. Then after the loop, it prints: tot - minv + abs(minv) + last_element. Let me test with the sample [ -2, -2, -2 ] (n=3):\n\n   list = ['-2', '-2', '-2']   -> len(list)=3, so val in range(2) -> val=0,1. list2 = [0, '-2', '-2', '-2']\n\n   val=0:\n        diff = list2[1] - list[1] = (-2) - (-2) = 0 -> >=0, so we do something. val=1:\n        diff = list2[2] - list[2] = (-2) - (-2) = 0 -> >=0. Then print: tot - (-2) + abs(-2) + (-2) = tot +2 +2 -2 = tot+2. What should tot be? For the sample, the answer is 2, so tot+2=2 -> tot=0. Therefore, in the TODO, we might not add anything when diff>=0. Test with the second sample: [6,4,1] (n=3) -> answer=13. list = ['6','4','1'] -> len=3, val in [0,1]\n   list2 = [0, '6','4','1']\n\n   val=0:\n        diff = list2[1] - list[1] = 6 - 4 = 2 >=0 -> do something. val=1:\n        diff = list2[2] - list[2] = 4 - 1 = 3 >=0 -> do something. Then print: tot - 6 + abs(6) + 1 = tot -6+6+1 = tot+1. We want tot+1 = 13 -> tot=12.",

Therefore, the TODO might be:\n        tot += diff * (n - val) But val is the index in the loop, and n = len(list) = the length of the array. For the first sample [-2,-2,-2] (n=3):\n        val0: diff = (-2) - (-2) = 0 -> skip (because if diff>=0, and 0>=0, so we do: tot += 0 * (3-0) =0.\n        val1: diff = (-2) - (-2)=0 -> tot +=0. then print: 0 - (-2) + abs(-2) + (-2) = 0 +2+2-2=2.  matches. Test with a third sample: n=1, a=[0] \n        list = ['0'] -> len=1, so the loop is for val in range(0) -> no iteration. print: tot - 0 + abs(0) + 0 = 0.  which is correct. Test with n=2, a=[1,0]:\n        list = ['1','0'] -> minv=1, last=0. val0: diff = a[0]-a[1] = 1-0=1>=0.\n        tot += 1 * (2-0) = 2.\n        print: 2 - 1 + abs(1) + 0 = 2-1+1=2. What is the answer for [1,0]? We can do: \n          x = ?",

The element i=2: we add the right boundary (if a[2]!=a[3]) at j=2. And the left boundary for i=2 (which is the boundary at j=1) was already added when i=1? But wait: we did not add the left boundary for i=2 when processing i=1. We only added the right boundary for i=1 (which is the boundary at j=1).

    },
    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an array and we have to handle updates. After each update, we must output the sum of awesomeness values over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nNote: The awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,2,2,3] has awesomeness 3.\n\nThe initial code sets up the array and then processes m queries. The array is 1-indexed (with a[0] and a[n+1] set to 0 as sentinels).\n\nThe key observation is that the total sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be expressed in terms of the boundaries where adjacent elements are different.\n\nIn fact, note that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1]. Therefore, the entire sum is:\n\n  Sum_{l=1 to n} Sum_{r=l to n} [1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1])]\n\nThe total number of contiguous subarrays is T = n*(n+1)//2. Then, we have to add the number of pairs (l, r) and (i, i+1) such that the boundary at i (i.e., a[i]!=a[i+1]) is included in the subarray [l, r]. For a fixed boundary at i (between i and i+1), the number of subarrays that include this boundary is i * (n - i). Why? Because l can be any index from 1 to i, and r can be any index from i+1 to n.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n\n  T + Sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (i * (n-i)) ]\n\nBut note: the provided code does:\n\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ...   # we are missing a loop body\n\nAnd then in the query processing, it subtracts and adds terms that look like:\n\n  (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)\n  (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i\n\nWait, note that the boundaries are at indices: between i-1 and i, and between i and i+1.\n\nSo the initial setup must initialize `ans` to the total contribution of all boundaries. Then, when we update an element at position i, we break the two boundaries (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) and then form two new boundaries. Therefore, we subtract the contributions of the old boundaries and add the contributions of the new boundaries.\n\nBut note: the formula for a boundary at position j (between j and j+1) is: j * (n - j). However, in the code we see:\n\n  (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)\n\nLet j = i-1: then the boundary between j and j+1 (which is i-1 and i) would be at j = i-1. Then the contribution is j * (n - j) = (i-1) * (n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1). Similarly, the boundary at i (between i and i+1) is at j = i, so the contribution is i*(n-i). But note the code uses (n - (i+1)+1) = n-i, and multiplies by i -> i*(n-i). So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the initial `ans` must be set to the sum of the contributions of all boundaries. We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We consider the boundary between i-1 and i? Actually, the boundaries are from 1 to n-1? \n      # But note: the array has been extended: a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. So we have boundaries at indices: \n      #   between 0 and 1 -> but we don't count that because our array is from 1 to n.\n      #   between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ... , n-1 and n, and n and n+1.\n\nHowever, the problem states: the array a is of length n (from a1 to an). The boundaries that matter are from 1 to n-1 (internal) and also the boundaries at the ends? Actually, the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] only depends on the boundaries from l to r-1. The boundaries at the ends (with the sentinels) are not included in any subarray that we consider? \n\nBut note: the sentinels are at 0 and n+1. The subarrays are from l to r (with 1<=l<=r<=n). Therefore, the boundaries we care about are from 1 to n-1 (between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ... , n-1 and n). The boundaries at 0 and 1 and at n and n+1 are not included in any subarray? Actually, the boundary at 0 and 1: the subarray starting at 1 might include the boundary between 0 and 1? But note: the subarray [1,1] does not include the boundary between 0 and 1 because the boundary between 0 and 1 is before the first element. Similarly, the boundary between n and n+1 is after the last element.\n\nTherefore, we only care about boundaries from 1 to n-1.\n\nBut wait: the code in the update part uses two boundaries for an element at i: the boundary with the left (i-1 and i) and the boundary with the right (i and i+1). And note that the boundaries are at indices: \n  - The boundary between i-1 and i: this is the boundary at index i-1? Actually, the boundary is between positions i-1 and i. The code uses (a[i] != a[i-1]) and multiplies by (n-i+1)*(i-1). This matches the formula for the boundary at i-1 (if we consider the boundary at position j between j and j+1, then j = i-1) and the contribution is (i-1)*(n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1). Similarly, the boundary between i and i+1 is at j=i, so the contribution is i*(n-i).\n\nSo in the initial setup, we should consider boundaries for j from 1 to n-1? Actually, the boundaries are at j (between j and j+1) for j in [1, n-1]. But note: the code in the update part also considers the boundaries at j=0 (between 0 and 1) and j=n (between n and n+1)? \n\nIn the update part, we have:\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)   [for the boundary at i-1: which is the boundary between i-1 and i, and j = i-1]\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i      [for the boundary at i: which is the boundary between i and i+1, and j = i]\n\nBut note: when i=1, the left boundary is between 0 and 1 -> j=0. Similarly, when i=n, the right boundary is between n and n+1 -> j=n.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the subarrays are from l to r (1<=l<=r<=n). The boundary at j=0 (between 0 and 1) is never included in any subarray? Because the subarray must start at at least 1, and the boundary at 0 is not between two elements of the subarray. Similarly, the boundary at j=n (between n and n+1) is never included.\n\nTherefore, we should not count the boundaries at j=0 and j=n. But the code in the update part does consider them? \n\nLooking at the update: \n  For the left boundary: (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n-i+1) * (i-1)\n  For i=1: i-1=0 -> so the term becomes 0. Similarly, for the right boundary when i=n: (n - (n+1)+1) = (n - n) = 0, so the term is 0.\n\nTherefore, the boundaries at the ends (with the sentinels) do not contribute because the multiplier (i-1) for the left boundary at i=1 is 0, and for the right boundary at i=n the multiplier (n-i) is 0.\n\nSo the initial setup: we need to initialize `ans` to the sum of contributions for boundaries at j from 1 to n-1? But note: the initial array a[1..n] is given, and we have set a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0.\n\nTherefore, the initial `ans` should be computed as:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We are going to consider the boundaries that the element at i is involved in? \n      # Actually, we can compute the entire initial `ans` by iterating over the boundaries? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the problem says the array is 1-indexed and we have a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. The boundaries we care about are from 1 to n-1 (between a1 and a2, a2 and a3, ... , a_{n-1} and a_n). \n\nHowever, the initial code has a loop for i in range(1, n+1). We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We can consider the left boundary for i? Actually, the boundaries are independent of the element index but by adjacent pairs.\n\nBut note: the update code uses two boundaries per element. We can also initialize by:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # The left boundary for i: between i-1 and i -> only if i>=2? Actually, for i=1, the left boundary is with a0 (which is 0) and we don't count it because (i-1)=0. Similarly, the right boundary for i: between i and i+1 -> for i=n, the right boundary is with a_{n+1} (0) and we don't count it because (n-i) becomes 0.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (i-1) * (n - i + 1)\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n\nBut wait: this counts each boundary twice? For example, the boundary between i and i+1 is counted at element i (as the right boundary) and at element i+1 (as the left boundary). But note: the boundary between i and i+1 is only associated with the element i (as the right boundary) and the element i+1 (as the left boundary) in the update. However, in the initial setup we are iterating over every element and adding the contributions of the two boundaries that the element is adjacent to. But each boundary (except the ones at the ends) is adjacent to two elements? Actually, no: each boundary is between two elements. We are counting the same boundary twice: once for the left element and once for the right element? \n\nBut note: the boundary between i and i+1 is only counted in the right boundary of element i and the left boundary of element i+1. However, we are iterating over i from 1 to n. So the boundary between i and i+1 will be added when i is processed (as the right boundary) and when i+1 is processed (as the left boundary). That would be double counting.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over the boundaries. The boundaries are from 1 to n-1 (for the internal ones). But the update code does not do that. The update code only updates the two boundaries adjacent to the changed element.\n\nTherefore, to be consistent with the update code, we should initialize `ans` by:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # For the left boundary: (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (i-1) * (n-i+1)\n      # For the right boundary: (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nBut note: the boundary between 1 and 2: \n   At i=1: we consider the right boundary: (a[1]!=a[2]) * 1 * (n-1)\n   At i=2: we consider the left boundary: (a[2]!=a[1]) * (2-1) * (n-2+1) = (a[2]!=a[1]) * 1 * (n-1)\n\nSo the same boundary is counted twice. That is double counting.\n\nTherefore, we must not do that. The update code only updates the two boundaries adjacent to the changed element, and each boundary is represented by one term. The term for the boundary between i and i+1 is stored as the right boundary of element i and the left boundary of element i+1? But in the update, we subtract both terms that involve the changed element. However, the boundary between i and i+1 is stored in two different elements? Actually, no: the update code for an element at position i subtracts the two boundaries that are adjacent to i: the left boundary (with i-1) and the right boundary (with i+1). Each boundary is adjacent to two elements? Actually, the boundary between i and i+1 is adjacent to element i (on the left) and element i+1 (on the right). Therefore, the entire `ans` variable is storing the sum of contributions for every boundary, and each boundary is stored in two different elements? \n\nBut note: the update code for an element i subtracts the two boundaries that are adjacent to i. When we change element i, we break the boundaries (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). Then we set a[i]=x and then add the new boundaries. So the `ans` variable is the total sum of contributions for all boundaries. And each boundary is stored in two elements? Actually, no: the boundary between i and i+1 is stored only in the right boundary of element i and the left boundary of element i+1? But we are adding the same boundary twice? \n\nThis would be a problem. However, note the update code does:\n\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)   [boundary at i-1: which is the boundary between i-1 and i]\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i      [boundary at i: which is the boundary between i and i+1]\n\nThen after updating a[i], it adds the same for the new value.\n\nBut the boundary between i-1 and i is adjacent to element i (as the left boundary) and also adjacent to element i-1 (as the right boundary). Similarly, the boundary between i and i+1 is adjacent to element i (as the right boundary) and element i+1 (as the left boundary). Therefore, the same boundary is stored in two different elements. \n\nThis means that in the initial setup, if we do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (i-1) * (n-i+1)\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nthen we are counting each boundary twice: for example, the boundary between i and i+1 is added at element i (as the right boundary) and at element i+1 (as the left boundary). Therefore, we are double counting every boundary.\n\nBut note: the update code also subtracts and adds the same boundary twice? Actually, no: because when we update an element i, we subtract the two boundaries that are adjacent to i (which are the boundary at i-1 and the boundary at i). Then we update and then add the new ones. However, the boundary at i-1 is also adjacent to element i-1 (as the right boundary) and the boundary at i is also adjacent to element i+1 (as the left boundary). Therefore, the update code only subtracts the two boundaries that are adjacent to the changed element, but the same boundary is stored in two different elements. This would break the consistency.\n\nAlternatively, the intended solution is to store the entire contribution of boundaries in the variable `ans` and each boundary is represented by one term: the term for the boundary between j and j+1 is stored at the element j (as the right boundary) and not at j+1? But the update code for element i subtracts the boundary at i-1 (which is the boundary between i-1 and i) and the boundary at i (which is the boundary between i and i+1). And the boundary at i-1 is stored at element i (as the left boundary) and the boundary at i is stored at element i (as the right boundary). So the entire `ans` variable is storing the boundaries by the element that is the left element of the boundary? \n\nActually, the boundary between j and j+1 is stored only once, and it is stored at the element j (as the right boundary) and also at the element j+1 (as the left boundary) in the update code? That would be double representation. \n\nBut note: the update code does not store the boundaries per element in the sense of a global array. It only updates the total `ans` by the contributions of the boundaries adjacent to the changed element. And the boundaries are stored in the total `ans` as the sum of:\n\n  for each boundary j (from 1 to n-1) that exists (i.e., a[j]!=a[j+1]): j*(n-j)\n\nSo the total `ans` is the sum over j=1 to n-1 of [ (a[j]!=a[j+1]) * j*(n-j) ].\n\nTherefore, the initial `ans` should be:\n\n  ans = 0\n  for j in range(1, n):\n      if a[j] != a[j+1]:\n          ans += j * (n - j)\n\nBut note: the array a is 1-indexed: a[1..n]. We have a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. The boundaries we care about are from j=1 to j=n-1.\n\nHowever, the update code uses:\n\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)   # This is for the boundary at j = i-1: which is the boundary between i-1 and i -> the contribution is (i-1)*(n - (i-1)) = (i-1)*(n-i+1)\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i              # This is for the boundary at j = i: which is the boundary between i and i+1 -> the contribution is i*(n-i)\n\nSo the update code is consistent: it subtracts the two boundaries that are adjacent to the changed element (if they exist) and then after updating, it adds the new ones.\n\nTherefore, the initial `ans` must be computed by iterating over the boundaries j from 1 to n-1. But the initial code has a loop for i in range(1, n+1). We can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      # boundary between i and i+1: at j = i\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the array a is 1-indexed and we have a[0] and a[n+1] as 0. The boundaries we consider are for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We don't have a boundary for i=0? \n      # Actually, we can only consider the right boundary for each element? But then we would miss the left boundary? \n\nBut note: the boundary between i and i+1 is the same as the right boundary of element i. And we are iterating over i from 1 to n. For i=n, the right boundary is with a[n+1] (which is 0) and we don't count it because the multiplier i*(n-i) for i=n is n*(0)=0. So we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):   # but then we skip i=n? \n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nBut the problem: the initial code has a loop for i in range(1, n+1). We must fill in the loop body.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # The boundary to the left: between i-1 and i -> this boundary is at j = i-1, and we can only count it when i>=2? \n      # But note: the boundary at j=i-1 is the same as the right boundary of element i-1. However, we are at element i, so we cannot count the right boundary of element i-1 here? \n\nTherefore, the intended initial setup for `ans` is to iterate over the boundaries from 1 to n-1. But the loop is over i from 1 to n+1? \n\nGiven the constraints, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut the code has a loop for i in range(1, n+1). We can change the loop? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The missing part is the body of the for-loop for i in range(1, n+1). We cannot change the loop structure.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      # We are going to consider the boundary to the left? But only for i>=2? \n      if i < n:\n          if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n              ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the boundary between i and i+1 is at j=i, and we are at element i. We are only adding the right boundary of element i? But then we are missing the left boundaries? \n\nBut wait: the left boundary of element i (with i-1) is the same as the right boundary of element i-1. And when we process element i-1, we add the boundary at j=i-1 (which is the boundary between i-1 and i). So if we do:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nThis adds the boundary at j=i (the right boundary of element i) for every element i from 1 to n-1. This is exactly the sum over j=1 to n-1 of [ (a[j]!=a[j+1]) * j*(n-j) ].\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the update code subtracts two boundaries: the left boundary (which is the boundary at j=i-1) and the right boundary (which is the boundary at j=i). However, in the initial setup we are only adding the right boundaries? How about the left boundaries? \n\nThe left boundary for element i (at j=i-1) is added when we process element i-1? Because when i-1 is in the range [1, n] and we are at element i-1, we check the right boundary (which is the boundary at j=i-1) and add it. \n\nBut note: the element i=1: we do not add the left boundary (because it's with a0 and we don't count it) and we add the right boundary (if a[1]!=a[2]) at j=1. The element i=2: we add the right boundary (if a[2]!=a[3]) at j=2. And the left boundary for i=2 (which is the boundary at j=1) was already added when i=1? \n\nBut wait: we did not add the left boundary for i=2 when processing i=1. We only added the right boundary for i=1 (which is the boundary at j=1). And the boundary at j=1 is the boundary between 1 and 2, which is the left boundary of element 2. So the boundary at j=1 is added when i=1 (as the right boundary) and that is the same as the left boundary of element 2. \n\nTherefore, the initial setup by adding the right boundary for every element i (for i from 1 to n-1) is sufficient to account for all boundaries from j=1 to j=n-1.\n\nSo the missing code for the for-loop in program1.py is:\n\n  if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n      ans += i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the update code uses:\n\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i-1]) * (n - i + 1) * (i - 1)\n  ans -= (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i\n\nand then after updating a[i], it adds the same conditions.\n\nTherefore, the entire program1.py is consistent.\n\nNow, the output of the program is:\n\n  print(ans + n * (n+1) // 2)\n\nWhy? Because the total awesomeness over all subarrays is the total number of subarrays (which is T = n*(n+1)//2) plus the total contribution of the boundaries (which is stored in `ans`). \n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 + (# of boundaries inside [l, r]). Therefore, the total sum is:\n\n  T + (sum over boundaries j: [if the boundary j is included in the subarray] )\n\nAnd the sum over boundaries j is stored in `ans`.\n\nTherefore, the initial setup for program1.py is:\n\n  n, m = ... \n  a = ... (with a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0)\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      if i < n and a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += i * (n - i)\n\nThen process the queries.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the body of the for-loop.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and an array a (which can have negative numbers). We need to compute the minimum number of actions to make all trees 0.\n\nThe actions:\n  1. Choose a position i and decrease the prefix [1..i] by 1.\n  2. Choose a position i and decrease the suffix [i..n] by 1.\n  3. Increase the entire array by 1.\n\nNote: action 3 is the opposite of 1 and 2? Actually, it increases by 1.\n\nWe can think of the operations as:\n\n  Operation 1: subtract 1 from a[0..i-1] (if we use 0-indexed for the array, but the problem uses 1-indexed: positions 1..i).\n  Operation 2: subtract 1 from a[i-1..n-1] (positions i..n).\n  Operation 3: add 1 to the entire array.\n\nWe are allowed to do any number of each operation.\n\nWe can rephrase: let x be the number of times we do operation 3. Then we are effectively starting from an array (a_i - x) and then we can do operations 1 and 2 (which subtract) to bring it to 0.\n\nBut note: we can also do negative operations? The problem does not say we can do negative operations. We can only do the operations a nonnegative integer number of times.\n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n  Let d1[i] = number of times the prefix operation ending at i (i.e., operation 1 on position i) is applied.\n  Let d2[i] = number of times the suffix operation starting at i (i.e., operation 2 on position i) is applied.\n  Let x = number of operation 3.\n\nThen the net effect on the j-th element is:\n  a_j - x - (d1[1] + d1[2] + ... + d1[j]) - (d2[j] + d2[j+1] + ... + d2[n]) = 0\n\nSo: \n  a_j = x + (d1[1] + ... + d1[j]) + (d2[j] + ... + d2[n])\n\nWe want to minimize: \n  x + (d1[1]+...+d1[n]) + (d2[1]+...+d2[n])\n\nBut note: the total number of operations is x + (sum of d1) + (sum of d2).\n\nWe can rearrange:\n\n  Let A_j = a_j - x = (d1[1]+...+d1[j]) + (d2[j]+...+d2[n])\n\nWe are free to choose x and the nonnegative integers d1[1..n] and d2[1..n].\n\nWe note that the array A = a - x must be nonnegative? Because d1 and d2 are nonnegative. But we can choose x arbitrarily? However, note that if we choose x too large, then a_j - x becomes negative and then we cannot represent it as a sum of nonnegative terms. Therefore, we must have x <= min(a_j). But note: we can also have negative a_j? The problem says a_i can be negative. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the answer exists.\".\n\nWe can also note that operation 3 (adding 1) can be done arbitrarily many times, but we can also think of it as: we can add a constant to the entire array arbitrarily. Therefore, we can set x to be any integer. However, we want to minimize the total operations.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the operations 1 and 2 are subtraction and operation 3 is addition. We can also do operation 3 negative times? But the problem says nonnegative. \n\nBut note: we can simulate subtraction by not doing operation 3? Actually, we can do:\n\n  Let y = -x, then we are effectively starting at a_i and then we do y times the operation of subtracting 1 from the entire array? But the problem does not have that operation. We have operation 3 as adding 1. \n\nWe can reframe: we are allowed to do:\n\n  Operation 1: subtract 1 from a prefix.\n  Operation 2: subtract 1 from a suffix.\n  Operation 3: add 1 to the entire array.\n\nWe can also note that if we do operation 3 k times, then we are effectively starting from (a_i + k) and then we do operations 1 and 2 to bring it to 0. Therefore, we require that the operations 1 and 2 bring the array (a_i + k) to 0. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimum k and nonnegative d1[1..n], d2[1..n] such that:\n\n  a_i + k = (d1[1]+...+d1[i]) + (d2[i]+...+d2[n])   for every i.\n\nAnd the total cost is k + (d1[1]+...+d1[n]) + (d2[1]+...+d2[n]).\n\nWe can define:\n\n  Let u_i = d1[1] + ... + d1[i]   (non-decreasing: u_0=0, u_i>=u_{i-1})\n  Let v_i = d2[i] + ... + d2[n]   (non-increasing: v_i>=v_{i+1}, v_{n+1}=0)\n\nThen we have: a_i + k = u_i + v_i.\n\nWe want to minimize: k + u_n + v_1.\n\nBut note: u_n = d1[1]+...+d1[n] and v_1 = d2[1]+...+d2[n]. And k is nonnegative.\n\nWe can write:\n\n  u_i = (a_i + k) - v_i.\n\nBut we also know that u_i is non-decreasing and v_i is non-increasing.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a known solution for this problem. \n\nKnown solution for \"Drying Potatoes\" or similar? Actually, this is a known problem: \n  https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1420/C1\n  But not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy or difference array.\n\nNote: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  ans = 0\n  for i in range(n):\n      ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])   # but wait, not exactly.\n\nActually, a known solution for a similar problem (making an array zero with prefix and suffix operations) is to use the differences.\n\nWe can define:\n\n  d[0] = a[0]\n  d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i>=1\n\nThen the problem becomes: we can subtract 1 from a prefix (which is equivalent to subtracting 1 from d[0] and adding 1 to d[i] if we do a prefix ending at i) and similarly for suffix: subtracting 1 from a suffix starting at i is equivalent to subtracting 1 from d[i] and adding 1 to d[n] (if we consider d[n] as the difference after the last element). But note: we also have the operation 3: which adds 1 to the entire array -> that is equivalent to adding 1 to d[0] and then we have to account for the entire array? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the known solution from Codeforces for the problem \"Leonard and Three Operations\" (but I don't recall the exact problem).\n\nHowever, note the sample: \n  Test case 1: n=1, a=[0] -> answer=0? \n  But the sample: \n      \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" \n      But wait: if a=[0], then we don't need to do anything? \n      Actually, the sample input: \n          t=?\n          n=3, a=[-2 -4 5] -> but the note says first test case: it's enough to apply operation 3 twice? \n      Actually, the first test case in the note: \n          \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" \n          So the array must be [ -2, -2, ... ]? \n\nBut the problem says: the first test case: \n  Input: \n      3\n      -2 -2 -2\n  Then we do operation 3 twice: becomes [0,0,0]. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut the code in program2.py:\n\n  for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n      tot = 0\n      list = line.split(' ')\n      list2 = [0] + list\n      minv = int(list[0])\n      for val in range(len(list)-1):\n          diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n          if (diff >= 0):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n      print(tot-minv+abs(minv)+int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\nThis code is confusing.\n\nAlternative known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      # We can use: \n      #   ans = 0\n      #   for i in range(1, n):\n      #       ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n      #   ans0 = ans\n      #   # Then subtract the maximum we can save by using the operations? \n      # But that is not the same.\n\nActually, a known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces Round #675 (Div. 2), problem C) is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n      mx = max(abs(a[0]-a[1]), abs(a[-1]-a[-2]))\n      for i in range(1, n-1):\n          mx = max(mx, abs(a[i]-a[i-1]) + abs(a[i]-a[i+1]) - abs(a[i-1]-a[i+1]))\n      print(ans - mx)\n\nBut wait, that is for a different problem (removing one element to minimize the total absolute difference).\n\nAnother known solution (from a known problem \"Three Operations\" of Leon) is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      # We can use: \n      #   b = [0] * n\n      #   for i in range(n-1):\n      #       b[i] = a[i] - a[i+1]\n      #   # Then the answer is ... \n      # But not exactly.\n\nAfter checking, a known solution for this exact problem (Leon and Three Operations) is:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      # We can use the following:\n      #   Let d0 = a[0]\n      #   Let d_i = a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n)\n      #   Let d_n = -a[n-1]\n      #   Then the operations can be seen as: \n      #       Operation 1 at i: subtract 1 from d0 and add 1 to d_i.\n      #       Operation 2 at i: subtract 1 from d_i and add 1 to d_n.\n      #       Operation 3: add 1 to d0 and subtract 1 from d_n.\n      #   We want to make all d_i = 0 for i in [0, n]? \n      #   But note: the condition is a_i=0 for all i, which implies d0=0, d_n=0, and the cumulative sum is 0.\n      #\n      #   The total number of operations is: \n      #       k (operation 3) + (sum of d1) + (sum of d2) \n      #   But we have a system of equations.\n      #\n      # Alternatively, we can use:\n      #   Let x = number of operation 3.\n      #   Then we have to cover the array a with prefix and suffix operations. \n      #   The minimal number of operations is at least the total variation? \n      #\n      # Known solution from a known AC code for this problem (Codeforces Round #675 (Div. 2), problem B? or from a contest):\n      #   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      #   using namespace std;\n      #   typedef long long ll;\n      #   int main() {\n      #       int t; cin >> t;\n      #       while (t--) {\n      #           int n; cin >> n;\n      #           vector<ll> a(n);\n      #           for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n      #           ll ans = 0;\n      #           for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n      #               ans = max(ans, a[i]);\n      #               if (a[i] - a[i+1] > 0) {\n      #                   ans += a[i] - a[i+1];\n      #               }\n      #           }\n      #           ans = max(ans, a[n-1]);\n      #           cout << ans << endl;\n      #       }\n      #   }\n      # But that doesn't match.\n\nAfter research, the intended solution is:\n\n  Let f = 0\n  For i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n      a[i] -= a[i-1]\n  a[0] = 0\n  Then the answer is the sum of the positive differences? \n\nBut the sample: n=3, a=[6,4,1] -> \n  Step: \n      i=2: a[2] = 1 - 4 = -3\n      i=1: a[1] = 4 - 6 = -2\n  Then a = [0, -2, -3] -> sum of positive differences = 0.\n\nThat is not 13.\n\nAnother known solution from the sample: \n  \"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6,0,3. After that apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1 and 3 times on the suffix of length 1. In total, the number of actions will be 4+6+3=13.\"\n\nWe can see that the total number of operations is 13.\n\nKnown solution from an AC submission for the same problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      tot = 0\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          tot += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n      mx = max(abs(a[0] - a[1]), abs(a[-1] - a[-2]))\n      for i in range(1, n-1):\n          mx = max(mx, abs(a[i]-a[i-1]) + abs(a[i]-a[i+1]) - abs(a[i-1]-a[i+1]))\n      print(tot - mx)\n\nBut that is for a different problem (removing one element).\n\nAfter rethinking, we can use the following approach:\n\n  We are allowed to do:\n      x: number of operation 3.\n      Then the array becomes b = [a0+x, a1+x, ..., a_{n-1}+x].\n      Then we do some prefix and suffix operations.\n\n  The prefix operations: let p0, p1, ..., p_{n-1} be the number of times we do the prefix operation ending at position i (0-indexed for the array of size n: positions 0 to n-1). Note: the prefix operation ending at i affects indices 0..i.\n\n  The suffix operations: let q0, q1, ..., q_{n-1} be the number of times we do the suffix operation starting at position i (affecting indices i..n-1).\n\n  Then for position i, we have:\n      b_i = p0 + p1 + ... + p_i + q_i + q_{i+1} + ... + q_{n-1}\n\n  We want to minimize: x + (p0+...+p_{n-1}) + (q0+...+q_{n-1})\n\n  And we have: b_i = a_i + x.\n\n  So: a_i + x = (p0+...+p_i) + (q_i+...+q_{n-1])\n\n  Let P_i = p0+...+p_i, and Q_i = q_i+...+q_{n-1}. Then:\n      a_i + x = P_i + Q_i.\n\n  Also, note that P is non-decreasing and Q is non-increasing.\n\n  We can write:\n      P_i = a_i + x - Q_i.\n\n  But also, P_i >= P_{i-1} and Q_i >= Q_{i+1}.\n\n  We can try to solve for x and the sequences.\n\n  Note that the total cost is: x + P_{n-1} + Q_0.\n\n  But from the equation at i=0:\n      a0 + x = P0 + Q0   -> P0 = a0 + x - Q0.\n\n  At i=n-1:\n      a_{n-1} + x = P_{n-1} + Q_{n-1}.\n\n  Also, note that P_{n-1} = P_{n-1} and Q0 = Q0.\n\n  How to minimize? \n\n  We can note that the system is consistent if and only if the array a_i + x is nonnegative and has a specific structure.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy method:\n\n      Let x = -min(a)   # to make the array nonnegative, but then we might do more.\n\n  But the sample: a = [-2,-2,-2] -> x=2, then b=[0,0,0] -> then we don't need any p or q. Total=2.\n\n  For the sample [6,4,1]: \n      a = [6,4,1] -> min = 1, so x = -1? then b = [5,3,0] -> then we need to represent [5,3,0] as P_i+Q_i.\n\n  How? \n      i0: 5 = P0+Q0.\n      i1: 3 = P1+Q1.\n      i2: 0 = P2+Q2.\n\n  And we require: \n      P0<=P1<=P2, and Q0>=Q1>=Q2>=0.\n\n  We can set:\n      P2 = 0, then Q2=0.\n      Then for i1: 3 = P1+Q1, and since Q1>=Q2=0, and P1>=P0, and for i0: 5 = P0+Q0, and Q0>=Q1.\n\n  We want to minimize: x + P2 + Q0 = -1 + 0 + Q0.\n\n  But note: the cost is x + (P0+...+p_{n-1}) + (q0+...+q_{n-1}) = x + P_{n-1} + Q_0 = -1 + 0 + Q0.\n\n  From i0: 5 = P0+Q0 -> P0 = 5 - Q0.\n  From i1: 3 = P1+Q1.\n\n  Also, P0<=P1<=0, and Q0>=Q1>=0.\n\n  We want to minimize -1+Q0.\n\n  We also have: P0 = 5 - Q0 <=0 -> Q0>=5.\n  Then minimize: -1+5 = 4? but the answer is 13.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following known solution (from an AC code in C++) for the same problem:\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      typedef long long ll;\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          cin >> t;\n          while (t--) {\n              int n;\n              cin >> n;\n              vector<ll> a(n);\n              for (auto &x : a) cin >> x;\n              ll ans = 0;\n              for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) a[i] -= a[i-1];\n              ll pos = 0, neg = 0;\n              for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (a[i] > 0) pos += a[i];\n                  else neg -= a[i];\n              }\n              ans = max(a[0] + pos, -neg);\n              cout << ans + abs(a[0] + pos - neg) << '\\n';\n          }\n      }\n\n  But wait, this passed in a contest? Let me test with the sample [6,4,1]:\n\n      a = [6,4,1]\n      After differences: \n          a[1] = 4-6 = -2\n          a[2] = 1-4 = -3\n          a[0] remains 6.\n      Then a = [6, -2, -3]\n      Then for i=1: a[1]=-2 -> neg = 0+2 = 2.\n                a[2]=-3 -> neg = 2+3 = 5.\n              pos = 0.\n      Then ans = max(6+0, 5) = 6.\n      Then output = 6 + abs(6+0-5) = 6+1 = 7.\n\n  But expected is 13.\n\n  Another known solution from a different AC code:\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.>\n      using namespace std;\n      typedef long long ll;\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          cin >> t;\n          while (t--) {\n              int n;\n              cin >> n;\n              vector<ll> a(n);\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  cin >> a[i];\n              }\n              ll tot = 0;\n              for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n                  tot += abs(a[i+1] - a[i]);\n              }\n              ll v = max(abs(a[0]-a[1]), abs(a[n-1]-a[n-2]));\n              for (int i = 1; i < n-1; i++) {\n                  v = max(v, abs(a[i]-a[i-1]) + abs(a[i]-a[i+1]) - abs(a[i+1]-a[i-1]));\n              }\n              cout << tot - v << endl;\n          }\n      }\n\n  This is for the problem of removing one element to minimize the total adjacent difference.\n\nGiven the provided code in program2.py, we see:\n\n  for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n      tot = 0\n      list = line.split(' ')\n      list2 = [0] + list\n      minv = int(list[0])\n      for val in range(len(list)-1):\n          diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n          if (diff >= 0):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n      print(tot-minv+abs(minv)+int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\nWe have to complete the TODO.\n\n The code does:\n   list = line.split(' ')   # the array of the test case\n   list2 = [0] + list       # so list2[0]=0, list2[1]=a0, list2[2]=a1, ...\n\n   minv = int(list[0])      # the first element of the array\n\n   Then it iterates for val in range(len(list)-1): \n        val from 0 to len(list)-2.\n\n        diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n\n        What is list2[val+1]?
