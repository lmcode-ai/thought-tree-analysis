Then we break and print the last recorded ans which was 0? -> but expected 2? But wait, the sample test case 1: [1,1] -> 2, test case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> 7?

Example: n=2, k=0:\n          swap 3*0+1 = 1 (0-indexed index1) and 3*2-3*0-1 = 6-1 = 5 (0-indexed index5) -> which matches the sample. Example: n=1, k=0:\n          swap 3*0+1 = 1 and 3*1-3*0-1 = 3-1=2 -> but wait, 1-indexed: 1 and 2? -> but the sample swapped 1 and 2 (1-indexed).",

However, the problem sample output for n=2 is \"1\\n2 6\", but we output \"1\\n1 5\". But the problem says: if there are multiple, output any. So we can do:\n\n          for i in range(aux):\n              # Calculate the two indices in 0-indexed:\n              left_index = 3 * i   # the 'B' in the i-th block\n              right_index = 3 * (n-1-i) + 1   # the 'A' in the (n-1-i)-th block\n              # Then convert to 1-indexed by adding 1\n              result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      But note: the problem says the total number of operations is aux, and then we output aux lines. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          for i in range(aux):\n              left_index = 3 * i\n              right_index = 3 * (n-1-i) + 1\n              result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is not too big (t<=100, n<=100) so this is safe. But wait: what if n is odd? For example, n=3: \n            aux = 2\n            i=0: \n                left_index = 0\n                right_index = 3*(3-1-0)+1 = 3*2+1 = 7 -> which is within [0,8] (0-indexed indices from 0 to 8) -> 1-indexed 1 and 8.\n            i=1:\n                left_index = 3*1 = 3\n                right_index = 3*(3-1-1)+1 = 3*1+1 = 4 -> 1-indexed 4 and 5. This is valid. Therefore, we output: program1: the missing two lines: \n              b -= 1\n              sumb += arr[b]\n              cur += 1\n\n          program2: the missing for loop:\n\n          for i in range(aux):\n              left_index = 3 * i\n              right_index = 3 * (n-1-i) + 1\n              result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      But note: in program2, we are already building the string `result` and then at the end we print result[:-1] to remove the last newline?",

Then we are adding the same candy? Example: n=2, [1,1]: Initially: a=-1, b=2 -> else: a becomes 0, b becomes 1 -> then suma=arr[0]=1, sumb=arr[1]=1 -> then we set ans=cur (which is 0? then becomes 2? wait, no: initially cur=0, then we do cur+=2 -> becomes 2) -> then we set ans=0? no: we set ans=cur (which is 0) -> then we update: \n                 a=0, b=1 -> then we do:\n                    a += 1 -> a=1\n                    b -= 1 -> b=0 Then suma += arr[1] -> 1+1=2\n                 sumb += arr[0] -> 1+1=2\n                 cur=0+2=2 -> then next iteration: a=1, b=0 -> a>=b -> break -> then we print ans=0? But expected ans=2. The problem: we set ans=cur (which is 0) at the moment of the equality? But then we update the pointers and the sums. Actually, we should set ans = cur at the moment we have an equality? But then we update and then the next state might be an equality? How about we set ans = cur when we have an equality? Then we update and then the next state might break? But in the example: \n          First iteration: \n             a=-1, b=2 -> else: \n                 ans = 0   -> but then we update: a=0, b=1, suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2 -> then next iteration: Now: a=0, b=1 -> then we check: suma=1, sumb=1 -> else: \n                 ans = cur   -> which is 2 -> then we update: a=1, b=0 -> then break -> then we print 2.

But the existing code is already written. We don't change that. Let me test with n=3: aux = (3+1)//2 = 2 -> same. So we are good. But note: in program1.py, the condition \"if a>=b: break\" is at the top of the loop. When we do b-=1, we must check that b is still >=0? Actually, the condition a>=b is checked at the top. Then we do the update. But what if b becomes less than a? \n\n      Example: Initially: a=-1, b=3 -> then we go to else: a becomes 0, b becomes 2 -> then if suma>sumb: we do b-=1 -> b becomes 1, then we add arr[1] to sumb. Then next iteration: a=0, b=1 -> then we break? no, because a<b. But what if we do b-=1 and then b becomes less than a? Example: a=0, b=1 -> then we do b-=1 -> b=0 -> then a=0, b=0 -> then next iteration: a>=b -> break. So it's safe.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the solve function. The current code uses two pointers (a and b) starting from -1 and n (so a moves right, b moves left). We have:\n  suma: the total weight Alice has eaten (from the left)\n  sumb: the total weight Bob has eaten (from the right)\n  cur: the current total number of candies eaten (Alice + Bob)\n  ans: the best total number of candies eaten so far when the weights were equal.\n\nThe algorithm:\n  while a < b:\n    if suma > sumb: \n        ... (we need to complete this part)\n    elif suma < sumb:\n        a moves right, add arr[a] to suma, and cur increases by 1.\n    else: (suma == sumb)\n        record the current total (ans = cur) and then move both pointers: \n          a moves right, b moves left, update sums and cur (cur increases by 2).\n\nBut note: when suma > sumb, we should move the right pointer (Bob) to eat more? Actually, in the current code, when suma < sumb we move the left pointer (Alice) to eat more. Similarly, when suma > sumb we should move the right pointer (Bob) to eat more.\n\nSo in the TODO part for suma>sumb, we should do:\n        b -= 1\n        sumb += arr[b]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: the condition a>=b must break the loop. Also, we are updating cur and then when we get an equality we update ans.\n\nHowever, note that the current code for the else part (equality) does:\n        ans = cur   # record the current total candies eaten so far (which is the best so far)\n        a += 1\n        b -= 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        sumb += arr[b]\n        cur += 2\n\nBut what if after moving the pointers we break the condition? We break at the next iteration.\n\nBut there is a problem: when we break the loop, we break without updating ans for the last equality? Actually, we update ans every time we have an equality. However, note that after an equality we move both pointers and then the next iteration might break? But we break only when a>=b. Also, when we move a and b in the equality case, we are effectively eating two more candies. But we must check that a and b are still valid? The condition at the top: if a>=b: break.\n\nBut note: initially a=-1, b=n. Then in the first step, we go to the else? Actually, initially suma=0, sumb=0 -> so we go to else. Then we set a=0, b=n-1, suma=arr[0], sumb=arr[n-1], cur=2, and set ans=0? Actually, we set ans=cur (which is 2). Then next iteration: we compare arr[0] and arr[n-1]. \n\nBut the problem: the current code does not handle the case when we break the loop? We break when a>=b. Also, we must note that after an equality we move both pointers and then the next iteration might break? But we break only when a>=b. \n\nHowever, the current code for the else part does:\n        a += 1\n        b -= 1\n\nBut what if after that a becomes >= b? Then we break and then we print the last recorded ans (which was the previous equality). But note: we update ans at the moment of equality and then we move the pointers. The next state might not be an equality? \n\nBut the problem: the current code does not record an equality that might occur at the very end? Actually, we break when a>=b, so we don't process that state.\n\nBut note: the problem says that we cannot eat the same candy. So when a and b meet, we break.\n\nHowever, the sample: \n  Test case 1: n=2, arr=[1,1] -> Alice eats the first, Bob eats the last -> total 2 candies. \n  In the code: \n      Initially: a=-1, b=2, suma=0, sumb=0 -> else: \n          ans=0 -> then a becomes 0, b becomes 1, suma=1, sumb=arr[1]=1, cur=2.\n      Then next iteration: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> then we compare: suma=1, sumb=1 -> else: \n          ans=2 -> then a becomes 1, b becomes 0 -> now a>=b -> break. Then we print ans=2.\n\n  Test case 2: n=3, [2,1,4] -> \n      Initially: a=-1, b=3 -> else: \n          a=0, b=2: suma=2, sumb=4, cur=2 -> then we break? No, we go to next iteration.\n      Now: a=0, b=2 -> suma=2, sumb=4 -> since suma < sumb, we do: a=1, suma=2+1=3, cur=3.\n      Then: a=1, b=2 -> now we compare: 3 vs 4 -> still less -> a=2: but then a becomes 2 and b=2 -> break? \n      Then we break and print the last recorded ans which was 0? -> but expected 2? \n\nBut wait, the sample test case 1: [1,1] -> 2, test case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> 7? Actually, the sample test cases in the problem:\n\n  For the first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n  Second: n=8, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\nBut the third test case: [3,1,0] -> answer=0.\n\nSo what's wrong with [2,1,4]? \n  The problem says: they want to eat the same total weight. \n  Possibilities:\n      Alice eats [2] -> 2, Bob eats [4] -> 4 -> not equal.\n      Alice eats [2,1] -> 3, Bob eats [4] -> 4 -> not equal.\n      Alice eats [2] -> 2, Bob eats [1,4] -> 5 -> not equal.\n      Alice eats nothing, Bob eats nothing -> 0=0 -> but that's 0 candies -> not maximum.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. They cannot skip. And they cannot eat the same candy.\n\n  The maximum number of candies they can eat in total while being fair? \n      They can eat 2: Alice eats the first (2) and Bob eats the last (4) -> but 2 != 4 -> not fair.\n      Or Alice eats the first two: [2,1] = 3, Bob eats the last two: [1,4] -> but wait, Bob cannot eat the [1] because it's already eaten by Alice? \n\n  Actually, the candies are distinct: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right until they meet. So they cannot overlap.\n\n  How about: Alice eats the first (2) and Bob eats the last two? But Bob must eat from the right without skipping. So Bob can only eat the last one? Or the last two? He can choose any contiguous segment from the right? Actually, the problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). So Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right. Similarly, Alice from the left.\n\n  So the entire set of candies is partitioned into three parts: \n      Left: eaten by Alice (a contiguous segment from the left)\n      Middle: uneaten\n      Right: eaten by Bob (a contiguous segment from the right)\n\n  We are to maximize the total number of candies (left segment length + right segment length) such that the sum of the left segment equals the sum of the right segment.\n\n  For [2,1,4]:\n      Possibilities:\n        Alice: [2], Bob: [] -> 2 vs 0 -> not equal.\n        Alice: [2,1] (3), Bob: [] -> 3 vs 0 -> no.\n        Alice: [2,1,4] -> Bob: [] -> but then Bob has nothing? and they are not fair? \n        Alice: [], Bob: [4] -> 0 vs 4 -> no.\n        Alice: [], Bob: [1,4] -> 0 vs 5 -> no.\n        Alice: [2], Bob: [4] -> 2 vs 4 -> no.\n        Alice: [2], Bob: [1,4] -> but wait, Bob can only eat from the right without skipping. So if Bob eats [1,4], that means he must eat the entire right part? But the middle is [1]? Actually, the candies are in a row. The right part is the last two? So Bob can eat the last two? Then the partition is: Alice: [2] (left), middle: [1] (uneaten), Bob: [4] -> no, because Bob must eat the entire contiguous segment from the right? Actually, the problem says: Bob can eat any number from the right (without skipping). So he can choose to eat the last one, or the last two? \n\n  But note: the candies are in a row. Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right. So if he eats the last two, then he eats the candy at index 1 (1) and index 2 (4). But then the candy at index 1 is not adjacent to the right edge? Actually, the problem does not require that the segment is adjacent to the right edge? It says \"from the right\", meaning the entire segment must be at the right. So Bob can only eat a contiguous segment that is at the right? So the entire segment from some index j to the last index.\n\n  Therefore, the partition is: \n      Alice: [0, i] (i inclusive)\n      Bob: [j, n-1] (j inclusive) \n      and we require that i < j (so no overlap) and the sums are equal.\n\n  In [2,1,4]:\n      i=0 (candy0:2), j=2 (candy2:4) -> but then the middle is [1] -> and the sums: 2 and 4 -> not equal.\n      i=0, j=1: then Bob eats [1,4] -> but wait, j=1 means from index1 to the end: [1,4] -> sum=5, Alice=2 -> not equal.\n      i=1, j=2: Alice eats [2,1] (3), Bob eats [4] (4) -> not equal.\n      i=0, j=0: Bob eats nothing? -> 2 vs 0 -> no.\n\n  So the maximum total candies they can eat with equal sum is 0? \n\n  But the problem says: they can also choose to eat nothing? Then the total is 0. And that is fair. But the problem says: \"maximum number of candies\". So 0 is the answer? \n\n  However, the problem note: For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\n\n  So [2,1,4] should be 0.\n\n  Now, the code for [2,1,4]:\n      n=3, arr=[2,1,4]\n      a=-1, b=3 -> else: \n          ans=0, then a=0, b=2 -> suma=2, sumb=4, cur=2.\n      Then next iteration: \n          a=0, b=2 -> 2<4 -> then we do: a=1, suma=2+1=3, cur=3.\n      Then next: a=1, b=2 -> 3<4 -> then a=2, suma=3+4=7, cur=4 -> then a=2, b=2 -> break -> then print ans=0.\n\n  But we never recorded an equality? So we output 0.\n\n  So the code for the first part: we need to complete the suma>sumb part.\n\n  Therefore, the missing part for program1.py is:\n\n        b -= 1\n        sumb += arr[b]\n        cur += 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious about the index. The array is 0-indexed. Initially, b is n (so the first candy Bob eats is at index n-1). Then when we do b-=1, we get b = n-1, then we add arr[b] (which is the last candy). Then we do cur+=1.\n\n  However, in the current code, when we are in the else part, we do:\n        a += 1\n        b -= 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        sumb += arr[b]\n\n  So the same indexing: we use the updated a and b to index the array.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        b -= 1\n        sumb += arr[b]\n        cur += 1\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are to output the minimum number of operations and then the operations (swaps) for each test case.\n\nThe current code for n=1: \n    result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n\nFor n>=2: \n    aux = n//2 if n is even, else n//2+1 (so ceil(n/2)? Actually, for n=2: aux=1, for n=3: aux=2, for n=4: aux=2, for n=5: aux=3.\n\nThen we output aux (the minimum number of operations) and then for i in range(aux): we need to output two indices.\n\nThe problem note: \n  n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\" (if we swap the first and second character: 0-indexed: swap(0,1) -> but the problem uses 1-indexed).\n\n  n=2: swap index2 and index6 -> so 1-indexed: swap(2,6). In 0-indexed: swap(1,5). The string \"BANBAN\" (length=6) becomes:\n        Original: \n          0: 'B'\n          1: 'A'\n          2: 'N'\n          3: 'B'\n          4: 'A'\n          5: 'N'\n        Swap index1 and index5: \n          becomes: \n            index1: 'A' becomes the character at index5: 'N' -> so index1 becomes 'N'\n            index5: 'N' becomes 'A'\n          So: \n            index0: 'B'\n            index1: 'N'\n            index2: 'N'\n            index3: 'B'\n            index4: 'A'\n            index5: 'A'\n          -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\nHow to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\nWe are guaranteed that the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). \n\nWhat is the pattern? \n\nIdea: \n  We have a string of n blocks of \"BAN\". We want to break every occurrence of the subsequence \"BAN\". \n\n  Note: we don't have to break the contiguous occurrence? Because the problem says subsequence.\n\n  How about: for each block of \"BAN\", we can break it by swapping the 'A' and the 'N'? But then we get \"BNA\", which still has the subsequence \"BAN\": because we can take the first 'B', then the next 'A' (which is now in the next block?) and then the next 'N'? \n\n  Alternatively, we can swap the 'B' in one block with the 'N' in another block? \n\n  The sample: \n      n=1: swap the first and second: so swap the 'B' and the 'A' -> \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n          How? \n          To form \"BAN\": \n            We would need a 'B' then an 'A' then an 'N'. \n            In \"ABN\": \n                The first character is 'A', then 'B', then 'N'. \n                We can take the 'B' at index1 (if 1-indexed: index2) and then we need an 'A' after it? but there is no 'A' after the 'B'. Then we need an 'N' after the 'A'? \n            Actually, we can form: \n                'A' (index1), then skip the 'B' (index2) and then take the 'N' (index3) -> that's \"A\" and \"N\" -> \"AN\", but not \"BAN\". \n                Or take the 'B' at index2 and then we need an 'A' after it? none -> so no \"BAN\".\n\n      n=2: swap the second and the sixth: \n          Original: positions: \n            1: 'B'\n            2: 'A'\n            3: 'N'\n            4: 'B'\n            5: 'A'\n            6: 'N'\n          Swap 2 and 6: \n            1: 'B'\n            2: 'N' (from the last)\n            3: 'N'\n            4: 'B'\n            5: 'A'\n            6: 'A' (from the second)\n          Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n            We can take the first 'B' (index1), then we need an 'A' after index1: the next 'A' is at index5. Then we need an 'N' after index5: we have an 'N' at index2? but that is before index5. And at index3? but that is also before. And at index6: 'A'. So no 'N' after index5. \n            Alternatively, take the second 'B' at index4: then we need an 'A' after index4: at index5. Then we need an 'N' after index5: at index6 we have 'A'. So no.\n\n  How to generalize? \n      We can break each \"BAN\" by swapping the 'A' in one block with the 'N' in a symmetric block? \n\n      Specifically, for k from 0 to aux-1 (where aux = ceil(n/2)), we can swap:\n          the 'A' in the k-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-k)-th block.\n\n      In the k-th block (0-indexed), the positions of the characters are:\n          'B': at 3*k\n          'A': at 3*k+1\n          'N': at 3*k+2\n\n      In the (n-1-k)-th block, the 'N' is at 3*(n-1-k)+2 = 3*n - 3*k - 1.\n\n      So we swap the element at 3*k+1 (the 'A' in the k-th block) with the element at 3*n-3*k-1 (the 'N' in the (n-1-k)-th block).\n\n      Example: n=2, k=0:\n          swap 3*0+1 = 1 (0-indexed index1) and 3*2-3*0-1 = 6-1 = 5 (0-indexed index5) -> which matches the sample.\n\n      Example: n=1, k=0:\n          swap 3*0+1 = 1 and 3*1-3*0-1 = 3-1=2 -> but wait, 1-indexed: 1 and 2? -> but the sample swapped 1 and 2 (1-indexed). However, in 0-indexed we have indices 1 and 2? but the string has length 3: indices 0,1,2. \n          Actually, the problem says: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) -> which are 0-indexed indices 0 and 1? \n\n      Correction: the problem uses 1-indexed. The sample for n=1: swap the first and second -> so indices 1 and 2 in 1-indexed.\n\n      But our formula for n=1: \n          k=0: \n            i1 = 3*0+1 = 1 (1-indexed) -> but wait, we are generating 0-indexed indices? \n\n      Actually, the problem expects 1-indexed indices.\n\n      So we can generate the two indices for the k-th operation as:\n          i = 3*k+1 + 1? -> no, because 3*k+1 is 0-indexed index of the 'A' in the k-th block. To get 1-indexed: we add 1 -> 3*k+2? \n\n      But wait: \n          k=0: \n            the 'A' is at 0-indexed index 1 -> 1-indexed index 2? \n          and the 'N' in the (n-1-k) block: for n=1, n-1-k = 0, so the 'N' is at 0-indexed index 2 -> 1-indexed index 3.\n\n      Then we swap 2 and 3? but the sample swapped 1 and 2.\n\n      Alternatively, the problem sample for n=1: \n          They swapped the first and second character -> so 1 and 2.\n\n      How do we get 1 and 2? \n          We could swap the 'B' and the 'A'? \n          The 'B' is at 0-indexed index0 -> 1-indexed 1.\n          The 'A' is at 0-indexed index1 -> 1-indexed 2.\n\n      So for n=1, we want to swap the first two.\n\n      How about we swap the 'B' in the k-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-k) block? \n          k=0: \n            'B' at 3*0 = 0 -> 1-indexed 1.\n            'N' at 3*(n-1-k)+2 = 3*(0)+2 = 2 -> 1-indexed 3.\n          Then we swap 1 and 3 -> \"NAB\" -> which also breaks \"BAN\", but the sample did 1 and 2.\n\n      But the problem says: if there are multiple, output any.\n\n      However, the sample output for n=1 is \"1\\n1 2\".\n\n      How about we do: \n          For the k-th operation, swap the 'A' in the k-th block with the 'B' in the (n-1-k)-th block? \n          Then for n=1: \n              k=0: \n                 'A' in block0: 0-indexed index1 -> 1-indexed 2.\n                 'B' in block (0): 0-indexed index0? -> 1-indexed 1.\n              swap 1 and 2 -> matches.\n\n      But wait, the (n-1-k) block for n=1: k=0 -> n-1-0=0 -> same block? \n          So we are swapping the 'A' and the 'B' in the same block? -> that gives \"ABN\" -> \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\", which is what we want.\n\n      For n=2: \n          k=0: \n             swap the 'A' in block0 (0-indexed index1) with the 'B' in block (2-1-0)=1 -> the 'B' in block1 is at 0-indexed index3 -> 1-indexed 4? \n          Then we swap index1 (0-indexed) and index3 (0-indexed): \n             Original: \n                0: 'B'\n                1: 'A'\n                2: 'N'\n                3: 'B'\n                4: 'A'\n                5: 'N'\n             After swap: \n                0: 'B'\n                1: 'B' (from block1)\n                2: 'N'\n                3: 'A' (from block0)\n                4: 'A'\n                5: 'N'\n             -> \"BBN AAN\" -> \"BBN\" and \"AAN\". \n          Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n             Take the first 'B' (index0), then the next 'A'? we have an 'A' at index3 -> then we need an 'N' after index3: we have at index5 -> so we can form: index0, index3, index5 -> \"BAN\". \n\n      So that doesn't work.\n\n      Alternatively, swap the 'A' in the k-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-k) block? \n          For n=1: \n             k=0: swap the 'A' (index1) with the 'N' (index2) -> 1-indexed: 2 and 3 -> but the sample did 1 and 2.\n\n      But the problem says: any sequence that achieves the goal. So we can do 1 and 3? \n          Then the string becomes: \n             swap index0 (1-indexed1) and index2 (1-indexed3): \n                 Original: \"BAN\" -> swap first and last: \n                    first: 'B' -> goes to last -> becomes: \n                         index0: 'N' (from last) -> but wait, we swapped index0 and index2: \n                         so: \n                            index0: 'N'\n                            index1: 'A'\n                            index2: 'B'\n                         -> \"NAB\"\n          Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n             We need a 'B' then an 'A' then an 'N'. \n                 We have a 'B' at index2 (last) -> but after that there is nothing. \n                 We have a 'B' at index0? no, we have 'N'. \n                 Actually, the only 'B' is at the end. Then we cannot form \"BAN\".\n\n      So that works.

But if the last character is a newline, that's okay? \n\n      But note: the test cases are consecutive. For example, if we have two test cases: \n          n=1: \n             result = \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n          then n=2: \n             we add \"1\\n1 5\\n\" -> so overall: \"1\\n1 2\\n1\\n1 5\\n\"\n          then we remove the last character: so we remove the last '\\n' -> becomes \"1\\n1 2\\n1\\n1 5\"\n\n      But the problem expects for each test case: first the number of operations, then the operations. \n\n      However, the problem says: \"for each test case, in the first line output m, then output m lines\". \n\n      And we are building: \n          for each test case: \n             if n==1: \n                 result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n             else:\n                 result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n                 for ...: \n                    result += ... + \"\\n\"\n\n      Then at the end we do: print(result[:-1])\n\n      Why remove the last newline? \n\n      The problem does not require that there is no newline at the end. But the sample outputs have newlines. \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code as it is.\n\n      But the original code for program2.py has:\n\n          if n == 1:\n              result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n              continue\n\n          result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n          for i in range(aux):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      and then after the while loop: \n          print(result[:-1])\n\n      So we are removing the last character. \n\n      Therefore, we must not have an extra newline at the end. \n\n      In our for loop, we are adding a newline for each operation. The last operation in the last test case will have a trailing newline. Then we remove the last character (which is that newline). \n\n      But what if there is only one test case? Then we remove the last newline of the last operation? \n\n      Example: t=1, n=1: \n          result = \"1\\n1 2\\n\" -> then we remove the last character: '\\n' -> becomes \"1\\n1 2\" -> which is two lines: \n              line1: \"1\"\n              line2: \"1 2\"\n\n      But the problem expects: \n          first line: \"1\"\n          second line: \"1 2\"\n\n      Without the trailing newline, the output is:\n\n          1\n          1 2\n\n      which is correct.\n\n      However, if we have multiple test cases, we are building:\n\n          test case1: ... then test case2: ... \n\n      and we are adding a newline at the end of each operation and at the end of the m number. \n\n      Then we remove the very last character. \n\n      So we must ensure that the last character is a newline. \n\n      Therefore, the code we add for the for loop in program2.py should add a newline for each operation. \n\n      But note: the last operation of the last test case: we add a newline, then we remove it? \n\n      Actually, the code: \n          result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"   # for the current test case\n          for i in range(aux):\n              ... + \"\\n\"\n\n      Then the next test case? \n\n      But the last test case: after the for loop, we don't add anything else? \n\n      Then the entire result string ends with a newline. Then we remove that last newline by result[:-1]. \n\n      So it's safe.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          for i in range(aux):\n              left_index = 3 * i\n              right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\n              result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      But note: the problem says the constraints: n>=1, and the operations are at most 10^5, and the total n over test cases is at most 100 (t<=100) so n<=100 -> aux<=50 -> total operations over test cases <= 100*50 = 5000, which is safe.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the variable `i` in the for loop is the same as the one in the outer loop? \n          The outer loop: \n              while t:\n                  t -= 1\n                  ... \n                  for i in range(aux):   # this is a new i\n\n          So it's okay.\n\n      Therefore, we output the two completions in the required JSON format.\n\n      Note: the missing code in program1.py is two lines? Actually, the TODO is in the block for \"if suma>sumb:\". We have to replace the TODO with two lines? \n\n      But the current code has:\n\n        if suma>sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the TODO with:\n\n            b -= 1\n            sumb += arr[b]\n            cur += 1\n\n      But note: the code is indented. We must preserve the indentation.\n\n      Similarly, in program2.py, we replace the TODO with the for loop.\n\n      However, the TODO in program2.py is inside a for loop and we are to output the code that goes there.\n\n      So the completions:\n\n        program1: \n            \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n        program2: \n            \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += f\\\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\\\n\\\"\"\n\n      But note: the existing code in program2.py after the TODO is:\n\n          print(result[:-1])\n\n      And we are to output the missing code without the entire program.\n\n      Therefore, we output the JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += f\\\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\\\n\\\"\"\n          }\n\n      However, note: the program2.py code uses an integer division for aux: \n          aux = int(n/2 if n%2==0 else n/2+1)\n\n      But we can also write: aux = (n+1)//2   -> which is the same as ceil(n/2). But the existing code is already written.\n\n      We don't change that.\n\n      Let me test with n=3: \n          aux = (3+1)//2 = 2 -> same.\n\n      So we are good.\n\n      But note: in program1.py, the condition \"if a>=b: break\" is at the top of the loop. When we do b-=1, we must check that b is still >=0? \n\n      Actually, the condition a>=b is checked at the top. Then we do the update. But what if b becomes less than a? \n\n      Example: \n          Initially: a=-1, b=3 -> then we go to else: a becomes 0, b becomes 2 -> then if suma>sumb: we do b-=1 -> b becomes 1, then we add arr[1] to sumb. Then next iteration: a=0, b=1 -> then we break? no, because a<b. \n\n      But what if we do b-=1 and then b becomes less than a? \n          Example: a=0, b=1 -> then we do b-=1 -> b=0 -> then a=0, b=0 -> then next iteration: a>=b -> break.\n\n      So it's safe.\n\n      Therefore, we output the JSON as above.\n\n      However, note: the program1.py code has a bug? \n\n      In the else part (when suma==sumb), we do:\n          a += 1\n          b -= 1\n          suma += arr[a]\n          sumb += arr[b]\n          cur += 2\n\n      But what if after a+=1, a becomes equal to b? Then we are adding the same candy? \n\n      Example: n=2, [1,1]: \n          Initially: a=-1, b=2 -> else: \n             a becomes 0, b becomes 1 -> then suma=arr[0]=1, sumb=arr[1]=1 -> then we set ans=cur (which is 0? then becomes 2? wait, no: initially cur=0, then we do cur+=2 -> becomes 2) -> then we set ans=0? no: we set ans=cur (which is 0) -> then we update: \n                 a=0, b=1 -> then we do:\n                    a += 1 -> a=1\n                    b -= 1 -> b=0\n                 Then suma += arr[1] -> 1+1=2\n                 sumb += arr[0] -> 1+1=2\n                 cur=0+2=2 -> then next iteration: a=1, b=0 -> a>=b -> break -> then we print ans=0? \n\n      But expected ans=2.\n\n      The problem: we set ans=cur (which is 0) at the moment of the equality? But then we update the pointers and the sums. \n\n      Actually, we should set ans = cur at the moment we have an equality? But then we update and then the next state might be an equality? \n\n      How about we set ans = cur when we have an equality? Then we update and then the next state might break? \n\n      But in the example: \n          First iteration: \n             a=-1, b=2 -> else: \n                 ans = 0   -> but then we update: a=0, b=1, suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2 -> then next iteration: \n          Now: a=0, b=1 -> then we check: suma=1, sumb=1 -> else: \n                 ans = cur   -> which is 2 -> then we update: a=1, b=0 -> then break -> then we print 2.\n\n      So it works.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program1.py is correct.\n\n      We output the completions.\n\n      Important: the program1.py code has the line:\n\n        a,suma=-1,0\n        b,sumb=n,0\n\n      Then in the else part: \n          a+=1 -> becomes 0\n          b-=1 -> becomes n-1\n\n      Then we add arr[a] and arr[b] -> which are the first and last.\n\n      So the missing code for program1.py is the three lines? Actually, the TODO is only two lines? \n\n      But the code we are replacing the TODO with is three lines? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is in the block:\n\n        if suma>sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace it with:\n\n            b -= 1\n            sumb += arr[b]\n            cur += 1\n\n      That's three lines.\n\n      But note: the existing code in the elif and else are also three lines? \n\n      The elif block:\n\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            a+=1\n            suma+=arr[a]\n            cur+=1\n\n      So we are consistent.\n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n        program1: \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\"\n        program2: \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += f\\\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\\\n\\\"\"\n\n      But note: in program2, we are using f-strings. This is valid for python3.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n      We output the JSON.\n\n      Let me write the JSON string:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += f\\\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\\\n\\\"\"\n          }\n\n      But note: the program2 code has a backslash in the f-string: we have to escape the backslash? \n\n      Actually, in the string we have: \n          result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      In the JSON string, we must escape the backslash: so we write \"\\\\n\" to represent the newline.\n\n      But wait, the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. \n\n      We are outputting a JSON string. We must escape the double quotes and backslashes.\n\n      However, the problem does not specify the output format beyond the JSON structure. \n\n      But to be safe, we escape the backslash and the double quotes.\n\n      However, the program2 completion string does not have double quotes? \n\n      Actually, we are using double quotes for the JSON keys and values. The value for \"program2\" is a string that contains double quotes? \n\n      In the f-string: we have double quotes? \n\n          result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      This is a string with double quotes? Actually, it's a string with single quotes? No, it's a string delimited by double quotes? \n\n      But in the code, we can use either. However, the problem does not specify. \n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          result += str(left_index+1) + \" \" + str(right_index+1) + \"\\n\"\n\n      to avoid f-strings? \n\n      But the problem does not require a particular style.\n\n      However, to avoid escaping in JSON, we can use the triple quoted string? \n\n      But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\n      Since the problem does not specify the style, we can choose the one without double quotes? \n\n      Actually, the f-string uses double quotes. \n\n      How about we use:\n\n          result += \"{} {}\\n\".format(left_index+1, right_index+1)\n\n      Then we avoid double quotes? \n\n      But the problem does not require that. \n\n      Alternatively, we can output the string as is and let the JSON escape the necessary characters.\n\n      We must escape the backslash in the newline: so we write \"\\\\n\" in the JSON string.\n\n      And the double quotes inside the string? We don't have any. \n\n      The f-string: \n          f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      This string does not contain double quotes. \n\n      So in the JSON string, we write:\n\n          \"program2\": \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += f\\\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\\\n\\\"\"\n\n      But wait, the f-string uses double quotes? Actually, we can use single quotes for the f-string? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. \n\n      However, the existing code in program2.py uses double quotes for the string in the n==1 case: \n          result += \"1\\n1 2\\n\"\n\n      So we can use double quotes.\n\n      But in the JSON, we are using double quotes for the key and value. So we must escape the double quotes inside the string? \n\n      Actually, the value of \"program2\" is a string that contains:\n\n          left_index = 3 * i\n          right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\n          result += f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\\n\"\n\n      This string does not contain double quotes. \n\n      But the f-string is written with double quotes? \n\n          result += f\"...\\n\"\n\n      This is a string with single quotes? Actually, no: in Python, we can use either. But the problem does not specify.\n\n      However, to avoid escaping in JSON, we can use single quotes for the f-string? \n\n      But the problem does not require. \n\n      Alternatively, we can write without f-strings:\n\n          result += str(left_index+1) + \" \" + str(right_index+1) + \"\\n\"\n\n      This is safe.\n\n      But the problem says: output the missing code. We can choose any representation as long as it is correct.\n\n      Let me choose the format method to avoid escaping issues:\n\n          \"result += \\\"{} {}\\\\n\\\".format(left_index+1, right_index+1)\"\n\n      Then the entire string for program2 becomes:\n\n          \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += \\\"{} {}\\\\n\\\".format(left_index+1, right_index+1)\"\n\n      But note: the existing code uses double quotes. We can use double quotes and escape them in the JSON? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          result += str(left_index+1) + ' ' + str(right_index+1) + '\\n'\n\n      Then we avoid double quotes? \n\n      Actually, we use single quotes for the space and the newline.\n\n      But the existing code for n==1 uses double quotes. \n\n      We'll use:\n\n          result += str(left_index+1) + ' ' + str(right_index+1) + '\\n'\n\n      Then the string for program2 is:\n\n          \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += str(left_index+1) + ' ' + str(right_index+1) + '\\\\n'\"\n\n      This way, we avoid double quotes in the string.\n\n      But the problem does not require consistency in quotes.\n\n      We'll do this to avoid JSON escaping.\n\n      Therefore, the final completions:\n\n        program1: \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\"\n        program2: \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += str(left_index+1) + ' ' + str(right_index+1) + '\\\\n'\"\n\n      Now, the JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"b -= 1\\n        sumb += arr[b]\\n        cur += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"left_index = 3 * i\\n        right_index = 3 * (n - 1 - i) + 1\\n        result += str(left_index+1) + ' ' + str(right_index+1) + '\\\\n'\"\n          }\n\n      We output this."
