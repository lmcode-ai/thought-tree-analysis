Actually, the example result: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> that has four zeros? (positions0:0, position1:0, position2:0, position5:0) -> that's four zeros? So they did two swaps: \n                swap the 1 at copy1[1] with the 0 at copy2[0] -> then copy1[1] becomes 0, and copy2[0] becomes 1 -> then copy1: [0,0,3,3,7,0] (zeros at indices0,1,5 -> three zeros) \n                then swap the 3 at copy1[2] with the 0 at copy2[5] -> then copy1: [0,0,0,3,7,0] (zeros at indices0,1,2,5 -> four zeros) and copy2: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> but wait, the second swap: we swapped the 3 at copy1[2] with the 0 at copy2[5] -> then copy2[5] becomes 3? So two swaps. Then they did: \n                Operation 3: clone the first array -> now we have three copies: \n                    copy1:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The code is already provided with some missing parts. We are to complete the missing lines.\n\n The approach in program1.py is:\n   We are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\n\n   The idea is to use three dictionaries:\n     dic1: counts the frequency of the first character (for strings with the same first character, they would have the same first character and then we look at the second character being different? Actually, note: the code adds to result when we see the same first character? But wait, the problem says: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\n   Actually, the method used is:\n     We can count:\n        (1) Pairs that have the same first character but different second character.\n        (2) Pairs that have the same second character but different first character.\n\n     However, note that if we count (1) and (2) separately, we might overcount the pairs that have both positions different? Actually, no: because if they differ in exactly one position, then either the first is same and second differs, or the first differs and the second is same.\n\n     But also note: the same string might appear multiple times. The current code also uses dic3 to count the frequency of the entire string.\n\n   The current code does:\n        if S[0] in dic1:\n            result += dic1[S[0]]\n            dic1[S[0]] += 1\n        else:\n            # missing code for dic1\n\n        Similarly for dic2 (which is for the second character).\n\n        Then for the entire string in dic3, we subtract twice the frequency of the same string? Why twice?\n\n   Explanation:\n     Consider: \n        We are counting pairs that have the same first character (and then we add the frequency of the first character so far) and same for the second character.\n\n        However, if two strings are identical, then they would be counted in both dic1 and dic2? Actually, no: because for two identical strings, say \"aa\" and \"aa\", when we process the second \"aa\":\n            - For the first character 'a': we have seen it, so we add the current count (which is 1) to result -> result +=1.\n            - For the second character 'a': we have seen it, so we add the current count (which is 1) to result -> result +=1.\n\n        So we have added 2 for the pair (i,j) of two identical strings? But that pair does not have exactly one difference? It has zero differences. So we must subtract.\n\n        However, the problem says: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position. So identical pairs are not allowed. Also, pairs that differ in both positions are not allowed.\n\n        But note: the above counting for the same first character: we are counting pairs that have the same first character and any second character? Actually, the same first character and then we don't care about the second? That would overcount because it includes pairs that have the same first character and same second character (which we don't want) and same first character and different second character (which we do want).\n\n        Similarly for the second character.\n\n        How do we fix? We subtract the pairs that are identical? Actually, the code subtracts twice the frequency of the same string? Why twice?\n\n        Let me think: \n          We have two counts: \n            A = count of pairs that have the same first character (including those that are identical) \n            B = count of pairs that have the same second character (including those that are identical)\n\n          Then we subtract twice the count of identical pairs? \n\n        Actually, for an identical pair, it was counted twice: once in the first character and once in the second. But we don't want it at all. So we subtract 2 * (number of identical pairs) to remove both counts? \n\n        However, note: the identical pair is only one pair? But we are adding 1 for the first character and 1 for the second character, so total 2. Then we subtract 2 * (the frequency of the same string so far) at the moment we see the same string? \n\n        But wait: when we see a duplicate string, we subtract 2 * (current frequency of that string). Then we update the frequency.\n\n        Example: \n          First string \"ab\": \n            dic1: 'a' -> not present -> set to 1? (but the else is missing for dic1, so we have to complete that)\n            dic2: 'b' -> not present -> set to 1 (the else is provided: dic2[S[1]]=1)\n            dic3: \"ab\" -> not present -> set to 1.\n\n          Second string \"ab\":\n            For the first character 'a': present -> result += dic1['a'] (which is 1) -> result=1.\n            For the second character 'b': present -> result += dic2['b'] (which is 1) -> result=2.\n            Then for the entire string: present -> result -= 2 * dic3[\"ab\"] (which is 1) -> result=0.\n            Then update: dic1['a'] becomes 2, dic2['b'] becomes 2, dic3[\"ab\"] becomes 2.\n\n          Third string \"ab\":\n            First char: result += dic1['a'] (2) -> result=2.\n            Second char: result += dic2['b'] (2) -> result=4.\n            Then: result -= 2 * dic3[\"ab\"] (which is 2) -> result=0.\n\n          But wait, we have three \"ab\": \n            The pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). \n            For each pair, we want to count 0 because they are identical? So the result should be 0.\n\n          How does the counting work for the third string?\n            For the third string, when we look at the first character: \n                we have two previous strings with 'a', so we add 2 -> result=2.\n            Then for the second character: we have two previous strings with 'b', so we add 2 -> result=4.\n            Then we subtract 2 * (current frequency of \"ab\", which is 2) -> 4 - 4 = 0.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        But why twice? Because each identical pair is counted twice (once for the first character and once for the second) and we subtract twice the frequency of the same string? Actually, the subtraction is done for each duplicate: \n          When we see the k-th occurrence of string S, we subtract 2*(k-1) because the current frequency in dic3 is (k-1). \n\n        Therefore, the missing part for dic1 is: we should set dic1[S[0]] to 1 if it is not present.\n\n        So for the else block of dic1, we do: \n            dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\n        Similarly, the else block for dic2 is already provided.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is just: \n            dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\n        But note: the code for the else block of dic1 is missing. We have:\n            if S[0] in dic1:\n                ... \n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We should set dic1[S[0]] to 1.\n\n        So the missing line for program1.py is: \n            dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: \n   We are given an array a of n integers. We can do two operations:\n      1. Clone any existing array (so we get one more copy).\n      2. Swap any two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n   We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n   Note: Initially we have one copy.\n\n   Example: \n        In the first test case: [1,1,1] -> already all equal -> 0 operations.\n\n        Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example used 6 operations? But the example says 6 operations? However, the problem says \"minimal\".\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   Observation:\n     We are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can gather all the same element (say x) from all the copies we have into one copy.\n\n     Steps:\n        Operation 1: cloning. Each clone operation adds one more copy (so we have more arrays to take elements from).\n        Operation 2: swapping. Each swap can move an element from one array to another.\n\n     We want one copy to have all elements equal to x.\n\n     How many operations do we need?\n\n     Let:\n        Let f(x) be the frequency of x in the original array.\n\n        To have a copy with all elements equal to x, we need n copies of x in that copy.\n\n        Currently, we have f(x) copies of x in the initial array.\n\n        We can get more copies of x by cloning the array? But note: when we clone, we get an identical array. So if we clone k times, we have k+1 copies of the array, and the total number of x's is (k+1)*f(x).\n\n        However, we can also swap elements. We can move x's from other copies to the target copy.\n\n        But note: we can also use other numbers? Actually, we don't care about the other numbers in the target copy: we only care that the target copy has n x's.\n\n        How many x's do we have in total? (k+1)*f(x). We need n x's in one copy. Therefore, we require (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n        But also, we can swap non-x elements out of the target copy? Actually, we can swap non-x elements from the target copy to other copies and bring x's from other copies to the target copy.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can rearrange arbitrarily. The key constraint is the total number of x's available.\n\n        Therefore, we must have: (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n        Then k (the number of clone operations) must be at least ceil(n / f(x)) - 1.\n\n        But wait: we also have to account for the swaps? \n\n        How many swaps are needed? \n\n        In the target copy, initially we have the original array. Then we can do swaps to bring x's from other copies and send non-x's to other copies.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not require to count swaps and clone operations separately? The operations are:\n          Operation type 1: clone (counted as one operation)\n          Operation type 2: swap (counted as one operation)\n\n        We need the total number of operations.\n\n        How many swaps? \n          In the target copy, we start with the original array. We need to replace the non-x elements with x's.\n\n          How many non-x elements are in the target copy? n - f(x) (if we consider the original array as the target? but we can choose any copy as the target).\n\n          However, we can also create clones and then use swaps to bring x's from other copies. \n\n          But note: we can also use multiple clones to gather x's. \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let k = number of clone operations.\n\n            Then we have k+1 copies.\n\n            The total number of x's available is (k+1)*f(x). We need n of them in one copy.\n\n            How do we get the x's into the target copy? We need to move x's from other copies to the target copy and move non-x's from the target copy to other copies.\n\n            Each swap can bring one x to the target copy and at the same time remove one non-x from the target copy? Actually, we can swap an element in the target copy (which is non-x) with an element in another copy (which is x). Then we get one more x in the target and one less x in the other copy.\n\n            But note: we might also swap within the same copy? But that doesn't help because we are moving within the same copy.\n\n            Actually, we need to move x's from other copies to the target copy. For each x that we bring from another copy, we can swap it with a non-x in the target copy. Then we get one x in the target and the non-x goes to the other copy.\n\n            How many such swaps? We need to bring (n - f(x)) x's to the target copy? Actually, no: because the target copy initially has f(x) x's, so we need n - f(x) more x's. And each swap brings one x from another copy (and sends one non-x to that copy). \n\n            Therefore, we need n - f(x) swaps.\n\n            But wait: what if we have multiple clones? We can bring x's from multiple clones. The total available x's is (k+1)*f(x). We need to have n in the target, so we must have (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n            The minimal k is the smallest integer such that (k+1)*f(x) >= n, i.e., k_min = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1.\n\n            Then the total operations would be: \n                clone operations: k_min\n                swap operations: n - f(x)   (because we need to replace n - f(x) non-x's in the target copy)\n\n            So total = k_min + (n - f(x))\n\n        However, consider: \n          Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6). \n          Let x=0: f(0)=2.\n          Then k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1 = 2? \n          Then total operations = 2 (clones) + (6-2) = 2+4 = 6. -> matches the example.\n\n          Example: [1,1,1] (n=3). \n          Let x=1: f(1)=3.\n          k_min = ceil(3/3)-1 = 1-1 = 0.\n          total operations = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct.\n\n          Example: [1,2,2,1] (n=4). \n          Let x=1: f(1)=2 -> k_min = ceil(4/2)-1 = 2-1=1, operations=1+(4-2)=3.\n          Let x=2: f(2)=2 -> same: 1+ (4-2)=3.\n\n          But is that minimal? \n\n          Alternatively, we might choose a different x? \n\n          We should choose x that minimizes: ceil(n / f(x)) - 1 + (n - f(x))\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to choose any x. So we should try all x that appear in the array? But note: the problem says \"all elements equal\", so x must be an element that appears in the array.\n\n        But wait: what if we choose an x that does not appear? Then we cannot get it because we start with the given array and we can only swap existing elements? So we must choose an x that is in the array.\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed test case, we can:\n          Let m = max frequency of any element? But note: we are going to consider each distinct element? However, the minimal operations might be achieved by the element with the highest frequency? \n\n          Why? Because k_min = ceil(n/f(x))-1: the larger f(x) is, the smaller k_min is. Also, n-f(x) is minimized when f(x) is maximized.\n\n          So the minimal total operations for a fixed x is achieved when f(x) is as large as possible? \n\n          Let's test with two elements: \n            Suppose we have two candidates: \n              candidate1: f1 = 3, n=4 -> total = ceil(4/3)-1 + (4-3) = ceil(1.33)=2 -> 2-1=1, then 1+1=2.\n              candidate2: f2 = 2, n=4 -> total = ceil(4/2)-1 + (4-2)= 2-1+2=3.\n\n          So candidate1 (with higher frequency) gives a lower total.\n\n          Therefore, we can choose the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n          But wait: what if there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency? Then we can choose any? \n\n          Actually, the total operations for an element x is: \n              k = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1\n              swaps = n - f(x)\n              total = k + (n - f(x))\n\n          And we want the minimum total over all x that appear.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require to choose the element that minimizes the operations? It says: \"minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal\". So we can choose the element that minimizes the total operations.\n\n          But the example: \n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example used x=0? and got 6 operations. \n            What if we choose x=3? \n                f(3)=2 -> same as 0? so total = ceil(6/2)-1 + (6-2) = 3-1+4 = 6.\n\n          So same.\n\n          But what if we choose an element that is not the most frequent? \n            [1,2,2,3] (n=4). \n            Frequencies: \n                1:1 -> total = ceil(4/1)-1 + (4-1)= 4-1+3 = 6.\n                2:2 -> total = ceil(4/2)-1 + (4-2)= 2-1+2=3.\n                3:1 -> total=6.\n\n          So we must choose the element that minimizes the expression.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n          Step 1: Count frequency of each element.\n          Step 2: Let m = max frequency? But note: we are going to compute for each distinct element? However, the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the distinct elements per test case might be up to n. But the sum of n over test cases is <=10^5, so we can iterate over distinct elements.\n\n          But wait: the problem says the sum of n over test cases <=10^5, so the total distinct elements over test cases is also <=10^5? \n\n          However, the input for each test case: the second line has n integers. The total n over test cases <=10^5, so we can do:\n\n          For each test case:\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list of n integers\n\n            We can compute the frequency of each element in a.\n\n            Then, we want: \n                ans = a big number\n                for each distinct element x in a:\n                    f = freq[x]\n                    k = ceil(n / f) - 1\n                    swaps = n - f\n                    total_ops = k + swaps\n                    ans = min(ans, total_ops)\n\n          But note: we must consider that we can only use x that appears in the array.\n\n        However, is this efficient? \n          The distinct elements in one test case: worst-case n distinct, and the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total distinct elements over test cases is at most 10^5? Actually, the sum of the lengths of the arrays is 10^5, so the total distinct elements over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n          But note: the distinct elements in one test case might be 10^5, and the total distinct over test cases might be 10^5? So we can iterate over distinct elements per test case.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the sum of n over test cases <=10^5, so the total distinct elements over test cases is bounded by 10^5? Actually, no: because distinct elements per test case: if one test case has 10^5 distinct elements, then we have one test case? and the next test case might have 1 element? \n\n          The constraint: the sum of n (the lengths) over test cases <=10^5. So the total number of elements is 10^5. Therefore, the total distinct elements over test cases is at most 10^5? Actually, no: because distinct elements per test case: the same element might appear in multiple test cases? \n\n          But we are processing test cases independently. The distinct elements in one test case: we can have up to n distinct. And the sum of n is 10^5, so the worst-case distinct elements over test cases is 10^5? \n\n          Actually, worst-case: one test case with n=10^5, then distinct elements up to 10^5. Then the next test cases have n=0? \n\n          So worst-case one test case: 10^5 distinct elements. Then we do a loop of 10^5 per test case? and the total distinct over test cases is 10^5? So overall we do 10^5 iterations? \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            for each test case:\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                from collections import Counter\n                freq = Counter(a)\n                ans = 10**18\n                for count in freq.values():\n                    k = (n + count - 1) // count - 1   # because ceil(n/count) = (n+count-1)//count\n                    total_ops = k + (n - count)\n                    if total_ops < ans:\n                        ans = total_ops\n                print(ans)\n\n        But wait: what if there is an element that appears so frequently that (n+count-1)//count is 1? then k=0? and total_ops = n - count.\n\n        However, consider: \n            [1,1,1] -> count=3, n=3: \n                k = (3+3-1)//3 - 1 = (5)//3 = 1 (integer division) -> 1? then k=1-1=0 -> total_ops=0+0=0 -> correct.\n\n        But what if n=4, count=3:\n            k = ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.33)=2 -> then k_min=2-1=1.\n            Using integer division: (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> then k=2-1=1 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: if n=1, count=1: \n            k = (1+1-1)//1 - 1 = (1)//1 -1 = 1-1=0 -> total_ops=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has negative numbers? The counting is the same.\n\n        However, the example in the note: \n            Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, and for 0: count=2 -> k = (6+2-1)//2 - 1 = (7//2)=3 (in integer division) -> 3-1=2, then total_ops=2+4=6 -> correct.\n\n        But the example also says: \n            \"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\"\n\n            Then they did swaps? and then cloned again? and then more swaps? and got 6 operations.\n\n        However, the problem says: minimal number of operations. Our formula gives 6 for that test case.\n\n        But wait: the example also says: \n            \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array\"\n\n            Then they did: \n                [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> then they cloned the first array -> then swapped again.\n\n            How many operations? \n                Operation1: clone -> 1 operation (now two copies)\n                Then they did swaps: how many swaps? \n                    They moved two zeros from the second copy to the first? and moved two non-zeros from the first to the second? \n                    Actually, they did 4 swaps? (because they moved two zeros: each swap moves one zero? and each swap moves one non-zero out? so 4 swaps) -> then 1 (clone) + 4 (swaps) = 5 operations? \n                Then they cloned the first array again: operation 6 -> then swapped two more times? \n\n            But the example says 6 operations.\n\n          Actually, the example breaks down the operations:\n\n            Step 0: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (one copy)\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> now two copies: \n                copy1: [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                copy2: [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n\n            Then they swapped: \n                swap the element at position2 in copy1 (which is 1) with the element at position2 in copy2 (which is 1) -> no change? \n                Actually, they swapped: \n                    copy1: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> they got two zeros at the beginning? \n                    How? They must have swapped a zero from copy2 to copy1? \n\n                They say: \n                    [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> but wait, how? \n\n                Actually, they did multiple swaps? \n\n            The example says: \n                After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: \n                    [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] \n\n            How many swaps? \n                We need to move two zeros from the second copy to the first? and then move the non-zeros (the 1 and the 3 at the end) from the first copy to the second? \n\n                That would be 4 swaps: \n                    swap copy1[1] (which is 1) with copy2[0] (which is 0) -> then copy1[1] becomes 0, copy2[0] becomes 1.\n                    swap copy1[5] (which is 0) with copy2[5] (which is 0) -> no change? \n                Actually, they moved two zeros? \n\n                Alternatively, they moved three zeros? \n\n            Actually, the first copy initially has two zeros. They want to have four zeros? So they need two more zeros from the second copy. \n\n            So two swaps: \n                swap copy1[1] (1) with copy2[0] (0) -> then copy1: [0,0,3,3,7,0] (now three zeros) and copy2: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> but then they swapped again: \n                swap copy1[3] (3) with copy2[5] (0) -> then copy1: [0,0,3,0,7,0] -> that's four zeros? but they show [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> that has three zeros? \n\n            Actually, the example result: [0,0,0,3,7,0] -> that has four zeros? (positions0:0, position1:0, position2:0, position5:0) -> that's four zeros? \n\n            So they did two swaps: \n                swap the 1 at copy1[1] with the 0 at copy2[0] -> then copy1[1] becomes 0, and copy2[0] becomes 1 -> then copy1: [0,0,3,3,7,0] (zeros at indices0,1,5 -> three zeros) \n                then swap the 3 at copy1[2] with the 0 at copy2[5] -> then copy1: [0,0,0,3,7,0] (zeros at indices0,1,2,5 -> four zeros) and copy2: [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> but wait, the second swap: we swapped the 3 at copy1[2] with the 0 at copy2[5] -> then copy2[5] becomes 3? \n\n            So two swaps.\n\n            Then they did: \n                Operation 3: clone the first array -> now we have three copies: \n                    copy1: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                    copy2: [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n                    copy3: [0,0,0,3,7,0]\n\n            Then they swapped: \n                They swapped two more times: \n                    swap copy1[3] (3) with copy3[3] (3) -> no change? \n                    Actually, they swapped: \n                    \" [ \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \\underline{0} \\ \\underline{0} \\ 0 \\ ]$, $[ \\ \\underline{3} \\ \\underline{7} \\ 0 \\ 3 \\ 7 \\ 0 \\ ]$ and $[ \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \\ 3 \\ 7 \\ 3 \\ ]$ \"\n\n                How? \n                    They swapped the 3 at copy1[3] with the 0 at copy3[3]? and the 7 at copy1[4] with the 0 at copy3[4]? \n\n                So two swaps.\n\n            Total operations: \n                clone1: 1\n                swap1: 1\n                swap2: 2\n                clone2: 3\n                swap3: 4\n                swap4: 5? \n\n            But the example says 6 operations? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"Finally, we made a copy where all elements are equal and made 6 operations.\"\n\n            So 6 operations.\n\n            How? \n                Operation1: clone -> 1\n                Operation2: swap -> 2\n                Operation3: swap -> 3\n                Operation4: clone -> 4\n                Operation5: swap -> 5\n                Operation6: swap -> 6\n\n            So 6 operations.\n\n            Therefore, the total operations for the example is 6.\n\n          So our formula gives 6.\n\n        But wait: why did we count 2 (clones) and 4 (swaps) = 6? \n\n          The formula: \n            clones: k = ceil(6/2)-1 = 2\n            swaps: n - f(x) = 6-2 = 4\n            total = 6.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n          We are given: \n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:   # this skips the first two lines? Actually, the input: \n                # first line: t\n                # then for each test case: \n                #   first line: n\n                #   second line: the array\n                # so [2::2] means: starting from index2 (which is the third line) and then every two lines -> so we get the array lines.\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split())   # a is the line of the array, we split and then n is the length? but the array has n integers, so this is correct.\n\n            m = max(Counter(a).values())   # but wait: we are using the string representation? the array elements are given as strings? and we are counting by string? but the array might have negative numbers? and the input is split into strings. \n\n            However, the problem says: the array elements are integers. But the input is as string. \n\n            But note: the same integer in string form is the same? but negative numbers: e.g., \"-1\" is a string. \n\n            However, the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the string representation is ['0','1','3','3','7','0'].\n\n            But what if we have negative? e.g., ['-1','-1','2'] -> then the frequency of '-1' is 2.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            But then: \n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then print(r)\n\n          What is this loop? \n\n          The current code sets m = max frequency. Then if m==n, then we skip the loop and print 0.\n\n          But if m<n, then we enter the loop. \n\n          How do we compute the answer? \n\n          We have: \n            total_ops = k + (n - m)   [if we choose the element with max frequency? but note: we are using m which is the max frequency, and we are going to use that element? because it minimizes the expression?]\n\n          However, the problem: we must choose the element that minimizes the expression. But the code uses m = max frequency. Is that sufficient? \n\n          We argued that the element with the maximum frequency minimizes the expression? \n\n          But wait: \n            total_ops = ceil(n/f(x))-1 + (n-f(x))\n\n          And we want to minimize that. \n\n          Why is the element with the maximum frequency the best? \n\n          Consider: \n            Let f1 > f2.\n            total_ops1 = ceil(n/f1)-1 + (n-f1)\n            total_ops2 = ceil(n/f2)-1 + (n-f2)\n\n          Since f1>f2, then n-f1 < n-f2 -> the second term is smaller for f1.\n\n          Also, ceil(n/f1) <= ceil(n/f2) because f1>f2 -> n/f1 < n/f2 -> so ceil(n/f1) <= ceil(n/f2). Therefore, the first term is also smaller for f1.\n\n          Therefore, the element with the maximum frequency minimizes the expression.\n\n          So we can use m = max frequency.\n\n          Then the total operations = ceil(n/m)-1 + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the code has a while loop? \n\n          The current code:\n\n            r=0\n            while m<n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          How can we use a while loop? \n\n          Actually, we don't need a loop? we can compute directly.\n\n          But the code structure: \n            It sets r=0, and then in the while loop, it does something until m>=n? \n\n          How does the process work? \n\n          Alternate approach (from known solutions to this problem):\n\n          Known solution in C++ for the same problem (from a contest):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n                cin.tie(nullptr);\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    vector<int> a(n);\n                    map<int, int> cnt;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                        cnt[a[i]]++;\n                    }\n                    int max_cnt = 0;\n                    for (auto i : cnt) {\n                        max_cnt = max(max_cnt, i.second);\n                    }\n                    int ans = 0;\n                    while (max_cnt < n) {\n                        ans++;\n                        int d = min(n - max_cnt, max_cnt);\n                        ans += d;\n                        max_cnt += d;\n                    }\n                    cout << ans << '\\n';\n                }\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n          Explanation of the known solution:\n\n            We start with max_cnt = m (the maximum frequency).\n\n            Then while max_cnt < n:\n                ans++   -> that's one clone operation? \n                Then we do d = min(n - max_cnt, max_cnt) -> that's the number of swaps we can do in this step? \n                Then ans += d -> so we add d swaps.\n                Then max_cnt += d -> because by swapping, we can add d more copies of the element? \n\n            How? \n              After cloning, we have one more copy. Then we can swap up to max_cnt elements from the new clone to the target? because the new clone has max_cnt copies of the element? \n\n              Actually, we can swap up to min(max_cnt, n - max_cnt) because we only need n - max_cnt more in the target.\n\n            Then we update: \n                max_cnt becomes max_cnt + min(max_cnt, n - max_cnt)\n\n            Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2.\n\n            Step1: \n                m=2 < 6 -> \n                    ans=1 (for the clone) \n                    d = min(6-2, 2)=2\n                    ans +=2 -> ans=3\n                    m = 2+2 = 4.\n\n            Step2: \n                m=4 < 6 -> \n                    ans=4 (after clone: 3+1=4)\n                    d = min(6-4,4)=2\n                    ans=4+2=6\n                    m=4+2=6 -> break.\n\n            Then output 6.\n\n          Why is this the same as our formula? \n            Our formula: ceil(6/2)-1 + (6-2) = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n          How does the known solution work?\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> now two copies. Then we can swap up to 2 elements (because we have 2 of the element in the new clone) to the target? so we get 2 more in the target? then the target now has 2+2=4.\n\n            Then Operation 2: we clone again? -> now three copies. Then we can swap up to min(2, 6-4)=2? because the new clone has 4? Actually, no: the new clone is a clone of the current state? \n\n            But note: when we clone, we clone the current state of one array. Initially, we have two arrays: the target has 4 of the element? and the other arrays have the rest? \n\n            Actually, after the first clone and swaps, we have:\n                Target: 4 of the element.\n                The other copies: the rest? \n\n            Then when we clone again, we can clone the target? then we get a new copy with 4 of the element. Then we can swap 2 of them to the target? so the target becomes 4+2=6.\n\n            Operations: \n                Operation1: clone -> 1\n                Operation2: swap1 -> 2\n                Operation3: swap2 -> 3\n                Operation4: clone -> 4\n                Operation5: swap1 -> 5\n                Operation6: swap2 -> 6\n\n            So 6 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the known solution is:\n\n            ans = 0\n            while m < n:\n                ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n                # How many swaps can we do? we can swap up to m (because the new clone has m copies of the element) but we only need n-m more.\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                ans += d   # for the d swaps\n                m += d\n\n          Then print(ans)\n\n          This matches the known solution.\n\n          Why is this equivalent to our formula? \n            Our formula: ceil(n/m0)-1 + (n-m0)   [where m0 is the initial max frequency] \n            But the known solution does iterative steps.\n\n          Actually, the known solution is iterative and we are not sure if it is the same? \n\n          Let me test with n=4, m0=1:\n\n            Our formula: \n                ceil(4/1)-1 + (4-1) = 4-1+3 = 6.\n\n            Known solution:\n                Step1: m=1 -> \n                    ans=1 (clone) \n                    d = min(1,3)=1 -> ans=2, m=2.\n                Step2: m=2 -> \n                    ans=3 (clone) \n                    d = min(2,2)=2 -> ans=5, m=4 -> break.\n                Output 5.\n\n          But 5 != 6.\n\n          What is the correct minimal operations for [1,2,3,4]? \n\n            We want to make one copy with all 1's? \n\n            Step0: [1,2,3,4] (target)\n\n            Operation1: clone -> two copies: \n                copy1: [1,2,3,4]\n                copy2: [1,2,3,4]\n\n            Operation2: swap copy1[1] (2) with copy2[0] (1) -> \n                copy1: [1,1,3,4]\n                copy2: [2,2,3,4]\n\n            Operation3: swap copy1[2] (3) with copy2[0] (2) -> \n                copy1: [1,1,2,4] -> not all 1's.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> two copies.\n\n            Then we need to get three more 1's? \n\n            Operation2: swap copy1[1] (2) with copy2[0] (1) -> copy1: [1,1,3,4], copy2: [2,2,3,4]\n            Operation3: swap copy1[2] (3) with copy2[1] (2) -> copy1: [1,1,2,4] -> not working.\n\n            How about:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> two copies.\n\n            Operation2: swap copy1[1] (2) with copy2[0] (1) -> copy1: [1,1,3,4], copy2: [2,2,3,4]\n            Operation3: swap copy1[2] (3) with copy2[0] (2) -> copy1: [1,1,2,4], copy2: [3,2,3,4] -> not helping.\n\n            Operation4: clone again -> three copies: \n                copy1: [1,1,2,4]\n                copy2: [3,2,3,4]\n                copy3: [1,1,2,4]   (clone of copy1)\n\n            Operation5: swap copy1[3] (4) with copy3[0] (1) -> copy1: [1,1,2,1] -> that's three 1's? \n            But we need four 1's.\n\n            Operation6: swap copy1[2] (2) with copy3[1] (1) -> copy1: [1,1,1,1] -> done.\n\n            So 6 operations.\n\n          Therefore, our formula gives 6, and the known solution we tested for n=4, m0=1 gives 5? which is not matching.\n\n          But wait, the known solution I wrote above is from a contest?

How to do it in 5?\n\n          Alternate for [1,2,3,4] (with m0=1) using 5 operations:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> two copies: \n                A: [1,2,3,4]\n                B: [1,2,3,4]\n\n            Operation2: swap A[1] and B[0] -> \n                A: [1,1,3,4]   (we have two 1's in A)\n                B: [2,2,3,4]\n\n            Operation3: clone A -> \n                A: [1,1,3,4]\n                B: [2,2,3,4]\n                C: [1,1,3,4]\n\n            Operation4: swap A[2] and C[0] -> \n                A: [1,1,1,4]\n                C: [3,1,3,4]\n\n            Operation5: swap A[3] and C[1] (which is 1) -> \n                A: [1,1,1,1] -> done.\n\n            But wait, operation5: we swap A[3] (4) with C[1] (1) -> then A[3] becomes 1, and C[1] becomes 4 -> so A becomes [1,1,1,1] and C becomes [3,4,3,4]. \n\n            So 5 operations: \n                Operation1: clone\n                Operation2: swap\n                Operation3: clone\n                Operation4: swap\n                Operation5: swap\n\n            That's 5 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the iterative method is correct.\n\n          Why did our formula give 6? \n            Our formula: ceil(4/1)-1 + (4-1) = 3+3=6.\n\n          But the minimal is 5.\n\n          Therefore, the iterative method is the intended solution.\n\n          How to reconcile? \n\n          The formula we derived: \n              total_ops = ceil(n/m0)-1 + (n-m0)\n\n          is not correct for m0=1.\n\n          Why? \n            The formula assumed that we do all the clone operations first and then the swaps. But the iterative method interleaves clones and swaps.\n\n          Therefore, we must use the iterative method.\n\n          So for program2.py, we complete the while loop:\n\n            r=0\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1   # for the clone operation\n                # Then we can swap up to m elements from the new clone to the target? but we only need n-m more.\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += d   # for the d swaps\n                m += d   # we get d more in the target\n\n          Then print(r)\n\n          But note: the initial m is the max frequency.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n          However, the code already has the while loop condition: while m<n.\n\n          So we put the three lines inside the loop.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=10^5, and the while loop: each iteration at least doubles m? so the number of iterations per test case is O(log(n)). And the sum of n is 10^5, so the total iterations over test cases is O(10^5 * log(10^5))? which is acceptable.\n\n        Example: \n            n=10^5, m0=1: \n                iteration1: m=1 -> d=min(1,99999)=1 -> m becomes 2, operations: 1+1=2.\n                iteration2: m=2 -> d=min(2,99998)=2 -> m becomes 4, operations: 2+2=4 (total=6)\n                iteration3: m=4 -> d=4 -> m becomes 8, total operations=6+1+4=11\n                ... until m>=n: about 17 iterations.\n\n        So it's efficient.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the variable m is the current max frequency (which we update). And n is fixed.\n\n        However, the code: \n            n=len(a:=a.split())   # this is the length of the array? \n            m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n        Then we do the while loop.\n\n        But note: the array a is a list of strings? and we are counting the frequency of the string representation? which is correct.\n\n        But what if there are negative numbers? the string representation of -1 and 1 are different? but that's correct.\n\n        Therefore, we complete program2.py with the three lines.\n\n        However, the code in the problem has: \n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must be careful: the variable n is the length of the array? and m is the max frequency.\n\n        So the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we update m to m+d, and d is at least 1? so it will terminate.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for program1.py is: \n            \"program1\": \"dic1[S[0]] = 1\"\n\n        And for program2.py:\n            \"program2\": \"r += 1\\nd = min(m, n - m)\\nr += d\\nm += d\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: output only the missing code, and in the specified format.\n\n        We output as a json string.\n\n        However, the missing code for program1.py is only one line? and for program2.py is three lines? \n\n        But the TODO in program1.py is in the else block? and the TODO in program2.py is in the while loop.\n\n        We write the exact code.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing line is: \n            dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\n        For program2.py, the missing block is:\n            r += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the code for program2.py is in a while loop, so we indent.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that should be placed in the TODO, with the same indentation? \n\n        The existing code in program2.py for the while loop has 4-space indentation? \n\n        We assume the same.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"dic1[S[0]] = 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"    r += 1\\n    d = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += d\\n    m += d\"\n        }\n\n        But wait: the program2.py code has the while loop already, and the TODO is inside. We are to replace the TODO with the block. The TODO is at the same indentation level as the while loop body? \n\n        The existing code: \n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to put the block of code at the same indentation level as the while loop body? \n\n        The while loop body should be indented. The current TODO is in the same line as the while. We need to break it.\n\n        Actually, the code is:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the comment with the block? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block that should be in the body of the while loop.\n\n        The body of the while loop should be:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r += 1\n                d = min(m, n - m)\n                r += d\n                m += d\n\n        But the existing code has the while loop condition and then a comment. We are to replace the comment with the block? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code\", so we assume that the while loop body is missing and we provide the body.\n\n        Therefore, we output the four lines (with 4-space indentation) for the body.\n\n        But note: the existing code has the while loop condition and then a comment. We are to remove the comment and put the block.\n\n        So the missing block for program2.py is the body of the while loop.\n\n        We output:\n\n            \"program2\": \"r += 1\\nd = min(m, n - m)\\nr += d\\nm += d\"\n\n        without any extra indentation? But the while loop body must be indented. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that would be placed.\n\n        Since the while loop is already there, we only need the body. The body should be indented. \n\n        How many spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n        We'll use 4 spaces for each line of the body.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    r += 1\\n    d = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += d\\n    m += d\"\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is written as \"while m<n:\" and then the body must be indented. The existing code has the comment at the same line? \n\n        We are replacing the entire body? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is in the same line. We are to write the body in the next lines? \n\n        The intended structure:\n\n            while m < n:\n                ...   # body\n\n        So we write the body as four lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have:\n\n            while m<n:   # TODO: Your code here\n\n        and we are to replace the comment with the body? but the body is multiple lines. \n\n        We must break the line and then put the body.\n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block.\n\n        We output the four lines with 4-space indentation.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer.\n\n        Let me write the json:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"dic1[S[0]] = 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"    r += 1\\n    d = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += d\\n    m += d\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program2.py code has the while loop condition and then a comment. We are replacing the comment with the body? \n\n        Actually, the body should be:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(m, n - m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        and these lines should be indented under the while.\n\n        So we output the string with each line starting with 4 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output without specifying the indentation? but the problem says \"exact\".\n\n        Since the existing code uses 4-space indentation, we use 4 spaces.\n\n        We are done."
