Our conditions:\n  rating>=1900 -> division1\n  else if rating>=1600 -> then it's at least 1600 and less than 1900 -> division2\n  else if rating>=1400 -> then at least 1400 and less than 1600 -> division3\n  else -> division4\n\nThis matches. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n  for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n      r = int(n)\n      if r >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif r >= 1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif r >= 1400:\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the input can be negative? Our conditions: \n  For negative, they will fall into the else -> division4, which is correct because division4 is rating<=1399, and negative is <=1399. So we are good.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n and q. Then a list of n prices.\nWe sort the prices in descending order and build a prefix sum array 'a' such that:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = p0 (the largest price)\n  a[2] = p0 + p1\n  ... \n  a[i] = sum of the i largest prices.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free.\nThe customer can choose which items to buy. To maximize the free value, the customer would want to have the y free items to be as expensive as possible. However, note that the free items are the cheapest among the purchased ones.\n\nSo the strategy: the customer must buy exactly x items (because buying more might force the free items to be even cheaper? but note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we can buy more? However, the problem also says that the free items are the y cheapest of the purchased items. To maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest to be as expensive as possible. How can we do that? We can choose which items to buy.\n\nBut note: if we buy more than x items, then the free items are the y cheapest of the entire purchase. However, we are allowed to choose any set. The best is to choose a set that has y expensive items that we can get for free, but note that the free items must be the cheapest in the set. Therefore, we cannot have a free item that is more expensive than a paid one.\n\nActually, the optimal strategy is to choose a set of exactly x items? Why? Because if we choose more than x, then we are including some cheaper items that might push the y cheapest to be cheaper. However, we can avoid that? Let me think:\n\nSuppose we choose a set S of size >= x. The free items are the y cheapest in S. To maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest to be as expensive as possible. Therefore, we want to avoid including very cheap items. In fact, the best is to choose the x largest items? But then the y cheapest among these x items would be the last y of the sorted (in increasing order) of these x. Alternatively, we can choose more than x? But if we choose more, we might have to include some items that are cheaper than the smallest in the top x, which would then become the free items? Actually, no: because we can choose arbitrarily. However, note that if we choose more than x, then the free items are the y cheapest, which might be even cheaper than the y cheapest in the top x? So it's better to choose exactly x.\n\nBut wait: what if we choose x+1? Then the free items are the y cheapest of the x+1. The y cheapest of x+1 might be more expensive than the y cheapest of x? Actually, no: because the set of x+1 would include the top x and one more item that is cheaper than the top x. Then the y cheapest would be the y-1 cheapest of the top x and the new added item? So the free value would be the sum of the y-1 smallest in the top x plus the new added item. This is less than the sum of the y smallest in the top x? Because the new added item is cheaper than the smallest in the top x? So it's worse.\n\nTherefore, the optimal is to choose exactly x items. And to maximize the free value, we choose the x largest items. Then the free items are the y smallest in this set. But note: the set of the x largest items, when sorted in increasing order, are the last x in the sorted array (if we sorted the entire array in increasing order). However, we built the prefix sum array from the sorted array in descending order.\n\nActually, we have:\n  We sorted the prices in descending order: so the array is [largest, ..., smallest]?\n  But note: we did: sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1] -> that sorts in increasing order and then reverses -> so descending.\n\nThen we built a prefix sum array for the descending sorted array. So:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = largest\n  a[2] = largest + second largest\n  ...\n\nNow, if we choose the top x items (the x largest), then the free items are the y smallest in this set. But note: in the set of the top x, the smallest items are the last ones in the descending order? Actually, the set of top x in descending order: [v0, v1, ..., v_{x-1}] where v0>=v1>=...>=v_{x-1}. The y smallest in this set are the last y: v_{x-y}, v_{x-y+1}, ..., v_{x-1}. But note: in the descending array, the last y are the smallest.\n\nHow do we compute the sum of the y smallest in the top x? \n  Total sum of the top x is a[x] (because our prefix array a has a[0]=0, a[1]=v0, a[2]=v0+v1, ... a[x]=v0+...+v_{x-1}).\n  The sum of the largest (x-y) items in the set is a[x-y] (because we take the first x-y from the descending array: the largest ones).\n  Then the free items sum = total sum - sum of the largest (x-y) = a[x] - a[x-y].\n\nBut wait: let me check with the example: \n  Example: [5,3,5] -> but note the example input: \n      Input: n=5, q=3, prices = [1,2,3,5,5]\n      Query: x=3, y=2 -> free value = 3+5 = 8? But note: the example says 8.\n\n  How do we process?\n    Sort the prices: [1,2,3,5,5] -> then reverse: [5,5,3,2,1]\n    Build prefix: \n        a[0]=0\n        a[1]=5\n        a[2]=5+5=10\n        a[3]=10+3=13\n        a[4]=13+2=15\n        a[5]=15+1=16\n\n    For x=3, y=2: we take the top 3: [5,5,3] -> free items: the 2 smallest: 5 and 3? But wait, the two smallest in [5,5,3] are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But note: 5 is not the smallest? The smallest is 3, then the next smallest is 5? So the free items are 3 and 5? Then the sum is 8.\n\n    How to compute: \n        total = a[3] = 13\n        we subtract the top (x-y) = 1 item: a[1] = 5 -> then free = 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n  Another example: x=2, y=1 -> free value = 5? \n        total = a[2]=10\n        subtract the top (2-1)=1: a[1]=5 -> free = 5 -> correct.\n\n  Third example: x=5, y=3 -> free value = 1+2+3=6.\n        total = a[5]=16\n        subtract the top (5-3)=2: a[2]=10 -> free = 6 -> correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer for a query (x,y) is: a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: our prefix array a is built for indices 0..n. We have a[0]=0, a[1] for the first, ... a[n] for the entire array.\n\nSo in the loop for each query, we do:\n  x, y = map(int, input().split())\n  print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nHowever, note: the array a has length n+1? Yes, because we started with a=[0] and then we appended n elements.\n\nBut what if x-y is negative? The problem states: y>=1 and x>=y, so x-y>=0.\n\nBut note: we built the prefix array for the entire array of n items. What if x>n? The problem says x<=n (because x<=n, as per input: x_i<=n). So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n  for each query, read x and y, then compute a[x] - a[x-y] and print it.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the customer must purchase at least x items. We assumed that we take exactly x. Why is that optimal? Because if we take more, then the free items are the y cheapest of the entire set, which might be cheaper than the y cheapest in the top x? As argued above, it is not beneficial to take more. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, what if we take less than x? Then we don't get any free items? But the condition is \"at least x\", so we must take at least x. So we take exactly x.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n  for _ in range(q):\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the current code has:\n  for _ in[0]*q:\n\nSo we can write:\n  for _ in [0]*q:\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nHowever, note: the array 'a' we built is for the entire array of n items. We built it for indices 0..n. But what if the query has x that is greater than the current length? Actually, we built the array for all n items. And the problem says x<=n. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the array 'a' we built has n+1 elements (from 0 to n). So a[x] is defined for x in [0, n]. And x-y is in [0, x] and since x<=n, then x-y is in [0, n]. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what if x-y is negative? The problem says y<=x, so x-y>=0.\n\nSo the code for program1.py is complete.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are to read t test cases. The first line is t, then t lines each with a rating.\n\nWe need to output the division for each rating.\n\nThe divisions:\n  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nWe can do:\n\n  for each test case (skip the first line which is the count, so we use [1:]):\n      rating = int(n)   # because n is a string from the open(0)\n\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif rating >= 1600:   # then it must be between 1600 and 1899 (because if it were >=1900, we would have taken the first branch)\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif rating >= 1400:   # then between 1400 and 1599\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says:\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> so if rating is 1600, it's division 2, and if 1899 also division 2.\n\nOur conditions:\n  rating>=1900 -> division1\n  else if rating>=1600 -> then it's at least 1600 and less than 1900 -> division2\n  else if rating>=1400 -> then at least 1400 and less than 1600 -> division3\n  else -> division4\n\nThis matches.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n  for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n      r = int(n)\n      if r >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif r >= 1600:\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif r >= 1400:\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the input can be negative? Our conditions: \n  For negative, they will fall into the else -> division4, which is correct because division4 is rating<=1399, and negative is <=1399.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code for both programs in the specified JSON format.\n\nNote: The problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nWe must be cautious about the exact code that is missing.\n\nIn program1.py, the existing code is:\n\n  n,q=map(int,input().split())\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:a+=a[-1]+x,\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to complete the for loop for the queries.\n\nIn program2.py, the existing code is:\n\n  for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to complete the for loop body.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the body of the for loop for the queries.\n\nThe missing code for program2.py is the body of the for loop for the test cases.\n\nWe output:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation. In program1.py, the existing for loop is at the same level as the previous lines. We should use 4 spaces per level? The existing code uses 4 spaces.\n\nIn the given program1.py, the for loop is written as:\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to write the body with one level of indentation (4 spaces). Similarly for program2.py.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that would be inserted.\n\nBut note: the entire program1.py and program2.py are provided with the missing part marked by a TODO. We are to replace the TODO with the code.\n\nIn program1.py, the missing part is the entire body of the for loop. We write two lines.\n\nIn program2.py, the missing part is the entire body of the for loop.\n\nWe must be cautious: in program1.py, the existing code uses a comma at the end of the line for building the list? That's okay.\n\nLet me write the exact strings:\n\nFor program1: \n  We are replacing the line: \"for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\"\n  with:\n      for _ in[0]*q:\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the existing line has the for loop header. We are only replacing the body. So the body should be two lines, each indented.\n\nBut the existing line has a comment and no body. We are to write the body.\n\nSo the missing code for program1 is the two lines (with proper indentation) that form the body.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the existing line is the for loop header. We are to write the body.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array is named 'a', and we are using the same.\n\nFor program2, the missing code is:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the variable in the for loop is 'n'. We are reading from the open(0) and the first line is skipped. Then each element in the list [*open(0)][1:] is a string that we are calling 'n'. But we are converting it to an integer and storing in r.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n    n = n.strip()   # because it might have a newline? But int can handle it.\n\nBut the example does not do that. Since the input is from open(0) and we are using int(n), it should work.\n\nWe'll output the code as a string in JSON. We must escape the quotes and newlines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the string with newlines and escape the double quotes.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code, and we are to output in the JSON format.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the indentation for the if-else in program2: we are inside the for loop, so the body of the for loop is one level (4 spaces). Then the if-else should be indented one more level (so 4 more spaces). So the entire body of the for loop is:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    ... \n\nSo the first line is 4 spaces, then the if and the rest are 4 spaces for the outer and then 4 more for the inner? Actually, the entire block is the body of the for loop. We can write:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if ...:\n        ...\n    else:\n        ...\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we must match the style. Since the existing code in program1 uses 4 spaces, we use 4 spaces per level.\n\nIn program2, the for loop header is at the top level, so the body should be indented 4 spaces. Then the if-elif-else should be indented 4 spaces (relative to the for) and the print statements inside the if blocks should be indented 8 spaces.\n\nBut in the example, the existing code for program1 has:\n\n  n,q=map(int,input().split())\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:a+=a[-1]+x,\n  for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe last line is at the same indentation as the previous for. So the body of the last for loop should be indented 4 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2, the for loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the code for program2 should be:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the if, elif, else are at the same level as the assignment? So the assignment is 4 spaces, then the if is 4 spaces, and the print inside is 8 spaces.\n\nSo the string for program2 is:\n\n    \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nSimilarly, for program1, the two lines are each indented 4 spaces.\n\nSo:\n\n    \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\nBut note: the existing for loop in program1 is written without a colon? Actually, it has a colon? The existing code: \"for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\" -> the colon is there. So we are writing the body.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as described."
