Actually, Bob eats from the right: first candy from the right: 2, then next: 2, then next: 3 -> total 7.

Now run the algorithm: l = deque([7,3,20,10,8,11,1])\n            a=0, b=0, cur=0, ans=0\n\n            Step1: cur=1 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=1 -> not equal\n            Step2: cur=2 -> a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=7 -> not equal\n            Step3: cur=3 -> a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=1 +11=12 -> not equal\n            Step4: cur=4 -> a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=7+3=10 -> not equal\n            Step5: cur=5 -> a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=10+20=30 -> not equal? (because b=12)\n            Step6: cur=6 -> a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=12+8=20 -> not equal\n            Step7: cur=7 -> a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=20+10=30 -> then a==b -> ans=7\n\n            Then we break. Output 7 -> correct.",

So for program1.py, the missing part is: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n   But note: the code uses a deque. We must pop from the left. However, the provided code has: \n        if a>=b: b += l.pop()   # pop from the right\n        else:\n            # TODO: we need to pop from the left. So we write: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n   But note: the condition in the if is a>=b, and the else is for a<b. That matches. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the variable name is 'l' (which is a deque). We use l.popleft(). But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so using a deque is efficient.",

Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = input().strip()\\n    distinct_chars = set(s)\\n    k = len(distinct_chars)\\n    if k == 1:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        continue\\n    n = len(s)\\n    found = False\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\n        if s[i] == s[i-1]:\\n            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            found = True\\n            break\\n    if found:\\n        continue\\n    if k >= 3:\\n        for i in range(2, n):\\n            if s[i] == s[i-2]:\\n                print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                found = True\\n                break\\n        if found:\\n            continue\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\")\"\n\n          But note: the first line in the for loop for program2 is already indented by 4 spaces (because it is inside the for loop).",

We must output the block with the following indentation:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct_chars = set(s)\n                ... So each line of the block should be at 4 spaces. But the block we are outputting is the entire body. How do we format it?",

Therefore, it is allowed.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses a deque and has a while loop that processes the candies. The current code has a TODO in the else branch.\n\n However, note that the provided code has a flaw: it always adds to Bob (from the right) when a>=b, and then in the else it is missing. Also, the condition for updating the answer is only when a==b, but we are updating the answer with the current count of candies eaten (cur) at that moment.\n\n But note: the problem says that the total number of candies eaten is to be maximized when the two have equal weight.\n\n However, the provided code does:\n   if a>=b: \n        b += l.pop()\n   else:\n        # TODO\n\n We need to complete the else branch. Since when a < b, we should add to Alice from the left.\n\n Also note: the current code uses a deque and we are popping from the right for Bob. For Alice, we should pop from the left.\n\n But the current code does not have a way to pop from the left in the else. Let's fix:\n\n   else:\n        a += l.popleft()\n\n However, we must note: the problem says that the total candies eaten (cur) is incremented at every step. And we are popping one candy at a time.\n\n But wait: the problem has a constraint that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so using a deque and popping from both ends is efficient.\n\n However, the provided code updates the answer only when a==b. But note: it might be that we get multiple equalities? We want the maximum total candies. So we update ans whenever we get an equality, and we are traversing until the deque is empty. The last equality we get might not be the maximum? Actually, we are increasing cur from 0 to n (total candies) and we update ans whenever a==b. But note: we are popping until the deque is empty, and we are updating ans every time we have an equality. However, we want the maximum number of candies eaten when they are equal. But note: if we have an equality at a certain point, that means we have eaten cur candies. Later we might eat more and break the equality? But we are not storing the maximum cur when we have equality. We are just storing the last equality. This is incorrect.\n\n We must change: we want the maximum total candies (i.e., the maximum cur for which a==b). So we should update ans = max(ans, cur) when a==b? But note: the problem says that we cannot skip candies, so they are eating in order. However, the process is: we are allowed to choose arbitrary numbers from the left and right (but contiguous from the ends). The problem is asking for the maximum total candies (so the maximum cur) for which we can have a==b.\n\n The provided algorithm is greedy: it alternates between adding to the smaller side. But is that correct?\n\n Let me think: we have two pointers (or a deque) and we start with a=0, b=0. Then we start eating one candy at a time: we always add to the side that has the smaller current total. This is a known two-pointer approach for this problem (known as \"Candies\" in some contests). However, we must note that we are allowed to choose arbitrary numbers from the ends, but the greedy step-by-step might not capture the optimal sequence? Actually, the known solution is:\n\n   Let left = 0, right = n-1\n   a = 0, b = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a <= b:\n            a += w[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = (left) + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the next index for Alice, so she has eaten left candies, and Bob has eaten (n-1-right) candies.\n\n But note: the provided code uses a deque and pops. Also, the variable cur counts the total candies eaten so far. Since we are popping one candy at a time, cur = (original n) - (remaining size). And when we pop from the left or right, we are effectively moving the pointers.\n\n However, the provided code does:\n        if a>=b: \n            b += l.pop()\n        else:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\n And then if a==b, we set ans = cur.\n\n But note: we are updating cur at the beginning of the loop: we start with cur=0, then at the beginning of the loop we do cur+=1. So when we pop the first candy, cur becomes 1.\n\n The problem: we are updating ans every time we have an equality, but we want the maximum cur. However, the greedy process might have multiple equalities? For example, we might have an equality at cur=2, then later at cur=6. We want the last one? Actually, we want the maximum cur. But note: as we eat more candies, the total cur increases. However, once we have an equality, if we continue, we break the equality? So the last equality we get might not be the one with the maximum cur? Actually, we want the maximum cur for which we have an equality. So we should record the maximum cur we have seen so far when a==b.\n\n But the code currently sets ans = cur every time we have an equality. Then at the end, we print ans. This would give the last equality. However, the last equality might not be the one with the maximum cur? Actually, cur is increasing until we have eaten all candies. But note: we are popping until the deque is empty. The last equality we get is the one with the largest cur? Not necessarily: because after an equality, we might eat more and then break the equality and then never get an equality again? But we want the maximum total candies (cur) for which we have an equality. So we should record the maximum cur we have ever seen when a==b.\n\n However, note: the problem says that we can choose arbitrary numbers from the ends. The greedy process we are doing is: we always add to the side that is currently smaller. This is a valid way to simulate the process? Actually, it is a known solution for the \"Candies\" problem (see problem 1472B or similar). The known solution is:\n\n   ans = 0\n   left = 0\n   a = 0\n   b = 0\n   right = n-1\n   while left <= right:\n        if a <= b:\n            a += arr[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += arr[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the count of candies Alice ate, and Bob ate (n-1-right) candies.\n\n But note: the total candies eaten is left + (n-1-right). And we update ans only when a==b, and we take the last one? Actually, we can update ans = max(ans, left + (n-1-right))? But note: the total candies eaten is increasing as we go? Actually, we are moving from the ends inward, so the total candies eaten is increasing. The last time we have an equality is the maximum total? But consider: we might have an equality at 2 candies and then at 6 candies. The 6 is larger. And then we continue and we might have another equality at 4? That would be less. Actually, the total candies eaten is left + (n-1-right) and as we move, left increases and right decreases, so the total is increasing? Actually, the total is left + (n-1-right) = left + (n-1) - right. Since left increases and right decreases, the total is increasing. Therefore, the last equality we get is the one with the maximum total candies.\n\n However, what if we have an equality at the very end? Then we have eaten all candies. But note: we break when the deque is empty. So the last equality we get is the maximum.\n\n But wait: what if we get an equality at 4 candies, then we eat more and then we get an equality at 6? Then we update ans to 6. Then we eat more and break the equality? Then we don't update again? But the total candies eaten at the last equality was 6, which is the maximum we have seen. However, the problem: we are not storing the maximum, we are storing the last one. And since the total is increasing, the last one is the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the provided code's logic (if we complete the else) is:\n\n   from collections import deque\n   for _ in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        l = deque(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b = 0, 0\n        ans = 0\n        cur = 0\n        while l:\n            cur += 1\n            if a >= b:\n                # then we add to Bob (from the right) to try to catch up with Alice?\n                # but note: if a>=b, then we add to Bob? Actually, we want to add to the smaller side? \n                # But if a>=b, then Bob is the one that is not bigger? Actually, we want to balance: if a>=b, then we add to Bob to try to make b bigger? \n                # But the known solution: if a<=b, we add to Alice. Here the condition is a>=b -> meaning Bob is not bigger? Actually, the condition in the known solution is: if a<=b, then add to Alice. Here, the condition is a>=b: then we add to Bob. That is symmetric? Actually, it's the same: we are adding to the side that is not the bigger one? \n\n                # However, note: the known solution adds to the smaller side. Here, if a>=b, then Bob is the one with the smaller or equal? Then we add to Bob. That is: we are adding to the side that is not the bigger one? Actually, we are adding to the side that is <= the other? \n\n                # But the condition is: if a>=b, then we add to Bob. This is equivalent to: if Bob is not bigger, then we add to Bob. But if Bob is bigger, then we add to Alice? Actually, the else branch: when a < b, then we add to Alice? \n\n                # So the condition is: if a>=b -> Bob is not bigger? Actually, if a>=b, then Bob is less than or equal to Alice. So we add to Bob to try to increase Bob. Similarly, if a < b, then we add to Alice.\n\n                b += l.pop()\n            else:\n                a += l.popleft()\n            if a == b:\n                ans = cur   # because we have eaten cur candies and they are equal.\n        print(ans)\n\n But wait: what if we never have an equality? Then ans remains 0? That matches the third test case.\n\n However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: n=2, weights [1,1]\n   Initially: a=0, b=0, cur=0, l = deque([1,1])\n   Step1: cur=1 -> a>=b (0>=0) -> true -> pop from right: b=1, then check: a==b? 0==1 -> no.\n   Step2: cur=2 -> now l has [1] -> a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> so we go to else: a += l.popleft() -> a=1. Then check: a==b? 1==1 -> yes, so ans=2.\n   Then we break. Output 2 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: n=3, weights [7,3,20]\n   But wait: the second test case in the note: n=3? Actually, the note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> but wait, the example says the answer is 6? Actually, the example says: \"The second test case\" has n=3? Let me check the note: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n   But wait: the example says the candies are [7,3,20]? Actually, the note says: \n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n   So the second test case must be different. The note says: \n        \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n   The input for the second test case: n=3? Actually, the note says: \"the first three candies from the left\" and \"the first three candies from the right\" -> that would be 3+3=6. So the input must be 6 candies? \n\n   The note says: \"For the second test case, ...\" and then the fourth test case is different.\n\n   Actually, the problem statement says: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n   How can the first three from the left and the first three from the right be non overlapping? Only if there are at least 6 candies? \n\n   The input for the second test case: n=6, weights = [1,1,1,1,1,1]? But then the total weight for Alice and Bob would be 3 and 3? \n\n   Actually, the note says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> that would be the leftmost 3 and the rightmost 3. But if there are 6 candies, then the leftmost 3 and the rightmost 3 are disjoint? Only if the candies are arranged in a row and they are numbered from left to right. Then Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats [4,5,6]. Then the total weight for Alice is 1+1+1=3? But the note says 7? \n\n   This is confusing. Let me read the note again: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n   So the weights of the first three from the left must be 7? Then the next three from the right must be 7? \n\n   The example input for the second test case: \n        n=6, weights = [2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2]? \n        Then Alice: [2,1,4] -> 2+1+4=7\n        Bob: [2,2,3] -> 2+2+3=7? But the candies are from left to right: [2,1,4,3,2,2]. The rightmost three: [2,2,3] -> but that is not contiguous from the right? Actually, Bob eats from the right: first candy from the right: 2, then next: 2, then next: 3 -> total 7.\n\n   Now, let's run the algorithm:\n\n        l = deque([2,1,4,3,2,2])\n        a=0, b=0, cur=0, ans=0\n\n        Step1: cur=1 -> a>=b (0>=0) -> true -> pop right: b=2 -> then a!=b -> ans=0\n        Step2: cur=2 -> a=0, b=2 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=2 -> then a==b? 2==2 -> ans=2\n        Step3: cur=3 -> l = [1,4,3,2] -> a=2, b=2 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=2+2=4 -> not equal\n        Step4: cur=4 -> a=2, b=4 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=2+1=3 -> not equal\n        Step5: cur=5 -> a=3, b=4 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=3+4=7 -> not equal\n        Step6: cur=6 -> a=7, b=4 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=4+3=7 -> then a==b? 7==7 -> ans=6\n\n        Then we break. Output 6 -> correct.\n\n   So the algorithm works for the second test case.\n\n   But what about the fourth test case? \n        \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n        This means: total candies eaten = 3 (Alice) + 4 (Bob) = 7.\n\n        The input: n=7, weights = [7,3,20,? ,10,8,11,1] -> wait, 7 candies? Actually, the candies are: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> from the left\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> from the right\n\n        So the entire row: [7,3,20, x, 10,8,11,1] -> but that would be 8 candies? \n\n        Actually, the note says: \"the fourth test case\" and the answer is 7. The input must be 7 candies? \n\n        Let me assume the candies: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> then Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [1,11,8,10] -> 1+11+8+10=30? But Bob eats from the right: first the last candy:1, then next:11, then next:8, then next:10 -> that is 1,11,8,10 -> 30.\n\n        Now run the algorithm:\n\n            l = deque([7,3,20,10,8,11,1])\n            a=0, b=0, cur=0, ans=0\n\n            Step1: cur=1 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=1 -> not equal\n            Step2: cur=2 -> a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=7 -> not equal\n            Step3: cur=3 -> a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=1+11=12 -> not equal\n            Step4: cur=4 -> a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=7+3=10 -> not equal\n            Step5: cur=5 -> a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> else: a += popleft -> a=10+20=30 -> not equal? (because b=12)\n            Step6: cur=6 -> a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=12+8=20 -> not equal\n            Step7: cur=7 -> a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> true -> pop right: b=20+10=30 -> then a==b -> ans=7\n\n            Then we break. Output 7 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing part is: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n   But note: the code uses a deque. We must pop from the left.\n\n   However, the provided code has: \n        if a>=b:\n            b += l.pop()   # pop from the right\n        else:\n            # TODO: we need to pop from the left.\n\n   So we write: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n   But note: the condition in the if is a>=b, and the else is for a<b. That matches.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the variable name is 'l' (which is a deque). We use l.popleft().\n\n   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so using a deque is efficient.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n   The problem: Check if a string s is perfectly balanced: for every substring t and for every two characters u,v in s, the absolute difference between the frequency of u and v in t is at most 1.\n\n   However, note: the condition is for every non-empty substring t and for every pair of characters (u,v) that appear in the entire string s? Actually, the problem says: \"for all possible triplets (t,u,v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\"\n\n   This is a very strong condition.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   Observation: \n        Consider the entire string s: the condition must hold for t = s. Then for every two characters u and v that appear in s, we have |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n        This implies that the entire string s can have at most one character that appears more than the others? Actually, no: because if we have three characters: a, b, c, then we must have:\n            |f(a)-f(b)|<=1, |f(a)-f(c)|<=1, |f(b)-f(c)|<=1.\n\n        This implies that the frequencies of the characters in the entire string can differ by at most 1. But note: the condition is for every substring, not just the entire string.\n\n        However, the note example: \n            \"abc\": entire string: f(a)=1, f(b)=1, f(c)=1 -> satisfies. \n            But also every substring: \n                \"a\": f(a)=1, f(b)=0, f(c)=0 -> |f(a)-f(b)|=1, |f(a)-f(c)|=1, |f(b)-f(c)|=0 -> all <=1 -> ok.\n                \"ab\": f(a)=1, f(b)=1, f(c)=0 -> |f(a)-f(c)|=1, |f(b)-f(c)|=1, |f(a)-f(b)|=0 -> ok.\n                \"aba\": ... \n\n        But what about a string with two distinct characters? \n            Example: \"aba\": \n                entire string: f(a)=2, f(b)=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                substring \"aa\" is not present? Actually, the substring must be contiguous. The contiguous substrings of \"aba\" are: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\". \n                substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? So we don't consider.\n\n        However, the condition is for every contiguous substring.\n\n        Now, consider a substring that has only one distinct character? For example, if we have \"aa\", then for u='a' and v='b' (if 'b' is present in the entire string), then in the substring \"aa\": \n            f('a')=2, f('b')=0 -> |2-0|=2 -> which is >1 -> not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then we cannot have two consecutive same characters? Because the substring \"aa\" would break the condition.\n\n        Similarly, we cannot have two same characters anywhere? Actually, we can have two same characters if they are separated? But consider the substring that is the two same characters and the character in between? \n\n        Actually, if we have \"aba\", then the substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? The contiguous substring must be consecutive. So the two a's are separated by a b: then the contiguous substring that contains both a's is \"aba\", which has two a's and one b -> then |f(a)-f(b)| = |2-1|=1 -> ok. But what about the substring that is the first two: \"ab\": that has one a and one b -> ok. The last two: \"ba\": one b and one a -> ok. The single a's: then for the substring \"a\" (first one): f(a)=1, f(b)=0 -> |1-0|=1 -> ok.\n\n        But what if we have \"aab\": \n            entire string: f(a)=2, f(b)=1 -> ok.\n            substring \"aa\": then for u='a' and v='b': |f(a)-f(b)| = |2-0| = 2 -> not ok.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n        So the necessary condition: the string must not contain two consecutive same characters? \n\n        But what about three distinct characters? \n            Example: \"abc\": \n                substring \"ab\": ok, \"bc\": ok, \"abc\": ok, \"a\": ok, \"b\": ok, \"c\": ok.\n\n            Example: \"abac\": \n                substring \"aa\": in the substring \"aa\" (if we have consecutive a's) -> fails. But in \"abac\", the a's are not consecutive? \n                Actually, the string \"abac\": \n                    contiguous substrings: \n                        \"a\": ok\n                        \"b\": ok\n                        \"a\": ok\n                        \"c\": ok\n                        \"ab\": ok\n                        \"ba\": ok\n                        \"ac\": ok\n                        \"aba\": f(a)=2, f(b)=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok\n                        \"bac\": f(b)=1, f(a)=1, f(c)=1 -> ok\n                        \"abac\": f(a)=2, f(b)=1, f(c)=1 -> |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |1-1|=0 -> ok.\n\n                But wait: is there a substring that has two a's? The entire string has two a's, but they are not consecutive. The substring \"aba\" has two a's? But then we also have a b. The condition: for every pair of characters (u,v) that appear in the entire string, we must have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1. In the substring \"aba\", the characters present in the entire string are 'a','b','c'? But note: the substring \"aba\" does not contain 'c'. The problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\" (the entire string). So we must consider u='a', v='b', and u='a', v='c', and u='b',v='c'. \n\n                For the substring \"aba\": \n                    u='a', v='c': f_t(a)=2, f_t(c)=0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n                Therefore, the string \"abac\" is not perfectly balanced.\n\n        So the condition is very strong.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        Insight: \n          In any substring t, for any two characters u and v that appear in the entire string s, we must have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n          Consider a character u that does not appear in the substring t. Then for any character v that appears in t, we have |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| = |0 - f_t(v)| = f_t(v). Therefore, for every character v that appears in t, we must have f_t(v) <= 1. Why? Because if there is a character v that appears at least twice in t, then for a character u that is in s but not in t, we have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = f_t(v) >=2 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, in any substring t, every character that appears in t must appear at most once? Actually, no: because we can have two different characters each appearing once? Then |1-1|=0. But what if we have three characters? Then we can have each appearing once? Then |1-1|<=1. \n\n          However, the condition also requires that for a character u that is not in t, we must have f_t(v) <= 1 for every v in t. But note: if we have a substring t that contains two different characters, say 'a' and 'b', then for a character 'c' (that is in s but not in t), we require |f_t(a)-f_t(c)| = |1-0|=1 -> ok, and |f_t(b)-f_t(c)|=1 -> ok. \n\n          But what if we have a substring t that contains two of the same character? Then for a character u not in t, we have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |0 - 2| = 2 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, we must have that no substring t contains two of the same character. That is: the entire string s must not have any duplicate character? \n\n          However, consider: if the entire string has distinct characters? Then every substring has distinct characters? Then for any substring t, the frequency of any character in t is either 0 or 1. Then for any two characters u and v: \n                if both are in t: |1-1|=0\n                if one is in t and the other is not: |1-0|=1\n                if both are not in t: |0-0|=0\n\n          So the condition holds.\n\n          But what if the entire string has duplicate characters? Then we must avoid having two same characters in any contiguous substring? But note: if the entire string has a duplicate, then there is a contiguous substring that contains two same characters? Not necessarily: consider \"aba\": the entire string has two a's, but they are not consecutive. However, we saw that the substring \"aba\" fails because of the character 'c' (if present in the entire string) but in \"aba\" the entire string has only 'a' and 'b'. Then for the substring \"aba\", we have:\n                u='a', v='b': |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                and there is no other character.\n\n          But wait: the problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\". So if the entire string has only two characters, then we only consider pairs of these two.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for the substring \"aba\" (with entire string s=\"aba\" having characters {'a','b'}) is satisfied? \n\n          However, we must check every substring. The substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? So we don't have a substring \"aa\". \n\n          But what about the substring that is the two a's? They are not contiguous? Then we cannot form a contiguous substring of two a's. \n\n          However, the condition fails for the substring \"aba\" when we consider u='a' and v='b'? It's 2 and 1 -> 1, which is allowed. \n\n          But what if the entire string has three distinct characters? Then even if the duplicate characters are not consecutive, we might have a substring that contains a duplicate and also does not contain one of the characters? Then the condition fails.\n\n          Example: s = \"abcab\" (which has 'a','b','c') and consider the substring \"aba\" (which is the first three and then the last two? Actually, contiguous substring: \n                \"a\": ok\n                \"b\": ok\n                \"c\": ok\n                \"a\": ok\n                \"b\": ok\n                \"ab\": ok\n                \"bc\": ok\n                \"ca\": ok\n                \"ab\": ok\n                \"abc\": f(a)=1, f(b)=1, f(c)=1 -> ok\n                \"bca\": same -> ok\n                \"cab\": same -> ok\n                \"abca\": f(a)=2, f(b)=1, f(c)=1 -> then for u='a' and v='b': |2-1|=1 -> ok, for u='a' and v='c': |2-1|=1 -> ok, for u='b' and v='c': |1-1|=0 -> ok.\n                \"bcab\": same -> ok\n                \"abcab\": f(a)=2, f(b)=2, f(c)=1 -> |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |2-2|=0 -> ok.\n\n          But wait: what about the substring \"aba\" (which is the first, second, and fourth? but contiguous? The contiguous substring of length 3 starting at index0: \"abc\", then at index1: \"bca\", index2: \"cab\", index3: \"aba\"? \n                substring \"aba\" (from index3? Actually, if we take indices 0,1,3: that is not contiguous? Contiguous means consecutive indices.\n\n          Therefore, the contiguous substring \"aba\" would be: \n                starting at index0: \"a\"\n                index1: \"b\"\n                index2: \"c\"\n                index3: \"a\"\n                index4: \"b\"\n                then length2: \n                    index0-1: \"ab\"\n                    index1-2: \"bc\"\n                    index2-3: \"ca\"\n                    index3-4: \"ab\"\n                length3:\n                    index0-2: \"abc\"\n                    index1-3: \"bca\"\n                    index2-4: \"cab\"\n                length4:\n                    index0-3: \"abca\"\n                    index1-4: \"bcab\"\n                length5: \"abcab\"\n\n          So there is no contiguous substring \"aba\" (with the two a's separated) in \"abcab\". \n\n          Therefore, the condition for the entire string \"abcab\" is satisfied? \n\n          But note: the problem says: the entire string s has characters 'a','b','c'. Now consider the substring \"abca\" (which is contiguous). In this substring, the frequency of 'a' is 2, 'b'=1, 'c'=1. Then for u='a' and v='c': |2-1|=1 -> ok. \n\n          However, what if we have a substring that has two a's and does not contain one of the characters? For example, if the entire string has three characters, then we must have every substring that contains two a's must also contain the third character? \n\n          Actually, the condition: for every substring t and for every pair (u,v) of characters that appear in the entire string s, we require |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n          Therefore, if a substring t does not contain a particular character (say 'c'), then for u='a' and v='c': |f_t(a) - f_t(c)| = |f_t(a) - 0| = f_t(a). Therefore, we must have f_t(a)<=1. Similarly, if t does not contain 'c', then every character that appears in t must appear at most once.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot have a substring that has two a's and does not contain 'c'. \n\n          How to enforce? \n\n          The string must be such that between two occurrences of the same character, all the characters that appear in the entire string must appear? \n\n          Actually, that is too strong? \n\n          Alternatively, note that the condition is very strong and the known solution is: \n                The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it does not contain any of the following as a contiguous substring:\n                    \"aa\", \"aba\", \"abb\", \"abcab\", ...? \n\n          But the constraints: the total length of all strings is at most 200,000. We cannot check every substring.\n\n          Known fact: This problem appeared in a contest and the solution is that the string is perfectly balanced if and only if for every contiguous substring of length at most the size of the alphabet (or maybe 26) the condition holds? But the problem says the total |s| over test cases is 200,000, but the length of each string can be up to 200,000? \n\n          Actually, the note: \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do O(n) per test case? \n\n          However, the condition must be checked for every substring? That is O(n^2) which is too high.\n\n          Insight from known problems: \n            The condition fails if and only if there exists a contiguous substring t and two characters u, v (that appear in s) such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>1.\n\n          But note: the condition also fails if there is a contiguous substring t that has a character repeated and that does not contain at least one character from the entire set of distinct characters? \n\n          Actually, we can break the condition in two cases:\n            Case 1: There is a contiguous substring t that has a character u repeated twice and that does not contain a character v (that is present in the entire string). Then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n            Case 2: There is a contiguous substring t that has three characters: u, v, w, and the frequencies are such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>1? But note: if the substring contains all the characters, then the frequencies might be unbalanced? \n\n          However, the condition must hold for every pair. So if the entire string has k distinct characters, then in any contiguous substring t, the frequencies of the characters must be as balanced as possible: the maximum frequency and the minimum frequency (among the characters that appear in the entire string) must differ by at most 1? But note: the condition is for every pair, so the entire set of frequencies must be within 1.\n\n          Therefore, the frequencies in t must be either all equal, or two consecutive integers? \n\n          But note: the condition does not require that the frequencies of the characters that are not in t are considered? Actually, it is: for every pair (u,v) of characters that appear in the entire string s, we require |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1. \n\n          Therefore, if the entire string has k distinct characters, then in the substring t, the frequencies of the k characters must be either all equal, or one of them is one more than the others? But wait: if k=3, then we can have (1,1,1) or (2,1,1) but not (2,1,0) because then the character with 0 would break the condition with the one with 2: |2-0|=2.\n\n          Therefore, the substring t must contain every character that appears in the entire string? \n\n          Then the condition becomes: every contiguous substring t must contain every distinct character of s? \n\n          But that is impossible unless the entire string has only one distinct character? \n\n          Actually, if the entire string has two distinct characters, then every contiguous substring must contain both? Then we cannot have a substring of length 1? But the condition: for a substring of length 1, we have one character and the other is absent -> then |1-0|=1 -> allowed. \n\n          So the condition for a substring of length 1: it is allowed to have one character? \n\n          Therefore, the condition does not require that the substring t contains every distinct character? \n\n          But then we have: \n            For a substring t that does not contain a character v, then for any character u that is in t, we must have f_t(u) <= 1? (because |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = f_t(u) must be <=1, and since v is absent, f_t(v)=0). \n\n          Therefore, the condition for a substring t that does not contain v is: every character that appears in t must appear exactly once? \n\n          So the substring t must be composed of distinct characters? \n\n          But note: if the substring t has two distinct characters, that is allowed? Because then for a character v not in t: \n                for a character u in t: f_t(u)=1 -> |1-0|=1 -> allowed.\n\n          And for two characters u1 and u2 in t: |1-1|=0 -> allowed.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: \n            For every contiguous substring t of s, the substring t must be such that:\n                - If t contains a character u, then the frequency of u in t is 1? \n                - But wait: what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then the substring t can have multiple u's? \n                    Example: s=\"aaa\". \n                    Then the entire string has only 'a'. \n                    Then for any substring t: \n                         for u='a', v='a': |f_t(a)-f_t(a)|=0 -> ok.\n                    But note: the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\" -> so we only consider u='a' and v='a'. \n                    So it is allowed? \n\n          Therefore, we can have multiple same characters if the entire string has only one distinct character? \n\n          But then consider a substring of two a's: \n                t=\"aa\": \n                    for u='a', v='a': |2-2|=0 -> ok.\n                and there is no other character.\n\n          So it is allowed.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for a substring t:\n            - If the entire string has only one distinct character, then there is no restriction (any frequency is allowed) because the only pair is (u,u) and |f_t(u)-f_t(u)|=0.\n            - If the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then in any contiguous substring t, no character can appear more than once? \n\n          But wait: what if the entire string has two distinct characters, and we have a substring \"aba\": \n                f(a)=2, f(b)=1 -> then for u='a', v='b': |2-1|=1 -> allowed.\n                and there is no other character.\n\n          So it is allowed? \n\n          However, we must also consider: the substring \"aa\" is not allowed? Because then for v='b' (which is present in the entire string), we have |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |2-0|=2 -> not allowed.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot have two consecutive a's? \n\n          But what if the two a's are not consecutive? Then the substring that contains the two a's and the b in between is allowed? \n\n          However, the condition requires that for every contiguous substring. The contiguous substring that is the two a's (if they are not consecutive) is not contiguous? So we don't have a contiguous substring of two a's? \n\n          But we do have a contiguous substring that is the entire \"aba\", which is allowed. \n\n          However, we also have the contiguous substring that is the first a and the b: \"ab\" -> allowed, and the b and the last a: \"ba\" -> allowed, and the first a alone: allowed, the b alone: allowed, the last a alone: allowed.\n\n          But what if the entire string has three distinct characters? Then in the substring \"aba\", we have two a's and one b, but the entire string has a third character 'c'. Then in the substring \"aba\", we have f(c)=0. Then for u='a' and v='c': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n          So the necessary and sufficient condition: \n            Let k = number of distinct characters in s.\n            - If k==1: then the string is perfectly balanced.\n            - If k>=2: then \n                  (a) The string must not contain two consecutive identical characters? -> because \"aa\" would fail (if there is at least two distinct characters, then in the substring \"aa\", we have for any other character v (which is present in s) we have |2-0|=2).\n                  (b) The string must not contain a contiguous substring of the form \"aba\" if k>=3? Actually, no: because even if the two a's are not consecutive, if there is a third character, then the substring that contains the two a's and the b in between will be missing the third character? \n\n          Actually, condition (a) is a special case of a more general condition: \n            The string must not contain any contiguous substring that has a duplicate character and that does not contain all the distinct characters of s.\n\n          But how to check this efficiently? \n\n          Given the constraint that the total length is 200,000, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the distinct characters in s. Let k = len(set(s))\n\n            Step 2: If k==1: return \"YES\"\n\n            Step 3: Check for duplicate consecutive characters: \n                for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                    if s[i]==s[i-1]:\n                        return \"NO\"\n\n            But that is not enough: because we also need to check for the condition that in any contiguous substring that has a duplicate (non consecutive) and that does not contain all distinct characters, the condition fails.\n\n          However, note: if there are no consecutive duplicates, then the string is an alternation of characters. But we might have a duplicate that is separated by one or more characters.\n\n          But then consider: \n            s = \"abcab\" (k=3) -> we have two a's and two b's. \n            We need to check: is there a contiguous substring that has a duplicate and that does not contain one of the distinct characters? \n\n            The contiguous substring \"abca\": \n                contains 'a','b','c' -> all distinct characters? Then the condition: \n                    f(a)=2, f(b)=1, f(c)=1 -> then for any pair: |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |1-1|=0 -> ok.\n\n            But wait: the condition requires that for every pair of characters in the entire string, the difference is at most 1. In \"abca\", we have all the characters, so it's ok.\n\n            Now consider a contiguous substring that has a duplicate and that does not contain one of the distinct characters? \n                Example: s = \"abcbd\" (k=3: 'a','b','c','d') -> wait, k=4? \n                We want a substring that has a duplicate and does not contain one of the distinct characters? \n                Consider the substring \"bcb\": \n                    distinct characters in the entire string: {'a','b','c','d'}\n                    in \"bcb\": we have 'b' and 'c', but not 'a' and 'd'. \n                    Then for u='b' and v='a': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n            Therefore, we must check: for every contiguous substring that has a duplicate character, it must contain all distinct characters of the entire string? \n\n          How to check that efficiently? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces 1536A): \n                It turns out that the only perfectly balanced strings are those that do not contain any of the following as a contiguous substring: \n                    \"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", ... (any two consecutive same characters) \n                    and also do not contain any of the following: \"aba\", \"aca\", \"abcba\", ...? \n\n          But note: the known solution for this problem (from past contests) is to check only for duplicate consecutive characters and for a specific pattern of three distinct characters: \n                Specifically, if the string has a contiguous substring of the form \"abc\" where a==c and b is different, then it might be allowed? \n\n          Actually, the known solution is: \n                The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it does not contain any of the following as contiguous substrings:\n                    - \"aa\"\n                    - \"aba\"\n                    - \"abb\"\n                    - \"abcab\"\n                    - ... \n\n          But the note: the total length of all strings is 200,000, and the sum of |s| is 200,000, so we can afford to check every contiguous substring of length at most 3? \n\n          Why 3? Because the condition might fail in a substring of length 2 or 3.\n\n          Specifically, the condition fails if:\n            - There is a substring of length 2: \"aa\" (or any duplicate consecutive) -> fails.\n            - There is a substring of length 3: \"aba\" -> fails? \n                   Why? In \"aba\", if the entire string has at least three distinct characters, then we have a character 'c' that is not in this substring. Then for u='a' and v='c': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n                   But if the entire string has only two distinct characters, then \"aba\" is allowed? \n\n          Therefore, we must consider the distinct characters in the entire string.\n\n          Proposed solution for program2.py:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                k = len(distinct)\n\n                # If there is any consecutive duplicate, then fail.\n                for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else:\n                    # Check for any contiguous substring of length 3 that might be \"aba\" (with a duplicate that is not consecutive) \n                    # but wait: if k>=3, then we must also fail if we have a duplicate anywhere if the substring does not contain all distinct characters? \n                    # However, note: if there is a duplicate that is not consecutive, then there must be a contiguous substring of length 3 that contains two a's and one b, and if k>=3, then there is a character c not in this substring -> then the condition fails for the substring and the pair (a,c): |2-0|=2.\n                    # But how to find such a substring? \n                    # Actually, the minimal substring that contains a duplicate and is contiguous is of length 3: \"aba\" (or any two a's separated by one character). \n                    # And if k>=3, then this substring does not contain the third character c. \n                    # Therefore, if k>=3 and there is any duplicate (even non consecutive) then we can find a contiguous substring of length 3 that has a duplicate? \n                    # Not exactly: the duplicate might be separated by more than one character. \n                    # Example: \"aabc\" -> \n                    #   consecutive duplicate at the beginning: \"aa\" -> we already caught that.\n                    # Example: \"acab\" -> \n                    #   no consecutive duplicate, but we have two a's. \n                    #   contiguous substring of length 3: \n                    #       \"aca\": has two a's and one c. \n                    #   if the entire string has at least three distinct characters? Actually, \"acab\" has {'a','c','b'} -> k=3.\n                    #   then in the substring \"aca\", we are missing 'b'. Then for u='a' and v='b': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n                    #   Therefore, we must fail.\n\n                    # How to catch \"aca\"? \n                    #   We can do: for every character c, we want to know if there is an occurrence of c that is followed by a non-c and then by c again, within a short span? \n                    #   Specifically, if the same character appears twice within a window of at most 3? \n\n                    #   But note: the duplicate might be separated by more than one character? \n                    #   Example: \"a...a\" with any number of characters in between. \n                    #   However, if the same character appears twice, then the minimal distance between the two a's is 2 (if not consecutive) and then we have a contiguous substring of length 3 that contains the two a's and the character in between? \n                    #   But wait: the substring from the first a to the second a is contiguous and has length = distance+1. \n                    #   And if the distance is 2, then the substring is \"aXa\", which is length 3. \n                    #   If the distance is 3: \"aXYa\", then the contiguous substring is \"aXYa\", which has length 4. \n                    #   In this substring, if there is a character missing from the entire distinct set, then it fails. \n                    #   But how to know without checking the entire distinct set? \n\n                    #   Alternatively, we can fail as soon as we see a duplicate (even non consecutive) if k>=3? \n                    #   But wait: what if the entire string has exactly two distinct characters? \n                    #   Example: \"ababa\" -> distinct = {'a','b'}, k=2. \n                    #   Then the substring \"aba\" (which has two a's and one b) -> then for the entire string, the distinct characters are only 'a' and 'b'. \n                    #   In the substring \"aba\", we have both 'a' and 'b'. Then |f(a)-f(b)| = |2-1|=1 -> allowed.\n                    #   Therefore, for k=2, non consecutive duplicates are allowed.\n\n                    #   So the only problem is when k>=3 and there is any duplicate (which means there is a character that appears at least twice) -> then we can find a contiguous substring that contains two of that character and that does not contain one of the distinct characters? \n\n                    #   But note: the entire string has k>=3 distinct characters. In any contiguous substring that contains two a's, if it does not contain all distinct characters, then it fails. \n                    #   However, the minimal contiguous substring that contains two a's might be very short: for example, if the two a's are consecutive, then the substring \"aa\" fails. If they are separated by one character, then the substring \"aXa\" fails if it does not contain all distinct characters? But it only has two distinct characters: 'a' and 'X'. Since k>=3, there is at least one distinct character missing.

\n                The entire string has distinct={'a','b','c'}. \n                We need to check every contiguous substring. \n                The substring \"abca\" (0-3) has a:2, b:1, c:1 -> then for any pair: \n                    |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |1-1|=0 -> ok.\n                The substring \"a\" (0): for any other character (b or c): |1-0|=1 -> ok.\n                The substring \"ab\" (0-1): |1-0|=1 for (a,c) and (b,c) -> ok.\n                The substring \"abc\" (0-2): has one of each -> ok.\n                The substring \"bca\" (1-3): one of each -> ok.\n                The substring \"ca\" (2-3): |1-0|=1 for (a,b) and (c,b) -> ok.\n                The substring \"ab\" (3-4): |1-0|=1 for (a,c) and (b,c) -> ok.\n\n            So it is valid.\n\n            Therefore, the only bad pattern is duplicate at distance 1 or 2.\n\n            But note: what if the duplicate is at distance 4 and the entire string has 4 distinct characters? \n                s = \"abcdxya\", distinct={'a','b','c','d','x','y'} -> then the substring \"abcdxya\" has all distinct characters? -> then it is allowed.\n                But the substring \"a......a\" (the two a's) might be the entire string, which is allowed.\n\n            However, there might be a substring in between that has a duplicate and is missing one character? \n                For example, s = \"abcda\" (distinct={'a','b','c','d'}), then the substring \"a\" (first) -> allowed.\n                substring \"abcd\" -> allowed.\n                substring \"abcda\" -> has a:2, then for any pair: |2-1|=1 -> allowed.\n\n            But consider a substring that is not the entire string and has a duplicate and is missing one character? \n                In \"abcda\", the only duplicate is in the entire substring. \n                The only other contiguous substring that has a duplicate is the entire substring.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to worry about duplicates that are close (distance<=2).\n\n          Conclusion for program2.py:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                # If the string has only one distinct character, then it's always YES.\n                if len(set(s)) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                found = False\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n\n                if found:\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for duplicate at distance 2, but only if the entire string has at least 3 distinct characters.\n                if len(set(s)) >= 3:\n                    for i in range(2, n):\n                        if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if found:\n                        continue\n\n                # If we passed both checks, then YES.\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n          Let's test with the examples in the note:\n\n            Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct = {'a','b'} -> size=2 -> skip the distance2 check?

We cannot use 'continue' to skip to the next test case inside the else? \n\n          We can restructure:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                k = len(distinct)\n                if k == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue   # next test case\n\n                found = False\n                for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n\n                if found:\n                    continue\n\n                if k>=3:\n                    for i in range(2, len(s)):\n                        if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if found:\n                        continue\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n          Let me test with \"aba\": \n                distinct = {'a','b'} -> k=2 -> skip the k>=3 check -> then print \"YES\"\n\n          \"abb\": \n                consecutive duplicate at i=1: 'b' and 'b' -> print \"NO\", then continue.\n\n          \"abc\": \n                k=3, then check consecutive: none. Then check distance2: \n                    i=2: s[2]=='c', s[0]=='a' -> not equal -> then print \"YES\"\n\n          \"abac\": \n                k=3, consecutive: none. Then at i=2: s[2]=='a', s[0]=='a' -> print \"NO\"\n\n          \"abcab\": \n                k=3, consecutive: none. \n                distance2: \n                    i=2: 'c' vs 'a' -> no\n                    i=3: 'a' vs 'b' -> no\n                    i=4: 'b' vs 'c' -> no\n                then print \"YES\"\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, what about a string with distinct=2 and a duplicate at distance2? \n                Example: \"ababa\" -> distinct=2, consecutive: \n                    i=1: 'b' vs 'a' -> no\n                    i=2: 'a' vs 'b' -> no\n                    i=3: 'b' vs 'a' -> no\n                    i=4: 'a' vs 'b' -> no\n                then skip the k>=3 check -> print \"YES\"\n\n          And \"ababa\" is allowed? \n                The entire string has distinct={'a','b'}. \n                The substring \"aba\" (which is contiguous) has f(a)=2, f(b)=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> allowed.\n                The substring \"ababa\" has f(a)=3, f(b)=2 -> |3-2|=1 -> allowed.\n\n          Therefore, it is allowed.\n\n          But the problem note says: \n                \"For example, the strings \"aba\" and \"abc\" are perfectly balanced\"\n\n          So \"aba\" is allowed, and \"ababa\" is similar.\n\n          Therefore, the solution for program2.py is as above.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all strings is at most 200,000, and we are doing two loops per test case (if needed) and the sum of the lengths is 200,000, so it is O(n).\n\n          But note: the first loop (consecutive) is O(n) per test case, and the second loop (distance2) is also O(n) per test case, but we only do the second loop if the first didn't fail and if k>=3. And the total n over test cases is 200,000, so overall it is O(200000).\n\n          Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total of |s| over test cases is 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is the entire block above.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the given code is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we output the code that goes inside the for loop.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n                {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n          We must output the string exactly.\n\n          For program1.py: the missing part is one line: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n          For program2.py: the missing part is the entire block for the test case.\n\n          However, note: the given code for program2.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we must write the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n          We write:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct = set(s)\n            k = len(distinct)\n            if k == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue\n\n            found = False\n            n = len(s)\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n            if found:\n                continue\n\n            if k>=3:\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if found:\n                    continue\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the variable 'n' is the length of s, so we can use len(s) in the range.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid n:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n          But the inner loops: we are using the current s.\n\n          We'll write:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct_chars = set(s)\n            k = len(distinct_chars)\n            if k == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                found = False\n                for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if not found:\n                    if k >= 3:\n                        for i in range(2, len(s)):\n                            if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                found = True\n                                break\n                    if not found:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, we must break out of the loop and skip to the next test case if we print \"NO\" in the consecutive check. The above uses a flag.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct_chars = set(s)\n            k = len(distinct_chars)\n            if k == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue   # to next test case\n\n            found_dup = False\n            for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    found_dup = True\n                    break\n\n            if found_dup:\n                continue   # next test case\n\n            if k>=3:\n                for i in range(2, len(s)):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found_dup = True\n                        break\n                if found_dup:\n                    continue\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the 'continue' is inside the for loop for the test cases. This is valid.\n\n          However, we can also use:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                if len(set(s)) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                n = len(s)\n                found = False\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if found:\n                    continue\n                if len(set(s)) >= 3:   # we can recompute set(s) or use a variable?

The line should be indented by 8 spaces (inside the else, inside the while, inside the for loop).\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program1, we output the string: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n          For program2, we output the entire block that goes inside the for loop for the test cases.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          For program2, the missing block is the entire body of the for loop.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = input().strip()\\n    distinct_chars = set(s)\\n    k = len(distinct_chars)\\n    if k == 1:\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        continue\\n    n = len(s)\\n    found = False\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\n        if s[i] == s[i-1]:\\n            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            found = True\\n            break\\n    if found:\\n        continue\\n    if k >= 3:\\n        for i in range(2, n):\\n            if s[i] == s[i-2]:\\n                print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                found = True\\n                break\\n        if found:\\n            continue\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\")\"\n\n          But note: the first line in the for loop for program2 is already indented by 4 spaces (because it is inside the for loop). The provided code has:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we must provide the code that replaces the TODO, and it should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n          The code we output for program2 should be:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct_chars = set(s)\n            k = len(distinct_chars)\n            if k == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue\n            n = len(s)\n            found = False\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                continue\n            if k >= 3:\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    if s[i] == s[i-2]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if found:\n                    continue\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n          But when we put it in the TODO, it will be at the same indentation level as the comment. So we do not add extra indentation.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string.\n\n          We must include the newlines and the exact spaces.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write the string with the exact indentation that is required: 4 spaces for the entire block? \n\n          But the TODO is at the same level as the for loop, so the block we provide should be at the same level as the comment.\n\n          Therefore, we output the block without extra indentation.\n\n          But the example: the for loop in program2 is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                [HERE]\n\n          We replace [HERE] with the block. The block should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for.\n\n          So the code we output for program2 is the block as above, and each line of the block should be indented by 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the entire block is one level in. But the provided code has:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the TODO is at 4 spaces. We will replace the TODO with the block, and the block should be at 4 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output the block as a string that has the same level of indentation as the TODO.\n\n          But the block we wrote above is not indented. We must indent it by 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, no: because the TODO is already at 4 spaces, and we are replacing the entire TODO line with the block. The block should be at 4 spaces.\n\n          How we write:\n\n            Line1: \"    s = input().strip()\"\n            Line2: \"    distinct_chars = set(s)\"\n\n          But wait: the TODO is at 4 spaces, and we are replacing it with multiple lines. We want:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct_chars = set(s)\n                ...\n\n          So each line of the block should be at 4 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output the block with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output the block without the 4 spaces and let the existing indentation (the 4 spaces from the for loop) cover it? \n\n          But the TODO is a comment at 4 spaces, and we are replacing it with code that should be at 4 spaces. So we output the block without extra spaces? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the code must run. In Python, indentation matters.\n\n          We must output the block with the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n          The surrounding code: the for loop is at 0 indentation, the body of the for loop is at 4 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, the block we output for program2 should be at 4 spaces.\n\n          We'll write the block as:\n\n            \"s = input().strip()\\ndistinct_chars = set(s)\\nk = len(distinct_chars)\\nif k == 1:\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    continue\\nn = len(s)\\nfound = False\\nfor i in range(1, n):\\n    if s[i] == s[i-1]:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        found = True\\n        break\\nif found:\\n    continue\\nif k >= 3:\\n    for i in range(2, n):\\n        if s[i] == s[i-2]:\\n            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            found = True\\n            break\\n    if found:\\n        continue\\nprint(\\\"YES\\\")\"\n\n          But this has no initial 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the entire block is the body of the for loop, so it should be indented by 4 spaces. But the problem's initial code has the for loop and then a comment at 4 spaces. We are replacing that comment. So we output the block without extra initial indentation? \n\n          However, the existing code has 4 spaces for the for loop body. We are replacing the TODO with a block that is at the same level. Therefore, we do not add extra 4 spaces to the entire block. We output the block as if it is at the same level as the TODO.\n\n          But the TODO is a single line. We are replacing it with multiple lines. The first line should be at the same level as the TODO.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"s = input().strip()\\n    distinct_chars = set(s)\\n    ...\"\n\n          That would be wrong.\n\n          We must output the block with the following indentation:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct_chars = set(s)\n                ...\n\n          So each line of the block should be at 4 spaces. But the block we are outputting is the entire body. How do we format it?\n\n          Actually, we can write the block as a string with embedded"
