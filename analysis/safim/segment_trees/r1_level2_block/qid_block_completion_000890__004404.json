Let me try with the example: \n                            n=3: tree with root (1) and two children (2,3). Then the list a = [1,1] -> because the parent of 2 is 1, parent of 3 is 1? Then counter[1] = 2 -> so count = [2] -> num_level=1. Then for i in range(1): \n                                count[0] = max(2 - 0 - 2, 0) = 0. Then R = max(count) = 0 -> so we return num_level+1 = 1+1 = 2. But the minimal seconds for n=3? Time0: inject root -> {1}\n                            Time1: inject one child (say 2) -> then spreading: root has one infected child -> so we can spread to 3? -> {1,2,3} -> done in 1 second? So total seconds: 1? But the code returns 2? This does not match. Alternatively, the known solution from Codeforces submissions for \"Tree Infection\" (problem C) is:\n\n                            t = int(input())\n                            for _ in range(t):\n                                n = int(input())\n                                p = list(map(int, input().split())) cnt = [0]*(n+1)\n                                for i in range(n-1):\n                                    cnt[p[i]] += 1\n                                a = [1]   #",

We can break down the pairs into two types:\n   Type 1: The first character is the same and the second character is different.\n   Type 2: The second character is the same and the first character is different.\n\n However, note that if we count both types naively, we might count pairs that actually differ in both positions twice? \n But observe: a pair that differs in both positions would be counted in both Type1 and Type2?

So a pair that differs in both positions is not counted.\n\n However, the current code does:\n   - It uses dic1: which counts by the first character. For a string S, we add the current count of strings that have the same first character (from dic1) to result. \n        Then we update dic1 for the first character.\n   - Similarly, dic2: for the second character.\n\n But then we subtract twice the count of the entire string? Why twice?\n\n Explanation: \n   Consider a pair (s, t) that has the same first character and same second character? Then they are the same string? \n   Actually, we are counting pairs that are the same? But note: the same string would be in dic1 and dic2? \n\n However, the problem: \n   We are counting pairs that have the same first character (so that the second character is different) and same second character (so that the first character is different) separately.\n\n But what if two strings are identical? Then they would be counted in both dic1 and dic2? Actually, no: \n   For a string \"ab\", when we process it:\n      - We look at the first character 'a': we add the current count of strings that started with 'a' (which is the number of previous strings starting with 'a').\n      - Then we look at the second character 'b': we add the current count of strings that have second character 'b' (which is the number of previous strings with second character 'b').\n\n   But if there was an identical string \"ab\" before, then:\n        In dic1: we added the count of previous 'a' (which included the previous \"ab\") -> so we added 1 for the same first char.\n        In dic2: we added the count of previous 'b' (which included the previous \"ab\") -> so we added 1 for the same second char.\n\n   However, the pair (previous \"ab\", current \"ab\") is not a valid pair because they are the same in both positions? Actually, they are the same in both, so they don't have exactly one difference. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\". So identical strings are not counted. However, we have overcounted? \n        We have added 1 (for the same first char) and 1 (for the same second char) for a total of 2? But we should have added 0.\n\n   Therefore, we subtract twice the count of the entire string? Why twice? \n        Because we have added two counts (one from dic1 and one from dic2) for the same pair? Actually, no: the pair is counted twice? \n\n   Actually, for each occurrence of the same string, we subtract twice the frequency? \n\n   How does the subtraction work?\n        We have a dictionary dic3 that counts the frequency of the entire string.\n        When we see a string S that has appeared k times before, then we subtract 2*k.\n\n        Why 2*k? \n          Because for each previous occurrence of S, we had added 1 in dic1 (for the same first char) and 1 in dic2 (for the same second char) for the current string? \n          But note: the current string is being compared to k previous identical strings. For each identical string, we have two counts: one from dic1 and one from dic2? \n          So we have overcounted by 2 per identical string? \n\n        However, consider: \n          For a previous identical string, when we processed that previous string, we did not have the current string. So the overcount is only for the current string and the previous identical ones? \n\n        Actually, the current code does:\n          result += dic1[S[0]]   -> but note: when we see the current string, dic1[S[0]] includes the previous identical strings? \n          Similarly, result += dic2[S[1]] -> includes the previous identical strings.\n\n        So for each previous identical string, we have added 1 (from dic1) and 1 (from dic2) for the current string? That is 2 per identical string.\n\n        Therefore, we subtract 2 * (number of previous occurrences of S).\n\n   But wait: what about non-identical strings? \n        The dic1 and dic2 counts include all strings that have the same first char (including identical ones) and same second char (including identical ones). \n        The subtraction is only for the identical ones? \n\n   So the formula is:\n        total = (pairs with same first char) + (pairs with same second char) - 2*(pairs of identical strings)\n\n   However, note: \n        The pairs with same first char include pairs that are identical? But also include pairs that are not identical? \n        Similarly, the pairs with same second char include identical pairs? \n\n        But we are subtracting twice the identical pairs? \n\n        Actually, the identical pairs are counted in both dic1 and dic2? And we subtract 2 times the count of identical pairs? \n\n        How many times are identical pairs counted? \n          In dic1: for a given identical pair (s, s), we count it once in the same first char? Actually, when we process the second occurrence of s, we add the count of the first occurrence (which is 1) from dic1. \n          Then when we process the third occurrence, we add 2 from dic1 (because there are two previous with same first char) and 2 from dic2? \n\n        So the count for identical pairs in the dic1 and dic2 parts is the same as for non-identical? \n\n        However, the problem: we don't want to count identical pairs at all? But the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\", so identical pairs are not counted. \n\n        But note: the pairs we are counting in dic1 and dic2 are not just the identical ones? \n          In dic1: we count any two strings that share the same first char? This includes:\n             - pairs that are identical: (s, s) -> but then we subtract them? \n             - pairs that have the same first char but different second char: these are valid for the first type.\n\n        Similarly, dic2 counts:\n             - identical pairs (which we subtract) \n             - pairs that have the same second char but different first char: valid for the second type.\n\n        However, what about a pair that is not identical but has both the same first char and same second char? That is only the identical pair? \n\n        So the subtraction is only for the identical pairs? \n\n        Therefore, the formula is:\n          result = (# of pairs with same first char) + (# of pairs with same second char) - 2*(# of pairs of identical strings)\n\n        But note: the identical pairs are counted in both the same first char and same second char? So we have counted each identical pair twice? \n          And we subtract 2 * (number of identical pairs that the current string forms with previous ones) for the current string? \n\n        Actually, the current string forms (frequency of S so far) pairs with previous identical ones? But we subtract 2 * (frequency of S so far) at the moment we are processing the current string? \n\n        However, the frequency of S so far (before updating) is stored in dic3? \n\n        The code does:\n          if S in dic3:\n             result -= dic3[S] * 2\n             dic3[S] += 1\n          else:\n             dic3[S] = 1\n\n        So for the k-th occurrence of S, we subtract 2*(k-1) because dic3[S] is k-1 at that time.\n\n        How many identical pairs are there? \n          For a string that appears k times, the number of identical pairs is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\n        But we are subtracting 2*(k-1) for the k-th occurrence? \n          For the second occurrence: subtract 2*(1) -> 2\n          For the third occurrence: subtract 2*(2) -> 4\n          For the fourth: 6, etc.\n\n        Total subtraction for a string that appears k times: 2*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 2 * (k-1)*k/2 = k*(k-1)\n\n        But we want to subtract 2 * (number of identical pairs) = 2 * (k*(k-1)/2) = k*(k-1). \n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, the current code has a TODO in the else part for dic2. We must complete the else part for dic2.\n\n Currently, for dic2, if the second character is in dic2, we do:\n      result += dic2[S[1]]\n      dic2[S[1]] += 1\n else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n We should do the same as for dic1: if the second character is not in dic2, we initialize it to 1.\n\n So the else part for dic2 should be:\n      dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n But note: the current code for dic1 and dic2 is symmetric? \n\n However, the code for dic1 is:\n      if S[0] in dic1:\n          result += dic1[S[0]]\n          dic1[S[0]] += 1\n      else:\n          dic1[S[0]] = 1\n\n So for dic2, we should do the same.\n\n Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is: \n      dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n But note: the code for dic3 is already complete.\n\n So for program1.py, the missing line is: \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is in the else part of dic2.\n\n But note: the current code for dic2 has an else block that is incomplete. We must complete that else block.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is the line: \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: minimal seconds to infect a rooted tree.\n\n The code structure:\n\n   counter = defaultdict(int)   # global, but then cleared per test case? Actually, we do counter.clear() for each test case.\n\n   def solve(a):   # a is the list of n-1 integers: the ancestors for vertices 2 to n.\n\n        # Count the frequency of each parent? \n        for ai in a:\n            counter[ai] += 1\n\n        count = list(counter.values())\n        num_level = len(count)   # This is not the number of levels? Actually, we are counting the frequency of each parent? \n        # But note: the root (vertex 1) is not in the list?

So the frequencies are for the parent nodes.\n\n        # But note: the root is the parent of some children? So we are counting the children count for each node? \n        # However, the root is not included in the list? The list a has the parent of vertex 2, vertex 3, ... vertex n.\n\n        # So the counter counts the number of times a node appears as a parent?

The list a has the parent for vertex 2,3,...,n. The root might be the parent of some of these? \n\n        # Example: n=3, a = [1, 1] -> then counter[1] becomes 2. So the root (1) has 2 children.\n\n        # But what about the root? The root is not a child of any node? So we are only counting the children of non-root nodes? \n        # Actually, we are counting the children of every node that appears as a parent? and the root appears as a parent? \n\n        # So the count list is the list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? \n\n        # However, note: the root is included? \n\n        # Now, the code does:\n        count.sort()\n        for i in range(num_level):\n            count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n        Then we set L=0, R = max(count) (if R==0 then return num_level+1)\n\n        Then we do a binary search on R? \n\n        The function check(k) is defined: \n            b = count.copy()\n            for i in range(len(b)):\n                b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n            if sum(b) <= k:\n                return True\n            return False\n\n        Then we do:\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R+L)//2\n                if check(mid):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then return num_level+1+R.\n\n        The TODO is in the else branch of the binary search. We must set L to mid? \n\n        Because in binary search, if check(mid) is false, then we need to search in the higher half? So we set L = mid.\n\n        So the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\n        But note: the binary search is set up to find the minimal k such that check(k) is true? \n            We are searching in the range [L, R]. Initially L=0, R = max(count). \n            We want to find the smallest k (in the range [0, max(count)]) such that check(k) is true.\n\n        The loop condition: while R - L > 1.\n\n        The update:\n            if check(mid) is true -> then we set R = mid (because we are looking for the minimal k, and we know that mid works, so we can try a smaller one? but note: we are moving R down to mid, and then we will check the left half? Actually, the condition is set to find the minimal k? \n\n        Actually, the binary search is set to find the minimal k that satisfies the condition? \n\n        How? \n            We start with L=0, R = max(count). \n            We know that for k = max(count), check(k) is true? because we subtract k from each, so they become 0? and then sum(b)=0 <= k.\n\n            We want the minimal k? \n\n            The loop: \n                mid = (L+R)//2\n                if check(mid) is True -> then we set R = mid (meaning we can try a smaller k? and we know that k=mid works, so we set R=mid to search in [L, mid] for a smaller k that works)\n                else -> then we set L = mid (meaning we must try a larger k)\n\n            Then the answer is R? \n\n            But the return is: num_level+1+R.\n\n        So the else branch should set L = mid.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"L = mid\"\n\n        However, note: the code after the binary search returns num_level+1+R.\n\n        Why num_level+1? \n            The variable num_level is the length of the count list? which is the number of distinct parents that have children? But note: the root is included? \n\n        Actually, the count list is the list of the number of children for each node that has children? \n\n        The infection process:\n            - We start at time 0: nothing is infected.\n            - Each second: \n                  Spreading: for each vertex v that has at least one child infected, we can choose at most one additional child to infect? \n                  Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex to infect.\n\n            The root must be infected by injection? because it has no parent? \n\n        The solution:\n\n          We note that the infection starts at the root? Actually, we can choose the first injection to be the root? \n\n          The problem: \n            We are free to choose which vertices to infect by injection and which by spreading? \n\n          The known solution for this problem (from known problems like \"Tree Infection\"):\n\n            We can model the problem as:\n\n              We have a tree. We can inject the root at time 0. Then at each second, we can do:\n                 - Inject one more node (any healthy node) -> injection operation.\n                 - Then, for each node that already has at least one infected child, we can spread to one more child (if available) of that node.\n\n              How to minimize the time?\n\n              Steps:\n\n                1. We note that the infection spreads along the branches. The children of a node are infected either by injection or by spreading from the parent? But note: the spreading operation: we can choose which child to spread to? \n\n                2. We can break the tree by the parent. For each parent, we have a group of children. The infection of the children of a node v can be done in two ways:\n                    - By injection: we can inject any child at any second (if we choose) \n                    - By spreading: once at least one child of v is infected (by injection or spreading from below? but note: the spreading from the parent v requires that the parent is infected? and then we can spread to one child per second? Actually, the problem says: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, then we can spread to at most one other child? \n\n                3. Actually, the spreading operation is done per node: each node that has at least one infected child can spread to one more child? \n\n                4. We can think greedily: \n                    - First, we must inject the root at time 0? \n                    - Then, for each node, we can delay the injection as long as possible? \n\n                Known solution:\n\n                  Step 1: Count the number of children for each node. \n                  Step 2: We note that the nodes with many children are the bottlenecks? \n\n                  Algorithm:\n\n                    Let f(v) = the number of children of v.\n\n                    We sort the children counts in descending order? \n\n                    Then we assign a time for when the node v becomes \"active\": meaning that we have infected at least one child of v? \n\n                    The infection process:\n\n                      At time 0: we inject the root -> so the root is infected.\n\n                      Then, for a node v, we can only start spreading from v after at least one of its children is infected? \n\n                    However, note: the root has children? We can start spreading from the root as soon as we have infected one child of the root? \n\n                    How do we infect the children of the root? \n                      We can inject one child of the root at time 1? \n                      Then at time 1: \n                         Injection: we inject one child of the root -> now that child is infected.\n                         Then spreading: the root now has one infected child -> so we can spread to one more child of the root? \n\n                      But note: the spreading operation happens after the injection? So at time 1, after the injection, we can spread? \n\n                      So at time 1, we can infect two children of the root? \n\n                    Actually, the process per second:\n\n                      Second 0: \n                         Injection: we inject the root -> root becomes infected.\n\n                      Then spreading: the root has no infected child at the start of second 0? so no spreading? \n\n                      Second 1:\n                         Injection: we inject one child of the root (say child1) -> child1 becomes infected.\n                         Then spreading: the root now has one infected child -> we can spread to one more child (child2) -> child2 becomes infected.\n\n                      Second 2:\n                         Injection: we inject child3 of the root? \n                         Then spreading: the root has two infected children? so we can spread to child4? \n\n                    So if the root has k children, we can infect 2 children at time1, then 1 per second after? \n\n                    How long to infect all k children? \n                         At time0: root is infected.\n                         At time1: we infect 2 children (by injection and then spreading) -> total infected: 1 (root) + 2 = 3? \n                         But wait, the root is infected at time0, then at time1 we infect two children? so at the end of time1: 3 nodes infected.\n\n                         Then at time2: we infect one by injection and then the root can spread to one more? -> 2 more? so total 5? \n\n                    Actually, the spreading operation: for each node that has at least one infected child, we can spread to one more? \n\n                    For the root: at time1, after injection we have one infected child -> then we spread to one more -> so two children at time1.\n\n                    Then at time2: \n                         Injection: we inject a third child? \n                         Then spreading: the root now has two infected children? so we can spread to a fourth child? -> so two more at time2? \n\n                    So the root's children: we can infect 2 at time1, 2 at time2, 2 at time3, ...? \n\n                    But note: we can only inject one per second? and then the root can spread to one per second? \n\n                    Actually, the root can spread to one per second? and we can also inject one per second? \n\n                    However, the spreading from the root: we can only do one per second? because the root is one node? \n\n                    So the root's children: \n                         We start at time0: root infected.\n                         Time1: inject child1 -> then spread to child2 -> so two children infected at time1.\n                         Time2: inject child3 -> then spread to child4 -> so two more? total 4.\n                         Time3: inject child5 -> then spread to child6 -> total 6.\n\n                    So for k children: we need ceil(k/2) seconds? \n\n                    But wait: at time1: 2 children, time2: 2 more -> total 4, time3: 2 more -> total 6. So for k children, we need k/2 seconds? \n\n                    However, if k is odd: \n                         k=3: \n                            time1: 2 children -> then at time2: we inject the last one -> then spreading: the root has three children? but we don't need to spread? because we already infected the last one by injection? \n                         So at time2: we have infected the last child by injection? and then we don't need to spread? \n\n                    But note: the spreading operation: we can choose to spread to a child that is not yet infected? but if we have already infected all, then we don't need to? \n\n                    So the time for the root's children: \n                         We can do: \n                            time1: 2 children\n                            time2: 1 child (by injection) -> then we don't use the spreading for the root? because we have no more children? \n\n                    So total time for the root's children: 2 seconds? \n\n                    How to compute? \n\n                    We note that we can infect two children per second for the root? until the last one? \n\n                    Actually, we can infect min(2, remaining) per second? \n\n                    But the spreading operation: we can only spread to one per second? and we can inject one per second? \n\n                    So the root's children: we can do 2 per second until the last one? \n\n                    So the time for the root's children is ceil(k/2) seconds? \n\n                    But wait: at time0 we have the root. Then we start at time1 to infect the children? \n\n                    So the root's children are all infected by time ceil(k/2) seconds? \n\n                    However, what about other nodes? \n\n                    Consider a node v that is a child of the root? and v has children? \n\n                    We must infect v first? then we can start infecting its children? \n\n                    Example: \n                         root: has two children: v1 and v2.\n                         v1 has two children: w1, w2.\n\n                    How to infect? \n\n                      Time0: inject root -> root infected.\n\n                      Time1: \n                         Injection: inject v1 -> v1 infected.\n                         Spreading: root has one infected child (v1) -> so we can spread to v2? -> v2 infected.\n\n                      Time2:\n                         Injection: inject w1 -> w1 infected.\n                         Spreading: \n                             For root: already has two infected children? so we can spread? but no more children? \n                             For v1: has one infected child (w1) -> so we can spread to w2? -> w2 infected.\n\n                      So total time: 2 seconds? \n\n                    But the entire tree has 5 nodes? and we infected in 2 seconds? \n\n                    However, at the end of time2: \n                         Time0: root\n                         Time1: v1, v2\n                         Time2: w1, w2\n\n                    So 5 nodes? \n\n                    But note: the problem says the minimal number of seconds to infect the whole tree? \n\n                    How many seconds? \n                         We started at time0, then time1, then time2 -> so 3 seconds? \n\n                    Actually, the process:\n\n                         Second 0: \n                             Injection: root -> infected set = {root}\n                         Second 1: \n                             Injection: v1 -> infected set = {root, v1}\n                             Spreading: from root (because root has one infected child v1) -> infect v2 -> infected set = {root, v1, v2}\n                         Second 2:\n                             Injection: w1 -> infected set = {root, v1, v2, w1}\n                             Spreading: \n                                 root: no more children? \n                                 v1: has one infected child (w1) -> so we can spread to w2 -> infected set = {root, v1, v2, w1, w2}\n\n                    So at the end of second 2, the entire tree is infected? \n\n                    Therefore, the minimal seconds is 3? \n\n                    But the known solution: \n                         The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n                         Let deg[i] be the number of children of node i.\n\n                         We consider the root? the root is initially infected? \n\n                         Then we have an array of the children counts for each node (including the root) that has at least one child? \n\n                         Then we do:\n\n                            sort the array in descending order.\n\n                            Then we simulate: \n                                time = 0\n                                We start by having the root infected.\n\n                                Then we consider each node: we need to assign a time when the node becomes \"active\" (meaning we have infected at least one of its children) so that we can start spreading from that node.\n\n                         The known solution in the code:\n\n                            We have:\n                                count = sorted list of the children counts? (but note: the code sorts in ascending order? but then subtracts indices? so it might be sorted in ascending order? but then the binary search? \n\n                         Actually, the code:\n\n                            count.sort()   # ascending order? \n                            for i in range(num_level):\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                         Why subtract i+2? \n\n                         Explanation from known solutions to \"Tree Infection\" (e.g. Codeforces Round #781, Problem C):\n\n                            Steps:\n\n                              Let a = list of the number of children for each node (including the root) that has children? \n\n                              We sort a in descending order? \n\n                              Then we want to find the minimal time T such that:\n\n                                 For each node i, we have: \n                                    T >= (the time when the node becomes active) + (the number of children that are not infected by spreading) \n\n                              Actually, we can think:\n\n                                 We start at time0: we inject the root? \n\n                                 Then, for a node with k children, we can start spreading from that node only after we have infected one of its children (by injection). \n\n                                 How to assign injections? \n\n                                 We can inject one node per second. \n\n                                 The spreading for a node i: we can spread to one child per second after the node becomes active.\n\n                                 So the total time to infect all children of node i is: \n                                    t_i = (time when the node becomes active) + (k_i - 1)   [because we spread to k_i-1 children? since one child is infected by injection?]\n\n                                 But note: we can also inject more than one child? \n\n                                 Actually, we can inject any healthy node? so we can inject multiple children of the same node? \n\n                                 However, the minimal time? \n\n                                 Known solution:\n\n                                    We sort the array a (the children counts) in descending order.\n\n                                    Then we let T = 0.\n                                    For each i from 0 to len(a)-1:\n                                        T = max(T, a[i] + i + 1)   # ? \n\n                                 But then we have to account for the root? \n\n                                 Actually, the root is already infected? \n\n                                 Then we have an array a for the children counts? \n\n                                 The idea: \n                                    We assign an injection at time i+1 to the first child of the node corresponding to a[i]? \n                                    Then the node becomes active at time i+1? \n                                    Then the spreading for that node: we need to spread to the remaining a[i]-1 children? which will take a[i]-1 seconds? \n                                    So the entire node's children are infected by time: i+1 + (a[i]-1) = a[i] + i.\n\n                                    Then the total time for the entire tree is the maximum over all nodes of (a[i] + i) and then we add 1? for the root? \n\n                                 But note: the root is infected at time0? \n\n                                 Actually, the root is infected at time0? and then we start the injections at time1? \n\n                                 So the time for the root's children: \n                                    We assign the root's children to the first injections? \n\n                                 Example: \n                                    a = [3] (if the root has 3 children) -> then we assign the first injection at time1 to one child of the root? \n                                    Then the root becomes active at time1? \n                                    Then we spread to the remaining 2 children? which will be at time2 and time3? \n                                    So the last child is infected at time3? \n\n                                 Then the total time is 3? \n\n                                 But the known solution: \n                                    T = max_i (a[i] + i) + 1? \n\n                                 For the root: i=0 -> 3+0 = 3, then +1? -> 4? \n\n                                 That doesn't match.\n\n                         Alternatively, known solution from the editorial:\n\n                            Let a be the list of the number of children for each node (including the root) that has children?

\n                                The spreading: we can spread to at most t - t_i children? \n                                So we require: 1 + (t - t_i) >= a[i]   => t - t_i >= a[i] - 1  => t_i <= t - (a[i]-1)\n\n                            Also, we have a limited number of injections: we can inject at most t injections (one per second) and we have to assign the injection times to the nodes? \n\n                            We want to know if time t is enough? \n\n                            How to check for time t? \n                                We have to assign an injection time t_i (with 1<=t_i<=t) to each node? such that t_i <= t - (a[i]-1) and the t_i are distinct? \n\n                            Then the minimal t is the smallest t such that we can assign distinct t_i in [1, t] with t_i <= t - (a[i]-1) for each i.\n\n                            How to assign?

(even though it has two children, they pushed 1) -> then they do the calculation and get 2 seconds? \n\n                         But the spreading: \n                                Second0: inject root.\n                                Second1: inject one child of the root -> then spreading: from the root to the other child? \n                                -> done in 1 second after the initial? \n\n                         So total seconds: 1? \n\n                         The known solution outputs 2? \n\n                         This matches the example: the known solution outputs 2 for n=3.\n\n                         Therefore, the given code in program2.py might be correct as is? \n\n                         But the example n=3: the code returns 2, which matches the known solution that passed.\n\n                         And the example n=7: the known solution that passed outputs 3, but the given code in program2.py outputs 4? \n\n                         How to make the given code work for n=7? \n\n                         The given code for n=7: \n                            count = [4,2] -> sorted: [2,4] -> then \n                                for i in range(2): \n                                    i=0: count[0] = max(2-0-2,0)=0\n                                    i=1: count[1] = max(4-1-2,0)=1\n                            then R = 1.\n                            then binary search: \n                                L=0, R=1 -> mid=0, check(0): b=[0,1] -> sum=1, 1<=0? -> False -> so L=0, R=1 -> then break? \n                            then return 2+1+1 = 4.\n\n                         This matches the known solution that uses the extra 1 and then does the other method? \n\n                         But the known solution that passed for n=7 outputs 3? \n\n                         There are two known solutions: one outputs 4 for n=3 and 3 for n=7, the other outputs 2 for n=3 and 3 for n=7.\n\n                         The intended answer for the sample tree in the note is 3 seconds? \n\n                         Given the confusion, and since the problem says the sum of n is 200000, and the given code is intended to work, we will complete the TODO as \"L = mid\".\n\n                         Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\n Summary:\n\n   program1.py: missing code in the else branch for dic2: we should set dic2[S[1]] = 1.\n\n   program2.py: missing code in the else branch of the binary search: we should set L = mid.\n\n   We output in JSON: \n        {\"program1\": \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\", \"program2\": \"L = mid\"}\n\n But note: the code for program1.py has an indentation level. The else branch is at the same indentation as the if. \n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n   For program1.py: the missing line is exactly \"dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n   For program2.py: the missing line is exactly \"L = mid\"\n\n But note: the TODO in program2.py is in a while loop, and the line \"L = mid\" should be at the same indentation as the other branch.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n We output the string for the missing code.\n\n But note: the program1.py has a comment in the else branch: \n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n We are replacing the TODO comment with the code.\n\n However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the line of code that should be there.\n\n Similarly, for program2.py, the TODO is in:\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace with \"L = mid\"\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"    dic2[S[1]] = 1\", \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"}\n\n But wait, the indentation? \n\n   In program1.py, the else branch is at the same level as the if branch above. The if branch for dic2 has:\n\n        if S[1] in dic2:\n            result += dic2[S[1]]\n            dic2[S[1]] += 1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The if branch has two lines: \n        result += dic2[S[1]]\n        dic2[S[1]] += 1\n\n   So the else branch should have one line: \n        dic2[S[1]] = 1\n\n   And the indentation level is 4 spaces per level? \n\n   The entire code is indented by 4 spaces per level. The else is at the same level as the if, which is inside the for loop that is inside the test case loop.\n\n   The current else branch is at an indentation of 8 spaces (two levels). The missing line should be at 12 spaces? \n\n   But the if branch in the if condition for dic2 has two lines at 12 spaces? \n\n   So the else branch's code should be at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program1.py is: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n   Similarly, for program2.py, the TODO is inside the while loop, inside the else branch. The current code:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The if branch is at 12 spaces (three levels: 4 for function, 4 for while, 4 for if). The else branch is at the same level.\n\n   The missing line should be at 16 spaces? \n\n   But the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 16 spaces? \n\n   So the else branch should have \"L = mid\" at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program2.py is: \"        L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the if branch has two lines: \n        R = mid\n   and the else branch should have one line: \n        L = mid\n\n   However, the if branch is written as:\n\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n\n   So the else branch:\n\n        else:\n            L = mid\n\n   The indentation for the else branch's code is 12 spaces for the else and 16 for the inner.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so we output the line that goes in the else branch, which is \"        L = mid\", with 8 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the entire block is:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line with \"L = mid\", and we must preserve the indentation.\n\n   The current else branch has the comment at the same indentation as the if branch's \"R = mid\", which is 12 spaces? \n\n   But the if branch's \"R = mid\" is at 12 spaces? \n\n   Let me count:\n\n        The while loop: \n            while ...:   -> at 8 spaces (because the function solve is at 4, then the for loop is at 4, then the while loop is at 8)\n            then the next line: mid = ... -> at 12 spaces? \n            then the if: at 12 spaces? \n            then the body of the if: at 16 spaces? \n\n   In the given code:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The \"R = mid\" is at 12 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the code is:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The \"R = mid\" is at the same indentation as the \"mid = ...\", which is 8+4=12 spaces.\n\n   The else branch's comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n   But the body of the if and else should be indented one more level? \n\n   In Python, the body of a compound statement is indented. The standard is 4 spaces per level.\n\n   The while loop is at 8 spaces (because the function solve is defined at 0, then the for loop inside solve is at 4, then the while is at 8). \n        Then the body of the while is at 12 spaces? \n\n   The if and else are at 12 spaces, and their bodies should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   However, the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 12 spaces? that is not indented? \n\n   This is a syntax error in Python? \n\n   Let me check the given code for program2.py:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   This is not valid because the body of the if and else must be indented.\n\n   The original code must have been:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   But then the body of the if and else are not indented? \n\n   This is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", we output the code that should be placed in the TODO spot, with the same indentation as the surrounding code in the example.\n\n   In the example for program2.py, the if branch has \"R = mid\" at the same indentation as the if? \n\n   To be safe, we output the code with the same indentation as the if branch's body.\n\n   In the if branch, the body is \"R = mid\", which is at 12 spaces? \n\n   But the else branch's TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n   We replace the TODO comment with \"L = mid\", at the same indentation level.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is \"                L = mid\" (16 spaces) if the if branch's body is at 16 spaces, or \"            L = mid\" (12 spaces) if the if branch's body is at 12 spaces.\n\n   But the given code in the problem for program2.py has the if branch written as:\n\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n\n   This suggests that the body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the if? \n\n   The if is at 12 spaces, so the body should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the else branch's body should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   But the TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n   This is likely a formatting issue in the problem statement.\n\n   Given the instructions, we output the line that completes the else branch, and we assume the indentation is the same as the if branch's body.\n\n   Since the if branch's body is \"R = mid\", and it is at 12 spaces (which is not standard), we output \"            L = mid\" for 12 spaces.\n\n   But note: the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 12 spaces, and the else branch currently has a comment at 12 spaces. \n\n   We replace the comment with \"L = mid\", so it becomes:\n\n        else:\n            L = mid\n\n   at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   But wait, the if branch has two spaces after the if? \n\n   We count the spaces in the given code for program2.py for the if branch:\n\n        if(check(mid)):\n            R = mid\n\n   The \"R = mid\" is at the same level as the if? \n\n   This is not standard, but we mimic.\n\n   So for program1.py: \n        The else branch currently has 8 spaces for the else: \n            else:\n        and then the comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We replace the comment with a line at 12 spaces: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n   But wait, the if branch for dic2 in program1.py has:\n\n        if S[1] in dic2:\n            result += dic2[S[1]]\n            dic2[S[1]] += 1\n\n   The body is at 12 spaces (two tabs? or 8 spaces?).\n\n   The else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with a line at the same indentation as the body of the if branch, which is 12 spaces.\n\n   The if branch's body has two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n   So the else branch's body should be at 12 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program1.py is: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n   And for program2.py, the missing line is: \"            L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the program2.py's while loop is at 8 spaces, the if and else are at 8 spaces? \n\n   Let me count the spaces in the given program2.py code:\n\n        for i in range(num_level):\n            count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n        L = 0; R = max(count)\n\n        if R == 0:\n            return num_level + 1\n\n        def check(k):\n            ...\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The while loop is at 8 spaces (because the function solve is at 4 spaces, and the for loop and the rest are at 4 spaces, but the while is inside the function, so it should be at 4 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the code:\n\n        def solve(a):\n            ...   # at 4 spaces\n            for i in range(num_level):   # at 8 spaces? \n                ...   # at 12 spaces\n            L = 0; R = max(count)   # at 8 spaces\n            if R==0:   # at 8 spaces\n                return ...   # at 12 spaces\n            def check(k):   # at 8 spaces\n                ...   # at 12 spaces\n            while R - L > 1:   # at 8 spaces\n                mid = ...   # at 12 spaces\n                if ...:     # at 12 spaces\n                    R = mid   # at 16 spaces\n                else:        # at 12 spaces\n                    # TODO   # at 16 spaces\n\n   This suggests that the body of the while is at 12 spaces, and the body of the if and else should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 16 spaces, and the else branch's TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n   We replace the TODO with \"L = mid\", so the else branch becomes:\n\n                else:\n                    L = mid\n\n   at 16 spaces.\n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is: \"                L = mid\"\n\n   But the if branch's body is written as \"R = mid\" at 16 spaces, so we use 16 spaces.\n\n   Given the complexity, and to be safe, we output:\n\n        program1: \"        dic2[S[1]] = 1\"   (8 spaces at the beginning of the line? but the line itself is at 12 spaces relative to the module? \n\n   Actually, the entire program1.py code is:\n\n        t=int(input())\n        for i in range(t):\n          n=int(input())\n          result=0\n          dic1={}\n          dic2={}\n          dic3={}\n          for i in range(n):\n            S=input()\n            if S[0] in dic1:\n              result+=dic1[S[0]]\n              dic1[S[0]]+=1\n            else:\n              dic1[S[0]]=1\n            if S[1] in dic2:\n              result+=dic2[S[1]]\n              dic2[S[1]]+=1\n            else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n            if S in dic3:\n              result-=dic3[S]*2\n              dic3[S]+=1\n            else:\n              dic3[S]=1\n          print(result)\n\n   The else branch for dic2 is at 10 spaces (because the for loop is at 2, then the if is at 4, then the else is at 4, and the body should be at 6? \n\n   This is not 4-space indentation? \n\n   The code uses 2 spaces per level? \n\n   Let me count:\n\n        t=int(input())   # 0\n        for i in range(t):   # 0\n          n=int(input())   # 2\n          ...   # 2\n          for i in range(n):   # 2\n            S=input()   # 4\n            if ...:   # 4\n              ...   # 6\n            else:   # 4\n              ...   # 6\n\n   So the body of the else should be at 6 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program1.py is: \"      dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n\n   Similarly, for program2.py, the code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n   The while loop is at 8 spaces (inside the function solve, which is 4 spaces, and the while is at 8 spaces).\n\n   The body of the while is at 12 spaces.\n\n   The if and else are at 12 spaces, and their bodies should be at 16 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the missing line for program2.py is: \"                L = mid\"\n\n   But note: the if branch has \"R = mid\" at 16 spaces, so we use 16 spaces.\n\n   We output:\n\n        program1: \"      dic2[S[1]] = 1\"\n        program2: \"                L = mid\"\n\n   However, the problem says the entire sum of n over test cases is at most 200000 for program2.py, and the given code structure is fixed.\n\n   Given the above, we output the answer."
