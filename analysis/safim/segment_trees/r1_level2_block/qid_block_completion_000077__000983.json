But note: the input index i is from 1 to n.\n\n      The breaks that are affected are at positions: \n          left break: between pos-1 and pos -> index = pos-1? Actually, the break at position j (which is between a[j] and a[j+1]) is at j. So:\n          - The break at j = i-1 (if i-1>=1) -> because that break is between a[i-1] and a[i] (which is about to change because a[i] is updated).\n          - The break at j = i (between a[i] and a[i+1]). Also, if we update a[i], then the break at j = i-1 (if exists) is between a[i-1] and the new a[i]. Similarly, the break at j=i is between the new a[i] and a[i+1]. Additionally, note: if i==1, then there is no break at j=0? Actually, our breaks are from j=1 to j=n (but j=n is not counted because (n - j) * j for j=n would be 0). So we only consider j from 1 to n-1? But our initial loop ran j from 1 to n. However, for j=n, the contribution is 0. So we can consider j from 1 to n-1. Steps:\n\n        Let old = a[i]   (the current value at position i)\n\n        We are going to update a[i] to x. The breaks that we need to remove are:\n          break1: at position i-1 (if i>=2) -> condition: if a[i-1] ! = old, then this break existed and we had a contribution of (i-1) * (n - (i-1))? Actually, the break at j = i-1: the contribution is (i-1) * (n - (i-1)).\n          break2: at position i (if i<=n-1) -> condition: if old != a[i+1], then the break at j=i had contribution i * (n-i). Then we set a[i] = x. Then we add the new breaks:\n          break1: at position i-1 (if i>=2) -> if a[i-1] ! = x, then we add (i-1)*(n-(i-1))\n          break2: at position i (if i<=n-1) -> if x != a[i+1], then we add i*(n-i) Then the total breaks = old_breaks - (removed break1 and break2) + (added break1 and break2)\n\n        Then the answer for the query = base + breaks\n\n        And we output the answer. Also, note: if the update does not change the value (old==x), then we do nothing? But we still do the removal and then the addition? And if old==x, then the breaks remain the same? So we can skip? But we don't know the future, so we do the update. However, we must update the array even if old==x?",

However, the problem: the array a has been extended with a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. So when i=1, we only update the break at j=1 (if exists) and when i=n, we only update the break at j=n-1. Also, note: when i=1, we do:\n          remove break at j=0? -> no, because we only consider j>=1. And we don't have a break at j=0? Actually, our breaks are from j=1 to n. So for i=1, we only remove the break at j=1 (if exists) and then update and then add the break at j=1 (if exists). Similarly, for i=n: we remove the break at j=n-1 (if exists) and the break at j=n? But j=n: we don't consider because i<=n-1 is false. So we only remove the break at j=n-1 and then update and then add the break at j=n-1 (if exists).

Let me recalc for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n\n            base = 15.\n\n            breaks:\n              i=1: a1=1, a2=2 -> break: 1*(5-1)=4\n              i=2: a2=2, a3=2 -> no break: 0\n              i=3: a3=2, a4=4 -> break: 3*(5-3)=3*2=6\n              i=4: a4=4, a5=5 -> break: 4*(5-4)=4\n              i=5: 0\n            total_breaks = 4+6+4 = 14 -> total_ans = 15+14=29. So the example input must have been:\n\n            initial array: [1,1,2,2,5] -> but then the first query: i=3, x=2 -> that doesn't change the array?",

We can do:\n              b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0=1: 0-1 = -1) -> 1 move. b1 = 0 (leave as 0) -> 0 moves? but then -1 < 0 -> ok.\n              b2 = 3 (by adding a2=1 three times? but we can only do one move per index: either add or subtract once? Actually, the problem says: \n            \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1<=i<=n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n          This means that we can do multiple moves on the same index? The problem says: \"the minimum number of moves\"\n\n          And the example: \n            \"you can subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\"\n\n          So we did one move on index1, one move on index3, one on index4, one on index5 -> total 4 moves. And the final b: \n            b1 = 0 - a1 = -1\n            b2 = 0 -> remains 0? but the example says [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> so b2 is 0? But the array a: \n            a1=1, a2=2, a3=1, a4=4, a5=5. The moves:\n            b1: subtract a1 -> -1\n            b2: not touched -> 0\n            b3: add a3 (which is 1) -> 0+1 = 1? but the example says 3. How do we get 3 for b3? The example says: \"add a_3\" -> that would be one move: 0+1=1. But then they say \"a_4\" and \"a_5\": \n            b4: 0+4=4\n            b5: 0+5=5\n\n          Then the array b = [-1, 0, 1, 4, 5] -> which is increasing.",

So if we do 3 adds and 1 subtract, that is 4 moves and the net effect is 2*a_i. But we could have done 2 adds in 2 moves. So we would never do both add and subtract? Why?",

But then the moves are not limited per index. Example: to get b3=3, we would add a3=1 three times -> 3 moves. Then total moves: \n            b1: 1 move (subtract)\n            b3: 3 moves (add three times)\n            b4: 1 move\n            b5: 1 move\n            total = 6 moves. But the example says 4 moves. The example says: \n            \"subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\"\n\n          This suggests one move per index: \n            b1: subtract (1 move) -> -1\n            b3: add (1 move) -> 1\n            b4: add (1 move) -> 4\n            b5: add (1 move) -> 5\n          Then b = [-1, 0, 1, 4, 5] -> which is increasing. But the example output array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> which is not what we get. I see: the example says: \n            \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5]\"\n\n          and the moves: \n            subtract a1 from b1 -> b1 = -1\n            add a3 to b3 -> b3 = 1? but then they say \"and add a_3, a_4, and a_5\" -> that's three moves: one for b3, one for b4, one for b5. How do we get b3=3?",

We require: \n            b_{j} = d * a[j] < b_{j+1}   [where j+1 is to the right of j]\n\n          So for a fixed next value (which is b_{j+1}), we want the largest multiple of a[j] that is < b_{j+1]. The largest multiple of a[j] that is < b_{j+1] is: \n             floor( (b_{j+1] - 1) / a[j] ) * a[j]\n\n          Then the cost for index j is |d| = | floor( (b_{j+1]-1) / a[j] ) |. But note: if b_{j+1] is negative, then floor( (b_{j+1]-1) / a[j] ) might be negative, and the cost is the absolute value. Alternatively, we can compute d as:\n\n             d = floor( (b_{j+1] - 1) / a[j] )\n\n          and then the cost is |d|. But is that the minimal |d|? We want the largest multiple below b_{j+1], which is floor((b_{j+1]-1)/a[j]) * a[j]. And the multiplier is floor((b_{j+1]-1)/a[j]). Example: \n            a[j]=2, b_{j+1]=0: \n               floor((0-1)/2) = floor(-1/2) = floor(-0.5) = -1. then b[j] = -1 * 2 = -2, which is <0. cost = | -1 | = 1. But could we use d=0? then b[j]=0, which is not <0? -> no.\n\n          d=-1 is the only possibility. Example: \n            a[j]=2, b_{j+1] = -1: \n               floor((-1-1)/2) = floor(-2/2)=floor(-1) = -1. b[j] = -2, which is < -1 -> works.\n               cost=1. But is there a multiplier with smaller absolute value? \n            d=0: 0, which is not < -1.\n            d=-1: -2, which is < -1 -> cost=1.\n            d=1: 2, which is not < -1. So it's minimal. Therefore, for the left part:\n\n            We start with t = 0 (representing the center b_i=0). Then for the first left element (at i-1), we set: d = floor( (t - 1) / k ) [because we require b_{i-1} < t=0]\n                then the value for this element is k * d.\n                cost = |d|, and we add |d| to p. then we set t = k * d   (for the next element to the left, we will require that the element is < t) But note: the condition for the next element to the left (i-2) is: b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = t. So the next element: \n             d = floor( (t - 1) / k ) [for the next k = a[i-2]]\n\n          However, the provided code for the right part used a variable t that is the value of the previous element (which is the next to the right).",

We can set: \n              b0 = -3\n              b1 = -2\n              b2 = -1\n              b3 = 0\n              b4 = 1\n              b5 = 2\n              b6 = 3\n            Then the moves for each: \n              c0 = -3 -> cost 3\n              c1 = -2 -> cost 2\n              c2 = -1 -> cost 1\n              c3 = 0 -> cost 0\n              c4 = 1 -> cost 1\n              c5 = 2 -> cost 2\n              c6 = 3 -> cost 3\n            total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12. But the example output is 10. How to get 10? We can set:\n              b0 = -3\n              b1 = -1  (then cost for b1: | -1 | = 1, but wait: b1 = c1 * a1 = c1 * 1, so c1 = -1 -> cost 1)\n              b2 = 0 -> cost 0\n              b3 = 1 -> cost 1\n              b4 = 2 -> cost 2\n              b5 = 3 -> cost 3\n              b6 = 4 -> cost 4\n            total = 3+1+0+1+2+3+4 = 14. Or: \n            b0 = -3 (cost 3)\n            b1 = -2 (cost 2)\n            b2 = 0 (cost 0? but then b2 = 0, which is > -2, but we skipped -1? -> we can do: \n                b0 = -3 (cost 3) b1 = -2 (cost 2)\n                b2 = 0 (cost 0) -> but then we have -3 < -2 < 0, and then we need b3>0: \n                b3 = 1 (cost 1)\n                b4 = 2 (cost 2)\n                b5 = 3 (cost 3)\n                b6 = 4 (cost 4) -> total 3+2+0+1+2+3+4 = 15. How about we reuse moves? We can set:\n            b0 = -3 (3 moves)\n            b1 = -3 + 1 = -2? -> but then we would have to do: \n                b0 = -3\n                b1 = -3 + 1 = -2 -> but how? we can only add or subtract multiples of a1=1. So to get b1 = -2, we do 2 subtracts? -> 2 moves? but then total moves for b1 is 2. Then b0 = -3 (3 moves), b1 = -2 (2 moves) -> total 5.\n\n            b2 = -2 + 1 = -1 -> 1 move -> total 6. b3 = -1 + 1 = 0 -> 1 move -> total 7.\n            b4 = 0+1=1 -> 1 move -> total 8.\n            b5 = 1+1=2 -> 1 move -> total 9.\n            b6 = 2+1=3 -> 1 move -> total 10. This yields 10. How does it work?",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an array `a` of length `n` and `m` queries. Each query updates an element and then we must output the sum of awesomeness values over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,1,1] has awesomeness 1, [1,2] has 2, [1,2,2] has 2 (because [1] and [2,2]), etc.\n\nThe initial approach in the code is:\n  n, m = map(int, input().split())\n  a = list(...) and then we do a.insert(0,0) and append 0 at the end.\n\nThen we have:\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i\n\nThis initial `ans` is the initial total awesomeness over all subarrays.\n\nHow to understand the problem?\nNote: The awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 (if the entire segment is the same) plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1]. Actually, the awesomeness is exactly 1 + (number of indices i in [l, r-1] where a[i] != a[i+1]). Why? Because each time two adjacent elements are different, we break a block.\n\nBut note: the entire array of one element has awesomeness 1 (which is 1 + 0).\n\nTherefore, the awesomeness of [l, r] = 1 + (# of indices j from l to r-1 such that a[j] != a[j+1]).\n\nThen the total sum over all subarrays is:\n  Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices j from l to r-1 such that a[j]!=a[j+1])]\n\nWe can split this into two sums:\n  = (number of subarrays) + Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} (# of indices j from l to r-1 such that a[j]!=a[j+1])\n\nThe number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThe second part: for a fixed j (from 1 to n-1), how many subarrays [l, r] are there such that j is in [l, r-1]? \nNote: j must be at least l and at most r-1, so l can be from 1 to j, and r must be from j+1 to n.\nSo the number of subarrays that include the index j (as a break between j and j+1) is j * (n - j). \nBut note: we only count the break at j if a[j] != a[j+1].\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n  total = n*(n+1)//2 + Sum_{j=1}^{n-1} [ (a[j] != a[j+1]) * (j * (n - j)) ]\n\nBut wait: the initial code does:\n  ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n  Here, i runs from 1 to n (but note: we have a[0]=0 and appended 0 at the end, so a[1]..a[n] are the original, and a[n+1]=0).\n\nIn the initial code, for i from 1 to n:\n  (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n  = (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i\n\nBut note: when i = n, then we are comparing a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0). That break should not be counted? Because the problem only considers the array from index 1 to n. However, the problem states that the array has length n. So we should only consider breaks between indices 1 to n-1.\n\nBut the initial code runs i from 1 to n, and for i=n, it checks a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0). This break (if a[n]!=0) would be counted. However, in the problem, the subarrays are only within [1, n]. So the break at position n (between a[n] and a[n+1]) is not part of any subarray? Because the subarray [l, r] only goes up to r, and the next element is beyond r. Therefore, we should not count the break at position n.\n\nBut note: the initial array a was extended with a 0 at the end? Actually, the problem does not have an extra 0. However, the code does a.insert(0,0) and then appends 0. So the array becomes:\n  index0: 0, index1: a1, index2: a2, ... index n: a_n, index n+1: 0.\n\nIn the initial loop, i runs from 1 to n. For i from 1 to n-1: we are checking the breaks that are within the array (between a_i and a_{i+1}, which is the break at i). For i = n: we are checking a_n and a_{n+1} (which is 0). This break is not part of any subarray? \n\nBut note: the subarray that ends at n does not include the next element (which is 0). So the break at n (if a[n]!=0) is not included in any subarray. Therefore, we should not count it.\n\nSo the initial code might be counting an extra break? However, the problem example: \n  n=5, a = [1,2,2,4,5] (after the first query) -> the initial array is [1,2,2,4,5] and then we have a[0]=0 and a[6]=0.\n\nIn the initial code, the breaks are at:\n  i=1: a1=1, a2=2 -> break -> count: 1 * (5-1) * 1 = 1*4*1 = 4\n  i=2: a2=2, a3=2 -> no break -> 0\n  i=3: a3=2, a4=4 -> break -> 1 * (5-3) * 3 = 1*2*3 = 6\n  i=4: a4=4, a5=5 -> break -> 1 * (5-4)*4 = 1*1*4 = 4\n  i=5: a5=5, a6=0 -> break -> 1 * (5-5)*5 = 1*0*5 = 0? Actually, (n - (i+1)+1) = (5-6+1)=0? \n  But note: (n - (i+1) + 1) = (5 - (5+1) + 1) = 5-6+1 = 0.\n\nSo the break at i=5 is multiplied by 0. So it is not counted. Therefore, the initial code is correct.\n\nSo the initial total is:\n  total = (number of subarrays) + (sum of contributions from breaks at positions 1 to n-1, each break at j contributes j*(n-j))\n\nBut note: the initial code does not have the term for the number of subarrays? \n\nWait: the initial code only has the break contributions. How do we account for the base 1 for each subarray?\n\nActually, the base 1 for each subarray is n*(n+1)//2. But the initial code does not add that? \n\nLet me check the example: \n  The example says after the first query the answer is 29.\n\n  The base: number of subarrays = 15.\n  The breaks: \n      break at index1: 1*(5-1) = 4 -> but the code multiplies by i and (n-i) -> 1*(5-1)=4? Actually, the code does: (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1)+1) * i = (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (n-i) * i.\n      So for i=1: 1 * (5-1) * 1 = 4.\n      i=2: 0\n      i=3: 1 * (5-3) * 3 = 2*3=6\n      i=4: 1 * (5-4)*4 = 1*4=4\n      i=5: 0 (as above)\n      total breaks = 4+6+4 = 14.\n\n  Then total = base (15) + breaks (14) = 29.\n\nSo the initial code does not have the base? But wait, the initial code sets ans=0 and then adds the breaks. Then we are missing the base.\n\nBut note: the example output is 29, and the initial code must output 29. Therefore, the base must be included.\n\nHow? The base (the 1 for each subarray) is not being added in the loop. \n\nBut the problem: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 + (# of breaks in [l, r-1]). The breaks we are counting are the contributions of each break to the subarrays that include that break. And the base 1 for each subarray is the entire set of subarrays. So we must add n*(n+1)//2.\n\nBut the initial code does not do that. \n\nLooking at the example: \n  The initial array is given, and then the initial loop runs and sets ans to 4+0+6+4 = 14. Then we have to add the base? \n\nBut the example output after the first query is 29. So we must have 14 (from breaks) plus 15 (from base) = 29.\n\nTherefore, the initial ans should be set to n*(n+1)//2 plus the breaks.\n\nBut the code sets ans=0 and then adds the breaks. So we are missing the base.\n\nSo we must add the base at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"after each query\" we output the total. So the initial state must be computed and then we update for each query.\n\nTherefore, we should set:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  breaks = 0\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      breaks += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i   # because (n - (i+1)+1) = n-i\n  ans = base + breaks\n\nBut the code does not have the base. So we must fix that.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the initial array is given and then we process m queries. The initial code does not output the initial state? It only outputs after each query. But the problem says \"after each query\" we output the answer. The first query is the first update.\n\nSo the initial state (before any query) is the initial array. Then we must output the answer for the initial array? But the problem says \"after each query\", meaning after the first query, then after the second, etc. So we have m queries and we output m lines.\n\nBut the code does not output the initial state. It only starts processing queries. So we must output the initial state? Actually, no: the problem says \"after each query\", meaning we have m queries and we output m lines. The first output is after the first query.\n\nBut note: the initial array is given, and then the first query updates one element. So the initial state (without any update) is not output? \n\nHowever, the example: \n  Input: \n      5 1\n      1 1 2 2 5\n      3 2\n  Then after the first query (which updates index 3 to 2) we get [1,1,2,2,5] becomes [1,1,2,2,5] -> wait, the update is: i=3, x=2 -> so the third element becomes 2. The array was [1,1,2,2,5] and becomes [1,1,2,2,5]? Actually, the third element was 2 and becomes 2? So no change? Then the answer is the same as the initial state.\n\nBut the example output is 29. So we must output the initial state? Actually, the problem says: \"after each query\", meaning after processing the query (even if the value doesn't change, we still output the current total).\n\nBut the initial state (before any query) is not output. The first output is after the first query.\n\nSo the code must compute the initial total (for the given array) and then update for each query. However, the problem does not require the initial state (without any update) to be output. The first query updates the array and then we output the total for the updated array.\n\nBut note: the initial array is given and then the queries. The initial total for the given array (without any update) is the starting point. Then we update the array and update the total accordingly.\n\nTherefore, we must compute the initial total (base + breaks) and then for each query, we update the breaks at the positions that are affected by the update.\n\nHow does an update affect the breaks?\nAn update at position i (changing a[i] to x) may affect the breaks at positions i-1 (between i-1 and i) and i (between i and i+1). \n\nSo we have to:\n  - Remove the contributions of the breaks at positions i-1 and i (if they exist) from the total breaks.\n  - Update a[i] to x.\n  - Add the contributions of the breaks at positions i-1 and i (if they now exist) to the total breaks.\n\nThen the total answer = base (which is n*(n+1)//2) + (current breaks total).\n\nBut note: the base is constant. So we only need to maintain the breaks total.\n\nSteps for the update:\n\n  Let base = n*(n+1)//2   (this is constant)\n\n  We maintain:\n      a[0..n+1] (with a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0)\n      ans = base + (sum of contributions from breaks at positions 1 to n)\n\n  For a query (i, x):\n      Let pos = i   (the index to update, note: our array a has indices 0..n+1, so the element at position i is a[i] in the list? Actually, we inserted 0 at the beginning, so the original a1 is at index1, and the update index i is at a[i] in the list? But note: the input index i is from 1 to n.\n\n      The breaks that are affected are at positions: \n          left break: between pos-1 and pos -> index = pos-1? Actually, the break at position j (which is between a[j] and a[j+1]) is at j. So:\n          - The break at j = i-1 (if i-1>=1) -> because that break is between a[i-1] and a[i] (which is about to change because a[i] is updated).\n          - The break at j = i (between a[i] and a[i+1]).\n\n      Also, if we update a[i], then the break at j = i-1 (if exists) is between a[i-1] and the new a[i]. Similarly, the break at j=i is between the new a[i] and a[i+1].\n\n      Additionally, note: if i==1, then there is no break at j=0? Actually, our breaks are from j=1 to j=n (but j=n is not counted because (n - j) * j for j=n would be 0). So we only consider j from 1 to n-1? But our initial loop ran j from 1 to n. However, for j=n, the contribution is 0. So we can consider j from 1 to n-1.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Let old = a[i]   (the current value at position i)\n\n        We are going to update a[i] to x.\n\n        The breaks that we need to remove are:\n          break1: at position i-1 (if i>=2) -> condition: if a[i-1] != old, then this break existed and we had a contribution of (i-1) * (n - (i-1))? Actually, the break at j = i-1: the contribution is (i-1) * (n - (i-1)).\n          break2: at position i (if i<=n-1) -> condition: if old != a[i+1], then the break at j=i had contribution i * (n-i).\n\n        Then we set a[i] = x.\n\n        Then we add the new breaks:\n          break1: at position i-1 (if i>=2) -> if a[i-1] != x, then we add (i-1)*(n-(i-1))\n          break2: at position i (if i<=n-1) -> if x != a[i+1], then we add i*(n-i)\n\n        Then the total breaks = old_breaks - (removed break1 and break2) + (added break1 and break2)\n\n        Then the answer for the query = base + breaks\n\n        And we output the answer.\n\n        Also, note: if the update does not change the value (old==x), then we do nothing? But we still do the removal and then the addition? And if old==x, then the breaks remain the same? So we can skip? But we don't know the future, so we do the update.\n\n        However, we must update the array even if old==x? Because the next update might be at the same index? But the problem says \"from now on the i-th element is x\", so if old==x, we don't need to change the breaks. But to keep the code clean, we do:\n\n          Remove the breaks that were there (if any) and then add the breaks that are there after update (if any). And if the breaks are the same, then the total breaks doesn't change.\n\n        But note: the breaks might change even if old==x? Actually, no: because the value doesn't change. So we can avoid if old==x? But the problem constraints say that m can be up to 10^5, and we are doing a constant number of operations per update, so it's acceptable to do the removal and then the addition even if the breaks are the same.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if the break condition changes? For example, if the break at i-1 was present and after update it is still present? Then we remove (i-1)*(n-i+1) and then add the same? Then net 0. Similarly for the break at i.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Let total_breaks = ... (we maintain a global variable for the total breaks)\n\n          Steps for update at index i (1-indexed) to x:\n\n            old = a[i]\n\n            # remove breaks at i-1 and i (if they existed) and subtract their contributions\n            for j in [i-1, i]:\n                if j < 1: continue   # j must be at least 1\n                if j >= n: continue   # because break at j is between j and j+1, so j must be <= n-1? Actually, j from 1 to n-1.\n\n                But note: j = i-1: we require j>=1 and j<=n-1 -> so i>=2 and i-1<=n-1 -> i>=2 and i<=n.\n                j = i: we require i>=1 and i<=n-1.\n\n            So:\n\n              if i-1 >= 1:   # then we have a break at j = i-1\n                  if a[i-1] != old:\n                      total_breaks -= (i-1) * (n - (i-1))   # because the break at j=i-1 had this contribution\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  if old != a[i+1]:\n                      total_breaks -= i * (n - i)\n\n            Then set a[i] = x\n\n            Then:\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  if a[i-1] != x:\n                      total_breaks += (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  if x != a[i+1]:\n                      total_breaks += i * (n - i)\n\n            Then ans = base + total_breaks\n\n            Print ans.\n\n        But note: the break at j = i-1 is between a[i-1] and a[i] (which we updated). Similarly, the break at j=i is between a[i] and a[i+1].\n\n        Also, note: the break at j = i-1 might have been absent before and become present after? Or vice versa.\n\n        We must do the removal only if the break existed (i.e., the condition was true) and then add only if the condition is true after update.\n\n        We maintain the array a.\n\n        We also maintain the total_breaks (which is the sum of contributions for breaks at positions 1 to n-1).\n\n        The base is constant: base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n        We must compute the initial total_breaks: we can do that in the initial loop.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          total_breaks = 0\n          a = [0] + list_of_input + [0]   # so a[0]=0, a[1..n] = the numbers, a[n+1]=0.\n\n          for i in range(1, n):   # i from 1 to n-1? because break at i is between a[i] and a[i+1]\n              if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                  total_breaks += i * (n - i)   # note: the break at position i (which is the i-th break) is at index i, and the contribution is i*(n-i) [because the number of subarrays that include this break is i * (n-i)].\n\n          But wait: in the initial code, they did for i from 1 to n, and for i=n: it becomes 0. So we can do for i in range(1, n) and then the break at i=n is not considered? Actually, the break at i=n (if it existed) would be between a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0) and we don't count it because the subarrays don't extend beyond n. And the contribution for i=n: (n - n) * n = 0. So it doesn't matter.\n\n          However, the initial code did for i from 1 to n. We can do the same: for i in range(1, n+1): \n              if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                  total_breaks += i * (n - i)   # but for i=n: (n-i)=0, so it's 0.\n\n          Then initial_ans = base + total_breaks\n\n          But we don't output initial_ans. We only output after each query.\n\n          Then for each query:\n\n            i, x = map(int, input().split())\n            old = a[i]\n\n            # if the value doesn't change, we still do the update? It might be that the breaks change? Actually, if old==x, then the breaks remain the same. But we do the removal and then the addition and it will be the same. So we can skip? But it's constant time.\n\n            # remove breaks at i-1 and i (if they exist) and subtract their contributions\n            # for break at j = i-1: we require j>=1 and j<=n-1 -> i>=2 and i<=n\n            # for break at j = i: we require i>=1 and i<=n-1 -> i<=n-1\n\n            # Break at j = i-1 (if i>=2)\n            if i >= 2:\n                j = i-1\n                if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # here a[j+1] is the old value at position i (which is a[i])\n                    total_breaks -= j * (n - j)\n\n            if i <= n-1:\n                j = i\n                if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # here a[j] is the old value at position i, and a[j+1] is a[i+1]\n                    total_breaks -= j * (n - j)\n\n            # Now update a[i] to x\n            a[i] = x\n\n            # Add the breaks at i-1 and i (if they exist now)\n            if i >= 2:\n                j = i-1\n                if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # now a[j] is the same as before, but a[j+1] is the new x\n                    total_breaks += j * (n - j)\n\n            if i <= n-1:\n                j = i\n                if a[j] != a[j+1]:\n                    total_breaks += j * (n - j)\n\n            ans = base + total_breaks\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the break at j = i-1: we are checking the break between a[i-1] and a[i] (which is now x). Similarly, the break at j=i: between a[i] (x) and a[i+1].\n\n        However, what if the update at i affects the break at i-2? No, because the break at i-2 is between a[i-2] and a[i-1] and that doesn't involve a[i]. Similarly, the break at i+1: that is between a[i+1] and a[i+2] and is not affected.\n\n        Therefore, we only update the two adjacent breaks.\n\n        But note: the break at j = i-1 is at position i-1, which is between a[i-1] and a[i]. The break at j = i is at position i, which is between a[i] and a[i+1].\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, the problem: the array a has been extended with a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. So when i=1, we only update the break at j=1 (if exists) and when i=n, we only update the break at j=n-1.\n\n        Also, note: when i=1, we do:\n          remove break at j=0? -> no, because we only consider j>=1. And we don't have a break at j=0? Actually, our breaks are from j=1 to n. So for i=1, we only remove the break at j=1 (if exists) and then update and then add the break at j=1 (if exists).\n\n        Similarly, for i=n: we remove the break at j=n-1 (if exists) and the break at j=n? But j=n: we don't consider because i<=n-1 is false. So we only remove the break at j=n-1 and then update and then add the break at j=n-1 (if exists).\n\n        Therefore, the code for the while loop:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          total_breaks = 0\n          # We have a = [0] + original_list + [0]\n\n          # Initialize total_breaks: for j from 1 to n (but j=n gives 0) so we can do for j in range(1, n):\n          # Actually, we can do for j in range(1, n): because j=n is 0. But the initial code did for i in range(1, n+1). We can do the same.\n\n          for j in range(1, n+1):\n              if a[j] != a[j+1]:\n                  total_breaks += j * (n - j)\n\n          # Then we process m queries.\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              data = input().split()\n              if not data: \n                  continue\n              i = int(data[0])\n              x = int(data[1])\n              old = a[i]\n              # If the new value is the same as the old, we can skip? But we do the update anyway? It's constant time.\n              # Remove breaks at positions i-1 and i (if they exist and if the indices are valid)\n              # Break at j = i-1 (if i>=2)\n              if i >= 2:\n                  j = i-1\n                  if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # a[j+1] is the old value at i\n                      total_breaks -= j * (n - j)\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  j = i\n                  if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # a[j] is the old value at i\n                      total_breaks -= j * (n - j)\n\n              # Update the array\n              a[i] = x\n\n              # Add breaks at positions i-1 and i (if they exist and if the indices are valid)\n              if i >= 2:\n                  j = i-1\n                  if a[j] != a[j+1]:   # now a[j+1] is the new x\n                      total_breaks += j * (n - j)\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  j = i\n                  if a[j] != a[j+1]:\n                      total_breaks += j * (n - j)\n\n              ans = base + total_breaks\n              print(ans)\n\n        But note: the base is constant and we computed it at the beginning.\n\n        However, the initial code had:\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          a.insert(0,0)\n          a.append(0)\n          ans = 0   # then they did a loop that added to ans the breaks.\n\n        We are going to change that:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          total_breaks = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                  total_breaks += i * (n - i)\n\n          # Then we set current_ans = base + total_breaks, but we don't output it until after the first update.\n\n        Then for each query, we update and output the new current_ans.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"after each query\", meaning after the first query we output the answer for the array after the first update.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              ... update and then print(base + total_breaks)\n\n        However, the initial code had a while loop: while(m): ... m-=1. We can do a for loop.\n\n        But the initial code had:\n\n          while(m):\n              # TODO\n\n        We can do:\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              ... the update code ...\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          total_breaks = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                  total_breaks += i * (n - i)\n\n          # Then for each query:\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              data = input().split()\n              i = int(data[0])\n              x = int(data[1])\n              old = a[i]\n              # Remove breaks at i-1 and i (if they exist and if the indices are in [1, n-1] for the break)\n              if i >= 2:\n                  # break at j = i-1\n                  if a[i-1] != old:\n                      total_breaks -= (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  if old != a[i+1]:\n                      total_breaks -= i * (n - i)\n\n              a[i] = x   # update\n\n              if i >= 2:\n                  if a[i-1] != x:\n                      total_breaks += (i-1) * (n - (i-1))\n              if i <= n-1:\n                  if x != a[i+1]:\n                      total_breaks += i * (n - i)\n\n              current_ans = base + total_breaks\n              print(current_ans)\n\n        But note: the array a is 0-indexed: \n          a[0] = 0\n          a[1] ... a[n] are the elements\n          a[n+1] = 0\n\n        And the update: we are updating a[i] (which is the element at position i, so a[i] in the list).\n\n        However, the input index i is from 1 to n. So we update a[i] (which is the i-th element, and in the list that is at index i because we inserted at the beginning).\n\n        Example: n=5, a = [0,1,1,2,2,5,0]. Then update i=3: set to 2 -> a[3]=2 (which is the third element).\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Let me test with the example:\n\n          Initial array: [0,1,1,2,2,5,0]\n\n          base = 5*6//2 = 15.\n\n          total_breaks = 0\n          i=1: a[1]=1, a[2]=1 -> no break -> 0\n          i=2: a[2]=1, a[3]=2 -> break -> 2*(5-2)=2*3=6 -> total_breaks=6\n          i=3: a[3]=2, a[4]=2 -> no break -> 0\n          i=4: a[4]=2, a[5]=5 -> break -> 4*(5-4)=4*1=4 -> total_breaks=10\n          i=5: a[5]=5, a[6]=0 -> break? but 5*(5-5)=0 -> so total_breaks=10.\n\n          Then initial total_ans = 15+10 = 25? But the example after the first query (which updates index3 to 2) is 29. \n\n          Why? The example input: \n              5 1\n              1 1 2 2 5\n              3 2\n\n          The initial array is [1,1,2,2,5]. After update: the array becomes [1,1,2,2,5] -> same? \n\n          But the example output is 29.\n\n          What's the issue? \n\n          The example says: after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          Actually, the example input says: \n            The second line: 1 1 2 2 5\n            The query: 3 2 -> so update the third element to 2. The third element was 2, so it remains 2.\n\n          But the example then says: \"after the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". That doesn't match.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1<=a_i<=10^9) \u2014 the array a.\"\n\n            Then the next m lines: each query i, x.\n\n            The example: \n               5 1\n               1 1 2 2 5\n               3 2\n\n          Then the array becomes: [1,1,2,2,5] -> update index3 to 2: so the array becomes [1,1,2,2,5] -> same.\n\n          But the example says the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          Actually, the example input in the note is different? \n\n          The note says: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n          How did that happen? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries. Each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n, 1<=x<=10^9).\"\n\n          The example input in the note: \n            The array initially: [1,1,2,2,5]? \n            Then the first query: i=3, x=2 -> but that doesn't change the array.\n\n          But the example output is 29. \n\n          How do we get 29? \n\n          We get 29 for the array [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          So the example input must be:\n\n            n=5, m=1\n            initial array: [1,1,2,2,5]   -> but then the first query: i=3, x=2 -> no change -> then the array is [1,1,2,2,5] and the answer is 25? \n\n          But the example output is 29.\n\n          There is a discrepancy.\n\n          Let me recalc for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n\n            base = 15.\n\n            breaks:\n              i=1: a1=1, a2=2 -> break: 1*(5-1)=4\n              i=2: a2=2, a3=2 -> no break: 0\n              i=3: a3=2, a4=4 -> break: 3*(5-3)=3*2=6\n              i=4: a4=4, a5=5 -> break: 4*(5-4)=4\n              i=5: 0\n            total_breaks = 4+6+4 = 14 -> total_ans = 15+14=29.\n\n          So the example input must have been:\n\n            initial array: [1,1,2,2,5] -> but then the first query: i=3, x=2 -> that doesn't change the array? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the first query\" and then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          How did the array become [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          The query is: \"3 2\" -> that sets the third element to 2. But the third element was 2? \n\n          Actually, the example input in the problem statement says:\n\n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n            and then the queries.\n\n          The example input: \n            \"5 1\"\n            \"1 1 2 2 5\"\n            \"3 2\"\n\n          But then the example says: \"after the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n          This implies that the first query is not (3,2) but (2,2) and (4,4) and (5,5)? \n\n          Actually, the example says: \n            \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n          And the example query: \"3 2\" -> so the third element becomes 2. But the third element was 2. \n\n          Then the example says: \"after the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n          This suggests that the initial array was not [1,1,2,2,5] but [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n          and then the example: \n            \"1 1 2 2 5\"\n\n          So the initial array is [1,1,2,2,5]. \n\n          Then the first query: \"3 2\" -> so the array becomes [1,1,2,2,5] -> same.\n\n          But the example output is 29, which is for [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          I see: the example note says: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n          and then they list the subsegments. \n\n          So the first query must have changed the array to [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          Therefore, the first query must be: \n            i=2: set to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,2,2,5]? \n            then i=4: set to 4 -> [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          But the problem says there is only one query.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"In the next m lines\" and m=1.\n\n          So the example input must be:\n\n            n=5, m=1\n            initial array: [1,1,2,2,5]\n            query: 3 2 -> but that doesn't change.\n\n          Or the example input is:\n\n            n=5, m=1\n            initial array: [1,1,2,2,5]\n            query: 4 4   -> then the array becomes [1,1,2,4,5] -> then the breaks:\n\n              base=15\n              breaks:\n                i=1: 1 and 1 -> no break -> 0\n                i=2: 1 and 2 -> break: 2*(5-2)=6\n                i=3: 2 and 4 -> break: 3*(5-3)=6\n                i=4: 4 and 5 -> break: 4*(5-4)=4\n                total_breaks=6+6+4=16 -> total_ans=15+16=31 -> not 29.\n\n          How about query: 2 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,2,2,5]? \n            breaks:\n              i=1: 1 and 2 -> break: 1*4=4\n              i=2: 2 and 2 -> no break: 0\n              i=3: 2 and 2 -> no break: 0\n              i=4: 2 and 5 -> break: 4*1=4\n              total_breaks=8 -> total_ans=15+8=23.\n\n          How about query: 1 1 -> no change.\n\n          How about query: 1 2 -> then the array becomes [2,1,2,2,5]? \n            breaks:\n              i=1: 2 and 1 -> break: 1*4=4\n              i=2: 1 and 2 -> break: 2*3=6\n              i=3: 2 and 2 -> no break: 0\n              i=4: 2 and 5 -> break: 4*1=4\n              total_breaks=14 -> total_ans=29.\n\n          So the first query must be: i=1, x=2.\n\n          But the example input says: \n            \"3 2\"\n\n          This is a discrepancy in the problem statement.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"after the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n          and the example input: \n            \"3 2\"\n\n          doesn't yield that.\n\n          But note: the example input in the problem statement might be different from the example note? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n          and then the example: \n            \"1 1 2 2 5\"\n\n          and then the query: \n            \"3 2\"\n\n          and then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          How? \n\n          The only way is if the query is not only updating one element? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n          So it updates one element.\n\n          And the example says: after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          This implies that the initial array was [1,1,2,2,5] and then the first query updated the second element to 2 and the fourth element to 4? But that would be two queries.\n\n          I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n          But the code we write is for the general case.\n\n          We'll assume the example input is:\n\n            n=5, m=1\n            a = [1,1,2,2,5]\n            query: i=1, x=2   -> then the array becomes [2,1,2,2,5]? -> but that doesn't match [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n          Alternatively, the example input is:\n\n            n=5, m=1\n            a = [1,1,2,2,5]\n            query: i=2, x=2 -> becomes [1,2,2,2,5] -> then the breaks: \n              i=1: 1 and 2 -> break: 1*4=4\n              i=2: 2 and 2 -> no break: 0\n              i=3: 2 and 2 -> no break: 0\n              i=4: 2 and 5 -> break: 4*1=4 -> total_breaks=8 -> total_ans=23.\n\n          Or query: i=4, x=4 -> becomes [1,1,2,4,5] -> breaks: \n              i=1: 1 and 1 -> no break: 0\n              i=2: 1 and 2 -> break: 2*3=6\n              i=3: 2 and 4 -> break: 3*2=6\n              i=4: 4 and 5 -> break: 4*1=4 -> total_breaks=16 -> total_ans=31.\n\n          How do we get [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          The only way is if the initial array was [1,2,2,4,5] and there are no queries? But the problem says there is one query.\n\n          Or the initial array is [1,1,2,2,5] and the query is (2,2) and (4,4) in one query? But the problem says each query updates one element.\n\n          I think the example note has a different scenario. \n\n          We'll trust the code: for the array [1,2,2,4,5] we get 29.\n\n          And the problem says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n          So the initial array must have been different? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n          and then the example: \n            \"1 1 2 2 5\"\n\n          and then the first query: \n            \"3 2\"\n\n          and then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          This is impossible. \n\n          But note: the problem says: \n            \"the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n          and then they list the subsegments. \n\n          So the initial array might be arbitrary, and the first query updates index 3 to 2, but the initial array was not [1,1,2,2,5]? \n\n          The problem does not specify the initial array in the note. \n\n          The note says: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n          So we don't know the initial array. \n\n          We'll assume the code is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we write the code as described.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n          We are given an array a of n positive integers. \n          We start with b = [0,0,...,0] (n zeros).\n          In one move, we can choose an index i and either add a[i] to b[i] or subtract a[i] from b[i].\n          We want to make b strictly increasing (b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1]) with minimum moves.\n\n        Example1: \n          Input: \n            5\n            1 2 1 4 5\n          Output: \n            4\n\n          How? \n            We can do:\n              b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0=1: 0-1 = -1) -> 1 move.\n              b1 = 0 (leave as 0) -> 0 moves? but then -1 < 0 -> ok.\n              b2 = 3 (by adding a2=1 three times? but we can only do one move per index: either add or subtract once? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1<=i<=n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n          This means that we can do multiple moves on the same index? \n\n          The problem says: \"the minimum number of moves\"\n\n          And the example: \n            \"you can subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\"\n\n          So we did one move on index1, one move on index3, one on index4, one on index5 -> total 4 moves.\n\n          And the final b: \n            b1 = 0 - a1 = -1\n            b2 = 0 -> remains 0? but the example says [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> so b2 is 0? \n\n          But the array a: \n            a1=1, a2=2, a3=1, a4=4, a5=5.\n\n          The moves:\n            b1: subtract a1 -> -1\n            b2: not touched -> 0\n            b3: add a3 (which is 1) -> 0+1 = 1? but the example says 3.\n\n          How do we get 3 for b3? \n\n          The example says: \"add a_3\" -> that would be one move: 0+1=1.\n\n          But then they say \"a_4\" and \"a_5\": \n            b4: 0+4=4\n            b5: 0+5=5\n\n          Then the array b = [-1, 0, 1, 4, 5] -> which is increasing.\n\n          Why does the example say [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5]? \n\n          There is a discrepancy.\n\n          The example says: \n            \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n          How do we get 3 for b3? \n\n          We can do multiple moves on the same index? \n\n          The problem says: \"In one move you can choose an integer i ... and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n          This means that we can do the same index multiple times? \n\n          But then the moves are not limited per index.\n\n          Example: to get b3=3, we would add a3=1 three times -> 3 moves.\n\n          Then total moves: \n            b1: 1 move (subtract)\n            b3: 3 moves (add three times)\n            b4: 1 move\n            b5: 1 move\n            total = 6 moves.\n\n          But the example says 4 moves.\n\n          The example says: \n            \"subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\"\n\n          This suggests one move per index: \n            b1: subtract (1 move) -> -1\n            b3: add (1 move) -> 1\n            b4: add (1 move) -> 4\n            b5: add (1 move) -> 5\n          Then b = [-1, 0, 1, 4, 5] -> which is increasing.\n\n          But the example output array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> which is not what we get.\n\n          I see: the example says: \n            \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5]\"\n\n          and the moves: \n            subtract a1 from b1 -> b1 = -1\n            add a3 to b3 -> b3 = 1? \n            but then they say \"and add a_3, a_4, and a_5\" -> that's three moves: one for b3, one for b4, one for b5.\n\n          How do we get b3=3? \n\n          Unless they did three moves on b3? \n\n          But then the total moves would be 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 1 (for b4) + 1 (for b5) = 6.\n\n          The example says 4 moves.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n          This means that in one move, we choose one index i and then we either add or subtract a_i. We can do multiple moves on the same index.\n\n          The goal: minimize the total number of moves.\n\n          Example1: \n            n=5, a = [1,2,1,4,5]\n\n          We want b0 < b1 < b2 < b3 < b4.\n\n          We start with [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n          One solution: \n            b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0=1)\n            b1 = 0 (0 moves) -> but then b0=-1 < b1=0 -> ok.\n            b2: we need b2 > b1=0. We can set b2 = 1 (by adding a2=1: one move) -> then b2=1.\n            b3: must be >1. We can set b3 = 4 (by adding a3=4: one move) -> 4>1 -> ok.\n            b4: must be >4. We can set b4=5 (by adding a4=5: one move) -> 5>4 -> ok.\n\n          Total moves: 1+0+1+1+1 = 4.\n\n          And the array: [-1,0,1,4,5] -> which is increasing.\n\n          But the example output is 4, and the example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]? \n\n          Why 3 for b2? \n\n          The example says: \n            \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5]\"\n\n          This might be a typo. They meant [ -1, 0, 1, 4, 5].\n\n          Or they did:\n\n            b0 = -1\n            b1 = 0\n            b2 = 3: how? \n              We can do: \n                b2: start at 0, then add a2=1 three times? -> 3 moves -> then b2=3.\n            b3 = 4: one move\n            b4 = 5: one move\n            total moves = 1+0+3+1+1 = 6.\n\n          But 6 is not the minimum.\n\n          Therefore, the example final array might be a typo.\n\n        Now, the code for program2.py:\n\n          We are given:\n            import math\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split(' '))) # numbers w/ ws\n\n            c = None\n            d = 0\n            for i in range(len(a)):\n                p = 0\n                t = 0\n                for k in a[i+1:]:\n                    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n                    t = k*d\n                    p += d\n                t = 0\n                for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if c == None or p < c:\n                    c = p\n\n            print(c)\n\n        How to solve the problem?\n\n          We are allowed to do any number of moves on any index. The moves on index i: we can do any integer number of moves (positive or negative) and the value of b[i] = (number of moves) * a[i] * (either positive or negative? but note: we can add or subtract, so the net moves can be positive or negative) -> actually, the net effect is that b[i] = c_i * a[i], where c_i is an integer (positive, negative, or zero).\n\n          We want b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1], and minimize the total absolute moves? But note: the total moves is the sum of |c_i| over i.\n\n          However, the problem does not require the moves to be in one direction. We can do both add and subtract on the same index? \n\n          But then: if we do 2 adds and 1 subtract on the same index, that is equivalent to 1 add. So we can assume that the net effect is one move: either we add a_i some number of times or subtract some number of times, but we can combine to get any integer multiple. And the cost is the absolute value of the net number of moves? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: in one move, we choose an index and then either add or subtract. So if we do 3 adds and 1 subtract, that is 4 moves and the net effect is 2*a_i. But we could have done 2 adds in 2 moves. So we would never do both add and subtract? \n\n          Why? Because if we do both, we can cancel them out. So the minimal moves for a desired net effect c_i (which can be any integer) is |c_i|. \n\n          Therefore, we can let b[i] = c_i * a[i], and we want to choose integers c_i to minimize sum_i |c_i|, subject to:\n            c_0 * a[0] < c_1 * a[1] < ... < c_{n-1} * a[n-1]\n\n          And we start with b[i]=0, so c_i=0 is the start.\n\n          But we can change.\n\n          How to minimize the total |c_i|? \n\n          This is a dynamic programming problem.\n\n          However, the constraints: n<=5000.\n\n          We can try to fix the values of c_i, but they can be very large.\n\n          Alternative: \n\n          We note that we can always shift the entire array by a constant. But the condition is relative.\n\n          We want b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1].\n\n          We can try to greedily assign b[i] as small as possible.\n\n          But the cost is the sum of |b[i]/a[i]| (if we let c_i = b[i]/a[i], but b[i] must be a multiple of a[i]). \n\n          Actually, b[i] must be an integer multiple of a[i]: b[i] = c_i * a[i].\n\n          We want to choose integers c_i such that:\n            c_0 * a[0] < c_1 * a[1] < ... < c_{n-1} * a[n-1]\n\n          and minimize sum_i |c_i|.\n\n          We start with c_i=0 for all, and then we can adjust.\n\n          We can do DP: \n            Let dp[i][k] = minimum total moves for the first i+1 elements such that b[i] = k * a[i] (for some integer k) and the sequence is strictly increasing up to i.\n\n          But k can be very large.\n\n          We need to find the constraints on k.\n\n          Note: we can always shift by a large constant. But the cost is |k|, so we want to avoid large |k|.\n\n          How about we try to assign b[i] as close to 0 as possible? \n\n          But the condition: b[0] must be < b[1] < ... \n\n          We can do:\n\n            b[0] = c0 * a0, and we want to minimize |c0|.\n\n            Then b[1] must be > b[0], and we want to minimize |c1|, etc.\n\n          But the choices for b1: it must be at least b0+1, and it must be a multiple of a1.\n\n          How about we let:\n\n            b0 = c0 * a0, and we choose c0 to be either -1,0,1,...? \n\n          We can try to use a greedy that goes from left to right, but it might not be optimal.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different approach.\n\n          Note: the problem is similar to \"minimum moves to make the array strictly increasing\" where we can only change by multiples of a[i].\n\n          We can use DP with state i and the value of b[i] modulo something? \n\n          But the state space is too large.\n\n          Insight: the minimal moves might be achieved by setting b[i] as close to 0 as possible, but satisfying the condition.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let b[0] = c0 * a0. We choose c0 to minimize |c0|, but there is no constraint from the left. However, we have to consider the next element.\n\n          We can iterate over the entire array and for each i, we consider the minimal moves for the prefix.\n\n          We can use DP with the state being the value of b[i] and then we want to minimize the total cost. But the value of b[i] can be huge.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the optimal b[i] will be in a bounded range? \n\n          But the note: Example2: \n            Input: \n              7\n              1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n            Output: \n              10\n\n          How? \n            We want b0 < b1 < ... < b6.\n            We can set: \n              b0 = -3\n              b1 = -2\n              b2 = -1\n              b3 = 0\n              b4 = 1\n              b5 = 2\n              b6 = 3\n            Then the moves for each: \n              c0 = -3 -> cost 3\n              c1 = -2 -> cost 2\n              c2 = -1 -> cost 1\n              c3 = 0 -> cost 0\n              c4 = 1 -> cost 1\n              c5 = 2 -> cost 2\n              c6 = 3 -> cost 3\n            total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\n          But the example output is 10.\n\n          How to get 10? \n            We can set:\n              b0 = -3\n              b1 = -1  (then cost for b1: | -1 | = 1, but wait: b1 = c1 * a1 = c1 * 1, so c1 = -1 -> cost 1)\n              b2 = 0 -> cost 0\n              b3 = 1 -> cost 1\n              b4 = 2 -> cost 2\n              b5 = 3 -> cost 3\n              b6 = 4 -> cost 4\n            total = 3+1+0+1+2+3+4 = 14.\n\n          Or: \n            b0 = -3 (cost 3)\n            b1 = -2 (cost 2)\n            b2 = 0 (cost 0? but then b2 = 0, which is > -2, but we skipped -1? -> we can do: \n                b0 = -3 (cost 3)\n                b1 = -2 (cost 2)\n                b2 = 0 (cost 0) -> but then we have -3 < -2 < 0, and then we need b3>0: \n                b3 = 1 (cost 1)\n                b4 = 2 (cost 2)\n                b5 = 3 (cost 3)\n                b6 = 4 (cost 4) -> total 3+2+0+1+2+3+4 = 15.\n\n          How about we reuse moves? \n\n          We can set:\n            b0 = -3 (3 moves)\n            b1 = -3 + 1 = -2? -> but then we would have to do: \n                b0 = -3\n                b1 = -3 + 1 = -2 -> but how? we can only add or subtract multiples of a1=1. \n                So to get b1 = -2, we do 2 subtracts? -> 2 moves? but then total moves for b1 is 2.\n\n            Then b0 = -3 (3 moves), b1 = -2 (2 moves) -> total 5.\n\n            b2 = -2 + 1 = -1 -> 1 move -> total 6.\n            b3 = -1 + 1 = 0 -> 1 move -> total 7.\n            b4 = 0+1=1 -> 1 move -> total 8.\n            b5 = 1+1=2 -> 1 move -> total 9.\n            b6 = 2+1=3 -> 1 move -> total 10.\n\n          This yields 10.\n\n          How does it work? \n            We are not setting b[i] independently. We are doing moves that can be distributed arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: the moves are per index. We cannot transfer moves from one index to the next.\n\n          In the above, we did:\n            index0: 3 subtracts -> b0 = 0 - 3*1 = -3.\n            index1: 2 subtracts? -> b1 = 0 - 2*1 = -2.\n            index2: 1 subtract? -> b2 = 0 - 1*1 = -1.\n            index3: 0 moves? -> b3=0 -> but then b2=-1 < b3=0 -> ok.\n            index4: 1 add -> b4=1\n            index5: 1 add -> b5=2\n            index6: 1 add -> b6=3\n\n          But then the array: [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> which is increasing.\n\n          And the moves: \n            index0: 3\n            index1: 2\n            index2: 1\n            index3: 0\n            index4: 1\n            index5: 1\n            index6: 1\n          total = 3+2+1+0+1+1+1 = 9, not 10.\n\n          How do we get 10? \n\n          The example says: \n            \"you can reach [\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves\"\n\n          How? \n            index0: 3 subtracts: 3 moves.\n            index1: 2 subtracts: 2 moves.\n            index2: 1 subtract: 1 move.\n            index3: 0 moves.\n            index4: 1 add: 1 move.\n            index5: 1 add: 1 move.\n            index6: 1 add: 1 move.\n            total = 3+2+1+0+1+1+1 = 9.\n\n          But the example says 10.\n\n          There is a mistake.\n\n          Let me read the example: \n            \"Example2: you can reach [\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3] in 10 moves\"\n\n          So they say 10.\n\n          How about if we do:\n            index0: 3 subtracts -> 3\n            index1: 2 subtracts -> 2\n            index2: 1 subtract -> 1\n            index3: 0 -> 0\n            index4: 1 add -> 1\n            index5: 2 adds? -> then b5=0+2=2 -> cost 2\n            index6: 1 add -> 1\n            total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+1 = 10.\n\n          But then the array: [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> and b5=2, b6=3 -> 2<3, but b4=1 and b5=2: 1<2, and b5=2 and b6=3: 2<3.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          But why would we do 2 adds on index5? \n\n          We can do 1 add on index5 to get 1, but then b5=1 and b4=1 -> not strictly increasing. \n\n          So we need b5>=2.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal moves for index5 is 2.\n\n          So the array: \n            b0 = -3\n            b1 = -2\n            b2 = -1\n            b3 = 0\n            b4 = 1\n            b5 = 2  (by doing 2 adds: 0+2=2)\n            b6 = 3  (1 add: 0+1=1? -> then 1, but then b5=2 and b6=1 -> not increasing) -> so we must do at least 3 adds? \n\n          How about:\n            b6 = 3: we can do 3 adds: 0+3=3 -> cost 3.\n\n          Then total = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\n          Or we can do:\n            b5 = 2 (2 adds) -> cost 2\n            b6 = 3 (1 add) -> cost 1, then b5=2 and b6=3 -> 2<3.\n\n          So that works.\n\n          Therefore, the moves for the example2 is 10.\n\n          How to compute it? \n\n          We want to assign b[i] = c_i * a[i] such that:\n            b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1]\n\n          and minimize sum |c_i|.\n\n          We can use dynamic programming. \n\n          Let dp[i][j] = the minimal total cost for the prefix ending at i, with b[i] = j * a[i] (j is an integer). But j can be very large.\n\n          We need to find the range of j.\n\n          Note: the cost is |j|, and we want to minimize the total cost, so j will be in a range around 0. But the condition might force j to be large.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different state: \n\n          We know that the condition is:\n            b[i] > b[i-1]  =>  j_i * a[i] > j_{i-1} * a[i-1]\n\n          We can try to do:\n\n            Let b[0] = j0 * a[0], and we choose j0 to be an integer. The cost for index0 is |j0|.\n\n            Then for i=1, we require:\n                j1 * a[1] > j0 * a[0]   =>   j1 >= floor( (j0 * a[0]) / a[1] ) + 1   [if we are only allowing integers]\n\n            Then we choose j1 to be the integer that minimizes |j1| and satisfies j1 >= floor( (j0 * a[0]) / a[1] ) + 1.\n\n          But then the cost for the prefix up to i is cost0 + |j0| + cost1 + |j1| + ... \n\n          However, the choice of j0 affects j1, and then j2, etc.\n\n          We can do DP over i and the value of j_{i-1}? But the state j_{i-1} can be large.\n\n          We need a better approach.\n\n          Insight: the optimal solution will have b[i] as close to the minimal as possible. The minimal b[i] we can achieve is by choosing the smallest integer j_i such that j_i * a[i] > b[i-1]. \n\n          Why? Because if we choose a larger j_i, the cost |j_i| might be higher, and it might force the next b[i+1] to be even larger, increasing the cost.\n\n          Therefore, we can do greedy:\n\n            b[0] = 0? -> cost0 = 0, but then b[0]=0.\n            Then b[1] must be >0. The smallest we can make b[1] is a[1] (by doing one add) -> cost1=1.\n            Then b[2] must be > b[1] = a[1]. The smallest b[2] we can make that is > a[1] is the smallest multiple of a[2] that is > a[1]. \n\n          But is this optimal? \n\n          Example2: a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n          Greedy:\n            b0 = 0 (cost0=0)\n            b1 must be >0 -> smallest is 1 (cost1=1)\n            b2 must be >1 -> smallest is 2 (cost2=2)\n            b3=3 (cost3=3)\n            b4=4 (cost4=4)\n            b5=5 (cost5=5)\n            b6=6 (cost6=6)\n            total cost = 0+1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.\n\n          But we know we can do 10.\n\n          So greedy in the forward direction with the smallest possible b[i] is not optimal.\n\n          How about backwards? \n\n          We can try to set the last element to 0, then the one before to -1, then -2, etc. but then the cost for the negative ones is the absolute value.\n\n          Or we can try to set the entire array to be around 0.\n\n          We can use a different greedy: \n\n            Let b[0] = c0 * a[0] with c0 chosen to be the integer that minimizes |c0|. There is no constraint from the left, so c0=0.\n\n            Then b[0]=0.\n            Then b[1] must be >0. The smallest in absolute value for c1 such that c1 * a[1] > 0 is c1=1 (if a[1] is positive) -> b[1]=a[1], cost1=1.\n            Then b[2] must be > b[1] = a[1]. We choose c2 to be the integer that minimizes |c2| such that c2 * a[2] > a[1]. \n\n            How to choose c2? \n              We want the multiple of a[2] that is > a[1] and has minimal |c2|.\n\n            For a[2]=1, a[1]=1: then the multiples: \n              c2=2: gives 2, cost=2.\n              c2=1: gives 1, but 1>1 is false.\n              c2=0: 0, not >1.\n              c2=-1: -1, not >1.\n              so minimal |c2| is 2.\n\n            Then b[2]=2, cost=2.\n\n            Then b[3] must be >2. For a[3]=1, we choose c3=3, cost=3.\n\n            ... and we get 0+1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.\n\n          Not 10.\n\n          We need a better method.\n\n          We can allow negative values. For the last element, we can set it to 0, then the one before to -1, then -2, etc. but then the cost for the negatives is the absolute value.\n\n          How about we try to set the entire array to be as close to 0 as possible, but satisfying the increasing condition.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let b[0] = 0.\n            b[1] = a[1]  (cost1=1)\n            b[2] = a[1] + 1? but then we would have to do: \n                b[2] = (a[1] // a[2] + 1) * a[2]   if a[1] is not a multiple of a[2]? \n                but then the cost = | (a[1] // a[2] + 1) |.\n\n          This is not necessarily minimal in absolute value.\n\n          Another approach: \n\n          We can use a DP that goes from left to right and for each i, we store the minimal total cost for the prefix ending at i and the value of b[i] in a compressed state.\n\n          But the state b[i] can be large.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different state: the value of c_i (the multiplier) for the last element. But c_i can be large.\n\n          We can use a greedy that goes from right to left? \n\n          We want b[n-1] to be as small as possible in absolute value? \n\n          But then the previous element must be < b[n-1].\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let b[n-1] = 0 (cost=0) -> then we minimize |c_{n-1}|=0.\n            Then b[n-2] must be <0. The closest to 0 is -a[n-2] (cost=1) -> then b[n-2] = -a[n-2].\n            Then b[n-3] must be < -a[n-2]. The closest to 0 is -a[n-2] - 1, but then we have to express as a multiple of a[n-3]. \n\n          This might not be optimal.\n\n          Given the complexity, and the code provided in program2.py, we see that the provided code has two nested loops. \n\n          The provided code:\n\n            import math\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split(' '))) # numbers w/ ws\n\n            c = None\n            d = 0\n            for i in range(len(a)):\n                p = 0\n                t = 0\n                for k in a[i+1:]:\n                    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n                    t = k*d\n                    p += d\n                t = 0\n                for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if c == None or p < c:\n                    c = p\n\n            print(c)\n\n          What is this doing?\n\n          It iterates i from 0 to n-1.\n\n          For each i, it does:\n            p = 0\n            t = 0\n            for k in a[i+1:]:   # the elements to the right of i\n                d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n                t = k*d\n                p += d\n\n            then it does a loop for the left part (reversed(a[:i])) and then sets c = min(c, p)\n\n          What is d? and t? and p?\n\n          In the first loop (for the right part), we have:\n\n            d = ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n          Example: \n            a = [1,2,1,4,5] (n=5), and i=0.\n\n            for k in a[1:]: [2,1,4,5]\n\n            k=2: \n                d = ceil((0+1)/2) = ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1\n                t = 2*1 = 2\n                p=1\n            k=1:\n                d = ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3\n                t=1*3=3\n                p=1+3=4\n            k=4:\n                d = ceil((3+1)/4)=ceil(4/4)=ceil(1)=1\n                t=4*1=4\n                p=5\n            k=5:\n                d = ceil((4+1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1\n                t=5\n                p=6\n\n          then for the left part: a[:0] is empty.\n\n          then c = 6.\n\n          Then i=1: \n            right part: a[2:]=[1,4,5]\n            k=1: \n                t=0, d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, t=1, p=1\n            k=4: d=ceil((1+1)/4)=ceil(2/4)=1, t=4, p=2\n            k=5: d=ceil((4+1)/5)=1, t=5, p=3\n            then left part: a[:1] = [1] (reversed: [1])\n            # TODO\n\n          What is the TODO for the left part?\n\n          The left part is processed in reverse order (from the element immediately to the left of i backwards to the beginning).\n\n          The code for the left part should be similar to the right part, but in reverse.\n\n          In the right part, we were ensuring that the sequence to the right is strictly increasing. We had a variable t that represented the current b value for the previous element (which is the next to the right). We then for the current element k, we choose the smallest (in absolute value of moves) multiple of k that is greater than t.\n\n          Specifically, we require b_{next} > t (which is the value we set for the previous element). We then choose the smallest multiple of k that is > t, which is: \n             d = ceil((t+1)/k)   [because we need k*d > t  => d > t/k, so the smallest integer d is ceil((t+1)/k) ???]\n\n          Let me check: \n            We require: k*d > t  => d > t/k.\n            The smallest integer d satisfying that is floor(t/k)+1, but floor(t/k)+1 = ceil((t+1)/k) ? \n\n          Example: t=0, k=2: floor(0/2)+1 = 0+1 = 1, and ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(1/2)=1.\n          t=2, k=1: floor(2/1)+1=2+1=3, ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3.\n\n          So it is floor(t/k)+1 = ceil((t+1)/k).\n\n          Therefore, the right part is: \n            starting from the element after i, we set the value for each element to be the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than the value we set for the previous element (which is the next to the right).\n\n          This is for the suffix starting at i+1.\n\n          Similarly, for the left part (from i-1 down to 0), we want a strictly increasing sequence, but now we are going backwards. So we want b_{i-1} < b_i, and then b_{i-2} < b_{i-1}, etc.\n\n          How to compute for the left part? \n\n          We want to assign values to the left part (from i-1 down to 0) such that they are strictly increasing and then connect to the current b_i.\n\n          But note: the current b_i is not fixed? \n\n          In the provided code, for a fixed i, we are not setting b_i. We are only setting the left and right parts.\n\n          The variable p is the total moves for the right part and the left part and possibly the center.\n\n          But the center (index i) is not included in the loops.\n\n          How about we are free to choose b_i? and then we minimize the total moves for the entire array.\n\n          The total moves = moves for left part + moves for right part + moves for center.\n\n          And we can choose b_i arbitrarily? \n\n          But then the condition: \n            b_{i-1} < b_i < b_{i+1}\n\n          and we minimize |c_i| for the center as well.\n\n          However, the code does not include the center in the loops.\n\n          The structure:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                p = 0   # total moves for this i\n                # right part: from i+1 to end\n                t = 0   # this might be the initial value for the first element to the right? \n                for k in a[i+1:]:\n                    d = ceil((t+1)/k)   # the smallest integer d such that k*d > t\n                    t = k * d            # the value we set for this element\n                    p += d               # the cost for this element is |d|, but d is positive? \n\n                # then left part: from i-1 down to 0\n                t = 0   # reset t to 0? \n                for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # k takes a[i-1], then a[i-2], ... \n                    # TODO: similarly, we want to set the value for this element to be the largest multiple of k that is < t (the next element to the right, which is the one we just did) but wait, we are going backwards.\n\n          For the left part, we are going from i-1 down to 0. We want:\n            b_{i-1} < b_i, and b_{i-2} < b_{i-1}, etc.\n\n          But we haven't set b_i yet.\n\n          How about we set the entire array to be 0 at the center? \n\n          Actually, the code sets t=0 for the left part. Then for the first element to the left (which is a[i-1]), we want to set it to a value that is < 0 (the next to the right, which is the center?).\n\n          But then the next element to the left must be < the value we set for a[i-1].\n\n          So for the left part, we are going from the center to the left, and we want strictly decreasing values? but then the array should be increasing from left to right.\n\n          Actually, when we go from left to right: \n            b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\n          When we go from right to left in the left part, we are doing:\n\n            We start at the center (b_i =0) and then move left: we want b_{i-1} < b_i =0.\n\n          So for the element at i-1, we want to choose a value b_{i-1} = d * a[i-1] that is < 0, and as close to 0 as possible (to minimize |d|). The closest is -a[i-1] (if we do one subtract) -> cost 1.\n\n          Then for the next to the left (i-2), we want b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = -a[i-1].\n\n          So we choose the largest multiple of a[i-2] that is < -a[i-1]. \n\n          How to compute d for the left part? \n\n          We require: \n            b_{j} = d * a[j] < b_{j+1}   [where j+1 is to the right of j]\n\n          So for a fixed next value (which is b_{j+1}), we want the largest multiple of a[j] that is < b_{j+1].\n\n          The largest multiple of a[j] that is < b_{j+1] is: \n             floor( (b_{j+1] - 1) / a[j] ) * a[j]\n\n          Then the cost for index j is |d| = | floor( (b_{j+1]-1) / a[j] ) |.\n\n          But note: if b_{j+1] is negative, then floor( (b_{j+1]-1) / a[j] ) might be negative, and the cost is the absolute value.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute d as:\n\n             d = floor( (b_{j+1] - 1) / a[j] )\n\n          and then the cost is |d|.\n\n          But is that the minimal |d|? \n\n          We want the largest multiple below b_{j+1], which is floor((b_{j+1]-1)/a[j]) * a[j]. And the multiplier is floor((b_{j+1]-1)/a[j]). \n\n          Example: \n            a[j]=2, b_{j+1]=0: \n               floor((0-1)/2) = floor(-1/2) = floor(-0.5) = -1.\n               then b[j] = -1 * 2 = -2, which is <0.\n               cost = | -1 | = 1.\n\n          But could we use d=0? then b[j]=0, which is not <0? -> no.\n\n          d=-1 is the only possibility.\n\n          Example: \n            a[j]=2, b_{j+1] = -1: \n               floor((-1-1)/2) = floor(-2/2)=floor(-1) = -1.\n               b[j] = -2, which is < -1 -> works.\n               cost=1.\n\n          But is there a multiplier with smaller absolute value? \n            d=0: 0, which is not < -1.\n            d=-1: -2, which is < -1 -> cost=1.\n            d=1: 2, which is not < -1.\n\n          So it's minimal.\n\n          Therefore, for the left part:\n\n            We start with t = 0 (representing the center b_i=0).\n            Then for the first left element (at i-1), we set:\n                d = floor( (t - 1) / k )   [because we require b_{i-1} < t=0]\n                then the value for this element is k * d.\n                cost = |d|, and we add |d| to p.\n                then we set t = k * d   (for the next element to the left, we will require that the element is < t)\n\n          But note: the condition for the next element to the left (i-2) is: b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} = t.\n\n          So the next element: \n             d = floor( (t - 1) / k )   [for the next k = a[i-2]]\n\n          However, the provided code for the right part used a variable t that is the value of the previous element (which is the next to the right). For the left part, we are going from the center to the left, so the previous element in the iteration is the one to the right"
