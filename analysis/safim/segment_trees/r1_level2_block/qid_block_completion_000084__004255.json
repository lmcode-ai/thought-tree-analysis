      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each update query. The awesomeness of a subsegment is defined as the minimum number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers into which the subsegment can be split. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the input values, including the array size `n`, the number of queries `m`, the initial array `a`, and the desired arrangement (which is read but not used in the solution).\n2. **Initial Calculation**: Compute the initial sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments. The sum can be broken down into two parts:\n   - **Base Value**: The number of all possible subsegments, which is `n*(n+1)/2`.\n   - **Difference Contribution**: For each position `i` from `1` to `n-1`, if `a[i]` differs from `a[i-1]`, add `i*(n-i)` to the sum. This accounts for all subsegments that include the segment between `i-1` and `i`.\n3. **Processing Queries**: For each query:\n   - **Update the Array**: Modify the array at the specified position.\n   - **Adjust the Sum**: Recalculate the contribution of the adjacent segments (left and right) to the total sum. The left segment involves the updated position and its left neighbor, and the right segment involves the updated position and its right neighbor. Adjust the total sum based on whether the differences before and after the update change.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing each query, output the current sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = input()\ndesired0 = input()\ndesired1 = input()\nbase = n * (n + 1) // 2\ns = 0\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if a[i] != a[i - 1]:\n        s += i * (n - i)\nans = base + s\nfor _ in range(m):\n    data = input().split()\n    pos = int(data[0]) - 1\n    x = int(data[1])\n    if pos > 0:\n        if a[pos] != a[pos - 1]:\n            old_left = 1\n        else:\n            old_left = 0\n        if x != a[pos - 1]:\n            new_left = 1\n        else:\n            new_left = 0\n        change_left = new_left - old_left\n        ans += change_left * pos * (n - pos)\n    if pos < n - 1:\n        if a[pos] != a[pos + 1]:\n            old_right = 1\n        else:\n            old_right = 0\n        if x != a[pos + 1]:\n            new_right = 1\n        else:\n            new_right = 0\n        change_right = new_right - old_right\n        ans += change_right * (pos + 1) * (n - pos - 1)\n    a[pos] = x\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: The code starts by reading the dimensions of the array and the number of queries. It then reads the initial array and the desired arrangement (which is not used further in the computation).\n2. **Initial Calculation**: The base value for the sum of awesomeness is initialized as the total number of subsegments, `n*(n+1)/2`. The difference contribution is calculated by iterating through the array and adding `i*(n-i)` for each position where the current element differs from the previous one.\n3. **Processing Queries**: For each query:\n   - The position to update and the new value are read.\n   - The left and right adjacent segments are checked. If the update changes the difference between the updated element and its",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to solve the problem by tracking the difference in the prefix sums of the two rows for the current arrangement and the desired arrangement.\n\n However, note that the problem is about swapping adjacent cells. We can think of the entire grid as two rows. The key observation is that the total number of 1s in the entire grid must be the same in the initial and desired arrangements. Otherwise, we output -1.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire grid to have the same total? Actually, the problem says: \"if it is possible to get the desired arrangement\". And indeed, if the total number of 1s in the entire grid (across both rows) is not the same in the initial and desired, then it's impossible.\n\n However, note that the grid has two rows. We have two rows in the initial and two in the desired. We must have:\n   total_initial = (sum of first row of initial) + (sum of second row of initial)\n   total_desired = (sum of first row of desired) + (sum of second row of desired)\n\n If total_initial != total_desired, then we output -1.\n\n But note: the problem also has constraints on the moves: we can only swap adjacent cells (so the total number of 1s remains constant). Therefore, the total must be the same.\n\n However, there is another invariant: the parity of the arrangement? Actually, no. But note: the problem does not require preserving the row-wise counts? Actually, swapping adjacent cells (which can be in the same row or between rows) can change the row-wise counts. However, the overall total is preserved.\n\n Therefore, step 1: check that the total number of 1s in the entire initial grid equals that in the desired grid. If not, output -1 for every query? Actually, the problem has no queries that change the total? But note: the input is fixed. We are given the initial arrangement and then the desired arrangement. Then we have to compute the minimal steps.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"after each query\" but the input does not have queries that change the arrangement? Actually, the input format is:\n\n   First line: n\n   Next two lines: current arrangement (two lines of n integers)\n   Next two lines: desired arrangement (two lines of n integers)\n\n And then there are no more lines? Actually, the problem says: \"There are m queries\" but in the input specification: \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries.\" However, the sample input does not show m queries? Actually, the problem says: \"The first line contains an integer n ... Following two lines ... The last two lines ...\"\n\n But then the problem says: \"after each query print the answer\". However, the input does not specify m? Actually, the first line is \"n and m\", but in the problem statement: \"The first line contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000) \u2014 the number of columns in the puzzle.\" and then two lines for current, then two lines for desired? Then the next m lines are queries? \n\n But the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n and m (1<=n, m<=100000)\".\n\n So the input is:\n\n   n m\n   first row of initial (n integers)\n   second row of initial (n integers)\n   then m lines, each with i and x (meaning update the i-th element of the array a to x? but note: the array a is the entire grid? Actually, the problem says: \"the array a\" of length n? But we have two rows.\n\n Let me re-read: \"You are given an array a of length n.\" and then the next two lines: the first line is the first row? and the second line is the second row? Actually, the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" and then the third line contains n integers? So the initial arrangement is:\n\n   row0: a1, a2, ..., an\n   row1: the next n integers\n\n Then the desired arrangement is given in the next two lines? But the problem says: \"the last two lines\" and then the queries? Actually, the problem says: \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries.\" \n\n So the input:\n\n   n, m\n   a[0][0] ... a[0][n-1]\n   a[1][0] ... a[1][n-1]\n   then the next two lines are the desired arrangement? Actually, no. The problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" meaning after the initial arrangement and before the queries? But then the queries are given.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Following two lines describe the current arrangement\" and then \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\". Then the queries? Actually, the problem says: \"There are m queries\" and they are given in the next m lines.\n\n But the sample input in the note does not have m? Actually, the note says:\n\n   Input: \n        5 5\n        1 2 2 4 5\n        3 2\n        4 2\n        3 1\n        2 1\n        2 2\n\n   But wait, that doesn't match. The problem says: the initial array is given in the second line (n integers) and the next line is the second row? Then the desired arrangement is two lines? Then the queries? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" and then the third line contains n integers? Then the next two lines? No, the problem says: \"the last two lines\" meaning the desired arrangement is given in two lines? But then the queries? \n\n But the input specification: \n   - first line: n, m\n   - second line: n integers (first row of current)\n   - third line: n integers (second row of current)\n   - then m lines: each query (i, x)\n\n And then the desired arrangement? It is not given? \n\n This is confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement in the same format.\" \n\n So the input is:\n\n   n m\n   [current row0: n integers]\n   [current row1: n integers]\n   [desired row0: n integers]\n   [desired row1: n integers]\n   then m lines of queries? \n\n But then the problem says: \"after each query\" meaning we have to update the current arrangement and then compute the answer? \n\n However, the problem says: \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\" \n\n But note: the array a is the entire grid? Actually, the problem says: \"the array a\" of length n? But we have two rows. \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \n        5 5\n        1 2 2 4 5\n        3 2\n        4 2\n        3 1\n        2 1\n        2 2\n\n This does not look like two rows for desired? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" \u2014 that is the first row. Then the next line is the second row? Then the desired arrangement is two lines? Then the queries? \n\n But the example input has 5 5, then a row of 5 numbers, then 5 lines of two numbers? \n\n This matches: \n   n=5, m=5\n   first row: [1,2,2,4,5]\n   second row: [3,2] -> wait, that is only two numbers? \n\n Actually, the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n   Input: \n        5 5\n        1 2 2 4 5\n        3 2\n        4 2\n        3 1\n        2 1\n        2 2\n\n This is 6 lines. The second line has 5 numbers, then the next 5 lines have 2 numbers each. \n\n But the problem says: the current arrangement is two lines. So the second row should be one line of 5 numbers. \n\n Therefore, the example input must be:\n\n   n=5, m=5\n   first row: [1,2,2,4,5]\n   second row: [3,2, ...] -> but the next line is \"3 2\", which is two numbers? \n\n This is inconsistent.\n\n After reading the problem again: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" and \"the next line\" (third line) contains n integers? Then the next two lines are the desired arrangement? But then the queries? \n\n But the problem says: \"There are m queries\" and m is given in the first line. \n\n So the input should be:\n\n   Line1: n, m\n   Line2: n integers for the first row of current\n   Line3: n integers for the second row of current\n   Line4: n integers for the first row of desired\n   Line5: n integers for the second row of desired\n   Then m lines: each with i and x\n\n However, the example input has 5 5 and then 5 numbers, then 5 lines of two numbers. \n\n This does not match. \n\n I see: the problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" \u2014 meaning that the desired arrangement is given after the current arrangement and before the queries? But then the queries are m lines. \n\n But the example input has 5 5, then one line of 5 numbers, then 5 lines of two numbers. \n\n How can that be? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" \u2014 that is the first row of the current. Then the next line (third) is the second row of the current? But the example input after 5 5 has:\n\n   \"1 2 2 4 5\" -> that's 5 numbers: first row\n   then \"3 2\" -> that's two numbers? but we need 5 for the second row.\n\n This is a mistake in the example? \n\n But the problem statement says: \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries. Each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n, 1<=x<=10^9).\"\n\n And the example input has 5 queries: \n        3 2\n        4 2\n        3 1\n        2 1\n        2 2\n\n So the input has 1 (first line) + 1 (second line) + 5 (queries) = 7 lines? But the example input has 6 lines? \n\n Actually, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        \"5 5\n         1 2 2 4 5\n         3 2\n         4 2\n         3 1\n         2 1\n         2 2\"\n\n That is 6 lines. \n\n I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" \u2014 that is the entire array a? But then what is the second row? \n\n The problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" \u2014 meaning that the desired arrangement is given in two lines? \n\n But then the current arrangement is only one line? \n\n The problem says: \"Following two lines describe the current arrangement\" \u2014 so two lines for current? \n\n This is very confusing.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n   \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" \n   and then \n   \"the next line\" (which would be the third line) is not described? \n\n Then it says: \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries.\" \n\n And then: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" \u2014 but if the desired arrangement is the last two lines, then they come after the queries? That doesn't make sense.\n\n I think the problem has a flaw in the input specification. \n\n But note: the problem says: \"You are given an array a of length n\". Then the next two lines: the first line is the array a? and the second line is the array for the second row? \n\n And then the desired arrangement is given in the same format: two lines? \n\n And then the queries? \n\n But the problem says: \"The last two lines\" \u2014 meaning the last two lines of the entire input? But then the queries are in between? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean: \n   Line1: n, m\n   Line2: current row0 (n integers)\n   Line3: current row1 (n integers)\n   Line4: desired row0 (n integers)\n   Line5: desired row1 (n integers)\n   Then m lines: queries\n\n But then the example input does not match.\n\n Another possibility: the desired arrangement is not given? The problem says: \"Alice came up with her own arrangement\" \u2014 but then we are not given it? \n\n I see: the problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement in the same format.\" \n\n So they are given. \n\n Given the constraints (n, m up to 200000) and the example input, I suspect that the example input provided in the problem is for a different example? \n\n Let me look at the sample:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            2 0\n            1 2\n            3 4\n            1 2\n            3 5\n\n        Output: \n            -1\n\n        But wait, the example input in the problem has 5 5 and then 5 numbers.\n\n The note says: \n        \"In the first example the following sequence of swaps will suffice: ... It can be shown that 5 is the minimal possible answer in this case.\"\n\n        and \n\n        \"In the second example no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement, so the answer is -1.\"\n\n So there are two examples. The first example has n=5? \n\n The note then describes: \n        After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5] (which is one row) and then the answer is 29.\n\n This suggests that the initial arrangement is given in two rows? But then the example input has:\n\n        5 5\n        1 2 2 4 5   -> this is the first row? \n        then the next line is \"3 2\" -> that would be the second row? but it has only two numbers.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n After reading the sample input in the problem statement: \n        \"5 5\n         1 2 2 4 5\n         3 2\n         4 2\n         3 1\n         2 1\n         2 2\"\n\n I think the problem intended to have the current arrangement as two rows of n numbers, then the desired arrangement as two rows of n numbers, and then m queries. But the example input has only one row for the current arrangement? \n\n I see: the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" \u2014 that is the first row. The third line contains the second row? But the example input has only one row of 5 numbers and then 5 lines of two numbers? \n\n This suggests that the example input is for a different part? \n\n The problem says: \"after each query\" \u2014 so the initial arrangement is given, then we have queries that update the arrangement, and after each query we output the answer.\n\n And the desired arrangement is fixed? Or is the desired arrangement not given and we are to achieve a fixed desired arrangement that is given at the beginning? \n\n The problem says: \"Alice came up with her own arrangement\" \u2014 so the desired arrangement is fixed and given at the beginning.\n\n Therefore, the input should be:\n\n   n, m\n   current_row0 (n integers)\n   current_row1 (n integers)\n   desired_row0 (n integers)\n   desired_row1 (n integers)\n   then m lines of queries: i, x\n\n But then the example input has only 6 lines for n=5, m=5: \n        line1: \"5 5\"\n        line2: \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n        then 5 lines: \n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\n\n This is 6 lines, but we need 4 lines for the grids (2 for current, 2 for desired) and then 5 queries -> 4+5 = 9 lines.\n\n This is a discrepancy.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be: \n   We are only given the initial arrangement (two rows) and then the desired arrangement is not given? Instead, the queries are updates and after each update we want the sum of awesomeness over all subsegments of the entire grid? \n\n But the problem says: \"Alice's desired arrangement\" \u2014 and then we have to achieve it. \n\n But then the problem also says: \"after each query\" (which updates the current arrangement) we print the sum of awesomeness over all subsegments of the current arrangement? \n\n And the desired arrangement is just the arrangement we want to achieve eventually, but the problem doesn't require to achieve it in the intermediate steps? \n\n But the problem says: \"after each query print the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a\". \n\n And the array a is the entire grid? But the grid has two rows. \n\n How is the array a defined? The problem says: \"the array a\" of length n? and then we have two rows? \n\n This is very confusing.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"Stanley has decided to buy a new desktop PC made by the company 'Monoblock', and to solve captcha on their website, he needs to solve the following task. The awesomeness of an array is the minimum number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers in which the array could be split.\"\n\n   Then: \"You are given an array a of length n.\"\n\n   Then: \"There are m queries of two integers i, x. A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n   And then: \"After each query print the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a.\"\n\n   And the example: \n        After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5] (which is a one-dimensional array of length 5).\n\n   So the entire grid is represented as a one-dimensional array? \n\n   But then what are the two rows? \n\n   The problem says: \"the array a\" and then the input has two rows? \n\n   The input format: \n        n, m\n        then a line of n integers (which is the first row)\n        then a line of n integers (which is the second row)\n\n   But then the array a is of length 2*n? \n\n   The problem says: \"array a of length n\", but we have 2*n elements.\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   Alternatively, the grid is 2 x n, and the array a is the first row? and the second row is another array? \n\n   But the query says: \"update the i-th element of the array a\" \u2014 so if a is the first row, then the second row is not updated? \n\n   The example update: \n        Query: \"3 2\" -> update the 3rd element of a to 2. \n        Then the grid becomes:\n            first row: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] -> but the third element (index 2) becomes 2? \n            second row: remains the same? \n\n   But the example says: after the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5] \u2014 which matches the first row.\n\n   Then what is the second row? \n\n   The problem does not say that the second row is updated. \n\n   And the awesomeness is defined for a one-dimensional array. But the grid has two rows? \n\n   The problem says: \"sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a\". \n\n   But then what about the second row? \n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   Let me look at the example calculation: \n        [1;1]: [1] -> 1 block\n        [1;2]: [1,2] -> 2 blocks\n        [1;3]: [1,2,2] -> 2 blocks (because [1] and [2,2])\n        [1;4]: [1,2,2,4] -> 3 blocks\n        [1;5]: [1,2,2,4,5] -> 4 blocks\n        [2;2]: [2] -> 1\n        [2;3]: [2,2] -> 1\n        [2;4]: [2,2,4] -> 2\n        [2;5]: [2,2,4,5] -> 3\n        [3;3]: [2] -> 1\n        [3;4]: [2,4] -> 2\n        [3;5]: [2,4,5] -> 3\n        [4;4]: [4] -> 1\n        [4;5]: [4,5] -> 2\n        [5;5]: [5] -> 1\n\n        Sum = 1+2+2+3+4+1+1+2+3+1+2+3+1+2+1 = 29.\n\n   This suggests that the array a is a one-dimensional array of length n (which is 5 in the example). \n\n   But the input has two rows? \n\n   The example input has:\n        first line: 5 5\n        second line: 1 2 2 4 5   -> this is the array a after the first query? \n        then the next line: \"3 2\" -> which is the first query? \n\n   But then what is the initial arrangement? \n\n   The problem says: \"after the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5]\". So before the first query, the array a was something else.\n\n   The input has:\n        n=5, m=5\n        then the next line is the initial a? \n        then the next line is the initial second row? \n\n   But the problem does not mention a second row in the definition of the array a.\n\n   I think the problem has a mistake in the input specification. \n\n   Alternatively, the grid is 2 x n, and the array a is the entire grid read in row-major order? \n\n   Then the array a would be of length 2*n.\n\n   The query: \"update the i-th element of the array a\" \u2014 so if i=1, then update the first element, which is the top-left. If i=2, then the second element, which is the first row second column, ... and i=n+1 would be the first element of the second row.\n\n   Then the example input:\n        n=5, so the array a has 10 elements.\n        The input has:\n            first line: 5 5\n            second line: 1 2 2 4 5   -> this would be the first row? \n            third line: 3 2 ... but wait, only two numbers? \n\n   The example input has only two numbers in the third line? \n\n   This doesn't work.\n\n   Another possibility: the input has only one row for the initial arrangement? and the second row is not given? \n\n   But the problem says: \"following two lines describe the current arrangement\".\n\n   Given the time constraints, I must rely on the sample.\n\n   The sample input in the problem is:\n\n        \"5 5\n         1 2 2 4 5\n         3 2\n         4 2\n         3 1\n         2 1\n         2 2\"\n\n   and the sample output is 29 for the first query.\n\n   Therefore, I deduce that the array a is one-dimensional of length n, and there is only one row. \n\n   But then what are the two rows in the input? \n\n   The problem says: \"following two lines\" for the current arrangement. \n\n   I think the only logical explanation is: the first line of the current arrangement is the array a, and the second line is not used? \n\n   But then the desired arrangement is given in two lines? \n\n   This doesn't make sense.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem has a different structure: \n        The grid is 2 x n, and the array a is the first row, and there is a separate array b for the second row. \n        The query updates only the array a? \n\n   Then the awesomeness is defined on the array a only? \n\n   But the example calculation only uses one row.\n\n   The example: \n        a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> then the awesomeness for subsegments of a.\n\n   So the second row is not used? \n\n   Then why is it in the input? \n\n   The problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" \u2014 but if we only care about array a, then the desired arrangement for a would be one row? \n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   Given the complexity, I will assume that the problem is about a one-dimensional array a of length n, and the input has:\n\n        n, m\n        a0 a1 ... a_{n-1}   (initial array a)\n        then m lines of queries: i, x\n\n   and the desired arrangement is not given because the problem does not require it for the awesomeness calculation? \n\n   But the problem title is \"Monoblock\" and the grid has two rows in the initial description.\n\n   However, the example calculation is for a one-dimensional array.\n\n   And the problem says: \"sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a\".\n\n   Therefore, I will solve the one-dimensional version.\n\n   The one-dimensional version: \n        We have an array a of length n.\n        The awesomeness of a contiguous subarray a[l..r] is the minimum number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. \n        Note: this is simply the number of contiguous groups. For example, [1,2,2,4,5] has groups: [1], [2,2], [4], [5] -> 4 groups.\n\n        But note: the example says the awesomeness of [1,2,2,4,5] is 4.\n\n        However, the example also says: \n            [1;1]: 1 block\n            [1;2]: 2 blocks\n            [1;3]: 2 blocks? -> because [1] and [2,2] -> 2 blocks.\n\n        So for [1,2,2] (which is indices 0 to 2) the awesomeness is 2.\n\n        How to compute the sum over all contiguous subarrays?\n\n        We note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] = 1 + (number of indices i from l+1 to r such that a[i] != a[i-1]).\n\n        Why? Because each time we have a change from a[i-1] to a[i], we get an extra block.\n\n        Therefore, for a subarray [l, r]:\n            g(l, r) = 1 + (# of indices i in [l+1, r] with a[i] != a[i-1])\n\n        Then the total sum is:\n            Sum_{l=0}^{n-1} Sum_{r=l}^{n-1} [ 1 + (# of indices i in [l+1, r] with a[i]!=a[i-1]) ]\n\n        = (number of subarrays) + Sum_{l=0}^{n-1} Sum_{r=l}^{n-1} [ (# of indices i in [l+1, r] with a[i]!=a[i-1]) ]\n\n        The number of subarrays = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n        Now, for the second part: \n            Let f(i) = 1 if a[i] != a[i-1] (for i>=1), else 0.\n            Then for a fixed i (>=1), how many subarrays [l, r] that include the index i and i-1? \n            Specifically, we require that l <= i-1 and r>=i.\n            The number of choices for l: from 0 to i-1 -> i choices.\n            The number of choices for r: from i to n-1 -> (n - i) choices.\n            So the contribution of f(i) is i * (n-i).\n\n        Therefore, the total sum = n*(n+1)//2 + Sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(i) * i * (n-i)\n\n        Example: n=5, a = [1,2,2,4,5]\n          f(1): a[1]!=a[0] -> 1 -> contribution: 1 * 1 * 4 = 4\n          f(2): a[2]!=a[1] -> 0 -> 0\n          f(3): a[3]!=a[2] -> 1 -> 3 * (5-3) = 3*2=6\n          f(4): a[4]!=a[3] -> 1 -> 4 * (5-4)=4\n          total = 15 + (4+6+4) = 15+14 = 29.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n          Let total = n*(n+1)//2\n          Let F = [0]*(n)   # f[0] is unused, we use f[1] to f[n-1]\n          For i in range(1, n):\n              if a[i] != a[i-1]:\n                  F[i] = 1\n              else:\n                  F[i] = 0\n\n          Then base = total + sum( i * (n-i) * F[i] for i in range(1, n) )\n\n          But note: when we update an element at position i (0-indexed), it can affect:\n             - the segment that includes i and i-1 (if i>=1): so we will update F[i] (which is the difference between i-1 and i)\n             - the segment that includes i and i+1: so we will update F[i+1] (which is the difference between i and i+1)\n\n          Specifically, when updating a[i] to x:\n\n            Let old = a[i]\n            a[i] = x\n\n            We will consider the two adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1)\n\n            For the pair (i-1, i):\n                Let old_f1 = 1 if (a[i-1] != old) else 0   [for i>=1]\n                Let new_f1 = 1 if (a[i-1] != x) else 0\n\n                The change in the sum for this pair: \n                    delta1 = (new_f1 - old_f1) * i * (n-i)\n\n            For the pair (i, i+1) [if i < n-1]:\n                Let old_f2 = 1 if (old != a[i+1]) else 0\n                Let new_f2 = 1 if (x != a[i+1]) else 0\n\n                The change in the sum for this pair: \n                    delta2 = (new_f2 - old_f2) * (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n            Then the new base = base + delta1 + delta2\n\n          And then we output the new base.\n\n          Also, we must update the array a and the F array? But we only need the current a to compute the next update.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # But wait, the input has two lines for the current arrangement? \n            # The problem says: two lines for the current arrangement.\n\n            # How to reconcile? \n\n            # Given the example input: \n            #   first line: \"5 5\"\n            #   second line: \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n            #   then the next line: \"3 2\" -> which is the first query.\n\n            # So there is no second row? \n\n            # I think the problem intended to have only one array. The \"two rows\" might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n            # Therefore, we ignore the second row.\n\n            # But the sample input has a third line: \"3 2\", which is the first query? \n\n            # However, the problem says: there are m queries, so we should read m lines.\n\n            # But the example input has 5 queries, so after the first line (n, m) and the second line (the array a), we then read m lines.\n\n            # So the input is:\n\n            #   n, m\n            #   a0 a1 ... a_{n-1}\n            #   then m lines: each has i and x\n\n            # Note: the query gives i (which is 1-indexed) and x.\n\n            # Example: first query: \"3 2\" -> i=3, so update a[2] (0-indexed) to 2.\n\n            # But the initial a is [1,2,2,4,5]. Then updating a[2] to 2: no change.\n\n            # Then the answer for the first query is 29.\n\n            # Then next query: \"4 2\" -> update a[3] to 2: \n            #   a becomes [1,2,2,2,5]\n\n            #   Now compute the awesomeness sum:\n\n            #   f[1]: a[1]!=a[0] -> 2!=1 -> 1 -> 1*1*4 = 4\n            #   f[2]: a[2]!=a[1] -> 2==2 -> 0\n            #   f[3]: a[3]!=a[2] -> 2==2 -> 0\n            #   f[4]: a[4]!=a[3] -> 5!=2 -> 1 -> 4*1=4\n            #   total = 15 + 4+4 = 23.\n\n            # But the example output for the first query is 29, then what are the next answers? \n\n            # The problem does not provide the full sample output.\n\n            # However, the problem says: \"after each query\", so we output m answers.\n\n            # Algorithm:\n\n            #   base = n*(n+1)//2\n            #   Let arr = a   (0-indexed array of length n)\n            #   Let f = [0]*n   # we will use f[i] for i in range(1, n) to represent the difference at i (which is between i-1 and i)\n            #   But we don't need to store f explicitly, we only need the current sum of contributions.\n\n            #   Precompute the initial contributions:\n\n            #   s = 0\n            #   for i in range(1, n):\n            #       if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:\n            #           s += i * (n-i)\n\n            #   total_ans = base + s\n\n            #   Then for each query (i, x):\n            #       i0 = i-1   (0-indexed index)\n            #       old_val = arr[i0]\n            #       We are going to update arr[i0] = x.\n\n            #       We consider the left neighbor: if i0>=1, then the pair (i0-1, i0) might change.\n            #       Let left_index = i0   [because this pair is represented at index i0 in our f array? note: the pair (i0-1, i0) is at position i0 in the array of differences (which has length n-1, indexed 0 to n-2) but we use i0 as the index for the pair (i0-1, i0) and i0+1 for the pair (i0, i0+1)]\n\n            #       Actually, the pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i (0-indexed) in the array of differences?
