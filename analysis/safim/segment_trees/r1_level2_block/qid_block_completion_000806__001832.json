Because if s==x, we don't break? But x = sum(a)//2, and s might be exactly x? Then we can continue? But the next candy will make s>x. But we break on s>x. \n\n Alternatively, we can break immediately after the condition. But the problem: if s>x, then any further suffix sums will be greater than x (because weights are positive), so we can break. So we do:\n\n        if s in d: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n Now for program2.py.

But the problem says: if there are multiple, output any. However, the sample expected output for the first test case (n=1) is:\n        1\n        1 2 But our code outputs:\n        1\n        2 3 So we must change the code for n=1 to output \"1 2\". But the general case for n>=2 uses a formula that for i in range(aux):\n        index1 = 2+3*i\n        index2 = 3+3*(n-i-1) For n=1: \n        i=0: \n            index1 = 2+0 = 2\n            index2 = 3+3*(1-0-1)=3+0=3 So it outputs \"2 3\". We need to output \"1 2\" for n=1. Therefore, we can handle n=1 separately. The TODO: if n==1, then we output:\n        result += \"1\\n\"   # because aux=1, so the first line is \"1\"\n        then for the swap: \"1 2\"\n\n   But the code already does: \n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"   # for n=1, aux=1, so it adds \"1\\n\"\n        then the for loop: for i in range(aux):  # aux=1, so one iteration\n            result += str(2+3*i) + ' ' + str(3+3*(n-i-1)) + \"\\n\"   # which is \"2 3\\n\"\n\n   We don't want that for n=1. So we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue   # skip the for loop But the code after the if n==1 is the general code that does the same: it outputs the number of operations and then the swaps.

So we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue But then the while loop continues. Alternatively, we can skip the for loop for n==1 by not doing the for loop when n==1? But the code has:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        for i in range(aux):\n            ...\n\n   We cannot change the structure arbitrarily.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, such that the total weight each eats is equal, and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n- It reads the number of test cases.\n- For each test case, it reads n and the list of candy weights.\n- It computes x = sum(a) // 2. This is half of the total weight (using integer division). Note: since they must be equal, the maximum possible common weight is at most half the total.\n- Then it initializes s=0 and an empty dictionary d.\n- It iterates over the candies from left (Alice's side), accumulating the sum (s) and storing in d the mapping from the accumulated sum to the number of candies eaten (idx+1). It breaks if the accumulated sum exceeds x (since we cannot exceed half the total weight in the left part? Actually, note: the goal is to have the same total weight, but the entire candy set might not be partitioned exactly in half. However, the break condition is to avoid unnecessary computation beyond the point where the left sum is already more than half, because then we cannot form a common weight that is at least that? But note: the common weight must be the same for both, and we are going to check from the right as well).\n\n- Then it initializes s=0 and r=0 (r will be the answer for the test case, the total number of candies eaten).\n- It iterates over the candies from the right (Bob's side), accumulating the sum (s). Then it checks if s is in the dictionary d. The idea is: if we have a left prefix sum that equals the current right suffix sum, then we can have Alice eat the prefix and Bob eat the suffix, and the total candies eaten would be (d[s] + the number of candies from the right that form the suffix). However, note that the suffix iteration is from the last candy backwards, and the index in the suffix loop is idx (starting at 0). The number of candies Bob has eaten is idx+1.\n\nBut the current code in the loop for the right side is incomplete. We need to complete the condition.\n\nSpecifically, the code says:\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to update r (the result) to be the maximum of the current r and (d[s] + idx+1). However, note: the problem states that they cannot eat the same candy. But in the way we are building, the left part is from the beginning and the right part is from the end. We must ensure that the two segments do not overlap.\n\nHow do we ensure non-overlap? The left part goes from index 0 to d[s]-1 (0-indexed, and d[s] is the count). The right part goes from the last candy backwards for idx+1 candies. The condition for non-overlap is: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. But note: if we have the same candy being counted in both, that would be an error.\n\nActually, the dictionary d was built from the left without considering the right. When we are building the suffix, we are going backwards. The left part uses the first d[s] candies and the right part uses the last (idx+1) candies. They are non-overlapping if d[s] <= n - (idx+1). But note: the entire array is of length n. The left part ends at index d[s]-1 and the right part starts at n - (idx+1). We must have d[s] <= n - (idx+1). However, the problem does not require that they eat all the candies? They can leave some in the middle.\n\nBut note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left (a contiguous prefix) and Bob from the right (a contiguous suffix). The two segments are disjoint by definition because the prefix is at the beginning and the suffix at the end, and they meet in the middle. However, if the entire array is partitioned, then the prefix and suffix must not overlap and must cover the entire array? Actually, they can leave some in the middle. So the condition is that the prefix and suffix are disjoint. The total number of candies eaten is d[s] (from left) + (idx+1) (from right). And we require that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, they are disjoint as long as the prefix does not extend into the suffix. The condition is: the left part ends at index d[s]-1 and the right part starts at n - (idx+1). We require d[s] <= n - (idx+1). But note: the array is 0-indexed. The left part covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the right part covers [n - (idx+1), n-1]. They are disjoint if d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This condition is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nTherefore, when we find s in the dictionary, we can update r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1) provided that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the problem does not require that the entire array is partitioned? They can leave some in the middle. But the condition for non-overlap is automatically satisfied because we are taking a prefix and a suffix? However, if the prefix and suffix together cover more than n candies, that would be an overlap. So we must check that the two segments do not overlap.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So we must avoid overlap.\n\nTherefore, we should only consider when the left part and the right part do not overlap. That is, the number of candies in the left part (d[s]) plus the number in the right part (idx+1) must be at most n. However, it is possible that the two segments meet exactly? Then they are adjacent and non-overlapping. So the condition is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nBut note: the example test cases:\nExample 1: n=2, weights [1,1]. Then Alice eats one from left (weight=1) and Bob eats one from right (weight=1). Then total candies=2, which is n. So condition holds: 1+1=2<=2.\n\nExample 2: n=3, weights [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> actually the example says n=7? The fourth test case: n=7, weights [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,1,4,1,1,1,1,3] -> wait, the note says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". But the input is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,1,4,1,1,1,1,3]? Actually, the note says: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". This does not match the input? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nActually, the problem statement for the fourth test case: \"The fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". But the input in the example is not provided? However, the note says: \"they each eat 30 weight\". So the left part: 7+3+20=30, the right part: 10+8+11+1=30. The total candies eaten is 3+4=7. And n=7? Actually, the example says: \"the answer is 7\". But wait, the input says n is the number of candies. The example says: \"the answer is 7\" meaning they ate 7 candies. But if n=7, then the entire array is 7 candies. How can Alice eat 3 from the left and Bob eat 4 from the right without overlapping? The total is 7, so they must have eaten all. Then the condition d[s] + (idx+1) = 3+4=7<=7 holds.\n\nTherefore, we must update r only when the two segments do not overlap. So the code for the TODO in program1.py should be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the suffix loop is iterating from the last candy backwards. The variable idx in the loop for the suffix starts at 0 for the last candy. So the number of candies Bob has eaten is idx+1. However, we must note that the entire array might be partitioned? But the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary.\n\nBut wait: what if the same sum s appears multiple times from the left? The dictionary d stores the last index (the largest index) for which the prefix sum is s? Actually, the code for the left part:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: break\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n\nIt stores the earliest occurrence? Actually, it stores the last occurrence that it sees? Because if the same sum appears again, it will overwrite. But we want the largest number of candies for a given sum? Actually, no: we want the left part to be as long as possible? Actually, we are storing the prefix sum and the count of candies (which is the index+1). When we have the same sum, we want the largest number of candies? Actually, no: we want to maximize the total candies (left + right). But note: if we have two different prefix lengths that yield the same sum, we want the one that has the smallest number of candies? Because then we can have more room for the right part? Actually, we want the left part to be as short as possible? Or as long as possible? \n\nWait: the total candies eaten is left_count + right_count. For a fixed s (the common weight), we want to maximize left_count + right_count. However, the left_count is fixed for a given s? Actually, we are storing the last occurrence of s. But we should store the maximum count? Actually, no: we are traversing from left to right, and we break when s > x. We store the count for the first time we achieve a sum? Actually, we store the count for every prefix sum until we break. And if the same sum appears again, we overwrite with the later index (which has a larger count). So we are storing the last (largest) index for which the prefix sum is s. That is, for a given s, we have the largest possible left_count (which is the entire prefix until that point). That is what we want? Because then we can have the left part as long as possible? But note: we want to leave as much room as possible for the right part? Actually, we want the left part to be as long as possible? Because then we are covering more candies? But we also have to add the right part. However, the condition for non-overlap is that left_count + right_count <= n. So if we have a left part that is longer, then we have less room for the right part? Actually, we are storing the left_count for a given s. Then when we traverse the right part and get the same s, we compute left_count + right_count. We want to maximize that. But if we have two different left parts that yield the same s, we want the one that has the smallest left_count? Because then we can have a larger right_count? \n\nBut note: the right_count is fixed by the suffix: for a given suffix sum s, the right_count is the number of candies we took from the right to get that sum. And we are traversing the suffix from the end, so we start with one candy, then two, etc. For a fixed s, we want the left_count to be as small as possible? Then we can have a larger right_count? Actually, no: the total is left_count + right_count. We want to maximize that. But note: the left_count and right_count are independent? Actually, for a fixed s, the left_count is fixed by the dictionary? But we stored the last occurrence, which is the largest left_count for that s. Then when we have a suffix that gives the same s, we have a fixed right_count (which is the number of candies we took to get that s from the right). Then the total is left_count + right_count. We want the maximum total over all s that appear in both the prefix and the suffix and that satisfy non-overlap.\n\nBut the dictionary d stores the largest left_count for a given s? Actually, we store the left_count for the last time we saw s (which is the largest index, so the largest left_count). Then when we are in the suffix, we are starting from the end and building the suffix sum. We start with the last candy (which is the smallest suffix: one candy) and then add the next one (from the left in the reverse order). So we are building the suffix from the end and increasing the count. For a given s, we get the left_count from the dictionary (which is the largest left_count for that s). Then we check if left_count + (current right_count) <= n. If so, we update r = max(r, left_count+right_count).\n\nBut is that correct? Consider: we might have multiple left parts that yield the same s. We stored the last one (largest left_count). But what if we have a left part that yields s with a smaller left_count? Then we could have a larger right_count? For example, if we have s=5, and we have two left parts: one with 2 candies and one with 4 candies. Then if we use the left part with 2 candies, we can have a right part that has up to n-2 candies? But the right part must yield the same sum s=5. The right part might be achieved by 3 candies? Then total=2+3=5. If we use the left part with 4 candies, then the right part must be at most n-4, and if the right part that yields 5 has 1 candy? Then total=4+1=5. But we want the maximum total. So we want the maximum of (left_count + right_count) over all pairs (left_count, right_count) for the same s and non-overlap.\n\nBut the dictionary d only stores one left_count per s. We stored the last one we encountered, which is the largest left_count. But we might miss a pair that has a smaller left_count and a larger right_count? \n\nHowever, note: we are iterating the suffix from the end and we are going to see every suffix. For a given s, we will see the smallest right_count first? Actually, we start with the last candy (right_count=1) and then add the next (right_count=2), etc. So for a fixed s, we will see the smallest right_count first? But we want the smallest right_count? Actually, we want the entire suffix that yields s? And then we can combine with the left part that yields s. But we are storing the left_count for the largest left_count? That might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can store for each sum s the maximum left_count (which we are doing) and then for the suffix, we can also store the maximum right_count for each s? But then we have to do a separate pass? \n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is at most 200,000. We are doing two passes per test case: one from left and one from right. We cannot do nested loops.\n\nThe intended solution is to use two pointers? Or use a dictionary for the left and then traverse the right.\n\nActually, the common solution for this problem (which is known as \"Candies\" in Codeforces) is:\n\n- Precompute prefix sums from left and suffix sums from right.\n- Then use two pointers: one at the beginning (for Alice) and one at the end (for Bob). \n  Let left_sum=0, right_sum=0, left_count=0, right_count=0.\n  Then while left_count + right_count < n:\n      if left_sum < right_sum: \n          left_sum += a[left_count]\n          left_count += 1\n      else:\n          right_sum += a[n-1-right_count]\n          right_count += 1\n      if left_sum == right_sum:\n          ans = max(ans, left_count+right_count)\n\nBut note: the constraint that the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n per test case? But worst-case total n is 200,000, so worst-case total operations 200,000? Actually, the two pointers move from 0 to n, so total steps per test case is n. And the sum of n over test cases is 200,000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut the provided code uses a different method: it builds a dictionary for the prefix sums and then traverses the suffix. And we are to complete that.\n\nSo we stick to the provided method.\n\nBut the issue: we stored the last (largest) left_count for a given s. Then when we traverse the suffix, we see a suffix sum s and we update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) provided that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nBut is that optimal? Consider: we might have the same s appear in the suffix multiple times? And we want the smallest right_count? Actually, we are traversing the suffix from the end (one candy, then two, then three, ...). So the first time we see a suffix sum s, we get the smallest right_count? Then we update r = d[s] + (that small right_count). But if we see the same s again later (with a larger right_count), then we would update with a larger total? Actually, no: because if we see the same s again, the right_count is larger. So we want the largest total? Then we should update every time we see s? Because the total is d[s] + (idx+1). And we want the maximum total.\n\nBut note: the dictionary d stores the largest left_count for s. Then for each occurrence of s in the suffix, we compute the total. And we take the maximum over these.\n\nSo the code for the right part should be:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d:\n            # Check non-overlap: the left part has d[s] candies, the right part has idx+1 candies.\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: what if the suffix sum s is greater than x? We don't break in the suffix? The left part broke when s > x. But the suffix might exceed x? However, if the suffix sum s is greater than x, then we don't have a corresponding prefix? Because the prefix only stored up to x. So we don't need to worry.\n\nBut note: the entire total is T = sum(a). The maximum common weight is at most T//2. The suffix sum s might exceed T//2? Then we could break? But the problem does not require that. However, the dictionary d only has keys up to x (which is T//2). So if s > T//2, then s won't be in d. So we can break? But the problem does not guarantee that the suffix sums are increasing? Actually, the suffix sums are increasing because we are adding nonnegative numbers (weights are positive). So the suffix sum is increasing as we add more candies from the end. So we can break when s > x? But note: the left part broke when the prefix sum exceeded x. Similarly, we can break the suffix loop when s > x? But the problem says the total n per test case can be up to 200,000, and the total over test cases is 200,000, so we don't need to break? But it might be efficient.\n\nBut the provided code does not break in the suffix loop. We are not breaking. So we can add a break condition? But the problem does not require it. And the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the worst-case total operations in the suffix loops is 200,000. So we can leave it.\n\nBut note: the example test case 3: [1,2,1] -> n=3, weights [1,2,1]. The total sum is 4. x=2. \nLeft part: \n  idx0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n  idx1: s=1+2=3 -> break? because 3>2? so break.\nThen suffix: \n  reverse: [1,2,1] -> \n    idx0: s=1 -> check: d has 1? yes. Then total = d[1] + 1 = 1+1=2. Condition: 1+1=2<=3 -> update r=2.\n    idx1: s=1+2=3 -> not in d? because d only has 1? so skip.\n    idx2: s=3+1=4 -> skip.\nSo we get r=2. But the expected answer for the first test case is 2? Actually, the first test case in the note: \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\". But the example says the first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2. This test case [1,2,1] is not the first? Actually, the problem says: \"For the first test case\" and then \"For the second\", etc. But the third test case: [1,1,1] -> n=3? The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". But [1,2,1] is not the third? \n\nBut the problem says: the first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2. The second: n=3, [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> wait, no: the second test case: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> so n=6? Actually, the note says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\". So the second test case: n=6? The input: [7,3,20,10,8,11]? But the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> [10,8,11]? Then the total is 10+8+11=29? But the note says 7? Actually, the note says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up: 7+3+20=30? Then Bob: 10+8+11=29? \n\nWait, the note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo? Actually, the example input for the second test case is not provided? But the note says: \"they cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\". So n=6? Then the entire array is 6 candies. The answer is 6.\n\nBut our method: \n  n=6, a = [7,3,20,10,8,11]? \n  Total sum = 7+3+20+10+8+11 = 59. x = 59//2 = 29 (integer division).\n  Left part:\n      idx0: s=7 -> d[7]=1\n      idx1: s=10 -> d[10]=2\n      idx2: s=30 -> break? because 30>29? so break.\n  Then suffix:\n      reverse: [11,8,10,20,3,7]\n      idx0: s=11 -> not in d? \n      idx1: s=11+8=19 -> not in d?\n      idx2: s=19+10=29 -> in d? d[29] doesn't exist? because we didn't store 29? \n      Actually, the left part did not store 29? \n\nBut the note says: Alice eats the first three: [7,3,20] -> 30? Bob eats the last three: [10,8,11] -> 29? That doesn't add to the same. \n\nWait, the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the last three? and the total weight is 7? That must be a typo. Actually, the note says: \"they each eat 7\"? But 7+3+20=30, and 10+8+11=29. \n\nLooking at the problem statement again: \n\"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nThis is confusing. The example input for the second test case is not provided? But the note says: \"the answer is 6\". \n\nActually, the sample input and output from the problem:\n\nInput:\n4\n2\n1 1\n2\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3\n\nOutput:\n2\n0\n6\n7\n\nSo the second test case: n=3? [1,2,1] -> output 0? But our method for [1,2,1] gave 2? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So the third test case: n=1? [7] -> then we cannot split because if Alice eats the candy, Bob has nothing? and vice versa? So the common weight must be 0? Then they eat 0 candies? But the problem says: \"the answer is 0\" (meaning total candies eaten is 0). \n\nBut the sample input has 4 test cases. The first: n=2, [1,1] -> output 2. The second: n=3, [1,2,1] -> output 0? But why 0? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> [1,1]: Alice eats the first (1) and Bob eats the last (1). Then they both have weight 1. Total candies=2.\n\nFor the second test case: n=3, [1,2,1]. \n  If Alice eats the first candy (1) and Bob eats the last candy (1), then they both have weight 1. Total candies=2. \n  But the problem says the answer is 0? \n\nWait, the sample output says for the second test case: 0? \n\nBut the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way\" -> so the third test case is the one with n=1? [7] -> output 0. Then the second test case is n=3, [1,2,1] -> output 0? Why?\n\nActually, the problem says: \"For the fourth test case\" -> output 7.\n\nBut the sample input has:\n4   (t=4)\n2   (n=2)\n1 1\n3   (n=3)   -> this is the second test case? \n1 2 1\n1   (n=1)   -> third test case\n7   (n=7)   -> fourth test case\n... the list of 14 numbers? Actually, the fourth test case: n=7, but the list has 7 numbers? The note says: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,1,4,1,1,1,1,3] -> that's 14 numbers? \n\nI see: the sample input:\n\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3   -> wait, the third test case: n=1, then the list has one number: 7? Then the fourth test case: n=7, then the list has 7 numbers? But the example input for the fourth test case has 14 numbers? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". But the input for the fourth test case is: \n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3\n\nThat doesn't match: n=7 but 14 numbers? \n\nI think there is a confusion. The problem says: \"the second line of each test case contains n integers\". So for the fourth test case, n=7, then the next line has 7 integers: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11]? Then the next test case? But the sample input has 4 test cases, and the last test case has n=7 and then 7 integers? \n\nBut the note for the fourth test case says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". This implies that the array has at least 7 candies? and the weights are 7,3,20,..., and then 10,8,11,1? But the array we have is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11]? \n\nActually, the example says: \"they each eat 30\". \nAlice: 7+3+20 = 30.\nBob: 10+8+11+1 = 30? But the array we have is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11] -> Bob would eat the last four: [5,15,1,11] = 5+15+1+11=32? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nBut the problem says: \"the answer is 7\". So the total candies eaten is 7. That means they ate the entire array? Then the common weight must be half the total? The total of the array is 7+3+20+5+15+1+11 = 62. Half is 31. But 30 != 31. \n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem note. \n\nBut regardless, our method:\n\nFor the test case [1,2,1] (n=3): \n  total sum = 4, x=2.\n  Left part:\n      index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1.\n      index1: s=1+2=3 -> break? because 3>2? so break.\n  Then suffix:\n      reverse: [1,2,1] -> \n          idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes. Then total = 1 (left) + 1 (right) = 2. Condition: 1+1=2<=3 -> update r=2.\n          idx1: s=1+2=3 -> not in d? because d only has 1? skip.\n          idx2: s=3+1=4 -> skip.\n  Then we output r=2.\n\nBut the sample output for the second test case (which is n=3, [1,2,1]) is 0? \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nI see: the problem says: \"For the second test case\" in the note is not the same as the second test case in the sample input. The sample input has:\n  test1: n=2, [1,1] -> output 2.\n  test2: n=3, [1,2,1] -> output 0? \n  test3: n=1, [7] -> output 0.\n  test4: n=7, [...] -> output 7.\n\nBut the problem note says:\n  first test case: output 2.\n  second test case: output 6.\n  third test case: output 0.\n  fourth test case: output 7.\n\nSo the sample input and the note are not aligned. The sample input's second test case is not the same as the note's second test case.\n\nTherefore, we must rely on the sample input and output.\n\nThe sample input:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7\n\nOutput:\n2\n0\n0\n?\n\nBut the fourth test case: n=7, and then the list of 7 integers? The sample output for the fourth test case is 7.\n\nBut the sample input for the fourth test case: \n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11\n\nThen the total sum = 7+3+20+5+15+1+11 = 62. x=31.\nLeft part:\n  7 -> d[7]=1\n  7+3=10 -> d[10]=2\n  10+20=30 -> d[30]=3\n  30+5=35 -> break? because 35>31? \nSuffix:\n  reverse: [11,1,15,5,20,3,7]\n  11 -> not in d\n  11+1=12 -> not in d\n  12+15=27 -> not in d\n  27+5=32 -> not in d\n  32+20=52 -> not in d\n  52+3=55 -> not in d\n  55+7=62 -> not in d\nThen r remains 0? \n\nBut the expected output is 7? \n\nHow can they eat 7 candies? That means the entire array. Then the common weight must be 31 each? But 31+31=62. But the entire array is 62. So they must each eat 31. But the left part has 30 at 3 candies, and the right part: we need 31. The last four: 11+1+15+5 = 32? too much. The last three: 11+1+15=27? then we need to take more from the left? But the left part already has 30. Then we cannot have 31.\n\nAlternatively, the entire array is partitioned: Alice eats the entire array? But then Bob eats nothing? That doesn't work. Or Bob eats the entire array? same.\n\nThe problem says: Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix. They cannot overlap. The entire array cannot be partitioned into a prefix and a suffix that are disjoint? They are disjoint by taking a prefix and a suffix that do not overlap. The entire array can be partitioned only if we leave some in the middle? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the answer is 7\", meaning they ate 7 candies. That is the entire array. Then the prefix and suffix must cover the entire array without overlap. That means the prefix and suffix must be adjacent. \n\nFor example: Alice eats the first k candies, Bob eats the last (7-k) candies. Then the condition is that the sum of the first k = the sum of the last (7-k). And k + (7-k) = 7.\n\nSo we need to find k such that the sum of the first k = the sum of the last (7-k). \n\nIn the array [7,3,20,5,15,1,11]:\n  k=3: [7,3,20] = 30, last 4: [5,15,1,11] = 32 -> not equal.\n  k=4: [7,3,20,5] = 35, last 3: [1,11] = 12 -> not equal.\n  k=2: [7,3] = 10, last 5: [20,5,15,1,11] = 52 -> not equal.\n  k=1: [7] = 7, last 6: [3,20,5,15,1,11] = 55 -> not equal.\n  k=0: 0, last 7: 62 -> not equal.\n\nSo there is no k that works for the entire array? Then how can the answer be 7? \n\nThe problem note says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". This implies that the array is not [7,3,20,5,15,1,11] but something else. \n\nThe sample input for the fourth test case might be different. The problem says: \"the fourth test case\" and then lists an array of 14 numbers? \n\nLooking back: the sample input has:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3   -> wait, this is not formatted correctly.\n\nActually, the sample input should be:\n\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7\n3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3   -> no.\n\nThe problem says: \"The fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n\nSo the array must be: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1]? \n\nBut the sample input says: \n  n=7\n  weights: 7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3\n\nThat's 14 weights. But n=7? \n\nI see the mistake: the sample input has:\n  test case 1: n=2, weights: 1 1\n  test case 2: n=3, weights: 1 2 1\n  test case 3: n=1, weights: 7\n  test case 4: n=7, weights: 7 3 20 5 15 1 11 1 4 1 1 1 1 3   -> but that's 14 weights, not 7.\n\n This is an error in the problem statement? \n\n Given the confusion, I will trust the provided code structure and the known similar problems.\n\n In known problems (like Codeforces Round #693 (Div. 3) problem C), the solution is to use two pointers or a dictionary for prefix and suffix.\n\n And the sample test case [1,2,1] (n=3) should output 2, not 0.\n\n But the sample output says 0 for the second test case? \n\n Why would it be 0? \n\n The only explanation is that the problem has an additional constraint: they must eat at least one candy each? But the problem does not say that. The note for the third test case says: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\", so they eat 0 candies.\n\n In [1,2,1]: we can have Alice eat the first candy (1) and Bob eat the last candy (1), so they both have weight 1 (non-zero). So the answer should be 2.\n\n Unless the problem requires that the prefix and suffix together cover the entire array? But the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\", and they can leave some in the middle.\n\n So the sample output of 0 for the second test case (n=3, [1,2,1]) is likely a mistake in the sample input/output provided in the problem? \n\n Given the constraints of the online judge, we must output what the sample expects? \n\n But the problem says: \"For the first test case\" -> output 2, \"For the second test case\" -> output 6, \"For the third test case\" -> output 0, \"For the fourth test case\" -> output 7.\n\n And the sample input has 4 test cases, and the sample output is:\n2\n0   [ for the second test case in the input, which is n=3, [1,2,1] ]\n0   [ for the third test case: n=1, [7] ]\n7   [ for the fourth test case ]\n\n So the online judge will test with the sample input and expect these outputs.\n\n Therefore, for the second test case in the sample input (n=3, [1,2,1]), we must output 0.\n\n Why would that be? \n\n Let me re-read the problem: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n This means that Alice must eat a contiguous prefix and Bob a contiguous suffix. In [1,2,1], if Alice eats the first candy (1), then the array becomes [ (eaten) , 2, 1] for Bob. Bob can only eat from the right: he can eat the last candy (1) or the last two (1 and then 2). But if he eats the last candy (1), then the middle candy (2) is not eaten by anyone. That is allowed.\n\n So the answer should be 2.\n\n Unless the problem requires that the sum of the candies eaten by Alice equals the sum eaten by Bob, and they must be non-zero. In [1,2,1], we have a valid solution.\n\n But the sample output is 0.\n\n This is a known problem: actually, in the sample input, the second test case is not [1,2,1] but [1,2] for n=2? \n\n Let me read the sample input again:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7\n\n So the second test case: n=3, weights = [1,2,1].\n\n The sample output is 0 for this test case.\n\n This is a mystery.\n\n But known to the community: this problem is \"Candies\" from Codeforces, and the sample test cases are:\n\nInput:\n4\n2\n1 1\n2\n1 2\n1\n7\n3\n1 2 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n So the sample input has:\n  test1: n=2, [1,1] -> 2\n  test2: n=2, [1,2] -> 0\n  test3: n=1, [7] -> 0\n  test4: n=3, [1,2,1] -> 2\n\n But the problem statement in our hands has the sample input as:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1\n7\n7   [ weights for the fourth test case? ]\n\n So the fourth test case has n=7 and then 7 integers.\n\n Therefore, the sample output for the provided sample input should be:\n2\n2  [ for [1,2,1] ]\n0\n7\n\n But the problem says the sample output is:\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the intended solution using the dictionary is correct for the known problem.\n\n In the known problem (Codeforces), the sample test case [1,2,1] (n=3) gives 2.\n\n Therefore, I will complete program1.py as follows:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                if d[s] + (idx+1) > r:\n                    r = d[s] + (idx+1)\n        # We can break if s > x? But the weights are positive, so suffix sums are increasing.\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so breaking early might help.\n\n However, the sample test case [1,2,1] (n=3): \n   x = 4//2 = 2.\n   suffix: \n        first: s=1 -> not >2, then check: in d? yes -> update r=1+1=2.\n        second: s=1+2=3 -> >2, so break.\n\n So we output 2.\n\n For the test case [1,2] (n=2): \n   total sum=3, x=1.\n   left: \n        s=1 -> d[1]=1; then s=1+2=3>1 -> break.\n   suffix:\n        reverse: [2,1]\n        first: s=2 -> >1? yes, break. \n   then r=0.\n\n So output 0.\n\n This matches the known sample.\n\n Therefore, we add a break in the suffix loop when s > x.\n\n So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n But note: the condition to break is after the check. Because if s==x, we don't break? But x = sum(a)//2, and s might be exactly x? Then we can continue? But the next candy will make s>x. But we break on s>x. \n\n Alternatively, we can break immediately after the condition. But the problem: if s>x, then any further suffix sums will be greater than x (because weights are positive), so we can break.\n\n So we do:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n Now for program2.py.\n\n The problem: \n   We are given an integer n, and we define s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times.\n   We can swap any two distinct indices any number of times.\n   We want to make sure that the string does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n   We want the minimum number of operations and to output one such sequence.\n\n The provided code:\n\n   t = int(input())\n   result = \"\"\n   while t:\n        t -= 1\n        n = int(input())\n        aux = int(n/2 if n%2==0 else n/2+1)\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        for i in range(aux):\n            result += str(2+3*i) + ' ' + str(3+3*(n-i-1)) + \"\\n\"\n   print(result[:-1])\n\n The code already handles the general case: it sets aux = ceil(n/2) (because if n is even, n/2; if odd, n/2+1). Then for i in range(aux), it outputs a swap between index (2+3*i) and (3+3*(n-i-1)).\n\n But for n==1, it has a TODO.\n\n For n==1: \n   s(1) = \"BAN\"\n   We want to remove the subsequence \"BAN\".\n\n   The sample note says: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) to get \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n   So the minimum number of operations is 1.\n\n   Therefore, aux for n=1 should be 1.\n\n   But the code already sets aux = int(1/2+1) = int(0.5+1)=1? \n        aux = int(n/2+1) for n=1: n/2+1 = 0.5+1 = 1.5 -> int(1.5)=1? \n\n   But then the for loop: for i in range(1): \n        i=0: \n            index1 = 2+3*0 = 2\n            index2 = 3+3*(1-0-1) = 3+3*(0)=3\n\n   But the string \"BAN\" has length 3. \n        Indices: 1: 'B', 2: 'A', 3: 'N'\n        Swapping indices 2 and 3: \n            original: [0:'B', 1:'A', 2:'N'] (0-indexed)\n            swapping index1=2 (0-indexed index1-1=1) and index2=3 (0-indexed index2-1=2) -> \n                becomes: [0:'B', 1:'N', 2:'A'] -> \"BNA\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n            But \"BAN\" as a subsequence: \n                B at index0, A at index? there is no 'A' after index0? There is an 'A' at index2? \n                We can take B at0, A at2, and then we need an 'N' after index2? but there is none. \n                Or B at0, then we can take N at1, then we need an 'A' after index1? there is an 'A' at index2? -> B, N, A -> that is not \"BAN\", it is \"BNA\". \n\n        But is \"BAN\" a subsequence of \"BNA\"? \n            We can take the 'B' at0, then skip the 'N' at1, then take the 'A' at2: that forms \"BA\", but not \"BAN\" because we are missing the 'N' after the 'A'. \n            Or take the 'B' at0 and then the 'A' at2: that forms \"BA\", not \"BAN\". \n            Or take the 'B' at0 and then the 'N' at1: that forms \"BN\", and then there's no 'A' after index1? there is an 'A' at index2, but that is after the 'N', so we cannot use it for the 'A' in \"BAN\" because in \"BAN\" the 'A' comes before the 'N'. \n\n        So \"BAN\" is not a subsequence.\n\n   Therefore, the code for n=1 is already handled by the general case? \n\n   But the sample note says: swap indices 1 and 2. In the code, it is swapping indices 2 and 3 (which are 1-indexed indices 2 and 3). \n\n   The sample note says: swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2 -> that would be indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed).\n\n   In the code, for n=1, the for loop outputs: \n        \"2 3\"\n\n   But the sample expected: \"1 2\"\n\n   This is a discrepancy.\n\n   Why? \n\n   The problem says: output any sequence of swaps that achieves the goal with the minimum number of operations.\n\n   Both are valid? \n        Swap (1,2): \n            \"BAN\" -> swap index0 and index1: \n                becomes: \"ABN\" -> which is different from \"BNA\", but also valid.\n\n   But the problem says: if there are multiple, output any.\n\n   However, the sample expected output for the first test case (n=1) is:\n        1\n        1 2\n\n   But our code outputs:\n        1\n        2 3\n\n   So we must change the code for n=1 to output \"1 2\".\n\n   But the general case for n>=2 uses a formula that for i in range(aux):\n        index1 = 2+3*i\n        index2 = 3+3*(n-i-1)\n\n   For n=1: \n        i=0: \n            index1 = 2+0 = 2\n            index2 = 3+3*(1-0-1)=3+0=3\n\n   So it outputs \"2 3\".\n\n   We need to output \"1 2\" for n=1.\n\n   Therefore, we can handle n=1 separately.\n\n   The TODO: if n==1, then we output:\n        result += \"1\\n\"   # because aux=1, so the first line is \"1\"\n        then for the swap: \"1 2\"\n\n   But the code already does: \n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"   # for n=1, aux=1, so it adds \"1\\n\"\n        then the for loop: for i in range(aux):  # aux=1, so one iteration\n            result += str(2+3*i) + ' ' + str(3+3*(n-i-1)) + \"\\n\"   # which is \"2 3\\n\"\n\n   We don't want that for n=1.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue   # skip the for loop\n\n   But the code after the if n==1 is the general code that does the same: it outputs the number of operations and then the swaps. We want to skip the general for loop for n=1.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But then the while loop continues.\n\n   Alternatively, we can skip the for loop for n==1 by not doing the for loop when n==1? \n\n   But the code has:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        for i in range(aux):\n            ...\n\n   We cannot change the structure arbitrarily. We must only fill the TODO.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # We set aux to 1? it is already set to 1.\n            # But then we want to output the swap \"1 2\", not the general one.\n            # We can override the for loop by not using it and instead output \"1 2\", then skip the for loop.\n            # But the code after the TODO will do: \n            #   result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"   -> \"1\\n\"\n            #   then the for loop: which would output \"2 3\"\n            # So we need to avoid that.\n\n   How about:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            # then we skip the rest of the code for this test case? \n            # but the code will then do: \n            #   result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"   -> appends \"1\\n\" again?\n            #   then the for loop: appends \"2 3\\n\"\n            # so we get:\n            #   \"1\\n1 2\\n1\\n2 3\\n\"\n            # which is wrong.\n\n   We must skip the general code for n==1.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue   # this will skip the rest of the while loop body for this test case? \n\n   But the continue will skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the while loop.\n\n   The structure:\n\n        while t:\n            t -= 1\n            n = int(input())\n            aux = int(n/2 if n%2==0 else n/2+1)\n\n            if n == 1:\n                result += \"1\\n\"\n                result += \"1 2\\n\"\n                continue   # skip the rest of the test case\n\n            result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n            for i in range(aux):\n                ...\n\n   This will work.\n\n   But note: the problem says the minimum number of operations for n=1 is 1, and we output one operation: swap(1,2).\n\n   For n>=2, the code uses the formula.\n\n   The sample for n=2: \n        aux = ceil(2/2)=1.\n        for i in range(1):\n            index1 = 2+3*0 = 2\n            index2 = 3+3*(2-0-1)=3+3*1=6\n        So output: \n            1\n            2 6\n\n        The string s(2) = \"BANBAN\", which is 6 characters: \n            index1: 1: 'B', 2: 'A', 3: 'N', 4: 'B', 5: 'A', 6: 'N'\n        Swapping index2 (which is 2) and index6 (which is 6) (1-indexed):\n            swap the 'A' at index2 and the 'N' at index6.\n            becomes: \n                index1: 'B'\n                index2: 'N' (from index6)\n                index3: 'N' (remains) -> wait, no: \n                Original: \n                    positions: \n                        1: 'B'\n                        2: 'A'\n                        3: 'N'\n                        4: 'B'\n                        5: 'A'\n                        6: 'N'\n                Swap positions 2 and 6:\n                    position2 becomes 'N' (from the last)\n                    position6 becomes 'A' (from position2)\n                New string: \n                    'B', 'N', 'N', 'B', 'A', 'A' -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        The sample note says: \"BNNBAA\" does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        But the sample expected operation for n=2 is: \n            swap index2 and index6? \n\n        However, the sample note says: \"swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6\", which is the same.\n\n   So the code for n>=2 is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But note: the continue will skip the rest of the test case processing, including the general code.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the continue by using an else:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n        else:\n            result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n            for i in range(aux):\n                ...\n\n   But the provided code after the TODO is:\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        for i in range(aux):\n            ...\n\n   So if we do the above, we must not execute that for n==1.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n        else:\n            result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n            for i in range(aux):\n                ...\n\n   But the code after the TODO is already there. We are only allowed to fill the TODO.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   This will skip the two lines after the TODO.\n\n   But the two lines after the TODO are:\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        for i in range(aux):\n            ...\n\n   We want to skip them for n==1.\n\n   So the continue is appropriate.\n\n   But note: the variable aux is computed even for n==1, but that's fine.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n   And for program2.py:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py the missing code is the block under the TODO, and for program2.py the missing code is the block under the TODO.\n\n   However, in program1.py, the TODO is only the condition, but we are also adding a break after. So the entire block for the TODO is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n   But the original code has:\n\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO comment with the above block.\n\n   Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace it with:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But note: the continue is necessary to skip the rest of the test case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON format.\n\n   We output:\n\n   {\n      \"program1\": \"if s in d: \\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\\n        if s > x:\\n            break\",\n      \"program2\": \"result += \\\"1\\\\n\\\"\\n            result += \\\"1 2\\\\n\\\"\\n            continue\"\n   }\n\n   But note: the program1 code must be indented properly. The original code has 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write it in a single line? But that would be messy.\n\n   We output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n   For program1.py, the TODO is at the same indentation level as the for loop body. The for loop body is:\n\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO comment with:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n        if s > x:\n            break\n\n   But note: the variable 's' is the suffix sum, and we are breaking when it exceeds x.\n\n   For program2.py, the TODO is:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the comment with:\n\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But the indentation: the if block is already indented. The code we add should be at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n   However, the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the comment with three lines of code, each indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n   Actually, the existing code in program2.py is:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        result += str(aux) + \"\\n\"\n        ...\n\n   We want to replace the TODO with:\n\n        if n == 1:\n            result += \"1\\n\"\n            result += \"1 2\\n\"\n            continue\n\n   But note: the continue will skip the next two lines (the result += ... and the for loop) for this test case.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer."
