    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe have a while loop that runs for `n` test cases. For each test case, we read an integer `num`.\nThe code already handles:\n  - If num >= 1900: print \"Division 1\"\n  - Else if num >= 1600: print \"Division 2\"\n  - Else if num >= 1400: we have a TODO\n  - Else: print \"Division 4\"\n\nAccording to the problem, the divisions are:\n  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> so we have already checked num>=1600 and we know it's not >=1900, so it's in [1600, 1899] -> so we print \"Division 2\"\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599 -> so for the condition `elif num>=1400:`, we should print \"Division 3\"\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399 -> which is the else.\n\nTherefore, for the TODO, we just need to print \"Division 3\".\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n    print(\"Division 3\")\n\nBut note: the code already has the condition `elif num>=1400:`, so we just need to complete the block.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are given a code snippet that processes test cases. The input is read all at once and then we skip the first two lines? Actually, the slicing is [2::2] meaning we take every other line starting from index 2 (so the third line, then fifth, etc.). But note: the first line is t, then for each test case we have two lines: the first is n (which we skip because we are taking every other line starting from index 2) and the second is the string s. So the variable `s` in the loop is the string of the picture for each test case.\n\nThe code then does:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe idea is that we split the string by 'W'. This breaks the string into segments of non-white characters. For each segment, we need to check if it is possible to form that segment with the stamp.\n\nObservations from the problem:\n- The stamp always colors two adjacent cells (one red and one blue) and must be applied entirely within the cells. Also, the same cell can be stamped multiple times.\n- Note that the entire picture must be formed by these stamps. Also, we can start from white and apply the stamps arbitrarily many times.\n\nKey insight:\n- The stamp operation is reversible? Actually, we can think in terms of invariants.\n- Notice that the stamp flips two adjacent cells from white to one red and one blue (in either order). But note that multiple stamps can be applied to the same cell, which effectively toggles the color (because each stamp changes the color: for example, if a cell is stamped an odd number of times, it becomes the opposite of what it would be if stamped once, and even becomes white? Actually, no: because the stamp always sets the color to either red or blue, and if stamped multiple times, the color might change again.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to note:\n1. The entire picture must be partitioned into contiguous non-white segments separated by white. Each contiguous non-white segment must be independently stampable.\n2. In each contiguous segment (which has no white), we can only have an even number of cells? Actually, no: because the stamp covers two cells at a time, but note that the segment might be of odd length? However, observe that the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So if the segment has odd length, it is impossible? Actually, no: because we can stamp overlapping. But note: the entire segment must be covered by stamps that are aligned on adjacent pairs.\n\nBut note: the problem states that the stamp must fit entirely on the n cells. So we can only cover adjacent pairs.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n- The stamp operation is linear? We can model the problem as a system of linear equations modulo 2? \n\nAlternatively, we can use known results from similar problems (like Codeforces Round #731 (Div. 3) problem C). The known solution for this problem is:\n\nWe break the string into contiguous non-white segments. For each segment:\n  - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible (because we cannot stamp a single cell).\n  - Also, the segment must contain at least one red and at least one blue? Why? Because the stamp always produces one red and one blue. However, note that if the entire segment is of the same color, that is impossible? \n\nActually, consider:\n  - The stamp always produces one red and one blue. Therefore, in any contiguous non-white segment, the number of red and blue must be at least one? Not exactly: because we can stamp multiple times. But note: the entire segment must be formed by a sequence of stamps that cover adjacent pairs. \n\nKnown solution from Codeforces problems (e.g., \"Stamped Coloring Book\" or similar) is:\n  - Split the string by 'W'\n  - For each segment in the split (if the segment is non-empty):\n        if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n        OR: if the segment does not have both 'R' and 'B' -> invalid.\n\nWhy? Because if the entire segment is only one color, say all 'R', then how can we form it? \n  - Consider: we start with white. We need to form a segment of all 'R'. \n  - The stamp always produces one 'R' and one 'B'. So if we have a segment of all 'R', then we must have an even number of stamps? But note: if we stamp a pair and then restamp part of it, we can change a blue to red? \n\nActually, the key invariant:\n  - The entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\nBut wait: what about a segment of length 1? We cannot stamp a single cell. So that is impossible.\n\nWhat about a segment of length 2? \n  - It must be either \"RB\", \"BR\", \"RR\", or \"BB\". \n  - But note: we can only form \"RB\" or \"BR\" with one stamp. \n  - For \"RR\": we would have to stamp the same pair twice? \n        Example: stamp the pair: becomes RB. Then if we stamp the same pair again, it becomes BR? Then if we stamp again, it becomes RB? \n        Actually, the problem says: each usage of the stamp recolors both cells. So if we stamp a cell twice, it goes from white to (say) R and then if stamped again, it becomes the other color? \n\nBut note: the stamp always sets the two cells to R and B (in some order). So if we stamp a pair once, we get either RB or BR. If we stamp the same pair again, we get the opposite? Then if we stamp a third time, we get the first again? \n\nSo to get \"RR\", we would have to have:\n  - First stamp: set cell1 and cell2 to RB. Then we stamp cell1 and cell2 again: that would set them to BR. Then we have BR. Then we stamp cell1 and cell2 again: RB. \n  - We can never get two reds? \n\nSimilarly, we can never get two blues? \n\nTherefore, the only possible two-cell patterns are RB and BR. \n\nBut wait: what if we use overlapping stamps? \n  Example for three cells: \n      We can do:\n        WWW -> stamp on cells 1 and 2: becomes RBW -> then stamp on cells 2 and 3: then cell2 (which is B) is stamped again: becomes R (because the stamp sets the two cells to the opposite: so when stamping a blue cell, it becomes red? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to one red and one blue regardless of the previous state? \n\nThe problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". \n\nSo if a cell is blue and we stamp it again (with a stamp that covers it and an adjacent cell), then that blue cell becomes either red or blue? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to a fixed pattern: either the left becomes red and the right blue, or the left becomes blue and the right red. \n\nTherefore, if a cell is stamped multiple times, the color it ends up with depends on the number of times it was stamped and the orientation of the stamp each time. \n\nBut note: each stamp flips the color? Actually, no: because the stamp sets the color to a specific value. It doesn't flip. \n\nSo if a cell is stamped twice, the second stamp will overwrite the first. \n\nTherefore, to get two reds in a row, we would have to have a stamp that sets two adjacent cells to RR. But the stamp only produces RB or BR. So we cannot have two adjacent reds? \n\nBut wait: what if we stamp two overlapping pairs? \n  Example: three cells: \n      Step 1: stamp cells 1 and 2: becomes RBW.\n      Step 2: stamp cells 2 and 3: now the stamp sets cell2 and cell3. But note: the stamp sets cell2 to the opposite of what it was set in the first stamp? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So if we set cells 2 and 3 to BR, then cell2 (which was B) becomes R? and cell3 becomes B? Then we have R R B? \n      So we have two reds: at cell1 and cell2.\n\nBut note: the stamp sets both cells at the same time. So in step 2, we set cell2 to R and cell3 to B. Then the entire string becomes: R (from step1, cell1), R (from step2, cell2), B (from step2, cell3). \n\nSo we can have two reds? \n\nBut then we have a segment \"RRB\". \n\nWhat if we want \"RR\"? \n  - We can have two cells: \n        We stamp the pair as RB, then we stamp the same pair as BR: then we get BR? \n        Then we stamp again as RB: then we get RB? \n        We never get RR.\n\n  - For three cells: \n        We can get \"RRB\", but not \"RR\" in two cells? \n\nActually, we cannot have two adjacent reds without a blue at the end? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire segment is contiguous and we can use multiple stamps arbitrarily. \n\nHowever, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to split by 'W' and then for each contiguous non-white segment:\n  - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> output NO.\n  - Else, if the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B', then it's impossible.\n\nWhy? Because if the entire segment is only one color (say all red), then how did we get that? \n  - Consider: the stamp always produces one red and one blue. So if we have a segment of all red, then every time we stamped, we also produced a blue. But then where are the blues? They must be in the segment? \n\nBut wait: we can restamp a blue to turn it into red? \n  - However, when we restamp a blue, we are forced to also stamp an adjacent cell. That adjacent cell might then become blue? \n\nActually, the invariant is that the number of reds and blues in the entire segment must be such that they are balanced? \n\nBut note: we can have an odd number of reds? \n\nKnown solution (from Codeforces) for the same problem (problem C of Round 731) is:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      s = input().strip()\n      parts = s.split('W')\n      valid = True\n      for part in parts:\n          if part == '':\n              continue\n          if len(part) == 1:\n              valid = False\n              break\n          if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n              valid = False\n              break\n      print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so we can do this.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py is:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b = 0\n        for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nWe see that they are splitting by 'W'. The variable `i` is each contiguous non-white segment.\n\nThe variable `b` is initially 0. Then we do something in the loop. Then we print using 'YNEOS '[b::2]. \n\nThis is a trick: \n  - If b is 0, then we get 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> which is 'YES' (because it takes every other character: index0: 'Y', index2: 'E' -> but wait, let me check: \n        'YNEOS' -> \n          index0: 'Y'\n          index2: 'E'\n          index4: 'S' -> so [0::2] gives 'YES'? Actually, no: \n          [0::2] takes indices 0, 2, 4 -> 'Y', 'E', 'S' -> \"YES\"?\n        But the string is 'YNEOS' -> which is 5 characters: \n          index0: 'Y'\n          index1: 'N'\n          index2: 'E'\n          index3: 'O'\n          index4: 'S'\n        So [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> \"YES\"\n        [1::2] -> indices 1,3 -> \"NO\"\n\nSo if we set b=0, we get \"YES\", and if we set b=1, we get \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the code does:\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nSo we want to set b to 0 if the picture is valid, and to 1 if we find any invalid segment.\n\nHowever, the loop iterates over segments. We want to set b=1 if we find at least one invalid segment.\n\nSo the plan in the loop:\n   For each segment i (which is a string of non-white characters):\n        if the segment is empty, skip.\n        else:\n            if the length of the segment is 1, then set b=1 (invalid).\n            else if the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B', then set b=1.\n\nBut note: we can break early? The code doesn't break, but we can set b=1 and then continue? The problem says the total length is bounded, so we can do.\n\nHowever, the code does not break the loop, so we must set b=1 and then continue to check the next segments? But if one segment is invalid, the entire test case is invalid.\n\nBut note: the variable `b` is initially 0. We want to set it to 1 if we find any invalid segment. We can do:\n\n    if not i:  # if the segment is empty, skip\n        continue\n    if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i): \n        b = 1\n\nBut wait: the condition for the segment: \n   We require that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n   Also, the segment must have length>=2. \n\nBut note: if the segment has length>=2, but if it has both 'R' and 'B', then it's valid? \n\nBut what if the segment is \"RRB\": that has both R and B -> valid.\nWhat if the segment is \"RR\": that does not have B -> invalid.\n\nSo the condition: \n   if len(i)==1: invalid.\n   else:\n        if i contains only one color (either only R or only B): invalid.\n\nSo we can write:\n   if len(i)==1:\n        b = 1\n   elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n        b = 1\n\nBut note: if the segment is empty, we skip. The split by 'W' might produce empty strings.\n\nSo the code for the TODO in program2.py:\n\n    if i == '': \n        continue\n    if len(i)==1:\n        b = 1\n    else:\n        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: we can write more concisely:\n\n    if i != '' and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n        b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition: \n   (len(i)==1) OR (('R' not in i) OR ('B' not in i)) \n   -> if len(i)==1, then we set b=1. \n   -> if len(i)>=2, then we set b=1 only if either 'R' is missing or 'B' is missing.\n\nBut note: if the segment is \"RR\" (so no 'B'), then we set b=1. Similarly for \"BB\".\n\nHowever, if the segment is \"R\" (len=1) -> set b=1.\n\nBut what if the segment is \"RB\" (len=2): then we have both R and B -> valid -> we don't set b.\n\nBut note: the condition: \n   if i != '' and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)):\n        b = 1\n\nThis condition is equivalent to: \n   if the segment is non-empty and (it has length 1 OR it doesn't have R OR it doesn't have B) -> invalid.\n\nBut note: if the segment has length 1, then it doesn't have both R and B? Actually, it has one character. So we don't need to check the presence of both? \n\nBut the condition is OR, so if the segment has length 1, we set b=1. Also, if the segment has length>=2 but is missing R, we set b=1. Similarly if missing B.\n\nBut note: if the segment has length>=2 and is missing R (so it's all B) -> invalid. Similarly, if missing B (so all R) -> invalid.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nBut note: we must not break the loop because we have to check all segments? Actually, if we set b=1, we can break early? The problem does not require to break, but it's more efficient. However, the total length is bounded by 10^5, and the worst-case we have many segments, but the total length is 10^5, so we can do without break. But we can break? Actually, we can break early if we set b=1? But the problem does not require to check the rest? \n\nBut the code does not break. We can leave it as is: set b=1 and then continue to the next segment. But if we set b=1, then the answer is already \"NO\", so we don't need to break. \n\nAlternatively, we can break the inner loop? But the code does not provide a break. We can do:\n\n    if i != '':\n        if len(i)==1:\n            b = 1\n        elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: we must not break the loop because there might be multiple segments. We need to check every segment. Because if one segment is invalid, the entire picture is invalid. So we set b=1 and then continue to the next segment. Then at the end, we output based on b.\n\nBut what if we have multiple segments and one is invalid and then later we see a valid segment? We still want to output \"NO\". So we set b=1 and then we don't change it back.\n\nSo the code for the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n    if i != '':\n        if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition: \n   if the segment is non-empty and (length==1 OR no R OR no B) -> invalid.\n\nBut wait: the condition \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is equivalent to \"if the segment does not contain both R and B\". \n\nSo we can write:\n\n    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n        b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition \"if i\" is the same as \"if i != ''\".\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition is a bit ambiguous? Let me test with a segment \"RRB\":\n   len(i)=3 -> not 1 -> then check: 'R' in i -> True, so 'R' not in i is False. 'B' in i -> True, so 'B' not in i is False. So the condition becomes: False or False -> False. So we don't set b.\n\nWith segment \"RR\":\n   len(i)=2 -> not 1 -> then: 'R' in i -> True, so 'R' not in i is False. But 'B' not in i -> True. So the condition: False or True -> True -> set b=1.\n\nWith segment \"R\" (len=1): condition is True -> set b=1.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut note: the condition is written as: \n   (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\nThis is equivalent to: \n   (len(i)==1) or (not ('R' in i and 'B' in i))\n\nBut we want: \n   if the segment is non-empty and (it has length 1 OR it does not have both colors) -> invalid.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n    print(\"Division 3\")\n\nAnd for program2.py is:\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nNow, we output in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output the exact code that goes in the TODO, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is one line: \n    print(\"Division 3\")\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is one line (or block? but we can write one line) as above.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program2.py is inside a for-loop and we are replacing the TODO with that one line.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code already has an indentation level. The TODO is at the same level as the for-loop. We are replacing the TODO with two lines? \n\nAlternatively, we can write it as one line? \n\nBut the condition is long. We can write:\n\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i): b=1\n\nBut the original code style uses multiple lines. However, the problem does not specify style. But to be safe, we can write it as two lines.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code in program2.py is a block that replaces the TODO. The TODO is currently a comment. We are replacing that comment with two lines of code.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n        if i != '':\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n\nBut that is three lines. The problem does not specify the exact style, but the condition can be written in one line as above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nWe'll output the two-line version for program2.py to be clear.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". So we can output the block.\n\nBut note: the example output format is a string. We must escape newlines.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as a single string with a newline.\n\nSo:\n\n  \"program2\": \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\nBut wait: the condition in the if-statement for program2.py: we have to be cautious about operator precedence? The condition is:\n\n   if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n   if (i is non-empty) and ( (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i) )\n\nBut note: the 'and' has higher precedence than 'or'? Actually, no: and has higher precedence than or. So:\n\n   if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\nis the same as:\n\n   if (i) and ( (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i) )\n\nBut we want: if the segment is non-empty and one of the three conditions (len==1, no R, no B) holds.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without parentheses for the or? \n\n   if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\nBut without the inner parentheses, it would be:\n\n   if (i) and (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\nThat is not what we want. So we must have the parentheses.\n\nBut wait: the condition is:\n\n   if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\nThe parentheses group the three conditions. So it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2.py, the variable `i` is the segment. We are using `i` as the string.\n\nWe are done."
