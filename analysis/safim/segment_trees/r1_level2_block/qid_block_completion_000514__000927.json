So the program2 string becomes:\n\n            \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          This is not what we want. I see: we must double-escape. The final JSON string for the whole answer should be:\n\n            \"{\\\"program1\\\": \\\"p.append(p[-1] + w)\\\", \\\"program2\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\\\\\n            b=1\\\\\\\\n            break\\\"}\"\n\n          This is not readable. Given the complexity, and since the problem is for a contest, we output the JSON as:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\", \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"}\n\n          and hope that the evaluator can handle the newlines in the string. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then we output a JSON.",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to complete two Python programs: `program1.py` and `program2.py`. Each program addresses a specific problem, and the solutions must ensure that when `program1.py` is executed and its output is piped to `program2.py`, the combined operation runs correctly.\n\n### Solution for `program1.py`\nThe problem involves processing multiple queries on a list of item prices. For each query, given values `x` and `y`, we need to determine the maximum total value of the `y` cheapest items when a customer buys at least `x` items. The solution involves:\n1. **Sorting the Prices**: The prices are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient query processing.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Query Processing**: For each query `(x, y)`, compute the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the most expensive `x` items. This is done by accessing the prefix sum array at positions `n - x` and `n - x + y`.\n\nThe missing code in `program1.py` appends the cumulative sum of the sorted prices to the prefix sum array `p`.\n\n### Solution for `program2.py`\nThe problem is to determine if a given string (representing a sequence of cells) can be formed by stamping adjacent cells with either \"RB\" or \"BR\" patterns. The solution involves:\n1. **Splitting by White Cells**: The string is split into segments separated by 'W' (white cells).\n2. **Segment Validation**: For each non-empty segment:\n   - **Single Character Check**: If a segment has only one character, it's invalid.\n   - **Color Presence Check**: If a segment lacks either 'R' or 'B', it's invalid.\n3. **Result Determination**: If all segments are valid, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThe missing code in `program2.py` checks each segment from the split string for the above conditions and sets a flag `b` to 1 if any segment is invalid.\n\n### Final Code\nThe completed programs are as follows:\n\n#### `program1.py`\n```python\nf=open(0)\nR=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\nn,q=R();p=[0]\nfor w in sorted(R()): p.append(p[-1] + w)\nfor _ in \" \"*q: x, y=R();print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n```\n\n#### `program2.py`\n```python\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b=1\n            break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **program1.py**: The program reads the number of items `n` and queries `q`, followed by the item prices. It sorts the prices and constructs a prefix sum array `p`. For each query, it computes the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the most expensive `x` items using the prefix sums.\n- **program2.py**: The program processes each test case by splitting the input string into segments separated by 'W'. For each segment, it checks if the segment is valid (length at least 2 and contains both 'R' and 'B'). If any segment is invalid, it sets the flag `b` to 1, leading to \"NO\"; otherwise, \"YES\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves both problems within the given constraints.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about processing queries for a promotion: \n   - We have n items with prices. We sort the prices (ascending) and then we build a prefix sum array p.\n   - The idea: for a query (x, y): \n        The customer must buy at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the y cheapest among the purchased items),\n        the customer will buy exactly x items (because buying more might not help and the free items are the cheapest ones, so we want to minimize the free ones? Actually, we want to maximize the free value, so we want the free items to be as expensive as possible).\n\n   However, note: the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased ones. So to maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest items to be as expensive as possible. How?\n        We can choose which x items to buy. We want the y cheapest of the x to be as expensive as possible.\n\n        Strategy: \n          - We sort the prices in ascending order. Then the cheapest items are at the beginning.\n          - But note: if we choose the most expensive x items, then the y cheapest among them are the first y of these x (which are the (n-x)th to (n-1)th in the sorted array, and then the next y? Actually, the entire set of x items we choose is a contiguous block? Not necessarily, but note: we can rearrange arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose any set of x items.\n\n        However, to maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest in the chosen set), we want the y cheapest in the set to be as large as possible. Therefore, we should choose the set that has the largest possible y smallest items. How?\n          - We can take the entire set of items and then remove the smallest (x-y) items? Actually, we can think: \n          The free value is the sum of the y smallest in the set. To maximize that, we want the y smallest to be as large as possible. So we can take the largest y items? But then the set must have at least x items. \n\n        Actually, the optimal strategy is to take the largest x items, and then the y cheapest among these x are the smallest items in this set. Since we sorted in ascending order, the largest x items are the last x in the sorted array. The smallest in this set is at index n-x, then n-x+1, ... up to n-x+y-1.\n\n        Therefore, the free value is the sum of the segment [n-x, n-x+y-1] in the sorted array.\n\n        We precompute the prefix sum array p, where:\n          p[0] = 0\n          p[i] = p[i-1] + a[i-1]   (if a is the sorted list of prices, 0-indexed)\n\n        Then the sum from index l to r-1 is p[r] - p[l].\n\n        For the segment from n-x to n-x+y-1 (0-indexed), the sum is:\n          p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]\n\n        But note: our array p is built for the entire sorted array. The sorted array is in ascending order.\n\n        However, the code provided already sorts the prices and builds an array p. The current code:\n\n          n,q=R();p=[0]\n          for w in sorted(R()): \n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then it loops over queries and prints: p[n-x+y]-p[n-x]\n\n        So we need to build the prefix sum array. The loop is iterating over the sorted prices (which are in ascending order). We need to build the prefix sums.\n\n        The current p starts as [0]. Then for each w in the sorted list, we should append the cumulative sum.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: [3,5,1,5,10] -> sorted: [1,3,5,5,10]\n          p = [0, 1, 4, 9, 14, 24]\n\n        Then for a query (x=3, y=2): \n          n=5, so n-x = 5-3 = 2, n-x+y = 2+2=4.\n          p[4] - p[2] = 14 - 4 = 10 -> which is 5+5? But wait: the two cheapest in the set of the 3 most expensive (which are [5,5,10]) are the two 5's -> 5+5=10. Correct.\n\n        So the missing code in program1.py is to build the prefix sum array.\n\n        We can do:\n          p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n        Therefore, the loop becomes:\n\n          for w in sorted(R()):\n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n        But note: the initial p is [0]. Then we iterate over the sorted list and append the cumulative sum.\n\n        However, the problem says: the input has n and q, then the next line has n integers.\n\n        The R() in the sorted(R()) will read the next line? Actually, the first line was read by n,q=R(). Then the next line is read by R() in the sorted(R()).\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        So for program1.py, we complete the for loop as:\n\n          for w in sorted(R()):\n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n        But note: the sorted(R()) returns the sorted list of the n prices. We are building the prefix sum array of the sorted prices.\n\n        Then the rest of the code: for each query, we compute and print p[n-x+y] - p[n-x].\n\n        However, note: our prefix array p has length n+1 (indices 0..n). The indices n-x and n-x+y are in [0, n] and n-x+y <= n because y<=x and x<=n, so n-x+y <= n.\n\n        This is safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B'), determine if it is possible to obtain the pattern by stamping.\n\n The stamp: covers two adjacent cells and colors them as either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell, and the operations can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n How to solve?\n   Note: \n     - The stamp always colors two adjacent cells. Therefore, we cannot have a single non-white cell. \n        Example: if the string is \"R\", then it's impossible because we cannot stamp a single cell.\n\n     - Also, note that the stamping operation is reversible? Actually, we can think in terms of invariants.\n\n   Observing:\n     - The entire process: we start from all white. Each stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to either (R,B) or (B,R). \n\n     - We can consider the following:\n        Let's assign a value to the colors: \n          R -> 1\n          B -> -1\n          W -> 0\n\n        Then note that in one stamping operation, we set two adjacent cells to two values that are opposite (1 and -1). Therefore, the sum of the entire array remains 0? But wait, because we can overwrite, the operations are not linear.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n        We note that the stamping operation is reversible: we can remove a stamp that is applied last? But the problem is about construction.\n\n   Insight: \n        We can break the string into contiguous segments separated by white (W) cells. Why?\n          - Because white cells are never stamped? Actually, they can be stamped and then overwritten? But note: the stamping operation always sets two adjacent cells to non-white. However, if we stamp over a white cell, it becomes non-white. But then if we stamp again, we can change it? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So if a cell is stamped multiple times, its color is the result of the last stamp that covered it.\n\n        However, note: the entire picture must be built by stamping. We can use the following known solution for this problem (known from Codeforces problems):\n\n          Step 1: if the entire string is white, then we don't need any stamp -> YES.\n\n          Step 2: split the string by 'W'. Then for each contiguous non-white segment, we check:\n             - The segment must have at least two characters? Actually, no: if the segment has one character, then it's impossible? Because we cannot stamp a single cell.\n\n          But also, we must check the parity? \n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem D) is:\n\n          We can break the string by 'W'. For each segment (which is a contiguous string of non-white characters), we check:\n            - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return NO.\n            - Also, if the segment has all the same characters (like all 'R' or all 'B'), then it's impossible? Why? Because in one stamp we always produce one R and one B. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and one B? \n\n          Actually, we can have multiple stamps that overlap arbitrarily. The necessary conditions for a segment (without white) are:\n            - The segment length must be at least 2? Actually, we can have a segment of length 2: then it must be either \"RB\", \"BR\", \"RR\", \"BB\", ...? But wait: \n                 How to get \"RR\"? \n                    Start: WW -> stamp on the two: then we get either RB or BR. Then if we stamp again on the same two, we can flip: \n                         RB -> if we stamp again with the same orientation (BR) then we get: BR? Actually, no: \n                         First stamp: WW -> RB.\n                         Then stamp again: if we use BR on the same two: then we get: \n                             The stamp BR: first cell becomes B? but wait: the stamp sets the two cells to BR? \n                         Actually, the stamp always sets both cells. So if we stamp again on the same two, we can set them to either RB or BR. So we can change from RB to BR? But that doesn't give RR.\n\n                 How to get \"RR\"? \n                    Consider three cells: \n                      WWW -> stamp on the middle and right: set to ? say we set to WRB (but then the middle becomes R and the right becomes B) -> then we stamp on the left and middle: set to BR -> then we have: B R B? \n                    How to get two adjacent R's? \n                      Actually, we can have: \n                         WWW -> stamp the left two: BRW -> then stamp the left two again: but now we can set to RB? then we get R B W -> then we have two non-adjacent R's? \n\n                 Alternatively, we can use overlapping: \n                    WWW: \n                      Stamp the first two: BRW\n                      Stamp the last two: B then we stamp the last two: we set the last two to RB? then we get B R B? \n\n                 How about: \n                    WWW -> stamp the first two: RB W -> then stamp the second and third: then the second and third become (say) BR: then we get R (from the first stamp on the first two: the first becomes R? wait no: the first stamp set the first to R and the second to B? then the second stamp sets the second and third: the second becomes B? and the third becomes R? then we get R, B, R? \n\n                 Actually, we cannot get two adjacent R's? \n\n          Known solution: \n            - The entire string must be partitioned into segments by white. For each segment:\n                * If the segment has length 1: then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n                * Also, if the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B', then it's impossible. Why? Because if the segment is all 'R', then how was it produced? Each stamp produces one R and one B. So if we have a contiguous segment of R's, then the B's must have been covered by overlapping stamps? But note: we can cover a cell multiple times. \n\n          Actually, we can use an invariant: \n            Let f(c) = 1 if c=='R', -1 if c=='B'. Then for a contiguous segment without white, consider the alternating sum? \n\n          Known from Codeforces: \n            - The necessary and sufficient condition for a contiguous segment (without white) is that the segment must have at least two characters and must contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n          Why? \n            - Because we can simulate: \n                We can represent the coloring as a graph where each stamp operation is an edge between two adjacent nodes. Then each stamp operation flips the color of the two nodes? Actually, the color is determined by the parity of the number of stamps that have covered the cell and the types of the stamps? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy removal: \n            - We can remove any occurrence of RB or BR from the string? But note, the operations can be in any order and overlapping.\n\n          Actually, a known solution (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if s.count('R') == 0 and s.count('B') == 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '': \n                        continue\n                    if len(part) == 1:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    # Check if the part has at least one R and one B?\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n          However, note: what about a segment like \"RBRB\"? \n            It has both R and B, and length>=2 -> valid.\n\n          But what about \"RRBB\"? \n            It has both R and B -> valid.\n\n          What about \"RBBB\"? \n            It has both R and B -> valid.\n\n          But how do we form \"RR\"? \n            Actually, we cannot form a segment of length 2 that is \"RR\" or \"BB\". Why?\n              - To form two adjacent R's: \n                  We must stamp the two. The stamp sets one to R and the other to B. So we get either RB or BR. Then if we stamp again on the same two, we flip: so we get BR or RB? We never get two R's.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for a segment is:\n            - It must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          Why is that sufficient? \n            - We can use induction: \n                Base: a segment of length 2: if it is \"RB\" or \"BR\", then we can do it in one stamp. \n                For a segment of length 3: \n                  Possibilities: \n                    \"RRB\": \n                      How? \n                         Start: WWW -> \n                         Stamp the first two: RBW -> then stamp the last two: but the last two are W and W? then we get R and then the last two become RB? -> R, B, B -> not RRB.\n                  Actually, we can do:\n                    \"RBR\": \n                      Step1: stamp the middle and right: W -> RB -> then we have W, R, B? \n                      Step2: stamp the first two: set to BR -> then we have B, R, B -> not RBR.\n\n            Actually, known from Codeforces: the problem is solved by the above condition.\n\n          However, note the example in the problem: \n            Example 5: \"BRB\" -> YES? \n            Example 6: \"RBB\" -> YES? \n\n          The problem states:\n            Example 5: WWW -> W RB -> BRB -> then they say it's possible? \n            Actually, the example in the problem for the fifth test case: \n                \"BRB\" is achieved as: \n                  WWW -> W RB (stamp on the last two) -> then stamp on the first two: BR followed by B? -> then we get BRB? \n\n          How about \"RR\"? \n            The problem says: \n              \"The second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          The second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> then we split by 'W'? but there's no W -> the segment is \"RR\". \n            Condition: the segment has length 2, but it does not contain 'B' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          The third test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> then segment \"RB\": has both R and B -> valid -> YES? but the problem says the second, third, and fourth are NO.\n\n          Wait, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          But the third test case is \"RB\" -> which is achievable by one stamp. \n\n          Actually, the problem states the test cases:\n\n            The first test case: \"BRBB\" (n=4) -> YES (explained in the statement).\n            The second: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n            The third: n=2, s=\"R\" -> NO? but wait, the problem says: \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\", so the third test case must be of length 1? \n\n          The input specification: \n            The first line of each test case contains n, then a string of length n.\n\n          The examples in the note:\n\n            The second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n            The third: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES? but the note says the third is NO? \n\n          Actually, the note says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          This implies that the third test case is a single cell? \n\n          Looking at the input examples:\n\n            The test cases are:\n\n            7\n            4\n            BRBB\n            2\n            RR\n            2\n            RB\n            1\n            W\n            3\n            BRB\n            3\n            RBB\n            2\n            RW\n\n          And the expected answers:\n\n            YES   (for the first: BRBB)\n            NO    (for the second: RR)\n            NO    (for the third: RB) -> wait, but we can do RB in one stamp? \n            NO    (for the fourth: W -> but wait, n=1 and s=\"W\": then we don't need to stamp -> YES? but the problem says the fourth is NO? and the note says the fourth is NO because we cannot stamp a single cell? but here the cell is white -> we don't need to stamp. So it should be YES? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          The fourth test case: n=1, s=\"W\" -> we don't need to stamp -> YES? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells (it cannot be partially outside the cells).\"\n\n          For a single cell: we cannot use the stamp (because the stamp requires two adjacent cells). Therefore, the only way to have a non-white single cell is impossible. But if the single cell is white, then we don't need to stamp -> it's valid.\n\n          So the fourth test case: n=1, s=\"W\" -> YES.\n\n          The problem says the fourth test case is NO? \n\n          Actually, the note says the fourth test case is one of the ones that is impossible? \n\n          The example test cases in the note:\n\n            Test case 1: n=4, s=\"BRBB\" -> YES (explained in the statement).\n            Test case 2: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n            Test case 3: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> NO? but wait, the problem says the third test case is NO? \n            Test case 4: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO? because we cannot stamp a single cell? \n            Test case 5: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> YES.\n            Test case 6: n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> YES.\n            Test case 7: n=2, s=\"RW\" -> ? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          So the second: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO (because we cannot get two R's? as explained: we get one R and one B, so two R's is impossible? but wait, we can stamp multiple times? \n            How to get \"RR\": \n              Start: WW\n              Stamp: set to RB.\n              Then stamp again: set to BR? then we get BR? \n              Then stamp again: set to RB? \n              We can only alternate between RB and BR. We never get two R's.\n\n          The third: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES? because we can do it in one stamp. But the problem says the third is NO? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          The third test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> we are stamping two cells, not a single cell. So why would it be NO? \n\n          I see: the problem says the third test case is \"RB\", but the note says the third test case is NO? \n\n          This is a discrepancy.\n\n          Looking at the sample input:\n\n            The input has 7 test cases.\n\n            The first test case: n=4, s=\"BRBB\" -> YES.\n            The second: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n            The third: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> NO? but that contradicts our reasoning.\n\n          Actually, the problem note says:\n\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          This implies that the third test case is a single cell? But the input says n=2 for the third test case.\n\n          I think the problem note is referring to:\n\n            The second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO (because we cannot get two R's? but actually we can get RB or BR, not RR? so that's why NO) \n            The third test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES? but the note says the third is NO? \n\n          Actually, the note says the fourth test case: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO (because we cannot stamp a single cell). \n\n          And the third test case: the problem says in the input example: \n            \"2\n            RB\"\n\n          And the note says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases\" -> meaning the second, third, and fourth in the sample input? \n\n          The sample input:\n\n            7\n            4\n            BRBB   -> test1: YES\n            2\n            RR     -> test2: NO\n            2\n            RB     -> test3: ? \n            1\n            W      -> test4: YES? but the note says the fourth test case (which is the fourth in the sample) is NO? \n\n          Actually, the fourth test case in the sample is n=1, s=\"W\" -> which is white. We don't need to stamp -> YES.\n\n          The problem note says the fourth test case is NO? \n\n          I see: the problem note says:\n\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          But the fourth test case is \"W\", which doesn't require any stamp -> it's valid.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the sample input again:\n\n            The sample input:\n\n              7\n              4\n              BRBB\n              2\n              RR\n              2\n              RB\n              1\n              W\n              3\n              BRB\n              3\n              RBB\n              2\n              RW\n\n          And the expected output:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n            NO   -> for the third: RB -> NO? \n            NO   -> for the fourth: W -> NO? \n            YES\n            YES\n            ? \n\n          But the problem note says:\n\n            \"For the fifth test case, ... -> YES\"\n            \"For the sixth test case, ... -> YES\"\n            \"For the seventh test case, ... -> YES\" (because it's already white? but the seventh: n=2, s=\"RW\": which has one white and one red? \n\n          How to get \"RW\"? \n            We have two cells: \n              Start: WW\n              We can stamp the two? then we get RB or BR? but we want one R and one W? \n            We cannot leave one white? because the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So if we stamp the two, both become non-white. \n\n          Therefore, \"RW\" is impossible? \n\n          So the seventh: NO? \n\n          But the problem note says: \"For the seventh test case, you don't need to use the stamp at all.\" -> meaning the entire picture is white? but here the picture is \"RW\", which is not all white.\n\n          So the seventh test case: n=2, s=\"RW\" -> invalid.\n\n          Therefore, the sample outputs:\n\n            test1: YES\n            test2: NO\n            test3: NO   -> for \"RB\"?\n            test4: NO   -> for \"W\"?\n            test5: YES\n            test6: YES\n            test7: NO\n\n          But wait, test4: n=1, s=\"W\" -> we don't need to stamp -> YES.\n\n          Why is test4 \"W\" (n=1) being output as NO? \n\n          I see: the problem note says the fourth test case is NO? \n\n          Actually, the problem note says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          This might mean that in these test cases, there is a single non-white cell? \n\n          The fourth test case in the sample is n=1, s=\"W\" -> no non-white cell? \n\n          The problem note says: \n            \"For the fourth test case, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" -> meaning that if there were a non-white cell, we couldn't stamp it? but here there is none.\n\n          So the condition for a segment of length 1: \n            - If the segment is non-white (like \"R\" or \"B\") then it's invalid -> NO.\n            - If the segment is white, then we don't need to do anything -> valid.\n\n          But in the entire string, we break by white. The string \"W\" is broken into two empty parts? or one empty part? \n\n          Actually, splitting \"W\" by 'W' gives: ['', ''].\n\n          Then we iterate over the parts: \n            for part in ['','']: \n                if part == '': skip.\n\n          Then we don't break? so we consider it valid.\n\n          How about a string of one white: \n            We don't have any non-white segment -> valid.\n\n          But the sample input for the fourth test case: n=1, s=\"W\" -> we output YES.\n\n          However, the problem note says the fourth test case is NO? \n\n          I think the problem note is referring to the fourth test case that is impossible? and the sample input has 7 test cases, and the fourth test case in the sample is \"W\", which is valid.\n\n          There is a misunderstanding.\n\n          Actually, the problem note says:\n\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          And the sample input:\n\n            test2: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO (because we cannot get two R's? -> actually we can't, so NO)\n            test3: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> we can get it? but the problem says NO? \n            test4: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO (because we cannot stamp a single cell to make it R) -> but the sample input for test4 is \"W\", not \"R\".\n\n          The sample input for test4 is \"W\", but the problem note is describing test cases that are impossible? \n\n          I see: the problem note says:\n\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          meaning that in these test cases, there is a single cell that is non-white? \n\n          But in the sample input:\n\n            test2: \"RR\" -> two non-white cells? \n            test3: \"RB\" -> two non-white cells? \n            test4: \"W\" -> no non-white cell? \n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          After checking the problem statement again: \n            The sample test cases are:\n\n              Test case 1: n=4, s=\"BRBB\" -> YES.\n              Test case 2: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n              Test case 3: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> NO?

\n\n          I think the problem note is referring to the fourth test case that is impossible, which in the sample input is the seventh? \n\n          But the note lists:\n\n            The second, third, and fourth test cases (in the list of impossible ones) are:\n\n              second: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO\n              third: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> NO? \n              fourth: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO\n\n          But in the sample input, the fourth test case is \"W\", and the seventh is \"RW\". \n\n          The problem note says the fourth test case (meaning the fourth one in the list of the problem's examples) is n=1, s=\"R\", but in the sample input it is not present.\n\n          Therefore, we stick to the known solution:\n\n            Steps for one test case:\n              - Read n and the string s.\n              - If the entire string is white -> YES.\n              - Split the string by 'W' to get a list of non-white segments.\n              - For each segment in the list:\n                    if segment is empty: skip.\n                    if the length of the segment is 1: then it's invalid -> break and mark as NO.\n                    if the segment does not contain both 'R' and 'B': then invalid -> break and mark as NO.\n              - Otherwise, YES.\n\n          Let's test with the sample:\n\n            test1: s=\"BRBB\" -> split by 'W' -> ['BRBB'] -> \n                length=4 (>=2) -> contains both 'R' and 'B'? yes -> valid.\n\n            test2: s=\"RR\" -> split: ['RR'] -> \n                length=2 -> but does it contain both? no -> invalid.\n\n            test3: s=\"RB\" -> split: ['RB'] -> \n                contains both 'R' and 'B'? yes -> valid? but the sample input says NO? \n\n          Why is \"RB\" valid in our condition? \n            Our condition: \n              - length>=2: yes.\n              - contains at least one R and one B: yes.\n\n          So we would output YES for \"RB\". \n\n          But the problem note says the third test case is NO? \n\n          I see the problem: the sample input for the third test case is \"RB\", but the problem note says the third test case is impossible? \n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          After rethinking: \n            How do we form \"RB\"? \n              We can do it in one stamp: so it's valid -> YES.\n\n          Therefore, the sample input in the problem note might have a typo? \n\n          But the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          and then lists:\n\n            The second: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO (correct, because we cannot get two R's)\n            The third: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> YES? \n            The fourth: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO.\n\n          The problem note says the third test case is NO? \n\n          I think the problem note meant the third test case that is impossible is the one with a single cell? but the third test case in the sample input is \"RB\", which is possible.\n\n          Actually, the problem note says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n          This might be interpreted as: in these test cases, there is a single non-white cell? \n\n          The third test case in the sample input is \"RB\", which has two non-white cells -> not a single cell.\n\n          The fourth test case in the sample input is \"W\", which has no non-white cell -> not a single cell.\n\n          The sample input does not have a test case with a single non-white cell? \n\n          The fourth test case in the sample input is n=1, s=\"W\" -> no non-white cell.\n\n          The seventh test case: n=2, s=\"RW\" -> has one non-white cell? \n\n          How about we break the seventh test case: \n            s = \"RW\" -> split by 'W' -> ['R', ''] (or ['','R']? actually: \n                s.split('W') -> splits at the W: \n                  \"RW\" -> split at the W: ['R', ''].\n\n            Then we have two segments: \n                segment1: \"R\" -> length=1 -> invalid.\n\n          So we output NO for the seventh.\n\n          Therefore, the sample outputs:\n\n            test1: YES\n            test2: NO   (because \"RR\" has no B -> invalid)\n            test3: YES  (because \"RB\" has both -> valid)\n            test4: YES  (because no non-white segment -> valid)\n            test5: YES  (because \"BRB\" has both -> valid)\n            test6: YES  (because \"RBB\" has both -> valid)\n            test7: NO   (because one segment is \"R\" -> length=1)\n\n          But the problem note says:\n\n            test2: NO -> matches.\n            test3: NO -> does not match (we output YES) -> but the problem note says the third test case is NO? \n\n          I see: the problem note says the third test case is NO? \n\n          However, the sample input for the third test case is \"RB\", which is possible.\n\n          There is a known issue: the problem note might have intended the third test case to be \"R\" (n=1) but the sample input has n=2 for the third test case.\n\n          Given the constraints of the problem and the known solution from Codeforces, we trust the condition:\n\n            For each contiguous non-white segment:\n              if len(segment)==1 -> invalid.\n              if the segment does not have both R and B -> invalid.\n\n          Therefore, we will implement that.\n\n          Now, the code in program2.py:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          The variable b is initially 0. Then we want to set b=1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n          The string s is read from the input, and we are taking every second line starting from index 2 (so the first line is t, then the next is n, then the string, then next test case: n, string, ...). \n\n          We do: s[:-1] to remove the newline? then split by 'W'.\n\n          Then we iterate over the parts (i).\n\n          For each part i:\n            if i is empty: skip.\n            else:\n                if len(i)==1: then set b=1 and break? \n                else: if the part has only 'R's or only 'B's? -> set b=1 and break.\n\n          But note: we can break out of the loop, but we have to check all segments? We can break early.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            for part in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if part == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(part)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                # Check if the part has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n                if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          However, note: the part might be \"R\" -> then we break and set b=1.\n\n          But what if there are multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: the entire string might be non-white? \n\n          Example: \"RR\" -> split by 'W' gives ['RR'] -> then we check: \n             len=2 -> not 1 -> then check: 'R' in part? yes, 'B' in part? no -> so set b=1.\n\n          So we output: \n             print('YNEOS'[b::2]) \n             if b=0: then we take the substring starting at 0 with step 2: 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> 'YES'\n             if b=1: then we take the substring starting at 1 with step 2: 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> 'NO'\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                parts = s[:-1].split('W')\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '': \n                        continue\n                    if len(part)==1:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          However, note: what if the string ends with 'W'? \n            Example: \"RWR\" -> split gives ['R','','R'] -> then we check the two non-empty parts: \n                \"R\" -> invalid -> b=1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are splitting and then checking each segment, and the total length is bounded.\n\n          However, the condition 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part: \n            This is O(n) per segment? but the total length of all segments over test cases is <= 10^5? because the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n          So it's efficient.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for part in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if part == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(part)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But note: the code already has a for loop:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n\n          So we can use:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i == '': continue\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b=1; break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b=1; break\n\n          We can write it in one line? but we have multiple conditions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But note: if i is empty, we skip. And if i is non-empty, then we check: \n            if (len(i)==1) -> invalid, or if it doesn't have both -> invalid.\n\n          However, the condition: \n            if (len(i)==1) -> then automatically 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i? because it has only one character. But we don't need to check the second condition if the first is true? \n\n          We can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i)):\n\n          But wait: if len(i)>=2, then we check if it has both? actually, we want to check if it does not have both -> which is: if 'R' not in i OR 'B' not in i.\n\n          But note: if the segment has both, then we skip.\n\n          So:\n\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1: invalid.\n                else: \n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: invalid.\n\n          We can combine:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)):\n\n          But note: if len(i)>=2, then we are checking: if 'R' not in i OR 'B' not in i -> that is, if it is missing one of them.\n\n          However, if we write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)):\n\n          This condition is always true for a non-empty i? because if len(i)>=2, then we are checking (false or ...) and then we check the next conditions: if either 'R' not in i' or 'B' not in i' is true, then the condition is true.\n\n          But note: the condition is ORed. So if len(i)>=2, then we are checking: (false) OR (condition1) OR (condition2) -> which is condition1 OR condition2.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n          However, this is not equivalent: \n            We want: if the segment is invalid -> set b=1 and break.\n\n          But note: if the segment has both R and B, then:\n            len(i)>=2 -> false, and 'R' not in i -> false, and 'B' not in i -> false -> so the condition is false -> we skip.\n\n          If the segment has only one character: true -> invalid.\n          If the segment has no R: then 'R' not in i -> true -> invalid.\n          If the segment has no B: then 'B' not in i -> true -> invalid.\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          But note: the condition is evaluated as: \n            (len(i)==1) OR ('R' not in i) OR ('B' not in i)\n\n          And if any of these is true, we break.\n\n          However, if the segment has both R and B and length>=2, then all are false -> we skip.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is to skip empty strings.\n\n          This is efficient.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          However, note: the condition \"or\" has lower precedence? we should use parentheses? \n\n          Actually, the condition is: \n            if (i is non-empty) and ( (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i) )\n\n          But we can write without extra parentheses? \n\n          Let me test: \n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n          This is parsed as: \n            if (i) and ( (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i) )\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          But note: the condition might be expensive? because if the segment is long, we do two membership tests? but the total length is bounded.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if i:\n                hasR = 'R' in i\n                hasB = 'B' in i\n                if len(i)==1 or not (hasR and hasB):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          This is also O(n) per segment.\n\n          But the condition we wrote is the same.\n\n          We'll use the one-liner.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the code already has the for loop header.\n\n          So we write inside the for loop:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the condition 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i is equivalent to not ('R' in i and 'B' in i). \n\n          But we can leave it as is.\n\n          Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n          Summary:\n\n            program1: \n                We add: p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n            program2:\n                We add: \n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          But note: the program2 code already has the for loop:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we complete the for loop body.\n\n          We write the JSON:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". And we must output the exact code to fill in.\n\n          For program1, the missing code is the body of the for loop. The for loop currently is:\n\n            for w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to replace the TODO with the body.\n\n          But note: the current code has no indentation? We assume the body should be indented.\n\n          We write: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\"\n\n          For program2, the missing code is the body of the for loop. The for loop is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to put the condition and the break.\n\n          But note: the next line is already intended? The code has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n            print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          We must indent the body we add.\n\n          However, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n          For program2, we output:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the original code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", which we remove.\n\n          We output the code exactly as it should appear in the program.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n          We output as a string.\n\n          But note: the JSON requires escaping newlines and quotes? \n\n          We are to output a JSON string. We must escape:\n\n            For program1: the string is \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\"\n\n            For program2: the string is \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b=1\\n    break\"\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. The current code in program2 has an indentation level of 4 for the outer for loop? \n\n          The code we are given:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          The body of the inner for loop should be indented one level more than the for statement.\n\n          We'll use 4 spaces for the inner block? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. We can use:\n\n            if ...:\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          with 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use one tab? but the problem uses spaces.\n\n          We'll use 4 spaces for each level.\n\n          The for loop is at the same level as the outer for loop? Actually, the outer for loop body is:\n\n                b=0\n                for ...: \n                print(...)\n\n          The inner for loop body must be indented one more level.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\"\n            program2: \n                \"if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n    b=1\\n    break\"\n\n          However, note: the program2 code already has the for loop header. We are only replacing the TODO with the body.\n\n          We output the body as a string with newlines and indentation.\n\n          We'll use 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n          But the existing code uses 4 spaces? \n\n          The outer for loop body has:\n\n                b=0\n\n          which is 4 spaces.\n\n          Then the inner for loop header is at 4 spaces? and then the body should be 8 spaces.\n\n          So:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n                if ...:   # 4 more spaces? so 8 in total? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. We can output:\n\n            \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact lines that are missing.\n\n          The missing code is the body of the for loop, which should be at the same indentation level as the next line? \n\n          Actually, the next line is the print statement, which is at the same level as the for loop. So the body of the for loop must be indented.\n\n          We'll assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\n          Therefore, the body should be:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          with the first line at 4 spaces (relative to the for loop) and the next two at 8.\n\n          But the for loop header is at 4 spaces? then the body should be 8.\n\n          How about we output:\n\n            program2: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the existing code has the for loop header at 4 spaces, and then the next line (the print) is at 4 spaces. We want the body to be inside the for loop.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the initial 4 spaces? because the for loop header is already there, and we are just putting the body? \n\n          The problem says: \"Output the missing code\" that replaces the TODO.\n\n          The TODO is in the same line as the for loop header? \n\n          The code: \n\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We want to replace the TODO with the body? Actually, we remove the TODO and put the body in the next lines.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            program2: \n                the string: \n                    \"\\n    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the for loop header ends with a colon, so the next line must be the body.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n                if ...: \n                    ...\n\n          So we output the body as:\n\n            \"\\n    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          But the problem says: the total code must run correctly.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            program1: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\"\n            program2: \"\\n    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          However, the program2 code already has the for loop header. We are adding the body.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the newline? \n\n          But the problem does not specify.\n\n          Let me write the intended program2:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          So the missing code for program2 is the three lines:\n\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n          We output these three lines as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n          We'll use 4 spaces for the first indent and 8 for the inner.\n\n          Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"\\n    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the for loop header is at 4 spaces, so the body should be at 8? \n\n          Actually, the outer for loop body is at 4 spaces. The inner for loop header is at 4 spaces (so the entire line is 4 spaces). Then the body of the inner for loop should be at 8 spaces.\n\n          So:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          The body of the inner for loop is:\n\n                    if ...:   -> 8 spaces\n                        b=1   -> 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            Level 0: for s ... (outer for)\n            Level 1: 4 spaces: b=0\n            Level 1: 4 spaces: for i ... (inner for)\n            Level 2: 8 spaces: if ... \n            Level 3: 12 spaces: b=1; break\n\n          But the problem does not specify. We can use 4 spaces for the first indent and 8 for the second.\n\n          However, the existing code has:\n\n                b=0   -> 4 spaces\n                for ...   -> 4 spaces\n                print ... -> 4 spaces\n\n          So the inner for loop body must be more than 4 spaces.\n\n          We'll use 8 and 12.\n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the exact lines that are missing.\n\n          We output:\n\n            program2: \n                \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          with 8 spaces for the if and 12 for the break? \n\n          Actually, we can use 4 and 8? \n\n          Let me see:\n\n            The outer for loop body (level1) is indented 4 spaces.\n            The inner for loop header is at level1 (4 spaces).\n            The body of the inner for loop should be level2: 8 spaces.\n\n            Then the if condition: 8 spaces.\n            The body of the if: level3: 12 spaces.\n\n          But the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are breaking early, so it's efficient.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            program2: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b=1\\n        break\"\n\n          This means:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces (because the for loop header is at 4 spaces, and we are adding 4 more? no) -> wait, the entire line should be 8 spaces? \n\n          How about we output the exact string that, when inserted after the for loop header, produces the correct indentation.\n\n          The for loop header is at 4 spaces. We want the next line to be 8 spaces for the if, and then 12 for the break.\n\n          We output:\n\n            \"\\n    if ...\" -> the first newline and then 4 spaces: so total 4 spaces? then the if is at 4+4=8 spaces.\n\n          Then the break: we output \"\\n        break\" -> 8 spaces (4+4) for the break? but we want 12.\n\n          We need 8 spaces for the if and 12 for the break.\n\n          So:\n\n            program2: \n                \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          This means:\n\n            After the for loop header, we output:\n                newline, then 8 spaces (so 8 in total: 4 from the outer and 4 added) -> then the if.\n            Then newline, then 12 spaces (4 from outer and 8 added) -> then b=1 and break.\n\n          But the outer for loop body is at 4 spaces. The inner for loop header is at 4 spaces. Then we want the body of the inner for loop to be at 8 spaces.\n\n          So:\n\n            Line1: 8 spaces: if ...\n            Line2: 12 spaces: b=1\n            Line3: 12 spaces: break\n\n          We output:\n\n            program2: \n                \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          This is 8 and 12.\n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. We'll use this.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the same as the outer body: the outer body uses 4 spaces, so the inner body should be 8 and the inner inner body 12.\n\n          We'll go with that.\n\n          Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n          But note: in JSON, we must escape backslashes and quotes.\n\n          We'll use a raw string? or escape.\n\n          We output the string with escaped newlines and spaces.\n\n          Actually, the newline is \\n, and in JSON we write it as \"\\\\n\".\n\n          But wait, no: in a JSON string, we use \\n for newline, and we don't escape the backslash? \n\n          Actually, in JSON, we use \\n for newline, and we don't need to escape the backslash? \n\n          But in a string in JSON, the backslash is escaped. So we write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if ... \\n            ...\"\n\n          But then the newline is represented as the two characters: backslash and n.\n\n          We want the actual newline? \n\n          The problem says: output the missing code. When we output the JSON, the value should be the string that contains the newline and spaces.\n\n          But in JSON, we can use \\n to represent newline.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the format of the JSON. We'll output the string with actual newlines? \n\n          But the problem says: output the JSON. We'll use standard JSON escaping.\n\n          We'll use:\n\n            \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          But then the newlines are in the string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          This is not necessary.\n\n          We'll output the JSON with actual newlines in the string? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then we output a JSON. \n\n          We'll generate a valid JSON.\n\n          We can use:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          But then when parsed, it becomes the string with the literal backslash and n.\n\n          We want the string to have a newline.\n\n          We should output:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          But in JSON, this is valid? \n\n          Yes, because newline is allowed in a string.\n\n          But in the overall output, it might be multi-line.\n\n          The problem says: output the JSON. We output a single line? or multi-line?\n\n          We output the JSON in a single line? \n\n          But the program2 string has newlines. We can escape the newlines as \\n.\n\n          We'll use:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          and hope that the newlines are preserved.\n\n          But the problem does not specify.\n\n          We'll output the JSON in a compact form.\n\n          Given the complexity, we output the program2 string with actual newline characters and spaces.\n\n          The entire JSON will be multi-line.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then we output a JSON.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n          But this is not valid JSON because of the newlines.\n\n          We must escape the newlines as \\n.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          We want the program2 string to be:\n\n            [newline]        if ... \n            [newline]            b=1\n            [newline]            break\n\n          But when we put that in a JSON string, we represent newline as the two-character sequence \\n.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          and the JSON encoder will handle it.\n\n          But we are writing the JSON as a string.\n\n          We'll assume the output is read by a JSON parser that understands newlines in string values.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following in the JSON string for program2:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          and then when parsed, the program will get the string:\n\n            \\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\n\n          which is not what we want.\n\n          We want the program to get the string with actual newlines.\n\n          Therefore, we output the JSON with actual newlines in the string.\n\n          The entire output will be:\n\n            {\n            \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n            \"program2\": \"\n                        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                            b=1\n                            break\"\n            }\n\n          This is not good.\n\n          Given the constraints, we output the JSON with escaped newlines.\n\n          We escape newline as \\n and backslash as \\\\.\n\n          So the string for program2 becomes:\n\n            \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          and in JSON, we write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          This is a valid JSON string.\n\n          But when read by a JSON parser, it will be unescaped to the intended string with newlines.\n\n          We'll do that.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program2 string has newlines. We are writing it in a JSON string with the newlines represented as \\n.\n\n          However, in the actual output, we must write the JSON as a string that contains the escape sequences.\n\n          We output the JSON as a string with the following content:\n\n            \"{\\\"program1\\\": \\\"p.append(p[-1] + w)\\\", \\\"program2\\\": \\\"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\\\"}\"\n\n          This is getting complicated.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a raw string for program2 in the JSON, but JSON doesn't have raw strings.\n\n          We decide to output the JSON with the program2 string containing the three lines as a string with embedded newlines, and we hope the evaluator can handle it.\n\n          Or, we output in a compact one-line JSON by escaping the newlines as \\n.\n\n          We'll do the latter.\n\n          For program2, the string is:\n\n            Line1: (empty)\n            Line2: 8 spaces: if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            Line3: 12 spaces: b=1\n            Line4: 12 spaces: break\n\n          We represent it as:\n\n            \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n\n          and in JSON, we write this as a string with embedded \\n.\n\n          Therefore, the JSON is:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n              \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n          But when we write this as a string, the newlines will be there.\n\n          To make it a valid JSON string, we should have the entire JSON in one line and use \\n in the string.\n\n          We can write the JSON in one line by escaping the newline in the string as \\n.\n\n          So the program2 string becomes:\n\n            \"\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\n            b=1\\\\n            break\"\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          I see: we must double-escape.\n\n          The final JSON string for the whole answer should be:\n\n            \"{\\\"program1\\\": \\\"p.append(p[-1] + w)\\\", \\\"program2\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\\\\\\\n            b=1\\\\\\\\n            break\\\"}\"\n\n          This is not readable.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem is for a contest, we output the JSON as:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\", \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"}\n\n          and hope that the evaluator can handle the newlines in the string.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then we output a JSON. We output the JSON in a pretty way or compact? \n\n          We output in compact.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\", \"program2\": \"\\n        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\\n            break\"}\n\n          This is a valid JSON if the newlines are allowed.\n\n          But in JSON, newlines in string values are allowed.\n\n          Therefore, we output that."
