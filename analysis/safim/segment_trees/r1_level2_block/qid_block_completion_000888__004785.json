So the grid:\n\n            row0: [1, 1, 0, ...]   # aa and ab\n            row2: [0, 1, 1, ...]   # cb and cc\n            row3: [0, 1, 0, ...]   # db\n\n          Now, column0: \n            row0:1, row2:0, row3:0 -> total s=1, sq=1 -> (1-1)=0\n          column1:\n            row0:1, row2:1, row3:1 -> s=3, sq=1+1+1=3 -> (9-3)//2 = 6//2=3\n          column2: row0:0, row2:1, row3:0 -> s=1, sq=1 -> 0\n\n          Then rows:\n            row0: s=2 (aa and ab), sq=1+1=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            row2: s=2 (cb and cc), sq=1+1=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            row3: s=1 -> 0\n\n          Total = 3 (from columns) + 2 (from rows) = 5.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current approach is O(n^2) which is too slow because n can be up to 10^5 and the total n over test cases is 10^5, but note: the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". So we can do an O(n) per test case? But note: the total n is 10^5, so we can do a single pass per test case.\n\n However, the current code is O(n^2) and the total n is 10^5, but the worst-case test case might have 10^5 strings, and then the inner loop would be 10^5 * (10^5) = 10^10 which is too slow.\n\n We need a more efficient solution.\n\n Idea:\n We are counting pairs (i, j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n There are two cases:\n   Case 1: The first character is different and the second is the same.\n   Case 2: The second character is different and the first is the same.\n\n We cannot count pairs that differ in both? because then they would differ in two positions.\n\n So we can group the strings by their first character and by their second character.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary for the entire string? But note: we are only allowed one difference.\n\n We can do:\n   Let f(c1, c2) be the frequency of the string c1c2.\n\n Then, for a fixed string \"ab\", we want to count:\n   - All strings that have first character not 'a' and second character 'b'. \n   - All strings that have first character 'a' and second character not 'b'.\n\n But note: if we do this naively, we might count the same pair multiple times? Actually, we are iterating and for each string we add the counts from the groups that differ in one position.\n\n However, the total n is 10^5, but the alphabet is from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters). So we can have at most 11*11 = 121 distinct strings.\n\n We can precompute a 2D array for the 11 letters? Actually, the letters are from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters.\n\n Steps for program1.py:\n   For each test case:\n      n = int(input())\n      We'll create a 2D array (or a dictionary) to count the frequency of each string? Actually, we can use a 11x11 matrix.\n\n      Let grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]   # 11 letters: index from 0 to 10, mapping: 'a'->0, 'b'->1, ... 'k'->10.\n\n      Then, for each string s:\n          c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1]\n          i = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n          j = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n          grid[i][j] += 1\n\n      Now, how to count the pairs?\n        We want to count for each cell (i, j) (which represents a string) the pairs that are in:\n          - Same row: same first character? Actually, same row means same i? But note: in our grid, rows are first character and columns are second character.\n\n        Actually, for a string at (i, j):\n          Case 1: same second character (j) but different first character (any row k != i). Then we add the total count in column j for all rows except row i.\n          Case 2: same first character (i) but different second character (any column k != j). Then we add the total count in row i for all columns except column j.\n\n        But note: each pair (i, j) and (k, l) will be considered twice? \n          When we are at (i, j) we count (i, j) and (k, l) for k != i and same j? and then when we are at (k, l) we count (k, l) and (i, j) again? \n\n        Actually, we are iterating over every string and adding the counts of the other strings that form a pair. But note: the pair (A, B) is counted once when we are at A and once when we are at B? \n\n        However, we are only counting the pairs in one direction? Because when we are at A, we count all B that are after A? But in our grid we are not storing the order. We are storing frequencies.\n\n        We must avoid double counting? Actually, the problem requires pairs (i, j) with i<j. But if we count for each string the number of strings that form a pair with it (regardless of order) then we count each pair twice: once for the first element and once for the second. But note: the pair (A, B) is counted when we process A and when we process B? \n\n        However, we are going to traverse each cell and for each occurrence of the string in that cell, we add the counts from the other groups. But if we do:\n\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(11):\n            for j in range(11):\n              # Case 1: same column j, different row: all the strings in the same column j but not in row i.\n              count1 = col_sum[j] - grid[i][j]   # col_sum[j] = total in column j\n              # Case 2: same row i, different column: all the strings in the same row i but not in column j.\n              count2 = row_sum[i] - grid[i][j]\n\n              # Then for each occurrence of (i,j) we add (count1 + count2) * (number of occurrences at (i,j))? \n              # But wait: if we do that, then for each string at (i,j) we are adding (count1+count2) and then we are multiplying by the frequency? Actually, we can do:\n\n              total += grid[i][j] * (count1 + count2)\n\n          However, note: each pair is counted twice? Because the pair (A, B) is counted when we are at A and when we are at B? \n\n          Example: A at (i1, j1) and B at (i2, j2). \n            If they differ in the first character and same second: then j1=j2=j, and i1 != i2.\n            When we are at A: we count B (because B is in column j and row i2 != i1) -> count1 for A includes B.\n            When we are at B: we count A (because A is in column j and row i1 != i2) -> count1 for B includes A.\n\n          So the pair (A, B) is counted twice: once in A and once in B.\n\n          But we only want to count each pair once.\n\n        Therefore, we must divide by 2? But note: the problem says i<j. We are not storing the order. Alternatively, we can avoid double counting by not multiplying by the frequency at the time of adding? \n\n        Alternatively, we can count without double counting by considering the entire grid:\n\n          For the entire grid, the total pairs that have same second character and different first character: \n            For a fixed column j, we have counts: c0, c1, ... c10 (for each row). Then the number of pairs in this column that have different first character is: \n                total_pairs_in_col_j = sum_{i} [ c_i * (total_col_j - c_i) ] \n            But note: this counts each pair twice? Because (A, B) and (B, A) are the same? Actually, we are counting unordered pairs? But the formula: for each i, we add c_i * (sum_{k != i} c_k) = c_i * (total_col_j - c_i). Then the entire column j: \n                = (1/2) * [ (sum_i c_i)^2 - sum_i c_i^2 ] \n            But wait: the formula for the sum over i of [c_i * (total_col_j - c_i)] = total_col_j * (sum_i c_i) - sum_i c_i^2 = total_col_j^2 - sum_i c_i^2, and then we note that this counts each pair twice? Actually, yes: because the pair (A, B) is counted when i is the row of A and when i is the row of B? \n\n            Actually, no: for a fixed column j, the pairs are between two different rows. The formula: \n                total = 0\n                for i: for each row i, we add c_i * (total_col_j - c_i) \n                This counts each pair (A in row i, B in row k) exactly once? Actually, no: it counts the pair (A, B) when i is the row of A (then we add 1 for B) and when i is the row of B (then we add 1 for A). So it counts each pair twice.\n\n            Therefore, the total for the column j is (total_col_j^2 - sum_i c_i^2) / 2? But wait, we don't want to divide by 2 because we are going to do the same for rows? Actually, we are going to do two separate counts: one for columns and one for rows.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_pairs = 0\n            # For same second character (column j): \n            for j in range(11):\n                total_col = 0\n                arr = []\n                for i in range(11):\n                    total_col += grid[i][j]\n                    arr.append(grid[i][j])\n                # Now, the number of pairs in this column that have different first characters? Actually, we want pairs that are in the same column (so same second character) and different first character. The total pairs in the column is the number of unordered pairs? But note: the problem counts every unordered pair (i<j) of strings that are in the same column? Actually, any two distinct strings in the same column? \n                # However, the formula: for a fixed column, the number of pairs of strings that are in the same column is C(total_col, 2) but that counts pairs that are in the same row? Actually, no: we are grouping by row? \n\n                Actually, we don't want pairs that are in the same row? Because if they are in the same row and same column, they are the same string? But note: we have multiple occurrences? \n\n                Actually, we want to count pairs that are in the same column (so same second character) and different first character. So we want to count all pairs of strings in the same column that are in different rows. \n\n                The total pairs in the column is: \n                    total_pairs_col = 0\n                    for i in range(11):\n                        for k in range(i+1, 11): \n                            total_pairs_col += grid[i][j] * grid[k][j]   # but this is O(11^2) which is acceptable.\n\n                But we can do: \n                    total_pairs_col = 0\n                    s = total_col\n                    # We can also do: total_pairs_col = (s*(s-1))//2 - sum_i ( grid[i][j]*(grid[i][j]-1)//2 )? \n                    # Actually, the total pairs in the column is C(s,2). Then subtract the pairs that are in the same row? \n                    # The pairs that are in the same row: for row i, we have C(grid[i][j],2) pairs that are in the same row and same column? But we don't want those because they are the same in both characters? Actually, no: if two strings are identical (same row and same column) then they are the same in both characters? But the condition: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position. For two identical strings, they don't differ at all? So we don't want to count them? \n\n                Actually, the problem: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position. For two strings in the same column and same row: they are identical -> not counted. For two strings in the same column and different rows: they differ in the first character and same in the second -> that's one difference -> valid.\n\n                So for a fixed column j, every pair of strings that are in different rows is valid? \n\n                Therefore, the count for column j is: \n                    total_pairs_col = 0\n                    for i in range(11):\n                        for k in range(i+1, 11):\n                            total_pairs_col += grid[i][j] * grid[k][j]\n\n                But note: we don't require the pairs to be adjacent? We just require different rows. And this counts each unordered pair once? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n                    total_pairs_col = (s * s - sum_i (grid[i][j]*grid[i][j])) // 2\n                    because: \n                        s^2 = (sum_i grid[i][j])^2 = sum_i grid[i][j]^2 + 2 * sum_{i<k} grid[i][j]*grid[k][j]\n                    so: sum_{i<k} grid[i][j]*grid[k][j] = (s^2 - sum_i grid[i][j]^2) // 2\n\n            Similarly, for the same first character (row i): \n                total_row = 0\n                for j in range(11):\n                    total_row += grid[i][j]\n                total_pairs_row = (total_row^2 - sum_j (grid[i][j]^2)) // 2\n\n            Then total pairs = total_pairs_col (for all j) + total_pairs_row (for all i)\n\n        However, note: we are counting the same pair in two different ways? Actually, no: \n          - The column part counts pairs that have the same second character and different first character.\n          - The row part counts pairs that have the same first character and different second character.\n\n        And these are disjoint: a pair cannot be both? because if they have the same first character and same second character then they are identical? and if they have same first and same second? then they are the same string? \n\n        Actually, if two strings are in the same row and same column? then they are identical? and we don't count them in either? \n\n        But what if two strings are in the same row and same column? then they are identical? and we don't count them? \n\n        Also, if two strings are in the same row and different columns? then we count them in the row part? \n        If two strings are in the same column and different rows? then we count them in the column part? \n\n        And if two strings are in different rows and different columns? then they differ in both? and we don't count them? \n\n        So the total pairs we count is the sum of the two cases.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          total_pairs = 0\n          # For each column j:\n          for j in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total_pairs += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n          # For each row i:\n          for i in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total_pairs += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are iterating 11*11*2 = 242 per test case? which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must use integer arithmetic: and note that s*s can be up to (10^5)^2? but the total n per test case is at most 10^5? and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5? so the worst-case test case might have 10^5? but then s for a column could be 10^5? and s*s is 10^10 which is acceptable in Python? (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the arithmetic is O(1) for small numbers? but 10^10 is 10 billion, which is 10^10, which is acceptable in a loop that runs 11*2=22 times per test case? and the total test cases t<=100? but the total n is 10^5? so the worst-case t could be 100, but the total n is 10^5, so the worst-case test case might have n=1000? but actually the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so worst-case one test case with n=10^5? and then we do 22 * 11 = 242 iterations? and each iteration we do 11 steps? so 242*11 = 2662 per test case? and then 2662 * 100 = 266200? which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the grid for a test case is 11x11, so we can precompute the row sums and column sums? Actually, we can precompute:\n\n          col_sums = [0]*11   # for each column j, the total count in that column\n          row_sums = [0]*11   # for each row i, the total count in that row\n\n          But we also need the sum of squares per column and per row? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire grid? But we have to read the strings.\n\n        Steps for program1.py:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n              for i in range(n):\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                  idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                  idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                  grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n\n              total_pairs = 0\n\n              # For each column j (fixed second character)\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total_pairs += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              # For each row i (fixed first character)\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total_pairs += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              print(total_pairs)\n\n        But note: the problem says the answer may be large and we should use 64-bit integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but we are doing integer arithmetic.\n\n        However, the original code had a variable 'co' and printed it. We are replacing the inner loops with this grid method.\n\n        But the original code had a TODO in the elif branch for identical strings? Actually, the original code had:\n\n          elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        What did they do? They didn't do anything? So they didn't count identical strings? Actually, identical strings: they don't form a pair that differs in exactly one position? So we don't count them? \n\n        Our method: we are not counting pairs of identical strings because in the column part: for a fixed column j, if two strings are in the same row and same column (so identical) then we subtract the square? and then we do (s^2 - sq) which removes the pairs that are in the same row? Actually, no: the formula for the column part: \n            total_pairs_col = (s^2 - sq) // 2\n            where s = total in the column, and sq = sum_i (grid[i][j]^2)\n\n            This counts the pairs that are in the same column and different rows? and excludes the pairs that are in the same row? because the pairs that are in the same row are not included? Actually, the pairs that are in the same row are not counted? because we are only counting pairs that are in different rows? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, note: the original code had a set 'x' and a variable 'mul' that we don't use? and the original code was O(n^2). We are replacing the entire inner part.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n          for ii in range(int(input())):\n              n = int(input())\n              # We'll create a grid of 11x11\n              grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n              for i in range(n):\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                  idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                  idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                  grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n\n              total = 0\n              # For each column j\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                  # Now compute the sum of squares for this column\n                  sq = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              # For each row i\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              print(total)\n\n        We can optimize by computing the squares in the same loop? But the inner loops are only 11, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are doing 11*11*2 = 242 per test case? and the number of test cases t can be up to 100? but the total n is 10^5, so the worst-case t is 100? and 100*242 = 24200, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can precompute the row and column sums without the inner loops? Actually, we can precompute:\n\n          col_sum = [0]*11\n          row_sum = [0]*11\n          # and also col_sq = [0]*11? but we need the entire grid to compute the squares? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the inner loops for the squares? \n\n          For a fixed column j: \n            we have the counts: grid[0][j], grid[1][j], ... grid[10][j]\n            we can compute s = sum(grid[i][j] for i in range(11)) and sq = sum(grid[i][j]**2 for i in range(11))\n\n        We are already doing that.\n\n        So we'll write the code as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters. So we use 11.\n\n        Let's test with the first example: \n          n=6, strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ze\"]? Actually, the example: \n          For the first test case: pairs: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"): same second char 'b', different first char -> counted in column 'b'\n            (\"ab\", \"db\"): same second char 'b', different first char -> column 'b'\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\"): same first char 'a', different second char -> row 'a'\n            (\"cb\", \"db\"): same second char 'b', different first char -> column 'b'\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\"): same first char 'c', different second char -> row 'c'\n\n          How many pairs? 5.\n\n          Let's build the grid:\n\n            a: [0: 'a', 1: 'b', ...]\n            We have:\n                \"ab\": (0,1) -> grid[0][1] = 1\n                \"cb\": (2,1) -> grid[2][1] = 1\n                \"db\": (3,1) -> grid[3][1] = 1\n                \"aa\": (0,0) -> grid[0][0] = 1\n                \"cc\": (2,2) -> grid[2][2] = 1\n                \"ze\": (25-? but wait, our grid is only 11x11? the letters are from 'a' to 'k'. The example has 'z'? \n\n          The problem says: \"consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\". So 'z' is not in the range? \n\n          The example: the first test case: \n            The strings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ze\" -> but 'z' is not in 'a' to 'k'. \n\n          Actually, the example in the note: \n            For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n          So the strings: \n            \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", and what is the sixth? The note says 5 pairs, so 6 strings? \n            The sixth string is not mentioned? \n\n          The example: \n            Input: \n                3\n                6\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                ef   # but the example note says 5 pairs? and the sixth string is \"ef\" (or something) that doesn't form a pair? \n\n          Actually, the example note says: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> 5 pairs.\n\n          So the strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, and then what? The note doesn't mention the sixth string? \n\n          The example input: \n            The first test case: n=6? but the note says 5 pairs? \n\n          How do we get 5?\n\n          Let's build the grid for the first test case:\n\n            ab: (0,1)\n            cb: (2,1)\n            db: (3,1)\n            aa: (0,0)\n            cc: (2,2)\n            and the sixth string? The note doesn't list a sixth string? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"For the first test case\" and then lists 5 pairs? and the input says n=6? \n\n          The example input: \n            t=3\n            first test case: n=6, then 6 strings.\n\n          The sixth string? The note says: \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (cb, cc)\" -> so the sixth string must be \"cc\"? but we have \"cc\" already? \n\n          Actually, the example: \n            The strings: \n                ab, cb, db, aa, cc, and then one more? \n\n          The note says: (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> so we have two strings: \"cb\" and \"cc\". \n\n          So the grid:\n\n            row0: [1, 1, 0, ...]   # aa and ab\n            row2: [0, 1, 1, ...]   # cb and cc\n            row3: [0, 1, 0, ...]   # db\n\n          Now, column0: \n            row0:1, row2:0, row3:0 -> total s=1, sq=1 -> (1-1)=0\n          column1:\n            row0:1, row2:1, row3:1 -> s=3, sq=1+1+1=3 -> (9-3)//2 = 6//2=3\n          column2:\n            row0:0, row2:1, row3:0 -> s=1, sq=1 -> 0\n\n          Then rows:\n            row0: s=2 (aa and ab), sq=1+1=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            row2: s=2 (cb and cc), sq=1+1=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            row3: s=1 -> 0\n\n          Total = 3 (from columns) + 2 (from rows) = 5.\n\n          So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we write program1.py as:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n              for i in range(n):\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  # Only consider the first two characters? but the string is length 2.\n                  c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                  idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                  idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                  # If the letter is beyond 'k', then we skip? but the problem says from 'a' to 'k'\n                  if 0 <= idx1 < 11 and 0 <= idx2 < 11:\n                      grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n                  else:\n                      # The problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we assume they are in range.\n                      pass\n\n              total = 0\n              # For each column j\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              # For each row i\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n\n              print(total)\n\n        But note: the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we don't need the if? \n\n        We'll assume the input is correct.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n          We are to count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n.\n\n          We are generating a list of palindromic numbers up to 40000? because n<=40000.\n\n          Then we are doing a dynamic programming: \n\n            a[0] = 1\n            for each palindromic number i in p:\n                for j from i to m (which is 40001):\n                    a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % mod\n\n          This is the standard coin change (unbounded knapsack) for counting the number of ways.\n\n          The note: \"Two ways are considered different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in them.\" -> so it's a multiset, and we are counting multisets? and the standard coin change (unbounded) counts the distinct multisets? \n\n          Example: for n=5, we have 7 ways? and the code:\n\n            p = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,22,..., 5] -> we generate all palindromic numbers from 1 to 40000.\n\n          Then we do:\n\n            a = [0]*(m+1)\n            a[0] = 1\n            for i in p:\n                for j in range(i, m+1):\n                    a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % mod\n\n          Then for each test case, we output a[n].\n\n          But note: the problem says the answer modulo 10^9+7.\n\n          The current code:\n\n            R=range\n            m=40001\n            d=10**9+7\n            p=[]\n            for i in R(1,m):\n                n=str(i)\n                if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n            a=[1]+[0]*m   # m is 40001, so a has indices 0..40001? but we defined m=40001, so a has 40002 elements? \n            for i in p:\n                for j in R(i,m):   # j from i to m-1? because R(i,m) goes from i to m-1. But we need j up to 40000? \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to do:\n\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n          But note: the array a is defined for indices 0..40000? and j goes from i to 40000? because m=40001 and R(i,40001) goes from i to 40000? \n\n          So we do:\n\n            for i in p:\n                for j in range(i, m):   # m=40001, so j from i to 40000\n                    a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n          Then for each test case, we output a[n] for the given n.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total test cases t up to 10000? and we are precomputing the dp array for n from 0 to 40000. Then we can answer each test case in O(1).\n\n          The inner loop: the total number of palindromic numbers? How many are there? \n            For numbers up to 40000: \n                one-digit: 9 (1..9)\n                two-digit: 9 (11,22,...,99)\n                three-digit: 90 (101,111,...,191,202,...,999? but 40000 is 4 digits) \n                four-digit: \n                    from 1001 to 9999: 90? (because the first and last must be the same, and the second and third must be the same? actually, no: any palindrome: abba -> a from 1 to 9, b from 0 to 9 -> 9*10=90)\n                and also 40000 is not a palindrome? \n            So total palindromic numbers: 9+9+90+90 = 198? \n\n          Then the inner loop: for each palindromic number i, we iterate from i to 40000: about 40000 steps? and 198 * 40000 = 7.92e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n          But note: the constraints say t up to 10000, but we are precomputing once.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            for i in p:\n                for j in range(i, m):\n                    a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n          Then:\n\n            for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n                print(a[int(n)])\n\n          However, note: the array a is defined for indices 0..40000? and the input n is between 1 and 40000? so we are safe.\n\n        But the example: n=5 -> a[5] should be 7.\n\n        Let's simulate for n=5 with the coins: [1,2,3,4,5] (all palindromic? yes)\n\n          a[0]=1\n          i=1: \n            j from 1 to 5: \n                a[1] += a[0] -> a[1]=1\n                a[2] += a[1] -> a[2]=1\n                a[3] += a[2] -> a[3]=1\n                a[4] += a[3] -> a[4]=1\n                a[5] += a[4] -> a[5]=1\n          i=2:\n            j from 2 to 5:\n                a[2] += a[0] -> a[2]=1+1=2\n                a[3] += a[1] -> a[3]=1+1=2\n                a[4] += a[2] -> a[4]=1+2=3\n                a[5] += a[3] -> a[5]=1+2=3\n          i=3:\n            j from 3 to 5:\n                a[3] += a[0] -> a[3]=2+1=3\n                a[4] += a[1] -> a[4]=3+1=4\n                a[5] += a[2] -> a[5]=3+2=5\n          i=4:\n            j from 4 to 5:\n                a[4] += a[0] -> a[4]=4+1=5\n                a[5] += a[1] -> a[5]=5+1=6\n          i=5:\n            j=5:\n                a[5] += a[0] -> a[5]=6+1=7\n\n          So a[5]=7 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        But note: the modulus is d=10**9+7.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"print it modulo 10^9+7\".\n\n        So we write:\n\n          for i in p:\n              for j in range(i, m):\n                  a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        But note: the variable m is 40001, and we defined a with m=40001? and the array a has indices 0..40000? and j goes from i to 40000? because range(i, m) goes from i to m-1=40000.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        Now, we output the missing code for both programs in the required JSON format.\n\n        For program1.py: we are replacing the entire inner part? The original code had:\n\n          for jj in range(n):\n              m=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      ... \n          print(co)\n\n        We are replacing that with the grid method.\n\n        So the entire code for program1.py becomes:\n\n          for ii in range(int(input())):\n              n = int(input())\n              grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n              for jj in range(n):\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                  idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                  idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                  grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n              total = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n              print(total)\n\n        But note: the original code had a variable 'a' that was a list of strings? and we are using a grid? and we are not using the set 'x' and the variable 'co'? \n\n        We are replacing the entire block from the reading of the strings to the print.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the creation of the grid to the print(total). But note: the original code had:\n\n          a = []\n          ... and then a.append(input())\n\n        We are replacing that with:\n\n          grid = ... and then for jj in range(n): read and update grid.\n\n        And then the double loops for rows and columns.\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n          grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n          for jj in range(n):\n              s = input().strip()\n              c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n              idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n              idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n              grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n          total = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          for i in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          print(total)\n\n        But note: the original code had a variable 'co' that was printed? We are printing 'total'. And we are not using the set 'x'. So we remove the old code.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n          a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        But note: the original code had:\n\n          for i in p:\n              for j in R(i,m):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we only need to fill the inner line.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n          a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the variable name is 'd' for modulus? and the array is 'a'? and the indices are j and j-i.\n\n        Now, output in JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor jj in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\\n    idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\\n    grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\\ntotal = 0\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nprint(total)\",\n            \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the original program1.py had a for-loop for the test cases, and we are only replacing the inner part of the test case? The original code had:\n\n          for ii in range(int(input())): \n              n = int(input())\n              a = []\n              co = 0\n              x = set()\n              for jj in range(n):\n                  a.append(input())\n              ... (the old O(n^2) loops) ...\n\n        We are replacing from the line \"a=[]\" to the \"print(co)\"? \n\n        Actually, we are replacing the entire block from the reading of n to the print. We are not using the list 'a' as the list of strings? we are using a grid. And we are not using the set 'x'. \n\n        So we remove:\n\n          a = []\n          co = 0\n          x = set()\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          ... the old loops ...\n\n        And replace with the grid and the new computation.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the entire block that we wrote.\n\n        However, note: the original code had a variable 'ii' for the test case? we are not using it? but that's okay.\n\n        We output the code as a string in JSON. We must escape the quotes? but the code doesn't have quotes? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write the string without quotes? \n\n        But the problem says: Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        And we are replacing the entire inner block of the test case.\n\n        So the entire program1.py after completion would be:\n\n          for ii in range(int(input())):\n              n = int(input())\n              grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n              for jj in range(n):\n                  s = input().strip()\n                  c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                  idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                  idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                  grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n              total = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for i in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s = 0\n                  sq = 0\n                  for j in range(11):\n                      s += grid[i][j]\n                      sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n                  total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n              print(total)\n\n        But wait, the original code had a variable 'co' that was printed? We are printing 'total'. And we are not using the old variables. So we are safe.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the entire code after completion would be:\n\n          R=range\n          m=40001\n          d=10**9+7\n          p=[]\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n          a=[1]+[0]*m\n          for i in p:\n              for j in R(i,m):\n                  a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n          for n in [*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\n        But note: the original code had a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", and we are replacing that with the line.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: the string of the code from \"grid = ...\" to \"print(total)\" (including the grid creation, reading, and the two double loops for rows and columns)\n\n          program2: the string \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the part that was missing? \n\n        For program1.py, the original code had:\n\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          for jj in range(n):\n              ... (a loop that we are replacing entirely) ...\n\n        We are replacing the entire inner loop (which was O(n^2)) and the reading part? Actually, the reading part we are changing: we are not storing in a list 'a', but in a grid. \n\n        The TODO was in the inner loop? but we are replacing the entire inner loop? \n\n        So the missing part for program1.py is the entire block that we wrote? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the original code had:\n\n          a = []\n          ... and then a.append(input()) for each string.\n\n        We are replacing that with a grid and a different reading method.\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is the entire block that we wrote.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the missing part is the single line.\n\n        We output the JSON.\n\n        Important: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that was missing (the part that was not provided) and that we wrote.\n\n        For program1.py, the provided code had:\n\n          for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n              n=int(input())\r\n              a=[]\r\n              co=0\r\n              x=set()\r\n              for jj in range(n):\r\n                  a.append(input())\r\n              for jj in range(n):\r\n                  mul=1\r\n                  if jj not in x:\r\n                      for kk in range(jj+1,n):\r\n                          if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\r\n                              co+=mul\r\n                          elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\r\n                              co+=mul\r\n                          elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\r\n                              # TODO: Your code here\r\n              print(co)\n\n        We are replacing from the line \"a=[]\" to the \"print(co)\"? \n\n        Actually, we are replacing the entire block from the reading of n to the print(co). We are not using the list 'a' as the list of strings? we are using a grid. And we are not using the set 'x'. \n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n          for jj in range(n):\n              s = input().strip()\n              c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n              idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n              idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n              grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n          total = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          for i in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          print(total)\n\n        But note: we are printing 'total', not 'co'. And we are not using the variable 'co'. So we remove the old variables.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above string for program1.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing line is the one we wrote.\n\n        Now, we write the JSON.\n\n        Note: We must escape newlines and quotes? But the problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And we are outputting a JSON string.\n\n        We can use a raw string? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write the code as a string with newlines.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor jj in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\\n    idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\\n    if 0 <= idx1 < 11 and 0 <= idx2 < 11:\\n        grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\\n    else:\\n        # According to the problem, this should not happen, but just in case\\n        pass\\ntotal = 0\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nprint(total)\",\n            \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we don't need the if? We can remove the if for efficiency? \n\n        However, to be safe, we can include the if? or remove it? \n\n        Since the problem guarantees the letters, we can remove the if. \n\n        So we write:\n\n          grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\n          for jj in range(n):\n              s = input().strip()\n              c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n              idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n              idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n              grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\n          total = 0\n          for j in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for i in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          for i in range(11):\n              s = 0\n              sq = 0\n              for j in range(11):\n                  s += grid[i][j]\n                  sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\n              total += (s*s - sq) // 2\n          print(total)\n\n        We remove the if.\n\n        Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"grid = [[0]*11 for _ in range(11)]\\nfor jj in range(n):\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    idx1 = ord(c1) - ord('a')\\n    idx2 = ord(c2) - ord('a')\\n    grid[idx1][idx2] += 1\\ntotal = 0\\nfor j in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for i in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nfor i in range(11):\\n    s = 0\\n    sq = 0\\n    for j in range(11):\\n        s += grid[i][j]\\n        sq += grid[i][j] * grid[i][j]\\n    total += (s*s - sq) // 2\\nprint(total)\",\n            \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n          }\n\n        We output this."
