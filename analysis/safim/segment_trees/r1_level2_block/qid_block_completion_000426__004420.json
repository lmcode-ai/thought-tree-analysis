Now, we can express the entire array:\n\n          a1 = x1 - y1. But what is y1?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about determining if we can obtain a given array `a` by performing operations that:\n   - Start with an array of zeros and a pointer at the first element.\n   - Operations: \n        1. If not on last, increase current by 1 and move to next.\n        2. If not on first, decrease current by 1 and move to previous.\n   - After all operations, the pointer must be at the first element.\n\n The provided code for program1.py is:\n\n    for _ in [0]*int(input()):\n        input()\n        n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n        s,f,m = 0,0,0\n        for i in n:\n            s+=i\n            if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n            if s==0:f=1\n            if f and s>0:m=1;break\n        print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2])\n\n We note that the output uses a trick: \n   \"YNEOS\"[(condition)::2] \n   If condition is True, then it selects the substring starting at index 1 with step 2 -> \"No\"\n   If condition is False, then it selects starting at index 0 with step 2 -> \"Yes\"\n\n The condition is (m or not f). So we want:\n   If (m is 1) OR (f is 0) then output \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\n What do the variables represent?\n   s: cumulative sum from left to right.\n   f: a flag that becomes 1 once we have encountered a point where the cumulative sum becomes 0 (and remains 1 for the rest?).\n   m: a flag that becomes 1 if after having set f=1 (i.e., after having seen a cumulative sum 0) we then get a positive cumulative sum.\n\n However, note the problem constraints and the operations:\n\n Important observations for the problem:\n   - The operations require that we start at the first element and end at the first element.\n   - The entire process can be thought of as a sequence of moves. The net effect on the array must satisfy:\n        a1 = (number of times we start at the first and move right) - (number of times we come from the second to the first)\n        Similarly, for the last element, we can only leave by moving left? Actually, we can only move right from the first and left from the last? \n\n But note the operations:\n   Operation 1: (when not last) -> current += 1, then move to next.\n   Operation 2: (when not first) -> current -= 1, then move to previous.\n\n We can model the entire process as:\n   Let x_i be the number of times we move from i to i+1 (right move at i).\n   Let y_i be the number of times we move from i to i-1 (left move at i).\n\n Conditions:\n   - The pointer starts at 1 and ends at 1.\n   - The net movement: \n        For the first element: \n          We start at 1 and we end at 1. \n          The moves: \n            We leave the first element to the second (x_1 times) and we come back from the second to the first (y_2 times? but note: the move from second to first is a left move at the second element, which is y_2). \n          However, note that the first element is never visited from the left? Actually, we can only leave the first to the right and come to the first from the right (from the second).\n\n   The net effect on the first element:\n        a1 = x_1 - y_2   (because each right move from 1 adds 1, and each time we come from 2 (which is a left move at 2) we subtract 1 at 2, but then we move to 1 and that move doesn't change 1? Actually, the operation at 2: when we do a left move at 2, we subtract 1 at 2 and then move to 1. So the value at 1 is only affected by the right moves from 1 and the left moves that start at 2 and end at 1? But note: the left move at 2 subtracts 1 at 2 and then moves to 1. It does not change the value at 1.\n\n   Actually, the value at position i is:\n        a_i = (number of right moves that start at i) - (number of left moves that start at i) \n             = x_i - y_i.\n\n   But also, the movement must be consistent: \n        For the first element: \n          The net number of times we leave the first element: x_1 (to the right) \n          The net number of times we enter the first element: y_2 (from the second element) \n          And we start at 1 and end at 1: \n             (starts) + (entries) = (leaves) + (ends)\n             => 1 + y_2 = x_1 + 1   => y_2 = x_1.\n\n        Similarly, for the last element (if n>1):\n          We never leave to the right? because we can't move right from the last? \n          So x_n = 0.\n          And we can only come from the left? \n          So: \n             (starts at last? no) so we start at 1, so the last element: \n             entries: x_{n-1} (right moves from n-1 to n) \n             leaves: y_n (left moves from n to n-1) \n          And we end at 1, so at the last element we must have:\n             entries = leaves? \n             But note: we are not required to end at the last? we end at the first.\n\n        Actually, the entire path is a walk that starts at 1 and ends at 1. The conservation at each node i (for i from 1 to n) is:\n          (number of times we enter i) = (number of times we leave i) \n          For i=1: \n             entries: only from the start? and from the right (if we come from 2) -> y_2\n             leaves: only to the right (x_1) and at the end we are at 1? \n          But note: we start at 1 and end at 1. So the net flow at 1:\n             in = y_2 + 1 (the start) \n             out = x_1 + 1 (the end) -> but wait, the end is not leaving? \n          Actually, we can model the entire path as:\n             We start at 1: that's an entry without a previous move? \n             We end at 1: that's an exit without a next move? \n\n          So for node 1:\n             in: 1 (start) + y_2 (from node 2)\n             out: x_1 (to node 2) + 1 (end) \n          Therefore: 1 + y_2 = x_1 + 1  => y_2 = x_1.\n\n          For node i (2<=i<=n-1):\n             in: x_{i-1} (from left) + y_{i+1} (from right)\n             out: x_i (to right) + y_i (to left)\n          => x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i.\n\n          For node n:\n             in: x_{n-1} (from left)\n             out: y_n (to left) \n          => x_{n-1} = y_n.\n\n        Now, the value at i: a_i = x_i - y_i.\n\n        We can express the entire system in terms of the x_i and y_i? \n\n        Alternatively, we can derive constraints on the array a:\n\n        From the flow equations and the value equations:\n\n          a1 = x1 - y1.\n          But from the flow at 1: y2 = x1.\n\n          For i=2:\n             a2 = x2 - y2 = x2 - x1.\n             and the flow: x1 + y3 = x2 + y2  => x1 + y3 = x2 + x1  => y3 = x2.\n\n          For i=3:\n             a3 = x3 - y3 = x3 - x2.\n             flow: x2 + y4 = x3 + y3  => x2 + y4 = x3 + x2  => y4 = x3.\n\n          We see a pattern: for i>=2, we have y_{i} = x_{i-1} and then a_i = x_i - x_{i-1}.\n\n          For i=n: \n             a_n = x_n - y_n = 0 - y_n = -y_n, and from flow at n: x_{n-1} = y_n, so a_n = -x_{n-1}.\n\n        Now, we can express the entire array:\n\n          a1 = x1 - y1.\n\n          But what is y1? Note: we cannot do a left move from the first element (because the pointer is at the first and we cannot move left). So y1 must be 0.\n\n          Therefore: a1 = x1.\n\n          Then:\n            a2 = x2 - x1\n            a3 = x3 - x2\n            ...\n            a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}\n            a_n = -x_{n-1}\n\n        We can write:\n\n          x1 = a1\n          x2 = a2 + x1 = a2 + a1\n          x3 = a3 + x2 = a3 + a2 + a1\n          ...\n          x_{n-1} = a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1}\n\n          and then a_n = - (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1])\n\n          Therefore, the total sum of the entire array is:\n            a1 + a2 + ... + a_n = (a1 + ... + a_{n-1}) + a_n = (a1+...+a_{n-1}) - (a1+...+a_{n-1}) = 0.\n\n        But note: we also have the condition that the cumulative sums must be nonnegative? \n\n        Why? Because the x_i (which are the number of right moves from i) must be nonnegative. And from the above:\n\n          x1 = a1 >= 0\n          x2 = a1+a2 >= 0\n          ...\n          x_{n-1} = a1+...+a_{n-1} >= 0\n\n        And the total sum a1+...+a_n = 0.\n\n        However, note the example in the note: \n          Second test case: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> \n            a1=2, a2=-1, a3=-1, a4=0 -> total sum=0.\n            cumulative: \n              s1 = 2 (>=0)\n              s2 = 2-1 = 1 (>=0)\n              s3 = 1-1 = 0 (>=0)\n              s4 = 0 (which is the total and must be 0).\n\n        But the provided example in the note: \n          The example: [0,0,0,0] -> \n            Then: \n              a1=0 -> x1=0\n              a2=0 -> x2=0\n              a3=0 -> x3=0\n              a4 = -x3 = 0 -> so a4=0 -> works.\n\n        However, the first test case in the problem? The note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so we must have the pointer at the first? Therefore, the first test case is not valid? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\".\n\n        So the constraints we have derived are:\n          1. The total sum must be 0.\n          2. The cumulative sums from left to right (until the last element) must be nonnegative? Actually, note that the cumulative sum for the entire array is 0, and for the first n-1 elements the cumulative sum must be nonnegative? \n\n        But note: the cumulative sum for the entire array is the last cumulative sum (s_n) = 0.\n\n        However, what about the cumulative sums at the last element? We don't require the cumulative sum at the last element to be nonnegative? Actually, the cumulative sum at the last element is 0 (by condition 1). And the condition for the last element is a_n = - (cumulative sum of the first n-1) -> which is the negative of the cumulative sum at n-1. But we require that the cumulative sum at n-1 (which is the same as the cumulative sum at n because a_n=0? no: s_n = s_{n-1} + a_n = s_{n-1} + (-s_{n-1}) = 0) is nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the last element is that the cumulative sum at n-1 must be nonnegative? because x_{n-1} = s_{n-1} = a1+...+a_{n-1} must be nonnegative? and then a_n = -s_{n-1} must be nonpositive? \n\n        However, the problem does not require the cumulative sums to be nonnegative at every step? \n\n        But note: the example [2, -1, -1, 0] has cumulative sums: [2, 1, 0, 0] -> nonnegative until the end.\n\n        What if we have a negative cumulative sum in the middle? \n          Example: [1, -2, 1] \n            total sum = 0.\n            cumulative: s1=1 (>=0), s2=1-2=-1 (<0) -> then we break.\n\n        Why is negative cumulative sum bad?\n          Because at step 2, we have x2 = a1+a2 = -1, which is negative -> impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the conditions are:\n          Condition 1: The total sum must be 0.\n          Condition 2: The cumulative sums from left to right must be nonnegative at every step.\n\n        However, note the example: \n          The note says: \n            One test case: \n              Input: \n                4\n                0 0 0 0\n              Output: Yes\n\n              Input: \n                4\n                2 -1 -1 0\n              Output: Yes\n\n          But what about: \n            [1, -1, 1, -1] -> \n              cumulative: [1,0,1,0] -> nonnegative? \n              total sum=0 -> so it should be \"Yes\"?\n\n          However, let's check the constraints for the last element:\n            a4 = - (a1+a2+a3) = - (1-1+1) = -1 -> but the given a4 is -1 -> matches.\n\n          But wait: the cumulative sum at the last element is 0? and the condition for the last element is a4 = - (a1+a2+a3) = -1 -> so the array must be [1, -1, 1, -1]? \n\n          However, the problem says: the array we are given is [1, -1, 1, -1]. \n\n          But note: the cumulative sum at the third element is 1 (nonnegative) and at the fourth is 0 (nonnegative). \n\n          However, the condition for the cumulative sums must be nonnegative at every step? including the last? but the last is 0 -> nonnegative.\n\n          But note: the condition for the cumulative sum at the last element is not used to compute an x_i? because the last element does not have a right move? \n\n          Actually, the condition for the cumulative sum at the last element is not needed for the x_i? because the x_i are defined only for i from 1 to n-1. \n\n          However, the cumulative sum at the last element is the total sum (0) and we require that the cumulative sums for i from 1 to n-1 are nonnegative? and the last cumulative sum (which is the total) is 0.\n\n          But note: the cumulative sum at the last element is the same as the cumulative sum at the last step? and we do require that the entire array has nonnegative cumulative sums? \n\n          However, the condition for the last element (n) is automatically 0? so nonnegative? \n\n          Therefore, we can say: \n            Condition 1: total sum = 0.\n            Condition 2: for every prefix i (from 1 to n-1) the cumulative sum is nonnegative? and the cumulative sum at n is 0 (which is already covered by condition1 and the nonnegativity of the prefix until n-1? because the last step adds a_n = - (prefix_{n-1}) and then the total becomes 0).\n\n          But note: the cumulative sum at the last element is 0, which is nonnegative? so we can require nonnegative for every prefix including the last? \n\n          However, the problem says: the pointer must end at the first element. And we have derived that the total sum must be 0 and the cumulative sums must be nonnegative at every step? \n\n          But wait: what if the cumulative sum becomes zero at some point and then becomes positive again? \n          Example: [1, -1, 1, -1] -> cumulative: [1,0,1,0] -> at step3: cumulative=1>0 -> then we have a positive after a zero? \n\n          The provided code has:\n            s,f,m = 0,0,0\n            for i in n:\n                s += i\n                if s<0: ... # we break? because negative is bad?\n                if s==0: f=1\n                if f and s>0: m=1; break\n\n          So the code breaks and sets m=1 if after having seen a zero (f=1) we then get a positive? \n\n          Why is that bad? \n\n          Consider: \n            The operations: we must end at the first element. The entire path is a walk that starts at 1 and ends at 1. \n\n          The condition we derived: \n            The cumulative sum at step i (prefix i) is the number of right moves that have been started and not canceled by left moves? \n\n          But note: the cumulative sum at step i (s_i) is the value of x_i? for i from 1 to n-1? \n\n          However, the entire array has n elements. The cumulative sum at the last element is 0. \n\n          The problem: if we have a positive cumulative sum after a zero? \n            Example: [0, 1, -1] -> \n              cumulative: [0, 1, 0] -> \n                step1: s1=0 -> set f=1.\n                step2: s2=1 -> then we have f=1 and s>0 -> set m=1 -> output \"No\".\n\n          Why is [0,1,-1] invalid? \n            Conditions: \n              Condition1: total=0 -> ok.\n              Condition2: nonnegative cumulative: [0,1,0] -> nonnegative? so why \"No\"?\n\n          Let's try to derive the array [0,1,-1]:\n            We require:\n              a1 = 0 -> x1=0.\n              a2 = 1 = x2 - x1 -> x2=1.\n              a3 = -1 = -x2 -> x2=1 -> so a3=-1 -> matches.\n\n            Now, the moves:\n              We start at 1: \n                We do a right move from 1: then a1 becomes 1? but we need 0. \n                Alternatively, we might do a left move? but we cannot at the first.\n\n            How to get a1=0?\n              We must not do any right move at 1? so x1=0.\n\n            Then how do we get to the second element? \n              We must do a left move from the second element to come to the first? but then we subtract 1 at the second? \n\n            How do we get a2=1?\n              a2 = x2 - y2 = 1 - y2 = 1 -> so y2=0.\n\n            Then we never do a left move at the second? \n\n            How do we get to the third? \n              We do a right move from the second? that increases the second by 1? but then we have a2=1? and then we move to the third? \n\n            Then at the third: we do a left move? because we need to get back to the first? \n              But we are at the third: we can do a left move: subtract 1 at the third and move to the second? \n              Then at the second: we can do a left move? but then we subtract 1 at the second? and then we have a2=1-1=0? which is not 1.\n\n            Alternatively, we do at the third: we do a left move? then a3 becomes -1? and then we move to the second? \n              Then at the second: we do a right move? then a2 becomes 1 (because we started with 0? then we do a right move: add 1 and move to the third? but then we are stuck? \n\n            Actually, we must end at the first. \n\n            Steps:\n              Start at 1: a1=0, we don't do any right move? so we are stuck at 1? but we need to get to the third? \n\n            How do we move? \n              We can only do a right move from 1? but that would make a1=1? not 0.\n\n          Therefore, [0,1,-1] is impossible.\n\n          Why? \n            The condition: we must have the cumulative sums nonnegative and the total 0, but also we cannot have a positive cumulative sum after a zero? \n\n          The reason: \n            The cumulative sum at step i is the net number of times we have passed from the first to the i-th without having returned? \n\n            If we have a positive cumulative sum after a zero, that means we have left the starting point again? but we already returned to the starting point (when the cumulative sum became zero) and then we left again? \n\n            However, the problem requires that at the end we are at the first. \n\n            The entire journey must be such that we never leave the starting point after having returned? \n\n          Actually, the condition is: \n            Once the cumulative sum becomes zero (meaning we have returned to the starting point and the entire journey so far is balanced) we cannot then leave the starting point again? because then we would have to return again? but the problem does not allow multiple returns? \n\n          But note: the entire sequence of operations must end at the first. So if we leave the starting point again after having returned, we must return again? but the cumulative sum must become zero again at the end? \n\n          However, the condition we have for the entire array is that the total sum is zero? so the cumulative sum at the end is zero? \n\n          But the problem is: the cumulative sum must be nonnegative and the total zero? and also we cannot have a positive cumulative sum after a zero? \n\n          Why? \n            Because the cumulative sum being zero at some point means we are back at the start? and then if we go to the right again (making the cumulative sum positive) we must eventually come back? but the problem does not forbid that? \n\n          Let me try with [0,1,-1,0]:\n            cumulative: [0,1,0,0] -> \n              step1: 0 -> f=1\n              step2: 1 -> then we break because f and s>0 -> m=1 -> output \"No\".\n\n          But is [0,1,-1,0] possible?\n            Conditions: \n              a1=0 -> x1=0.\n              a2=1 = x2 - y2 -> and from flow: y2 = x1=0 -> so x2=1.\n              a3=-1 = x3 - y3 -> and from flow: y3 = x2=1 -> so x3 - 1 = -1 -> x3=0.\n              a4=0 = -x3 -> 0=0 -> ok.\n\n            Now, the moves:\n              Start at 1: \n                We do nothing at 1? so a1=0, then we move? but we cannot move right without adding? \n\n            How do we get to the second? \n              We must do a right move from 1? but that would make a1=1? not 0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n            Step1: at 1, we do nothing? then how do we move? we are stuck? \n\n          Therefore, [0,1,-1,0] is impossible.\n\n          But what about [0,0,0]? \n            cumulative: [0,0,0] -> \n              step1: s=0 -> f=1\n              step2: s=0 -> no problem? \n              step3: s=0 -> no problem? \n            Then we don't set m? and f=1 -> condition: (m or not f) = (0 or 0) -> false -> \"Yes\".\n\n          How about [1,0,-1]? \n            cumulative: [1,1,0] -> \n              step1: s=1 -> no zero? so f=0? \n              step2: s=1 -> still no zero? \n              step3: s=0 -> set f=1.\n            Then we don't set m? -> condition: (0 or not 1) = (0 or 0) -> false -> \"Yes\".\n\n          But is [1,0,-1] possible?\n            Conditions:\n              a1=1 -> x1=1.\n              a2=0 = x2 - y2 -> and y2 = x1=1 -> so x2=1.\n              a3=-1 = -x2 -> so x2=1 -> matches.\n\n            How to do:\n              Start at 1: \n                Do a right move: a1 becomes 1, then move to 2.\n              At 2: \n                We can do a left move: then a2 becomes -1 and move to 1? -> but then we are at 1 and we have a2=-1? not 0.\n                Or we can do a right move: then a2 becomes 1 and move to 3? -> then we have a2=1? not 0.\n\n            Alternatively, at 2: \n                We do nothing? but then we are stuck? \n\n            How about:\n              Start at 1: \n                Right move: a1=1, then at 2.\n              Then at 2: \n                We do a left move: subtract 1 at 2 -> a2 becomes -1? and then move to 1? -> then we are at 1 and we have a2=-1? \n                Then we do a right move again? a1 becomes 2? \n\n            This doesn't work.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n              Start at 1: \n                Right move: a1=1, then at 2.\n              Then at 2: \n                Right move: a2=1, then at 3.\n              Then at 3: \n                Left move: a3=-1, then at 2.\n              Then at 2: \n                Left move: a2 becomes 1-1=0? and then move to 1.\n\n            Then the array: \n                a1=1, a2=0 (because we did one right move and one left move: 1-1=0), a3=-1.\n\n            Steps:\n              [0,0,0] -> \n                Start at 1: \n                  Operation1: [1,0,0] and pointer at 2.\n                  Operation1: [1,1,0] and pointer at 3.\n                  Operation2: [1,1,-1] and pointer at 2.\n                  Operation2: [1,0,-1] and pointer at 1.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not just nonnegative and total zero? but also we cannot have a positive cumulative sum after a zero? \n\n          Why did [1,0,-1] work? \n            The cumulative sums: \n              step1: 1 -> not zero? \n              step2: 1 (because 1+0=1) -> not zero? \n              step3: 0 -> zero.\n\n            We never had a zero and then a positive? \n\n          But what about [0,1,0,-1]? \n            cumulative: [0,1,1,0] -> \n              step1: 0 -> f=1\n              step2: 1 -> then we break? because f and s>0 -> m=1 -> \"No\".\n\n          Is [0,1,0,-1] possible?\n            Conditions:\n              a1=0 -> x1=0.\n              a2=1 = x2 - y2 -> and y2=x1=0 -> x2=1.\n              a3=0 = x3 - y3 -> and y3=x2=1 -> x3=1.\n              a4=-1 = -x3 -> so x3=1 -> matches.\n\n            How to do?\n              Start at 1: \n                We cannot do a right move? because that would make a1=1? \n                But we can do: \n                  We start at 1: \n                    We do nothing? then we are stuck? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n                  We do a right move? then a1=1? -> not 0.\n\n            So it is impossible.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions in the code are:\n            - We traverse the array and maintain the cumulative sum s.\n            - If at any point s<0 -> we break? but the code doesn't break? it has a TODO.\n\n          What should we do when s<0?\n            We know that if s<0 at any prefix, then it's impossible? so we can set a flag and break? \n\n          The code currently has:\n            if s<0: # TODO\n\n          We can set m=1 and break? because if we get negative, then it's invalid.\n\n          But note: the code already has:\n            if s==0: f=1\n            if f and s>0: m=1; break\n\n          And then after the loop, we check (m or not f) -> if m is set (meaning we had a negative OR we had a positive after zero) OR if f is not set (meaning we never had a zero) then we output \"No\".\n\n          So we can do:\n            if s<0: \n                m=1\n                break\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            if s<0:\n                m=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the problem says the cumulative sums must be nonnegative? and the total must be zero? and we break on negative? and also we break on positive after zero? \n\n          However, what if we get negative and then it becomes nonnegative? \n            Example: [1, -2, 1] -> \n              step1: s=1 -> ok.\n              step2: s=-1 -> set m=1 and break -> output \"No\".\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Also, what if we never get a zero? \n            Example: [1, -1, 1] -> \n              cumulative: [1,0,1] -> \n                step1: s=1 -> f remains 0? \n                step2: s=0 -> set f=1.\n                step3: s=1 -> then we have f and s>0 -> set m=1 -> break -> output \"No\".\n\n          But wait: [1,-1,1] -> \n            Conditions: \n              a1=1 -> x1=1.\n              a2=-1 = x2 - y2 -> and y2=x1=1 -> so x2=0.\n              a3=1 = x3 - y3 -> and y3=x2=0 -> so x3=1.\n              Then a4? we don't have a4? but we have a3=1, and the condition for the last element? the last element is a3? \n                The condition for the last element: a3 = - (a1+a2) = - (1-1)=0 -> but we have a3=1 -> not 0.\n\n          Therefore, the total sum is 1? not 0? so it should be invalid? \n\n          Actually, the total sum of [1,-1,1] is 1, not 0. \n\n          So the condition of total sum=0 is not checked? \n\n          The code does: \n            s = 0\n            for i in n:\n                s += i\n                ...\n\n          Then after the loop, we check the flags? but we don't check the total sum? \n\n          However, note: the total sum is the last value of s. And we break if we see a negative? or a positive after zero? but we don't break for [1,-1,1] until the last step? \n            step1: s=1 -> no break.\n            step2: s=0 -> set f=1 -> no break.\n            step3: s=1 -> then we break and set m=1.\n\n          Then we output \"No\", which is correct.\n\n          But what if the total sum is not zero? \n            Example: [1,0,0] -> \n              cumulative: [1,1,1] -> \n                step1: s=1 -> no break.\n                step2: s=1 -> no break? and f remains 0? \n                step3: s=1 -> no break? \n              Then after the loop: \n                m=0, f=0 -> condition: (0 or not 0) = (0 or 1) = 1 -> output \"No\".\n\n          But [1,0,0] has total sum=1, not 0 -> so it should be \"No\".\n\n          Therefore, the condition (m or not f) covers:\n            - If we ever had a negative (m=1) -> then output \"No\".\n            - If we ever had a positive after a zero (m=1) -> then output \"No\".\n            - If we never had a zero (f=0) -> then output \"No\".\n            - Otherwise, output \"Yes\".\n\n          But note: the total sum must be zero? and the cumulative sums must be nonnegative? and we break on negative? and we break on positive after zero? and we set f=1 only when we see a zero? \n\n          However, what if the cumulative sum becomes zero at the last step? \n            Then f=1 (because we set f=1 when we see a zero at any step) and we don't set m? \n            Then condition: (0 or not 1) = (0 or 0) = 0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n          But what if the cumulative sum becomes zero at an intermediate step and then becomes zero again at the end? \n            Example: [1,-1,0] -> \n              cumulative: [1,0,0] -> \n                step1: s=1 -> no break, f=0.\n                step2: s=0 -> set f=1.\n                step3: s=0 -> no break? \n              Then after the loop: \n                m=0, f=1 -> condition: (0 or not 1)=0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n          But [1,-1,0] is possible? \n            Conditions: \n              a1=1 -> x1=1.\n              a2=-1 = x2 - y2 -> y2=x1=1 -> so x2=0.\n              a3=0 = -x2 -> 0=0 -> ok.\n\n            How to do:\n              Start at 1: \n                Right move: a1=1, then at 2.\n              At 2: \n                Left move: a2=-1, then at 1.\n              Then we are at 1? and we have a3=0? \n                But we haven't set a3? \n\n            We need to set a3? \n              We can do:\n                After being at 1 (after the left move from 2), we do a right move again? then a1 becomes 2? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n                Start at 1: \n                  Right move: a1=1 -> at 2.\n                Then at 2: \n                  Right move: a2=1 -> at 3? but we need a2=-1.\n\n            How about:\n                Start at 1: \n                  Right move: a1=1 -> at 2.\n                Then at 2: \n                  Left move: a2=-1 -> at 1.\n                Then at 1: \n                  Right move: a1=2 -> at 2? \n                Then at 2: \n                  Right move: a2=0 -> at 3? \n                Then at 3: \n                  Left move: a3=-1 -> at 2? \n                Then at 2: \n                  Left move: a2=-1 -> at 1? \n                Then we are at 1? but we have a1=2, a2=-1-1+0? -> complicated.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n                Operation1: [1,0,0] (pointer at 2)\n                Operation2: [1,-1,0] (pointer at 1) -> then we are done? \n                But we haven't set a3? \n\n          The array has three elements: a1, a2, a3. \n            We have set a1=1, a2=-1, and a3 remains 0? so [1,-1,0] -> that's the array.\n\n          How did we set a3? \n            We never visited a3? \n\n          The operations only set the current element? and we never visited the third? \n\n          But the problem: the array has three elements? we must set a3? \n\n          How to set a3? \n            We must visit the third? \n\n          How about:\n                Operation1: from 1 to 2: [1,0,0] (pointer at 2)\n                Operation2: from 2 to 3: [1,1,0] (pointer at 3)\n                Operation3: from 3 to 2: [1,1,-1] (pointer at 2)\n                Operation4: from 2 to 1: [1,0,-1] (pointer at 1) -> then we have [1,0,-1]? \n\n          How to get [1,-1,0]? \n            We need to subtract 1 at the second element without adding? \n\n          We can do:\n                Operation1: from 1 to 2: [1,0,0] (pointer at 2)\n                Operation2: from 2 to 1: [1,-1,0] (pointer at 1) -> then we are done? \n\n          This works: \n                a1: we did one right move: 1.\n                a2: we did one left move: -1.\n                a3: we never visited? so 0.\n\n          But the problem: the array has three elements? and we are allowed to do operations? the third element remains 0? which is the initial value? \n\n          So [1,-1,0] is possible.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            for _ in [0]*int(input()):\n                input()\n                n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n                s,f,m = 0,0,0\n                for i in n:\n                    s+=i\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n                    if s==0:\n                        f=1\n                    if f and s>0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n                print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2])\n\n          But note: the problem says the total sum must be zero? and the above code does not explicitly check the total sum? \n          However, the condition (not f) at the end: if we never had a zero? then we output \"No\". \n          But what if the total sum is zero but we never had a zero in the prefix? \n            Example: [0] -> \n              n=[0]: \n                s=0 -> set f=1.\n                then condition: (m or not f) = (0 or 0) -> false -> \"Yes\".\n\n          Example: [2,-2] -> \n              step1: s=2 -> no break, f=0.\n              step2: s=0 -> set f=1.\n              then condition: (0 or not 1)=0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n          Example: [1,-1] -> \n              step1: s=1 -> no break, f=0.\n              step2: s=0 -> set f=1.\n              then condition: (0 or 0) -> \"Yes\".\n\n          Example: [1, -1, 1] -> \n              step1: s=1 -> f=0.\n              step2: s=0 -> f=1.\n              step3: s=1 -> then we break and set m=1 -> condition: (1 or ...) -> true -> \"No\".\n\n          But [1,-1,1] has total sum=1, not 0? so it's invalid? \n\n          However, the condition (not f) is only about having at least one zero? but the total sum is the last s? and we break at step3? so the last s is 1? not 0? \n\n          The problem requires the total sum to be 0? but we break early? \n\n          How do we know the total sum? \n            We break at step3? so we don't process the entire array? \n\n          But the problem: the array has three elements? we break at the third element? and the cumulative sum at the third element is 1? which is not 0? so it fails the total sum condition? \n\n          Therefore, the condition (m or not f) at the end: \n            - If we broke early because of negative or positive after zero, then m=1 -> output \"No\".\n            - If we did not break, then we have processed the entire array? \n                Then we require that the total sum is 0? but note: the condition (not f) -> if we never had a zero? then output \"No\". \n                But what if the entire array never had a zero until the last? \n                  Example: [1, -1] -> we set f=1 at the last? so not f=0 -> condition (0 or 0)=0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n          However, the total sum is 0? and we had a zero at the last? so it's valid.\n\n          But what if the entire array never has a zero? \n            Example: [1,0] -> \n              step1: s=1 -> f=0.\n              step2: s=1 -> then we break? no, because we don't break for positive? unless we have f set? \n              So we finish the loop: \n                m=0, f=0 -> condition: (0 or 1)=1 -> \"No\".\n\n          But [1,0] has total sum=1, not 0? so it's invalid? \n\n          Therefore, the condition (not f) at the end catches the case where the total sum is not zero? \n            Because if the total sum is zero, then the last cumulative sum is zero? so we set f=1 at the last? \n            But what if we have a zero only at the last? \n              Then we set f=1 at the last? so not f=0 -> condition (0 or 0)=0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n          However, what if we have a zero at the last but we also had a zero earlier? \n            Then we set f=1 at the earlier step? and then at the last step we don't set it again? but it's already 1? \n\n          So the condition (not f) at the end is equivalent to: the total sum is not zero? \n            Because if the total sum is zero, then the last cumulative sum is zero? so we set f=1 at the last step? \n            But what if we broke early? then we might not have processed the last step? \n\n          Therefore, the code as written is correct.\n\n          Conclusion for program1.py: \n            The missing code is:\n                if s<0:\n                    m=1\n                    break\n\n          Now, for program2.py:\n\n          Description: \n            We are given an array a. We start with one copy. Operations:\n              1. Clone any existing array (costs 1 operation).\n              2. Swap any two elements from any two copies (maybe the same) (costs 1 operation per swap).\n\n            We want the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n          Example: \n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example in the note: 6 operations.\n\n          The provided code:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n          We note: \n            The input is read from stdin. The test cases: the first line is t, then for each test case: \n                first line: n, second line: the array.\n\n          The code: \n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2] \n                This skips the first two lines? \n                Actually: \n                  [*open(0)] is a list of lines.\n                  [2::2] means starting at index 2 (the third line) and then every two lines? \n                But the input: \n                  first line: t\n                  then for each test case: \n                      first line: n\n                      second line: the array\n\n                So the array lines are at indices: 1, 3, 5, ... -> so [1::2] would be the array lines? \n                But the code uses [2::2] -> that would be indices 2,4,6,... -> which are the second test case's array? \n\n          Correction: \n            The first line: index0 -> t\n            Then first test case: \n                index1: n\n                index2: array\n            Then second test case:\n                index3: n\n                index4: array\n\n            So the array lines are at indices: 2,4,6,... -> [2::2] is correct? \n\n          But note: the first array line is at index2? \n\n          Then: \n            n = len(a:=a.split()) \n                This sets a to the list of tokens (the array) and n to the length of that list? \n\n          Then: \n            m = max(Counter(a).values()) \n                m is the frequency of the most frequent element.\n\n          Then: \n            r=0\n            while m<n:\n                # TODO\n            print(r)\n\n          We need to compute the minimal number of operations.\n\n          How to solve?\n            We can do:\n              Operation1: clone the array (cost 1) -> now we have two copies.\n              Operation2: swap two elements (cost 1) -> we can swap to put two of the same element together? \n\n            But note: we can do multiple clones and multiple swaps.\n\n          Observation:\n            We want one copy to have all elements equal to some value x. \n            How many of the element x do we need? n (the entire array).\n\n            Initially, we have one copy of the array. We can clone the array arbitrarily. Then we can swap arbitrarily between copies.\n\n            The total number of copies of the element x in the entire system is the frequency of x in the original array multiplied by the number of clones that contain x? \n\n            But note: we can swap arbitrarily? so we can gather all the x's from all the clones? \n\n            Actually, the entire system has:\n              Initially: one array -> total frequency of x: freq(x) (from the original array).\n              After k clones: we have k+1 arrays. The total frequency of x: (k+1)*freq(x) ? \n                But wait: when we clone, we clone the entire array? so each clone has the same frequency? \n\n            However, when we swap, we can move an element from one array to another? so the total number of x's in the entire system is always (k+1)*freq(x) (if we haven't created new x's? we are only swapping).\n\n            But we want one array to have n copies of x. Therefore, we require:\n                n <= (k+1)*freq(x)   [because we have k+1 arrays and the total number of x's is (k+1)*freq(x)]\n\n            But note: we can choose x arbitrarily? so we choose the x that has the maximum frequency? m = max_freq.\n\n            Then: n <= (k+1)*m.\n\n            How many clones? k = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\n            But then we have to do the swaps? \n              We start with one array. \n              We do k clones: k operations.\n              Then we need to do swaps to gather n copies of x in one array. \n\n            How many swaps? \n              Initially, the array that we want to make all x has some number of x's? and the other arrays have the rest? \n              We can swap an element that is not x in the target array with an x in another array? \n              The target array initially has, say, c0 copies of x. Then we need n - c0 more x's. \n              And each swap can bring one x from another array? \n\n            But note: we can also swap within the same array? but that doesn't help? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n              We have k+1 arrays. The target array initially has c0 copies of x. \n              The other arrays: we can take x's from them? but we cannot take more than the number of x's they have? \n\n            However, we are free to rearrange arbitrarily? \n\n            The minimal number of swaps is the number of non-x elements in the target array? because we need to replace each non-x in the target array with an x from somewhere else? \n\n            But note: we can also swap non-x elements from other arrays? but that might require more swaps? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n              We need to have n x's in the target array. \n              Currently, the target array has c0 x's? so we need n - c0 x's from outside? \n              And we have to remove the non-x elements from the target array? we can swap them with x's from other arrays? \n              Each swap can fix one position: swap a non-x in the target with an x in another array? \n              So we need n - c0 swaps? \n\n            But what is c0? the initial number of x's in the target array? \n              We can choose the target array arbitrarily? we can choose the original array? or a clone? \n              But note: we can rearrange arbitrarily? so we can choose the array that initially has the most x's? \n\n            However, we are allowed to do swaps arbitrarily? so we can even choose to build the target array from scratch? \n\n            Actually, the minimal number of swaps is the number of non-x elements that we have to remove from the target array? which is n - (number of x's we have in the target array). \n\n            But we can also use multiple swaps to bring x's? and we can also use the fact that we can swap multiple times? \n\n            However, note: we can also create multiple clones? and then we can swap from multiple clones? \n\n            The total number of x's available is (k+1)*m. \n            We need to put n of them in one array. \n\n            The number of swaps needed is the number of non-x elements that are in the target array? which is n - (number of x's we leave in the target array). But we can leave as many x's as we want in the target array? as long as we don't exceed the initial x's in that array? \n\n            Actually, we can choose the target array arbitrarily? so we choose the one that has the most x's? which is m? \n            Then we need to bring n - m x's from other arrays? and we have to remove n - m non-x elements from the target array? \n            But each swap can fix one non-x in the target array: swap it with an x from another array? \n            So the number of swaps is n - m.\n\n            But wait: what if we have more than one clone? \n              Example: n=4, m=1 -> then we need 4 x's. \n                Total x's: (k+1)*1 >= 4 -> k>=3 -> so we do 3 clones (3 operations).\n                Then we have 4 arrays, each with one x.\n                Then we need to form one array with 4 x's: \n                  We choose one array (the target) that initially has one x. \n                  We need to bring 3 more x's from the other arrays? \n                  But each swap: we can swap a non-x (which is the other 3 elements in the target array) with an x from another array? \n                  How many swaps? 3.\n\n                Total operations: 3 (clones) + 3 (swaps) = 6.\n\n            But the formula: \n                clones: k = ceil(n/m) - 1 = ceil(4/1)-1 = 4-1=3.\n                swaps: n - m = 4-1=3.\n                total = k + (n-m) = 3+3=6.\n\n            What if we do more clones? \n              k=4: then we have 5 arrays -> total x's=5 -> then swaps: n-m=3 -> total operations=4+3=7 -> worse.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations for a fixed x (with frequency m) is:\n            k = ceil(n/m) - 1   [because we start with 1 array, then we clone k times to get k+1 arrays]\n            swaps = n - m   [because we start with m x's in the target array and we need n, so we need n-m more, and each swap brings one x?]\n\n          But wait: is it that simple? \n            Consider: n=3, m=2 -> \n                k = ceil(3/2)-1 = ceil(1.5)-1 = 2-1=1.\n                swaps = 3-2=1.\n                total=1+1=2.\n\n            How?\n              Start: [x, x, y] (one array)\n              Operation1: clone -> two arrays: [x,x,y] and [x,x,y]\n              Operation2: swap the y in the first array with an x in the second array? \n                Then we get: [x,x,x] and [x,y,y] -> done.\n\n            So total 2 operations.\n\n          But note: the problem says we can swap any two elements from any two copies? so we can swap the y in the first with an x in the second? \n\n          However, what if we choose the target array to be the first array? \n            Initially: [x,x,y] -> we want to make it [x,x,x]. \n            We have one x in the second array? we swap the y in the first with the x in the second? \n            Then the first becomes [x,x,x] and the second becomes [x,x,y] -> but then we have an extra y in the second? \n\n          But we don't care about the other arrays? we only need one copy to be all x.\n\n          Therefore, the formula: \n            operations = (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)\n\n          But wait: what if we can do better? \n            Consider: we might not need to do all the clones? \n\n          Actually, the formula for k: we need (k+1)*m >= n -> k >= ceil(n/m)-1.\n\n          And the swaps: we need to bring n-m x's? and each swap brings one x? so we need at least n-m swaps.\n\n          Therefore, the total operations is at least (ceil(n/m)-1) + (n-m).\n\n          But is it achievable? \n            We do k = ceil(n/m)-1 clones: that gives us k+1 arrays, and total x's = (k+1)*m >= n.\n            Then we do n-m swaps: each swap takes one x from a non-target array and swaps it with a non-x in the target array? \n            Since the total x's is at least n, we can take n-m x's from the non-target arrays? and the target array has m x's initially? so after adding n-m x's, it becomes n? \n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations is (ceil(n/m)-1) + (n-m).\n\n          However, note: what if m==n? \n            Then k = ceil(n/n)-1 = 1-1=0.\n            swaps = n-n=0.\n            total=0 -> which is correct.\n\n          Example: [0,0,0] -> m=3, n=3 -> 0 operations.\n\n          But the example in the note: \n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (because 0 and 3 appear twice? but note: 0 appears twice? 3 appears twice? so m=2? \n            Then: \n                k = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2.\n                swaps = 6-2=4.\n                total=2+4=6 -> matches.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # We need to do operations until we have one array with all equal? \n                # But we have a formula: \n                #   operations = (ceil(n/m)-1) + (n-m)   -> but wait, we are in a loop? \n\n          Why is there a while loop? \n\n          The provided code:\n\n            while m<n:\n                # TODO\n\n          And then print(r). \n\n          How to update? \n\n          Note: the formula we have is for one step? but actually, we are allowed to do multiple clones and swaps? and we have a direct formula? \n\n          But the problem: we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily? and we have a direct formula? \n\n          Therefore, we can break out of the loop immediately? \n\n          However, the while loop condition is m<n? and if m==n, we skip the loop and output 0? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n            r = (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)\n\n          But wait: what if we can do better by choosing a different x? \n            We already chose the x with the maximum frequency? so m is the maximum frequency? \n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations is the formula above? \n\n          But note: the formula ceil(n/m) is not linear? and we are in a loop? \n\n          Alternatively, the problem might be solved by a greedy simulation? \n\n          However, the note says the total n over test cases <= 10^5? and the while loop condition is m<n? but if m is small, the loop might run many times? \n\n          We must avoid a loop that runs n times? \n\n          Therefore, we should compute the answer without a loop? \n\n          How? \n\n          We have: \n            k = ceil(n/m) - 1\n            swaps = n - m\n            total = k + swaps = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m\n\n          But note: ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1? \n\n          So: \n            k = (n-1)//m + 1 - 1 = (n-1)//m\n\n          Then total = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          But wait: what if n is divisible by m? \n            ceil(n/m) = n/m, then k = n/m - 1.\n            (n-1)//m = (n-1)//m, which is not the same as n/m-1? \n\n          Example: n=4, m=2 -> \n            ceil(4/2)=2 -> k=1.\n            (4-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 -> same.\n\n          Example: n=5, m=2 -> \n            ceil(5/2)=3 -> k=2.\n            (5-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> same.\n\n          So: \n            ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          But note: the while loop condition: if m==n, we skip? so we only do this when m<n.\n\n          However, what if m==0? \n            But n>=1, and m>=1? because the array has n elements? so m>=1.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          But wait: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5? and we are doing integer division? so it's efficient.\n\n          However, the code is inside the while loop? and the condition is m<n? and we are updating what? \n\n          The provided code: \n            while m<n:\n                # TODO\n\n          And then we break? \n\n          But we don't update m or n? so we would be stuck in an infinite loop? \n\n          Therefore, we should break after setting r? \n\n          Alternatively, we can set r and then break? \n\n          But the problem: we are only going through the loop once? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n            break\n\n          Or we can avoid the loop and do:\n\n            if m == n:\n                r = 0\n            else:\n                r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          But the code already sets r=0? and then if m<n, we enter the loop? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem might have multiple steps? \n\n          Actually, the formula we derived is the minimal number of operations? so we don't need a loop? \n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n            break\n\n          However, what if we can do better by increasing m? \n            But m is fixed: the maximum frequency in the original array? \n\n          Therefore, we break after one iteration.\n\n          But the while loop condition is m<n? and we break? so we do one iteration? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do without the loop? \n\n          But the code structure has a while loop? so we must break? \n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n                print(r)\n\n          But what if we don't break? and the loop condition becomes m>=n? then we break? \n\n          We break explicitly? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if m < n:\n                r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          But the code has a while loop? and we are only going to do one iteration? \n\n          We can break out of the loop? \n\n          But note: the problem says the minimal number of operations? and we have a direct formula? \n\n          Therefore, we break.\n\n          However, the problem: \n            Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 -> \n                r = (6-1)//2 + 6 - 2 = 5//2 + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 -> correct.\n\n          Example: [0,0,0] -> n=3, m=3 -> skip the loop -> r=0 -> correct.\n\n          Example: [0,1,2] -> n=3, m=1 -> \n                r = (3-1)//1 + 3-1 = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n          How to do [0,1,2] in 4 operations?\n                Operation1: clone -> [0,1,2] and [0,1,2] (cost=1)\n                Operation2: swap the 1 in the first array with the 0 in the second array? \n                    Then we have: [0,0,2] and [1,1,2] -> not all equal.\n                Operation3: clone the first array? -> [0,0,2], [0,0,2], [1,1,2] (cost=2)\n                Operation4: swap the 2 in the first array with the 1 in the third array? \n                    Then we have: [0,0,1] -> not all equal.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n                Operation1: clone -> two arrays: A=[0,1,2], B=[0,1,2]\n                Operation2: swap A[1] and B[0] -> A=[0,0,2], B=[1,1,2]\n                Operation3: clone A -> three arrays: A=[0,0,2], B=[1,1,2], C=[0,0,2]\n                Operation4: swap A[2] and C[0] -> but C[0] is 0? then A becomes [0,0,0] -> done.\n\n          So 4 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n          But note: the formula: \n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n\n          However, we must be cautious: \n            The formula for k: ceil(n/m)-1 = (n-1)//m   [because ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, so k = (n-1)//m]\n            Then total = k + (n-m) = (n-1)//m + n - m.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5? and we are doing one integer division per test case? so it's efficient.\n\n          However, the while loop condition is m<n? and we break? so we do one iteration per test case? \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the loop? \n\n          But the problem says: \"complete the code\" and the code has a while loop? so we must fill the loop body? \n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            while m < n:\n                r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                break\n\n          But what if we don't break? then the next iteration of the while loop would run again? and m and n haven't changed? so we break to avoid infinite loop.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set m to n? to break the loop? \n\n          But the problem: we are only using the formula once? \n\n          Therefore, we break.\n\n          Final code for program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n                print(r)\n\n          However, note: the array elements are strings? and we are splitting the string? \n          But the problem: the array elements can be negative? and integers? \n\n          The input: \n            The second line of each test case contains n integers? \n\n          But we are splitting the string and then counting? \n\n          Example: \n            Input: \"1 0 -1\" -> split -> ['1','0','-1'] -> \n                Counter: \n                  '1':1, '0':1, '-1':1 -> m=1.\n\n          This is correct? \n\n          But note: the array elements are integers? but the problem does not require the values? only the frequency? and we are counting the frequency of the string representation? \n\n          However, the same integer represented by the same string? so it's fine.\n\n          But what if we have the same integer represented in different ways? \n            The problem: the integers are given as decimal integers? so no leading zeros? \n\n          Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the array elements can be negative? and we are splitting the string? and then we get the tokens? which are the string representations? \n\n          Example: \n            Input: \"0 0 0\" -> tokens: ['0','0','0'] -> m=3.\n\n          So it's fine.\n\n          But what if we have a large array? \n            The total n over test cases <= 10^5? so the Counter is efficient.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"m=1\\n        break\"\n            program2: \"r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the code in program1.py has an indentation of 8 spaces for the body of the for loop? and the TODO is at the same level? \n\n          Similarly, in program2.py, the while loop body should be indented.\n\n          We output the exact code to fill the TODO.\n\n          For program1.py: the TODO is at the line after \"if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\"\n\n          We replace the TODO line with two lines:\n\n            if s<0:\n                m=1\n                break\n\n          But the existing code already has \"if s<0: ...\", so we just fill the body? \n\n          The existing code:\n\n                if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n                if s==0:f=1\n                if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          We want to replace the TODO line with:\n\n                if s<0:\n                    m=1\n                    break\n\n          But note: the next two if statements are after the body of the first if? \n\n          We must break out of the loop if s<0? so we break and skip the next if's? \n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n                if s<0:\n                    m=1\n                    break\n\n          For program2.py: the TODO is inside the while loop.\n\n          We write:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          But note: the break is necessary to avoid an infinite loop.\n\n          However, we can also do:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    m = n   # to break the loop condition for the next iteration? but we break anyway? \n                    # but we break explicitly? \n\n          But the break is simpler.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code:\n\n            program1: \n                m=1\n                break\n\n            program2:\n                r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                break\n\n          But note: the code in program1.py has the next two if statements? we must not run them if we break? \n\n          The break will break the for loop? so the next if's are skipped? \n\n          So we are good.\n\n          However, the problem: the code for program1.py has the for loop over the array? and we break out of the for loop? \n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          Now, output in the required JSON format.\n\n          Example:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        m=1\\n        break\",\n                \"program2\": \"        r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the indentation? \n            In program1.py, the current indentation level is 8 spaces? so we add 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the existing code:\n\n                for i in n:\n                    s+=i\n                    if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          We want to replace the line with TODO with:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          But the TODO is on the same line as the if? \n\n          We must write:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          The existing line: \"if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\" -> we replace that entire line with:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          But then the next two if statements are still in the loop? \n\n          However, the break will break the loop? so we skip the rest of the array? \n\n          But what if we don't break? then we continue? \n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          And then the next two if statements remain? \n\n          But the problem: if we break, we break the loop? so the next two if's are not executed? \n\n          If we don't break (i.e., s>=0) then we continue to the next if's? \n\n          So the code becomes:\n\n                for i in n:\n                    s+=i\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Similarly, for program2.py, we replace the TODO with:\n\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          Therefore, the answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"    m=1\\n        break\",\n                \"program2\": \"    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the existing code in program1.py has 8 spaces for the inner for loop? and the TODO line is at 8 spaces? and the body of the if should be indented by 12? \n\n          Actually, the existing code:\n\n            for _ in [0]*int(input()):\n                input()\n                n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n                s,f,m = 0,0,0\n                for i in n:\n                    s+=i\n                    if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n                print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2])\n\n          The inner for loop body is indented by 8 spaces? and the if statements are at 8 spaces? \n\n          We want to replace the line:\n\n                    if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          with:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          So we write:\n\n                    if s<0:\n                        m=1\n                        break\n\n          The indentation: \n            The first line: 8 spaces? then the next two lines: 12 spaces? \n\n          Therefore, the string for program1 should be:\n\n                \"        if s<0:\\n            m=1\\n            break\"\n\n          But wait: the existing line is already \"if s<0: ...\", so we are replacing it with a multi-line block? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                \"        if s<0: m=1; break\"\n\n          But that would be:\n\n                    if s<0: m=1; break\n\n          This is a one-liner? \n\n          But the problem: the next two if statements are still there? \n\n          We want to break out and skip the next two if's? \n\n          The one-liner: \n            if s<0: m=1; break\n\n          This is equivalent to:\n\n            if s<0:\n                m=1\n                break\n\n          So it's acceptable.\n\n          But the problem: the code after the TODO is:\n\n                    if s<0:# TODO: Your code here\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          If we replace the first if with a one-liner, then the next two if's are still at the same level? \n\n          So:\n\n                    if s<0: m=1; break\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Similarly, for program2.py, we can write:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m; break\n\n          But the problem: the break is on the same line? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write two lines? \n\n          Given the requirement: output only the missing code? and the existing code has a while loop with a TODO? we can output two lines with proper indentation? \n\n          The existing code in program2.py:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace with:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          The indentation: the while loop is at 4 spaces? the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n          But the existing code: \n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n          We want to replace the TODO line with:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          But note: the next line is \"print(r)\"? which is outside the loop? \n\n          So we break the while loop into multiple lines? \n\n          Therefore, the code becomes:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          But the existing code already has the while loop? so we are just filling the body? \n\n          We output the body? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> so we output the block? \n\n          For program1.py: we output the block that replaces the entire TODO line? \n\n          We decide to output:\n\n            program1: \"        if s<0: m=1; break\"\n            program2: \"        r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the existing TODO line in program1.py is one line? and we are replacing it with one line? \n\n          For program2.py, the TODO line is one line? and we are replacing it with two lines? \n\n          The indentation in program2.py: the while loop is at the same level as the for loop? which is 4 spaces? so the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n          Therefore, the two lines for program2.py should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n          We write:\n\n            \"        r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n          This will give:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r = (n-1)//m + n - m\n                    break\n\n          And then the next line is \"print(r)\"? \n\n          But note: the existing code after the while loop is:\n\n                print(r)\n\n          So we break the loop and then print.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        if s<0: m=1; break\",\n                \"program2\": \"        r = (n-1)//m + n - m\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n          But wait: in program1.py, the next two if statements are still there? \n            We want to skip them if we break? and the one-liner does break? \n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          However, what if we have multiple conditions? \n            We break on negative? and we break on positive after zero? \n\n          The code:\n\n                for i in n:\n                    s+=i\n                    if s<0: m=1; break\n                    if s==0:f=1\n                    if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          We output the JSON."
