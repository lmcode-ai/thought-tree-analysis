Therefore, we can change the condition to:\n\n          if elem * n == sm:\n\n  Then we avoid floating point. How about the example [1,1,1] (n=3, sm=3):\n          1*3==3 -> True. [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5, sm=15): \n          3*5==15 -> True. [1,1,2] (n=3, sm=4): \n          1*3=3 ! =4, 2*3=6 ! =4. So it is the same. We can change the for-loop to:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              if elem * n == sm:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  This is simpler and avoids floating point. But the existing code has:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1)) We can remove these and do:\n\n          if elem * n == sm:\n\n  Or we can leave them and change the condition to `if elem * n == sm`? Since the problem says to complete the missing part, and the TODO is inside the if-statement, we can simply set:\n\n          if ...: \n              found = True\n              break\n\n  But we are allowed to change the condition?",

Alternatively, we can count the spaces: \n          The line above: \"if lhs == rhs:\" is at the same level as \"lhs = elem\", which is 4 spaces from the for. Then the block inside the if should be 8 spaces. But the sample code we are given for program2.py has:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1)) if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  So we output:\n\n          \"found = True\\n                break\"\n\n  But to be safe, we can use the same indentation as the surrounding.",

Operation2: if we leave out the 1: then the others become (1.5+1.5)/2 = 1.5 -> array: [1, 1.5, 1.5] -> no change. If we leave out a 1.5: then the others become (1+1.5)/2 = 1.25 -> array: [1.25, 1.25, 1.5] -> sum=1.25+1.25+1.5=4. Then we have [1.25,1.25,1.5] -> still no 4/3. Operation3: if we leave out the 1.5: then the others become (1.25+1.25)/2 = 1.25 -> array: [1.25,1.25,1.5] -> no change. If we leave out a 1.25: then the others become (1.25+1.5)/2 = 1.375 -> array: [1.375,1.25,1.375] -> sum=1.375+1.25+1.375=4. We never get 4/3. Therefore, it is impossible. So the solution for program2.py is: For each test case:\n            n = lines[i][0]\n            a = list of n integers\n            total = sum(a)\n            if total % n == 0:\n                average = total // n\n                if average in a:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n      But wait: what if the average is not an integer? Then it is impossible to have an element exactly equal to the average (which is not an integer) in the integer array initially?",

This avoids floating point. Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n          for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n              n = lines[i][0]\n              a = lines[i+1]\n              total = sum(a)\n              found = False\n              for elem in a:\n                  if elem * n == total:   # because then elem = total/n\n                      found = True\n                      break\n\n              if found:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But note: the array might be large? n up to 50, so it's fine. Let me test with the provided examples:\n          Example1: [1,1,1] -> n=3, total=3. 1*3==3 -> True -> YES. Example2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> n=5, total=15. 1*5=5 ! =15, 2*5=10 ! =15, 3*5=15 -> YES. Example3: [1,1,2] -> n=3, total=4.\n             1*3=3 ! =4, 1*3=3 ! =4, 2*3=6 ! =4 -> NO. Example4: [0,0,0,0] -> n=4, total=0.\n             0*4=0 -> YES. This matches the note. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is to set `found = True` when we find an element such that `elem * n == total`, and then break out of the loop. The code already has:\n      for elem in a:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1)) if lhs == rhs:\n              # TODO:",

For the array to become constant in the future, we must eventually have a_i = S/n for the left out element and (S - a_i)/(n-1)=S/n. But we showed that (S - a_i)/(n-1)=S/n  <=> a_i = S/n.\n\n          Therefore, the only way to complete the process in the next operation is to have an element S/n at the time of the operation.

We start with [1,2,2,1]. Operation: leave out a 2 -> then the others: [1,2,1] -> average = (1+2+1)/3 = 4/3 \u22481.333 -> becomes [4/3,4/3,4/3,2] -> total=4/3*3+2=4+2=6. Then leave out the 2 -> then the others: [4/3,4/3,4/3] -> average=4/3 -> becomes the same. Or leave out a 4/3: then the others: [4/3,4/3,2] -> average = (4/3+4/3+2)/3 = (8/3+2)/3 = (14/3)/3 = 14/9 \u22481.555 -> becomes [14/9,14/9,14/9,2] -> total=14/9*3+2 = 14/3+2 = 14/3+6/3=20/3\u22486.666 -> wait, that's not 6. I see an error: when we leave out one 4/3, the chosen set is the other three: [4/3,4/3,2] -> average = (4/3+4/3+2)/3 = (8/3+6/3)/3 = (14/3)/3 = 14/9. Then we set these three to 14/9 -> the new array: [4/3, 14/9, 14/9, 14/9] -> total = 4/3 + 14/9*3 = 4/3 + 14/3 = 18/3=6. Then we have [4/3, 14/9, 14/9, 14/9]. Now, 4/3 = 12/9, which is not 1.5 (which is 13.5/9).",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about processing queries for a promotion: for each query (x, y), we need to compute the maximum total value of free items when a customer must buy at least x items and the y cheapest of them are free.\n\nThe idea:\n1. We read n and q.\n2. We read the list of prices and sort them. However, note that the sample code already sorts and builds a list `p` starting with 0.\n3. The sample code has a for-loop that iterates over sorted input and builds `p` but it is incomplete. We can see that after building `p`, the code processes each query by computing `p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]`.\n\nWhat is `p`?\nLooking at the sample: \n  In the first query: items [5,3,5] -> sorted [3,5,5] -> but note the example says the two cheapest are 3 and 5 (which are the two smallest) and the total is 8.\n  The code prints: `p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]`\n\nWe can deduce that `p` is a prefix sum array of the sorted prices. But note the example:\n\n  Input: n=5, q=3, prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\n  Query1: x=3, y=2 -> output = 8? But wait, the example says: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n  However, the example input is not [1,2,3,4,5] but [5,3,5]? Actually, the example input has 5 items: [1,2,3,4,5] and the first query is x=3, y=2.\n\n  How does the example work?\n      The customer must buy at least 3 items. To maximize the free value, the customer would choose the items that give the highest free total. The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So the strategy is to buy a set that has as many high-priced items as possible, but also including some cheap ones that will be free. However, note that the free items are the cheapest ones in the purchase. Therefore, to maximize the free total, we want to have as many expensive items as possible, but we must include at least y cheap items that we get for free. Actually, the best is to take the top (x) items in terms of price? But wait: if we take the top x items, then the y cheapest among these top x would be the smallest ones in that set. \n\n  Example: [1,2,3,4,5] sorted: [1,2,3,4,5]\n      We take the top 3: [3,4,5] -> then the two cheapest in this set are 3 and 4 -> free total = 3+4 = 7? \n      But the example says 8.\n\n  Alternatively, the example says: \"a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5\". How do we get 5,3,5? The array is [1,2,3,4,5] so that would be 3,5,5? But there is only one 5. \n\n  Actually, the note says: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n\n  This implies that the store has two items of price 5? But the input is [1,2,3,4,5] -> only one 5.\n\n  Let me re-read the input: the second line contains n integers: p1, p2, ... pn. So the example input must be: \n      n=5, q=3\n      prices: [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n  But the example output for the first query is 8? That doesn't match.\n\n  The note also says: \n      \"In the second query: two items worth 5 and 5\" -> so there must be two 5's? \n\n  Actually, the sample input in the note is not the same as the one in the problem? \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"The second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn\"\n\n  And the example: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5\"\n\n  So the array must have two 5's? \n\n  Therefore, the example input array might be: [5,3,5,1,2]? Then sorted: [1,2,3,5,5]\n\n  Then for the first query: x=3, y=2: \n      We can choose the three items: 5,5,3? -> then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? -> total free = 8.\n\n  How do we compute this?\n      We want to maximize the free total. The free total is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase. But note: we are allowed to choose any set of at least x items. To maximize the free total, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. However, the free items are the cheapest in the purchase. So we want to have as many expensive items as possible, but we must have at least y items that are free. The trick is: we can only get an item for free if we include at least y items that are at most that item's price.\n\n  Insight: \n      The best we can do is to have the free items be the y largest possible. How? \n      We can choose the entire set? But then we get the y cheapest of the entire set. But that might not be the maximum free total.\n\n  Actually, the standard solution for this problem is:\n      Sort the prices in ascending order and build prefix sums.\n      Then for a query (x, y): \n          We note that the customer must buy at least x items. To maximize the free total, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. Therefore, we want the purchase to include as many expensive items as possible, but we must include at least y cheap items. However, the expensive items we include will not be free because they are not among the cheapest. \n\n      Alternate view: \n          The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. To maximize the free total, we want the y cheapest in the purchase to be as expensive as possible. How? \n          We can choose a purchase that includes the top (x - y) most expensive items and then the next y expensive items? Then the y cheapest in the purchase would be the next y expensive items (which are the most expensive among the non-top ones). \n\n      Example: [1,2,3,5,5] (sorted: [1,2,3,5,5])\n          We want to get the two free items to be 3 and 5? \n          How? We choose the set: [3,5,5]. The two cheapest in this set are 3 and 5 -> free total = 8.\n\n      How to compute without the set? \n          We note that the entire set is sorted. We can consider: \n          We are going to take the top k items? Actually, we can take the top (x) items? But then the y cheapest in the top x would be the ones from the bottom of that segment.\n\n      Specifically, if we take the top x items (the x largest) then the free items would be the smallest y items in that segment. \n\n      How to get the segment? \n          The array is sorted in increasing order. So the top x items are the last x items: from index n-x to n-1 (0-indexed). The y cheapest in that segment are the first y items of that segment: indices n-x to n-x+y-1.\n\n      Then the free total = prefix_sum from n-x to n-x+y-1.\n\n      But note: the example: \n          n=5, x=3, y=2 -> segment: last 3 items: [3,5,5] -> the first 2 of this segment: [3,5] -> sum=8.\n\n      How to compute with prefix sums?\n          Let p[i] = prefix sum up to index i (0-indexed, and we have a 0 at the beginning). \n          Then the segment from l to r (inclusive) is p[r+1] - p[l].\n\n          The segment we want: \n            l = n - x\n            r = n - x + y - 1\n          So the sum = p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]\n\n      Example: \n          p[0]=0\n          p[1]=1\n          p[2]=1+2=3\n          p[3]=1+2+3=6\n          p[4]=6+5=11\n          p[5]=11+5=16\n\n          Then for n=5, x=3, y=2:\n            n-x = 5-3 = 2\n            n-x+y = 2+2 = 4\n            sum = p[4] - p[2] = 11 - 3 = 8 -> matches.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program1.py is building the prefix sum array.\n\n      The current code:\n          n,q=R()\n          p=[0]\n          for w in sorted(R()): \n              # we are iterating over the sorted prices. We need to build the prefix sum array.\n\n          We can do: \n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n      Then the array p will have length n+1: indices 0..n.\n\n      Then for each query: \n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[n-x+y] - p[n-x])\n\n      But note: the array p is built from the sorted array in increasing order. The smallest first. Then the segment from n-x to n-x+y-1 is the y smallest in the top x.\n\n      However, note: the sorted array is ascending. The top x items (largest) are the last x: from index n-x to n-1. The y smallest in that segment are the first y of that contiguous segment.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is to build the prefix sum array.\n\n      We replace the for-loop with:\n          for w in sorted(R()):\n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n      But note: the sorted(R()) returns the sorted list of the prices. We are building the prefix sum from the smallest to the largest.\n\n      Example: [1,2,3,5,5] -> \n          p[0]=0\n          p[1]=1\n          p[2]=1+2=3\n          p[3]=3+3=6\n          p[4]=6+5=11\n          p[5]=11+5=16\n\n      Then for (x=3,y=2): \n          n-x = 5-3 = 2 -> so we take from index 2 to 3? \n          Actually, the segment we want is from index 2 to 3 (inclusive) -> that is two elements: the element at index2 (which is 3) and index3 (which is 5). \n          The prefix sum from index0 to index3 is p[4]=11, and from index0 to index1 is p[2]=3 -> 11-3=8.\n\n      So the code for program1.py is:\n\n          f=open(0)\n          R=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\n          n,q=R();p=[0]\n          for w in sorted(R()): \n              p.append(p[-1] + w)\n          for _ in \" \"*q: \n              x, y=R()\n              print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\n      However, note: the sorted(R()) returns the sorted list in increasing order. This matches.\n\n      But note: the problem constraints: n, q up to 200,000. The above is O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for prefix and O(q) for queries -> acceptable.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  The problem: \n      We are allowed to choose any n-1 elements and replace them with their arithmetic mean. We can do this any number of times. We are asked if we can make all elements equal.\n\n  Example: \n      Test case 1: [1,1,1] -> already equal -> YES.\n      Test case 2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> we choose the first four: (1+2+4+5)/4 = 12/4 = 3 -> becomes [3,3,3,3,5]? \n          Then we choose the last four: (3+3+3+5)/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 -> becomes [3, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5] -> not equal.\n\n      But the note says: \n          \"In the second test case, you can choose all elements except the third, their average is (1+2+4+5)/4 = 3, so the array will become [3,3,3,3,3]\"\n\n      How? \n          The example says: choose all elements except the third -> that means we choose indices 0,1,3,4 (if 0-indexed) and replace them by the average. \n          The array becomes: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] because we replaced the chosen ones by 3 and the third element was originally 3? \n\n      Actually, the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. The third element (if 0-indexed) is the element at index2 which is 3. Then we choose the other four: [1,2,4,5] -> average=3. Then we set the chosen ones to 3: \n          [3,3,3,3,3] -> because the third element (index2) remains 3? \n\n      So the operation: \n          We choose a set of n-1 indices. We compute the average of the values at those indices. Then we set every element in that set to that average.\n\n      Therefore, the element that was not chosen remains as it was.\n\n      In the example: \n          We did one operation: \n            chosen set: all except the third (index2) -> the values: [1,2,4,5] -> average=3.\n            then we set the chosen set to 3: so the array becomes [3,3,3,3,5]? -> no, because the third element (index2) was not chosen and remains 3? \n          Actually, the note says: \"the array will become [3,3,3,3,3]\". \n\n      How? \n          The note says: \"if we choose all elements except the third\", meaning we are replacing the chosen ones (which are the ones that are not the third) by the average. The third element remains. But the third element was 3, and the average is 3, so we set the chosen ones to 3 and the third element is already 3 -> so the entire array becomes 3.\n\n      Therefore, the operation: \n          We leave one element unchanged and set the other n-1 to the average of the n-1 elements (which includes the other n-1, not the one left).\n\n      Now, the question: is it possible to make all equal?\n\n  Insight:\n      Note that the total sum of the array is invariant? \n          Let the current array be a1, a2, ..., an, and total sum = S.\n          In one operation: we choose n-1 elements. Let the element left out be ai. Then the new array has:\n              The element ai remains.\n              The other n-1 elements become: (S - ai) / (n-1)\n          Then the new total sum = (S - ai) + (S - ai) / (n-1) * (n-1) = (S - ai) + (S - ai) = 2*(S - ai) ??? \n\n      Actually, no: \n          The new array: \n              The element ai remains.\n              The other n-1 elements become: (S - ai) / (n-1) -> so the new total = ai + (S - ai) = S? \n          So the total sum is preserved.\n\n      Therefore, the total sum S is invariant.\n\n      Now, if we ever make all elements equal to k, then the total sum = n*k -> so k = S/n.\n\n      Therefore, a necessary condition: S must be divisible by n? \n          But note: the operations might be done with non-integer averages? The problem says \"replace each of them with their arithmetic mean (which doesn't have to be an integer)\". \n\n      However, the output condition: we are only asked if it is possible. And note that the initial array has integers, but the operations can produce non-integers.\n\n      But the total sum S is an integer and remains an integer? \n          Initially, the array has integers -> S is integer.\n          In one operation: \n              We take n-1 integers -> their sum is an integer, then we divide by (n-1) -> the average might not be integer. Then we set the n-1 elements to that average. \n          Then the new array has one integer (the one left out) and n-1 non-integers? \n\n      However, the problem does not require the elements to remain integers. \n\n      But note: the goal is to have all elements equal. Then they must be equal to S/n. Therefore, we require that S/n is the value of every element. \n\n      However, we can only do the operations a finite number of times. \n\n      How can we achieve it?\n          We note that if the array is already constant, then we are done.\n\n          Otherwise, we require that there exists at least one element that is already S/n? \n          Why? \n          Consider: \n              In the first operation, we leave out one element. Then we set the others to the average of the rest. Then the entire array becomes constant if and only if the element left out is already S/n? \n              Because then the average of the rest is (S - S/n) / (n-1) = ( (n*S/n - S/n) ) / (n-1) = ( (n-1)*S/n ) / (n-1) = S/n.\n\n          Therefore, if there is at least one element that is S/n, then we can do one operation leaving that element and set the rest to S/n -> then the entire array becomes S/n.\n\n          Conversely, if there is no element equal to S/n, then after one operation we set n-1 elements to the average of the rest (which is S/n) and leave one element (which is not S/n). Then we have one element that is not S/n and the rest are S/n. \n\n          Now, can we fix it? \n            In the next operation, we can leave out the element that is not S/n? \n            Then the average of the rest (which are all S/n) is S/n. Then we set the chosen ones (which are the n-1 elements that are S/n) to S/n -> they remain S/n. The element we left out remains unchanged (which is not S/n). \n\n          So we are stuck.\n\n          Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is: there exists at least one element that is equal to S/n.\n\n      But wait: what if we do multiple operations without having an element equal to S/n? \n          Example: [1,2,3] -> n=3, S=6, S/n=2. \n          We don't have a 2? \n          Operation1: leave out the 1 -> then the other two: [2,3] -> average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5 -> becomes [2.5, 2.5, 1] -> total=6.\n          Operation2: leave out the 1 again? -> then the other two: [2.5,2.5] -> average=2.5 -> becomes [2.5,2.5,1] -> same.\n          Operation2: leave out one of the 2.5? -> then the other two: [2.5,1] -> average = (2.5+1)/2 = 1.75 -> becomes [1.75, 2.5, 1.75] -> total=6.\n          Now we have [1.75, 2.5, 1.75]. \n          Operation3: leave out the 2.5? -> then the other two: [1.75,1.75] -> average=1.75 -> becomes [1.75,1.75,1.75] -> done.\n\n          So it is possible? \n\n      But wait: the example [1,2,3] -> we made it [1.75,1.75,1.75] -> which is 1.75, but 6/3=2. So we did not get 2? \n\n      However, the problem does not require the final value to be 2? It only requires that all elements are equal. And 1.75 is the same for all. \n\n      But note: the total sum is preserved: 1.75*3 = 5.25? but we started with 6. \n\n      What happened? \n          Operation1: [1,2,3] -> leave out 1: then set [2,3] to (2+3)/2 = 2.5 -> becomes [2.5,2.5,1] -> total = 2.5+2.5+1 = 6.\n          Operation2: [2.5,2.5,1] -> leave out one 2.5: then set [2.5,1] to (2.5+1)/2 = 1.75 -> becomes [2.5, 1.75, 1.75] -> total = 2.5+1.75+1.75 = 6.\n          Operation3: [2.5,1.75,1.75] -> leave out the 2.5: then set [1.75,1.75] to (1.75+1.75)/2 = 1.75 -> becomes [1.75,1.75,1.75] -> total=5.25? -> wait, 1.75*3=5.25, but we had 6.\n\n      This is a contradiction. \n\n      Let me recalculate:\n          Operation1: \n              Array: [1,2,3] -> leave out 1 -> the other two: [2,3] -> average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5 -> so we set the two chosen to 2.5 -> new array: [2.5, 2.5, 1] -> total = 2.5+2.5+1 = 6.\n          Operation2: \n              Array: [2.5,2.5,1] -> leave out the first 2.5 -> then we take the other two: [2.5,1] -> average = (2.5+1)/2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75 -> then we set the chosen two to 1.75 -> new array: [2.5, 1.75, 1.75] -> total = 2.5+1.75+1.75 = 6.\n          Operation3:\n              Array: [2.5,1.75,1.75] -> leave out the 2.5 -> then we take the last two: [1.75,1.75] -> average = (1.75+1.75)/2 = 1.75 -> then we set the chosen two to 1.75 -> new array: [2.5, 1.75, 1.75] -> same as before? \n\n      Actually, we set the two chosen ones to 1.75, but they were already 1.75. So we didn't change the array. \n\n      Therefore, we are stuck at [2.5,1.75,1.75] and not [1.75,1.75,1.75]. \n\n      How did the example in the note work? \n          [1,2,3,4,5] -> they left out the third (which was 3) and set the others to (1+2+4+5)/4 = 12/4=3 -> then the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3]. \n\n      Why did that work? Because the element left out was already 3, and the average of the rest was 3. \n\n      So the key is: we can set the entire array to a constant in one operation if there is one element that is already the target (S/n) and the average of the rest is also S/n.\n\n      But note: if the entire array is already constant, then we are done.\n\n      What if we don't have an element equal to S/n? \n          We might be able to do multiple operations? \n\n      Let me try with [1,2,3] again: \n          We want to get to [2,2,2]. \n          Operation1: leave out the 2 -> then the rest: [1,3] -> average=2 -> then set them to 2 -> becomes [2,2,2] -> done.\n\n      So that worked. \n\n      Therefore, the condition is not just having one element equal to S/n. \n\n      How did we do it? \n          We left out the element that was already 2 (which is S/n=6/3=2) and set the others to 2. \n\n      So the condition is: there exists at least one element that is S/n? \n\n      In [1,2,3]: there is a 2 -> so we can do one operation leaving the 2 and setting the others to 2. \n\n      Then what about the example [1,2,3,4,5]? \n          S=15, S/n=3 -> and there is a 3 -> so we leave the 3 and set the others to 3.\n\n      Then what about the third and fourth test cases in the note? \n          The note says: \n              \"It's possible to show that it's impossible to make all elements equal in the third and fourth test cases.\"\n\n      Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one element that is S/n, then YES, else NO.\n\n      But wait: what if the array is [0,0,0,0]? then S=0, S/n=0 -> and we have zeros -> YES.\n\n      However, what if the array is [1,1,2]? \n          n=3, S=4, S/n=4/3 which is not an integer? \n          But the problem does not require integers. \n          However, the array must become [4/3,4/3,4/3]. \n          Is it possible? \n          Condition: we require at least one element that is 4/3. \n          The array [1,1,2] has no element 4/3? -> then NO.\n\n      But let's try: \n          Operation1: leave out one 1 -> then the other two: [1,2] -> average = 3/2 = 1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1.5,1] -> total=4.\n          Operation2: leave out the 1 -> then the other two: [1.5,1.5] -> average=1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1.5,1.5] -> done.\n\n      So we did it without having an element 4/3 initially? \n\n      Therefore, the condition is not that simple.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n      The invariant: the total sum S is preserved. So the final constant value must be S/n.\n\n      Now, we can do the operation arbitrarily many times. \n\n      Consider: \n          We can do an operation that leaves out an element that is already S/n? Then we set the others to S/n -> done.\n\n          But what if we don't have an element S/n? \n          We can try to create one? \n\n      How? \n          Operation: leave out an element a_i. Then we set the other n-1 to the average of the rest: (S - a_i) / (n-1). \n          Then the new array: \n              a_i remains.\n              the others become (S - a_i) / (n-1).\n\n          Now, we want to know: can we eventually get an element to be S/n? \n\n          Note: the new array has one element a_i and the rest (S - a_i) / (n-1). \n\n          We require that either a_i = S/n or (S - a_i) / (n-1) = S/n.\n\n          The condition (S - a_i) / (n-1) = S/n \n             => n*(S - a_i) = S*(n-1)\n             => nS - n*a_i = S*n - S\n             => -n*a_i = -S\n             => a_i = S/n.\n\n          So if we don't have an element S/n initially, then after the first operation we still don't have an element S/n? \n          Because the element we left out (a_i) is not S/n, and the others become (S - a_i)/(n-1) which is not S/n (by the above algebra). \n\n          Then we are stuck: we can never create an element that is S/n? \n\n      But wait: in the example [1,1,2] (n=3, S=4, S/n=4/3) we did:\n          Operation1: leave out the 2 -> then the others: [1,1] -> average=1 -> becomes [1,1,2] -> same? \n          Actually, we did: \n              Operation1: leave out one 1 -> then the others: [1,2] -> average= (1+2)/2 = 1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1.5,1] -> now we have an array: [1.5,1.5,1]. \n          Now, is 1.5 = 4/3? -> 1.5 = 3/2, 4/3\u22481.333 -> not equal. \n          Then we did: leave out the 1 -> then the others: [1.5,1.5] -> average=1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1.5,1.5] -> which is 1.5, and 1.5*3=4.5, but we started with 4? \n\n      This indicates an error in the example run. \n\n      Let me recalculate the total after the first operation for [1,1,2]:\n          Operation1: leave out the first 1 -> then we take the other two: [1,2] -> average = (1+2)/2 = 1.5 -> then we set the chosen ones to 1.5 -> so the array becomes [1.5, 1.5, 1] (because the first element was left out and remains 1? but we left out the first element, so the first element remains 1, and the other two become 1.5) -> [1, 1.5, 1.5] -> total = 1+1.5+1.5 = 4.\n\n          Then Operation2: leave out the 1 -> then we take the other two: [1.5,1.5] -> average=1.5 -> set them to 1.5 -> so the array becomes [1, 1.5, 1.5] -> same? \n\n      How did we get [1.5,1.5,1.5]? \n\n      Operation2: we leave out the 1 -> then we set the other two to the average of the other two? \n          The other two are 1.5 and 1.5 -> average=1.5 -> so we set them to 1.5 -> they were already 1.5 -> so the array remains [1,1.5,1.5]. \n\n      Then how did we get [1.5,1.5,1.5]? \n\n      We must leave out the 1 and set the other two to 1.5 -> but then the 1 remains. \n\n      Therefore, we cannot change the 1? \n\n      But note: we can choose which n-1 to leave out. \n          In the array [1,1.5,1.5]: \n          Operation: we can leave out the 1.5? \n          Then we take the other two: [1,1.5] -> average = (1+1.5)/2 = 1.25 -> then we set the chosen ones to 1.25 -> becomes [1.25,1.5,1.25] -> total=1.25+1.5+1.25=4.\n\n          Then we have [1.25,1.5,1.25]. \n          Then we leave out the 1.5 -> set the others to (1.25+1.25)/2 = 1.25 -> becomes [1.25,1.25,1.5] -> same as above.\n\n          Or leave out one 1.25 -> set the others to (1.25+1.5)/2 = 1.375 -> becomes [1.375,1.375,1.25] -> total=4.\n\n          We never get 4/3? \n\n      However, note: the final value must be 4/3 \u2248 1.333... \n\n      How can we get it? \n          We need to have an operation that sets the entire array to 4/3. \n          But the only way to set the entire array to 4/3 is to have one operation that leaves out an element that is 4/3 and sets the others to 4/3, or to have an operation that sets the entire array to 4/3 in one step? \n\n      But the operation only changes n-1 elements. \n\n      Therefore, we must have at least one element that is 4/3 at the time of the operation? \n\n      Since we start with integers and do rational operations, we can only get rational numbers. But 4/3 is rational. \n\n      However, the above example [1,1,2] we never got an element 4/3. \n\n      Therefore, it might be impossible? \n\n      But the note says the third and fourth test cases are impossible. \n\n      How about the known test cases:\n          Test case 1: [1,1,1] -> YES -> because we have 1 and 3/3=1 -> so we have an element 1.\n          Test case 2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> YES -> because we have 3 which is 15/5=3.\n          Test case 3: [1,2,3] -> n=3, S=6, S/n=2 -> we have a 2 -> YES? but the note says the third test case is impossible? \n\n      The note says: \n          \"It's possible to show that it's impossible to make all elements equal in the third and fourth test cases.\"\n\n      So there must be a third test case that is impossible. \n\n      Let me assume the third test case is [0, 0, 0, 0] -> then YES, so that's not it.\n\n      The problem says: \n          \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=200) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n      And the sample: \n          \"The first test case: all elements are already equal.\n           The second test case: ... \n           It's possible to show that it's impossible ... in the third and fourth test cases.\"\n\n      So the sample test cases are 4? \n\n      The sample input format: \n          t\n          n\n          a1 ... an\n          n\n          a1 ... an\n          ...\n\n      The note says: \n          \"In the first test case, all elements are already equal.\n           In the second test case, ... \n           ... impossible in the third and fourth test cases.\"\n\n      Therefore, the third test case might be [1,2,2,1]? \n\n      But let me try: \n          [1,2,2,1] -> n=4, S=6, S/n=1.5.\n          We have no element 1.5? \n          Operation: leave out a 1 -> then the others: [1,2,2] -> average = (1+2+2)/3 = 5/3 \u22481.666 -> becomes [5/3,5/3,5/3,1] -> then we leave out the 1 again -> the others: [5/3,5/3,5/3] -> average=5/3 -> becomes [5/3,5/3,5/3,1] -> stuck.\n\n          Or leave out a 5/3: then the others: [5/3,5/3,1] -> average = (5/3+5/3+1)/3 = (10/3+1)/3 = 13/9 \u22481.444 -> becomes [13/9,13/9,13/9,1] -> still not 1.5.\n\n      How can we get 1.5? \n          We need to have an element 1.5 at some point. \n\n      But note: the total sum is preserved: 6. \n          If we ever have an element 1.5, then the rest must sum to 6-1.5=4.5, and then we can set them to 4.5/3=1.5 -> done.\n\n      But how to get the first 1.5? \n          We start with [1,2,2,1]. \n          Operation: leave out a 2 -> then the others: [1,2,1] -> average = (1+2+1)/3 = 4/3 \u22481.333 -> becomes [4/3,4/3,4/3,2] -> total=4/3*3+2=4+2=6.\n          Then leave out the 2 -> then the others: [4/3,4/3,4/3] -> average=4/3 -> becomes the same.\n          Or leave out a 4/3: then the others: [4/3,4/3,2] -> average = (4/3+4/3+2)/3 = (8/3+2)/3 = (14/3)/3 = 14/9 \u22481.555 -> becomes [14/9,14/9,14/9,2] -> total=14/9*3+2 = 14/3+2 = 14/3+6/3=20/3\u22486.666 -> wait, that's not 6.\n\n      I see an error: when we leave out one 4/3, the chosen set is the other three: [4/3,4/3,2] -> average = (4/3+4/3+2)/3 = (8/3+6/3)/3 = (14/3)/3 = 14/9. Then we set these three to 14/9 -> the new array: [4/3, 14/9, 14/9, 14/9] -> total = 4/3 + 14/9*3 = 4/3 + 14/3 = 18/3=6.\n\n      Then we have [4/3, 14/9, 14/9, 14/9]. \n      Now, 4/3 = 12/9, which is not 1.5 (which is 13.5/9). \n\n      We can try to leave out the 12/9: then the others: [14/9,14/9,14/9] -> average=14/9 -> becomes [12/9, 14/9, 14/9, 14/9] -> same.\n\n      Or leave out a 14/9: then the others: [12/9,14/9,14/9] -> average = (12/9+14/9+14/9)/3 = (40/9)/3 = 40/27 \u22481.481 -> becomes [40/27,40/27,40/27,14/9] -> 14/9=42/27 -> so array: [40/27,40/27,40/27,42/27] -> total= (40*3+42)/27 = (120+42)/27=162/27=6.\n\n      Still not 1.5.\n\n      Therefore, it might be impossible.\n\n  Known solution for this problem: \n      After checking known problems (like CodeForces Round #783), the solution is: \n          It is possible if and only if there is at least one element that is not less than the average? \n          But that doesn't make sense.\n\n      Alternatively, known solution: \n          We can do it if either:\n            - all elements are already equal, or\n            - there exists at least one element that is greater than or equal to the average.\n\n      But wait, in [1,2,3] (n=3, average=2) -> we have 3>=2 -> then YES -> and we did it.\n\n      In [1,1,2] (n=3, average=4/3) -> we have 2>=4/3 -> then YES -> but we failed to do it in our simulation? \n\n      However, we did it in one move: \n          [1,1,2] -> leave out the 2 (which is>=4/3) -> then the average of the rest is (1+1)/2=1 -> then we set the chosen ones to 1 -> becomes [1,1,2] -> same as before.\n\n      But then we leave out one of the 1's and use the 2 and the other 1: \n          leave out a 1 -> then the chosen ones: [1,2] -> average=1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1,1.5] -> then leave out the 1 -> then the chosen ones: [1.5,1.5] -> average=1.5 -> becomes [1.5,1.5,1.5] -> done.\n\n      So it took two moves. \n\n      Therefore, the condition might be: if there is at least one element that is>= the average, then we can do it? \n\n      But in [0,0,0,0] -> average=0, and 0>=0 -> YES.\n      In [1,2,3,4,5] -> 5>=3 -> YES.\n      In the third test case that is impossible: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] (n=4, average=2.5) -> then we have 3>=2.5 and 4>=2.5 -> YES? \n\n      But the note says the third and fourth are impossible.\n\n      What if the array is [1,2,3,3] (n=4, average=9/4=2.25) -> then we have 3>=2.25 -> YES.\n\n      What if the array is [0,0,3,3] (n=4, average=6/4=1.5) -> then we have 3>=1.5 -> YES.\n\n      What if the array is [0,0,0,3] (n=4, average=3/4=0.75) -> then 3>=0.75 -> YES.\n\n      What if the array is [0,0,0,1] (n=4, average=0.25) -> then 1>=0.25 -> YES.\n\n      Then what is the impossible test case? \n\n      Known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces Educational Round 123, problem C): \n          https://codeforces.com/contest/1644/problem/C\n\n      But that's not the same.\n\n      After checking, a known problem is \"Everything Everywhere All But One\" (from a contest): \n          The solution is: if the maximum element is greater than the average, then we can use it to pull up the others? \n\n      But note: the total sum is preserved. \n\n      Another known problem: \n          https://codeforces.com/contest/1615/problem/C\n\n      But not exactly.\n\n      After research, the intended solution for the problem is: \n          It is possible if and only if there is at least one element that is>= the average. \n          But wait, in the array [1,2,3,4] (n=4, average=2.5) -> we have 3>=2.5 and 4>=2.5 -> so YES.\n\n      However, the note says the third and fourth test cases are impossible. \n\n      The sample test cases from the note: \n          Test case 1: [1,1,1] -> YES.\n          Test case 2: [1,2,4,5] (n=5? but the example says: [1,2,3,4,5] -> but then they used n=5 and left out the third) -> wait, the example in the note for the second test case is not provided in the input example for program2.py? \n\n      The input for program2.py: \n          t\n          n\n          a1 ... an\n\n      The note says for the second test case: \n          \"The first line of the test case contains a single integer n=5, and the second line contains [1,2,3,4,5]? -> but then they say they choose all elements except the third -> which is [1,2,4,5] -> average= (1+2+4+5)/4=3 -> then becomes [3,3,3,3,3] -> so it is done.\n\n      Therefore, the second test case is [1,2,3,4,5] -> and it is YES.\n\n      The note says the third and fourth are impossible. \n\n      What are the third and fourth? \n          The problem does not specify, but common examples of impossible cases are when the average is not achievable because there is no element>= the average? \n\n      But wait, the average might be not present, but we only require>=.\n\n      Let me try an example: [1,1,1,2] (n=4, average=5/4=1.25) -> then we have 2>=1.25 -> YES.\n\n      How about [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100] (n=10, average=10) -> then 100>=10 -> YES.\n\n      How about [1,1,1,1,100] (n=5, average=104/5=20.8) -> then 100<20.8? -> then NO.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is: if there exists at least one element a_i such that a_i>= S/n, then YES, else NO.\n\n      Let me test with the sample that the note says is impossible: \n          Test case 3: suppose [1,1,1,1,100] -> n=5, S=104, average=20.8, and 100<20.8 is false (100>=20.8) -> YES.\n\n      Then what if the array is [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5) -> average=1, and 1>=1 -> YES.\n\n      How about [1,1,...,1,2] (n=50, 49 ones and one 2) -> average = (49+2)/50 = 51/50=1.02 -> 2>=1.02 -> YES.\n\n      How about [0,0,...,0,1] (n=50) -> average=1/50=0.02 -> 1>=0.02 -> YES.\n\n      Then when is it NO? \n          Only when the maximum element is < the average? \n          But the average is S/n, and the maximum element is at least the average (because if all are < the average, then the sum would be < n*(S/n)=S, contradiction). \n\n      Therefore, there will always be at least one element>= the average? \n\n      This is by the pigeonhole principle: \n          If all elements are < S/n, then the sum < n*(S/n)=S, contradiction.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is always true? \n\n      But the note says there are impossible test cases.\n\n  Re-read the operation: \n      \"choose n-1 elements of the array and replace each of them with their arithmetic mean\"\n\n      This means: \n          Let the chosen set have sum = T, then the new value for each chosen element is T/(n-1).\n\n      Then the new array has one element unchanged and the others become T/(n-1).\n\n      The total sum becomes: unchanged element + T/(n-1) * (n-1) = unchanged element + T = unchanged element + (S - unchanged element) = S.\n\n      So the total sum is preserved.\n\n      Now, can we make the array constant? \n          We can if and only if the array is already constant, or if there is at least one element that is already S/n? \n\n      But wait, we can also create an element S/n in the process? \n\n      However, the earlier algebra showed: \n          In any operation, if we leave out an element a_i, then the new array has a_i and the others become (S - a_i)/(n-1).\n          For the array to become constant in the future, we must eventually have a_i = S/n for the left out element and (S - a_i)/(n-1)=S/n.\n\n          But we showed that (S - a_i)/(n-1)=S/n  <=> a_i = S/n.\n\n          Therefore, the only way to complete the process in the next operation is to have an element S/n at the time of the operation.\n\n      But what if we do more than one operation? \n          We might create an element S/n in an intermediate step? \n\n      How? \n          Suppose we do an operation and then in the new array we have an element that is S/n? \n          The new array has: \n             one element a_i (unchanged) and the others become (S - a_i)/(n-1).\n\n          We want either a_i = S/n or (S - a_i)/(n-1) = S/n.\n\n          The second condition is equivalent to a_i = S/n, as shown.\n\n          Therefore, after the operation, we have an element S/n only if a_i = S/n.\n\n          So if we don't have an element S/n initially, then after any number of operations, we never have an element S/n? \n\n      Therefore, the condition is: if there is at least one element in the initial array that is S/n, then we can do one operation (leaving that element) to set the others to S/n, and then we are done.\n\n      Otherwise, it is impossible.\n\n      Now, what about the example [1,2,3]? \n          S=6, S/n=2. \n          The array has a 2 -> YES.\n\n      [1,2,3,4,5]: has a 3 -> YES.\n\n      [1,1,2]: \n          S=4, S/n=4/3\u22481.333... -> does the array have an element exactly 4/3? -> no. \n          Therefore, NO.\n\n      But wait, the note says the second test case is [1,2,3,4,5] -> YES, and the third and fourth are impossible.\n\n      Therefore, the third test case might be [1,1,2] and the fourth might be another without an element exactly S/n.\n\n      However, in the example run for [1,1,2] we eventually made it to [1.5,1.5,1.5]? \n          But 1.5 != 4/3.\n\n      And the total sum of [1.5,1.5,1.5] is 4.5, not 4. \n\n      Therefore, that run was flawed.\n\n      In a correct run for [1,1,2]:\n          We cannot change the total sum. \n          We want to get [4/3,4/3,4/3]. \n          How to get there? \n            Operation1: we must leave out an element. \n            If we leave out a 1: then the others become (1+2)/2 = 1.5 -> array: [1, 1.5, 1.5] -> sum=1+1.5+1.5=4.\n            Now, we have no 4/3. \n            Operation2: if we leave out the 1: then the others become (1.5+1.5)/2 = 1.5 -> array: [1, 1.5, 1.5] -> no change.\n            If we leave out a 1.5: then the others become (1+1.5)/2 = 1.25 -> array: [1.25, 1.25, 1.5] -> sum=1.25+1.25+1.5=4.\n            Then we have [1.25,1.25,1.5] -> still no 4/3.\n            Operation3: if we leave out the 1.5: then the others become (1.25+1.25)/2 = 1.25 -> array: [1.25,1.25,1.5] -> no change.\n            If we leave out a 1.25: then the others become (1.25+1.5)/2 = 1.375 -> array: [1.375,1.25,1.375] -> sum=1.375+1.25+1.375=4.\n\n          We never get 4/3.\n\n      Therefore, it is impossible.\n\n      So the solution for program2.py is: \n          For each test case:\n            n = lines[i][0]\n            a = list of n integers\n            total = sum(a)\n            if total % n == 0:\n                average = total // n\n                if average in a:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n      But wait: what if the average is not an integer? \n          Then it is impossible to have an element exactly equal to the average (which is not an integer) in the integer array initially? \n          However, the array might have non-integer after operations, but initially we are only checking the initial array.\n\n      But the condition is: we require an element in the initial array that is exactly the average (which is total/n) -> which might not be an integer. \n\n      However, the array initially has integers. Therefore, if total/n is not an integer, then there is no integer in the array that is exactly total/n? \n\n      For example: [1,1,2] -> total=4, n=3, 4/3 is not an integer -> then there is no integer in the array that is 4/3.\n\n      Therefore, we can simply do:\n          if there exists an element a_i such that a_i * n == total, then YES, else NO.\n\n      Why? \n          Because the average is total/n, and we require a_i = total/n -> which is equivalent to a_i * n == total.\n\n      This avoids floating point.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n          for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n              n = lines[i][0]\n              a = lines[i+1]\n              total = sum(a)\n              found = False\n              for elem in a:\n                  if elem * n == total:   # because then elem = total/n\n                      found = True\n                      break\n\n              if found:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n      But note: the array might be large? n up to 50, so it's fine.\n\n      Let me test with the provided examples:\n          Example1: [1,1,1] -> n=3, total=3. \n             1*3==3 -> True -> YES.\n          Example2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> n=5, total=15.\n             1*5=5 !=15, 2*5=10 !=15, 3*5=15 -> YES.\n          Example3: [1,1,2] -> n=3, total=4.\n             1*3=3 !=4, 1*3=3 !=4, 2*3=6 !=4 -> NO.\n          Example4: [0,0,0,0] -> n=4, total=0.\n             0*4=0 -> YES.\n\n      This matches the note.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is to set `found = True` when we find an element such that `elem * n == total`, and then break out of the loop.\n\n  The code already has:\n      for elem in a:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n          if lhs == rhs:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  But wait, the existing code in the for-loop is different. It is checking:\n      lhs = elem\n      rhs = (sm - elem) / (n-1)\n      if lhs == rhs: ...\n\n  This is checking: elem == (sm - elem) / (n-1)\n      => elem * (n-1) = sm - elem\n      => elem * n = sm\n\n  So it is exactly the condition we want.\n\n  Therefore, we can simply set found = True and break.\n\n  So the TODO part is:\n      found = True\n      break\n\n  But note: the code already has a variable `found` initialized to False, and then after the loop it prints based on `found`.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in the for-loop is:\n\n      if lhs == rhs:\n          found = True\n          break\n\n  However, note: the condition uses floating point division? \n      rhs = (sm - elem) / (n-1) -> this is floating point.\n\n      But we are comparing lhs (which is an integer) to a float. \n\n      Example: [1,1,2] for the element 1: \n          lhs = 1\n          rhs = (4-1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5\n          1 == 1.5 -> False.\n\n      For the element 2:\n          lhs=2\n          rhs = (4-2)/2 = 2/2=1.0\n          2==1.0 -> False.\n\n      But we want to check: elem * n == sm? \n          For 1: 1*3=3 !=4 -> False.\n          For 2: 2*3=6 !=4 -> False.\n\n      So it is the same condition.\n\n      However, floating point might be inexact? \n\n      Since n is at most 50 and the numbers are integers between 0 and 100, we can do integer arithmetic: \n          if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n          then ...\n\n      But the condition is algebraically equivalent.\n\n      But to avoid floating point, we can change the condition to:\n          if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n\n      However, the problem says the array has integers, and sm is integer, so both sides are integer.\n\n      But the existing code uses floating point division. \n\n      Alternatively, we can do the integer condition without floating point.\n\n      But the problem says: \"the arithmetic mean (which doesn't have to be an integer)\" -> so the comparison of an integer to a float might be problematic.\n\n      However, the condition `lhs == rhs` is comparing an integer `elem` to a float `(sm-elem)/(n-1)`. \n\n      In Python, when comparing an integer to a float, Python will convert the integer to float and then compare. \n\n      But note: (sm-elem) might not be divisible by (n-1) -> then we get a float that is not an integer. And we are comparing to an integer `elem` -> they won't be equal.\n\n      And that matches the integer condition: we want to know if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem.\n\n      Therefore, we can leave it as is.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is to set `found = True` and break inside the if-statement.\n\n  The code for program2.py becomes:\n\n      for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n          n = lines[i][0]\n          a = lines[i+1]\n          sm = 0\n          for elem in a:\n              sm += elem\n          found = False\n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n          if found:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: the example [1,1,1] (n=3) -> \n      For an element 1: \n          lhs=1\n          rhs = (3-1)/2 = 2/2=1.0 -> 1==1.0 -> True -> found=True -> YES.\n\n  [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5): \n      For element 3: \n          lhs=3\n          rhs = (15-3)/4 = 12/4=3.0 -> 3==3.0 -> True -> YES.\n\n  [1,1,2] (n=3): \n      For 1: 1== (4-1)/2 -> 1==3/2=1.5 -> False.\n      For 1: same -> False.\n      For 2: 2== (4-2)/2=2/2=1.0 -> 2==1 -> False -> NO.\n\n  It matches.\n\n  However, note: the condition `lhs == rhs` might suffer from floating point inaccuracies? \n      But the numbers are small (n<=50, a_i between 0 and 100) and the division (sm-elem) by (n-1) is exact if (sm-elem) is divisible by (n-1). \n      But if it is not divisible, then we get a float that is not an integer, and then it won't be equal to an integer.\n\n      And if it is divisible, then the float is an integer and the comparison will be exact.\n\n  Therefore, it is safe.\n\n  But to be safe from floating point, we could do:\n          if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:   # but the numbers are integers, so we don't need it.\n\n  However, the problem says the integers are between 0 and 100, and n<=50, so (sm-elem) is at most 50*100=5000, and we are dividing by at most 49 -> the result is a float that might not be represented exactly? \n\n  Example: 1/3 is not exact in binary. \n\n  But we are comparing to an integer. The only time they can be equal is when the division yields an integer. \n\n  Therefore, we can do integer arithmetic:\n\n          if (sm - elem) % (n-1) == 0 and (sm - elem) // (n-1) == elem:\n\n  But note: the condition is: \n          (sm - elem) must be divisible by (n-1) and the quotient must be equal to elem.\n\n  This is equivalent to: \n          (sm - elem) = elem * (n-1)\n          => sm = elem * n\n\n  So we can simply do: \n          if elem * n == sm:\n\n  This is integer arithmetic and exact.\n\n  Therefore, we can change the condition to:\n\n          if elem * n == sm:\n\n  Then we avoid floating point.\n\n  How about the example [1,1,1] (n=3, sm=3):\n          1*3==3 -> True.\n\n  [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5, sm=15): \n          3*5==15 -> True.\n\n  [1,1,2] (n=3, sm=4): \n          1*3=3 !=4, 2*3=6 !=4.\n\n  So it is the same.\n\n  We can change the for-loop to:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              if elem * n == sm:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  This is simpler and avoids floating point.\n\n  But the existing code has:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n\n  We can remove these and do:\n\n          if elem * n == sm:\n\n  Or we can leave them and change the condition to `if elem * n == sm`? \n\n  Since the problem says to complete the missing part, and the TODO is inside the if-statement, we can simply set:\n\n          if ...: \n              found = True\n              break\n\n  But we are allowed to change the condition? \n\n  The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n  The missing code is the block inside the if-statement and the condition is already there? \n\n  But the condition might be flawed by floating point. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we should only output the missing part.\n\n  But the missing part is only the block inside the if-statement.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the entire for-loop for program2.py? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the format is a json with two completions.\n\n  We are to output the missing code for program1 and program2.\n\n  For program1, the missing code is the body of the for-loop that builds the prefix sum.\n\n  For program2, the missing code is the block inside the if-statement.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n      \"program2\": \"found = True\\n                break\"\n\n  But note: the program2 code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the block inside the for-loop and the if. We must match the existing indentation.\n\n  The existing code in program2.py for the for-loop and if is:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO part with two lines: \n          found = True\n          break\n\n  And the existing code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n  The code we see: \n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The next lines are indented by 4 (or 8) relative to the for? \n\n  In the provided code, the for-loop body is indented by 4, and the if body is indented by 8.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n          found = True\n          break\n\n  with 8 spaces of indentation for the two lines? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\n  We can write:\n\n          \"program2\": \"found = True\\n                break\"\n\n  But note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the if body? \n\n  Alternatively, we can count the spaces: \n          The line above: \"if lhs == rhs:\" is at the same level as \"lhs = elem\", which is 4 spaces from the for. Then the block inside the if should be 8 spaces.\n\n  But the sample code we are given for program2.py has:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  So we output:\n\n          \"found = True\\n                break\"\n\n  But to be safe, we can use the same indentation as the surrounding.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is two lines of code that are at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n  We'll assume 8 spaces for the block.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the two lines with the exact same indentation as the condition.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match.\n\n  Since the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code\", we output the two lines as they would appear in the program.\n\n  We'll use 8 spaces for the two lines? \n\n  But the existing code might be using tabs? \n\n  We'll assume spaces and 8 spaces for the inner block.\n\n  Therefore, the two lines are:\n\n          found = True\n          break\n\n  with each line having 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n  But in the context, the if-statement is already indented by 4, so the block inside is 8.\n\n  We output:\n\n          \"program2\": \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  But wait, that would be 8 spaces for each line? \n\n  However, the existing code has:\n\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces. So we replace that comment with:\n\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  So each line should be indented by 8 spaces relative to the outer for-loop? \n\n  But the for-loop is at 4, so the if is at 8? \n\n  Actually, the code we are given:\n\n  for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n      n = lines[i][0]\n      a = lines[i+1]\n\n      b = 123 + 23\n      c=  b + 1\n\n      sm = 0\n      for elem in a:\n          sm += elem\n\n      found = False\n      for elem in a:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n          if lhs == rhs:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for-loop over a is at 4 spaces, then the body of that for-loop is 8 spaces. The if is at 8 spaces, and the body of the if should be 12 spaces? \n\n  But the comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the code we are given has:\n\n          for elem in a:\n              lhs = elem\n              rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n              if lhs == rhs:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The \"lhs = elem\" is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop that is at 4). The if is at 8, and the body of the if is at 12.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code should be at 12 spaces:\n\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output:\n\n          \"program2\": \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  with 8 spaces per line? That would be 8 spaces from the beginning of the line? \n\n  But in the context, the code is at 12 spaces relative to the outer for-loop that is at 4. \n\n  We must output the code exactly as it should appear in the program.\n\n  The program has:\n\n          for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n              ... (indent 4)\n              for elem in a:\n                  ... (indent 8)\n                  if lhs == rhs:\n                      ... (indent 12)\n\n  So the two lines should be:\n\n                      found = True\n                      break\n\n  We'll output:\n\n          \"program2\": \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  But that has 8 spaces per line, which is 8 from the beginning of the line. But in the program, the entire block is indented by 4 (from the outer for) and then 4 more for the inner for, and then 4 more for the if -> total 12. \n\n  How do we represent 12 spaces? \n\n  We can count: \n          The existing comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n  But the problem does not show the exact spaces. \n\n  Alternatively, we can output the two lines with the same indentation level as the comment. \n\n  Since the comment is at 12 spaces, we output 12 spaces for each line? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is to be placed at the position of the TODO.\n\n  We'll output:\n\n          \"program2\": \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  with 12 spaces per line? \n\n  But 12 spaces is 12 characters. \n\n  However, the existing code in the problem for the TODO has 8 spaces from the outer for? \n\n  Let me count the spaces in the provided program2.py code:\n\n  The code:\n\n  for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n      n = lines[i][0]\n      a = lines[i+1]\n\n      b = 123 + 23\n      c=  b + 1\n\n      sm = 0\n      for elem in a:\n          sm += elem\n\n      found = False\n      for elem in a:\n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n          if lhs == rhs:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The outer for (for i) is at 0? \n  Then the inner for (for elem in a) is at 4.\n  Then the body of that for is at 8: \n          lhs = elem\n          rhs = ...\n          if ...: \n  Then the body of the if is at 12.\n\n  So we output 12 spaces for the two lines.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code\", so we output the string exactly as it should be inserted.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n          \"program2\": \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  with 12 spaces per line.\n\n  But note: the break should be at the same level.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem uses spaces.\n\n  We'll use 12 spaces: 12 spaces for each line.\n\n  However, 12 spaces is 12 characters. \n\n  But the existing code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n  The outer for: 0\n      inner: 4\n          for body: 8\n          if: 8\n          if body: 12\n\n  So we output:\n\n          line1: 12 spaces + \"found = True\"\n          line2: 12 spaces + \"break\"\n\n  We represent that as:\n\n          \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  But note: the existing code has a line after the if: \n          if found: \n              ...\n\n  So we don't need to worry about dedent.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n  {\n      \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n      \"program2\": \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n  }\n\n  But wait, the program1 part: the for-loop is:\n\n      for w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with the body. The body is one line: p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\n  We output that line.\n\n  However, the for-loop currently has no body. We are to add the body.\n\n  We output the body as a string.\n\n  But note: the for-loop might be intended to be a one-liner? \n\n  The existing code:\n\n      for w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the comment with the body.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1 is the string: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\n  But note: the next line is \"for _ in \" \"*q: ...\", which is at the same level as the for-loop. So the body of the for-loop must be indented.\n\n  We output the code that goes in the body: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\n  We do not include the indentation because the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the for-loop already has the structure.\n\n  Therefore, we output the string exactly as: \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\n  But note: the existing code has a colon at the end of the for-loop, so the body must be indented. We are only outputting the body.\n\n  So the final answer:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n        \"program2\": \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n      }\n\n  However, for program2, the two lines are at the same level, and we output them as two lines.\n\n  But note: the program2 code has a comment at the TODO, and we are replacing that comment with two lines.\n\n  We output the two lines with the same indentation as the comment would have.\n\n  We use 12 spaces for each line? \n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we deduced 12.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces and let the existing indentation handle it? \n\n  But the problem says to output the missing code.\n\n  We'll output the two lines with 12 spaces each.\n\n  But to be safe, we can count the spaces in the provided program2.py code for the line above: \n\n          \"          if lhs == rhs:\"\n\n  This line is at 8 spaces? \n\n  Then the body should be 12.\n\n  We'll do 12.\n\n  If the system uses 8, then it will be 8+4=12.\n\n  Therefore, we output as above."
