    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of 2-character strings (from letters 'a' to 'k') that differ in exactly one position.\nThe current code uses a counter and iterates over the strings. For each string \"ab\", it counts:\n  - For each letter l (in LETTERS) that is not equal to 'a', it adds the count of the string (l, b) that has been seen so far.\n  - Similarly, for each letter l that is not equal to 'b', we should add the count of the string (a, l) that has been seen so far.\n\nHowever, note that the current code only does the first part (for the first character) and the second part (for the second character) is incomplete.\n\nBut wait: the problem is that if we do both loops naively, we might overcount? Actually, note that the two loops are for two different positions.\n\nBut observe: the pair (ab, cb) is counted when we are processing \"ab\" and see that \"cb\" (with same second char) is in the counter? Actually, when processing \"cb\", we haven't seen \"ab\" yet? So we do it in the opposite order? Actually, the counter is being built as we go. So for each new string, we look at the previously seen strings.\n\nThe current code for the first character: for each string \"ab\", we look at all strings that have the same second character but a different first character. Similarly, we should look at all strings that have the same first character but a different second character.\n\nHowever, note that the current code for the second character is:\n\n            if l != b:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to add the count of the string (a, l) that has been seen so far. So we can do:\n\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut wait: this would count pairs that differ in the second character. However, note that the pair (ab, ac) would be counted when we are processing \"ab\" and then when we process \"ac\" we would also count \"ab\" again? But note: we are iterating in the order of the input. When we are at a string, we only consider the strings that have been seen before (because we update the counter after processing the current string? Actually, no: the counter is updated after we do the counting for the current string? Let me see:\n\nThe code does:\n        ctr[ab] += 1   -> this is done after we have used the counter for the current string? Actually, no: we are updating the counter at the beginning of the inner loop for the current string? Then we use the counter to count the pairs. But note: the current string is not in the counter when we are processing it? Actually, we update the counter at the beginning of the inner loop for the current string? Then we use the counter that already includes the current string? That would be wrong because we don't want to count the current string with itself.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: we are counting pairs (i, j) with i<j. So when we process the j-th string, we want to count the pairs (i, j) for i<j. Therefore, we should not have the current string in the counter when we are processing it. So the code is:\n\n        ctr[ab] += 1   -> this is done after we have used the counter? Actually, no: the code does:\n\n        for ab in islice(data, n):\n            a, b = ab\n            ctr[ab] += 1   -> this adds the current string to the counter immediately.\n\nThen we do the two loops. This means that when we are processing the current string, the counter already includes the current string. Then when we do:\n\n            for l in LETTERS:\n                if l != a:\n                    s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']   -> this would include the current string if l==a? but we skip l==a. However, what if there is another string that is the same as the current string? Then we would count the same string? But note: the current string is added in this iteration, so if there was a previous same string, then we would have counted it? Actually, we are counting pairs (i, j) and we want to count each pair once. But note: the current string is being compared with itself? We skip l==a and l==b, but what about the same string? \n\nActually, the same string would not be counted in the first loop because we skip l==a? But if we have two identical strings, say \"ab\" and then another \"ab\", then when we process the second \"ab\", we have:\n\n  ctr['ab'] is 1 (from the first one) and then we add the second one -> now ctr['ab'] becomes 2.\n\nBut then in the loops:\n\n  For the first loop: for l in LETTERS, if l != 'a', we look for strings of the form (l, 'b'). When l is 'a', we skip. But when we are at the second \"ab\", we are going to count the first \"ab\" in the second loop? Actually, no: the second loop is for the second character. For the second loop, we look for strings of the form (a, l) for l != b. When l is 'b', we skip. So we don't count the same string? \n\nBut wait: the same string is not going to be counted in either loop? Then how do we count pairs of identical strings? We don't, because identical strings do not differ in exactly one position? They differ in zero positions. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, the problem: the current code updates the counter before the loops. This means that when we are processing the current string, the counter already includes the current string. Then when we do:\n\n            for l in LETTERS:\n                if l != a:\n                    s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']   -> this includes the current string? because the current string is now in the counter? But the current string is (a,b) and we are looking for (l,b) with l != a. So the current string is not included? Similarly for the second loop: we are looking for (a, l) with l != b, so the current string is not included.\n\nTherefore, the update of the counter at the beginning is acceptable.\n\nSo the missing code for the second loop is:\n\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the string (a, l) might not be in the counter? Then ctr[f'{a}{l}'] would return 0. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing line is: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5. And the inner loops run 11 (because there are 11 letters) for each string. So 11*2 per string -> 22 per string, which is acceptable for 10^5 strings? Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so total operations would be 22 * 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are counting the number of trees (with a specific structure: each vertex i (from 2 to n) is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) for which vertex i is the centroid. The tree has n vertices (n is odd). The centroid is defined as a vertex whose removal leaves no subtree with more than (n-1)/2 vertices.\n\nThe given code already sets up factorials and inverse factorials, and then:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nout = [0] * n\n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n    base = fact[n - 1]\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nThen:\n\nrem = 0   \nfor i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n    oldrem = rem\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n    out[i] -= oldrem\n    rem %= MOD\n    out[i] %= MOD\n\nWe are missing the definition of the function `inv(x)`. We need to compute the modular inverse modulo MOD.\n\nWe can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function `invs(x)` is defined as:\n\ndef invs(x):\n    return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\nBut wait, what is `invs`? It seems to be: fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = ( (x-1)! ) / (x!) ) = 1/x.\n\nSo `invs(x)` returns the modular inverse of x? Actually, yes: because fact[x] = fact[x-1] * x, so invfact[x] = invfact[x-1] * inv(x) -> then fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = fact[x-1] * invfact[x-1] * inv(x) = inv(x) * (fact[x-1] * invfact[x-1]) = inv(x) * 1 = inv(x).\n\nBut note: the function `invs(x)` is defined in terms of factorials, which is a bit heavy? But we have precomputed factorials. However, we also have a direct `inv` function that we are missing.\n\nBut the code uses `inv` in the precomputation? Actually, we are missing the `inv` function. We need to define it.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the precomputation of `invfact` uses:\n\ninvfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n\nSo we must define `inv` for that.\n\nAlternatively, we could have computed the inverse factorials without the `inv` function by using the iterative method, but the code already uses the `inv` function for the last element.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the `inv` function.\n\nBut note: the problem says to output only the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nSo:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nFor program2.py: the missing function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py has a placeholder for the TODO. We must replace the entire TODO block? The TODO is:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with the function body? Actually, the function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the entire function body? Actually, we replace the TODO line with the return statement.\n\nBut note: the function must be properly indented.\n\nSo the completion for program2.py is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: we must be cautious about the modulus.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut we are in the context of MOD.\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\", \"program2\": \"def inv(x):\\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nBut note: the string for program1 is a single line? And for program2 is two lines? We must represent the newline as \\n.\n\nHowever, the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\nBut the missing code in program1 is one line? Actually, the TODO is in the inner loop. We are replacing the comment with the line: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nBut note: the line is indented? The current code for the second loop is:\n\n            if l != b:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO comment with the code. So the entire block becomes:\n\n            if l != b:\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut we are only outputting the missing line? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO. So for program1, we output the line: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we output the two lines of the function body? Actually, the function body is two lines: the function definition and the return. But note: the function definition is already there. We are only replacing the body? Actually, the function is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the body (the TODO line) with the return statement. So we output:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the indentation. The function body must be indented. So we output two lines? Actually, we can output the entire function body as a string with a newline? But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the function. However, the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the part that replaces the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is a single line. We are replacing that single line with two lines? Actually, the function body is two lines: the first line is the return statement, and the second line is the end of the function? Actually, the function body is one line? We can write:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function body must be one level indented. So we output:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut wait: the original function has a comment. We are replacing the comment with the return statement. So the function becomes:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nSo the missing code for program2 is the line: `return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)`\n\nBut note: the function body must be one line? Actually, we can write it as one line.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". For program2, the missing block is the body of the function.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output:\n\nFor program1: the string: \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nFor program2: the string: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut note: the program2 function body must be indented? Actually, the problem does not require us to output the indentation? Because the existing code has the function definition and the indentation for the body. We are only replacing the body. So we output the code that goes in the body, which is one line: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut to be safe, we output the exact code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is a single line, so we output one line for program2.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code for program2 is the body of the function, which is one line.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\", \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nBut wait: in program1, the line we are outputting is exactly: `s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']`\n\nBut note: the string contains single quotes and braces. We must escape if we are writing a string? Actually, the problem says: output the missing code. We are outputting the code as a string in JSON. So we must escape the quotes? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we are writing JSON. So we must use valid JSON.\n\nIn the JSON string, we must escape the double quotes? But the code uses single quotes. So we can write:\n\n\"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nBut the string has a single quote and also braces. We don't need to escape single quotes in JSON? Actually, in JSON, a string can contain single quotes without escaping. Only double quotes must be escaped.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double quotes for the entire JSON and then use single quotes inside without problem.\n\nBut note: the code has an f-string: f'{a}{l}'. The braces in the f-string are not escaped? They are part of the code.\n\nSo the JSON string for program1 is: \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\"\n\nBut wait: the f-string has two braces: one for the expression and one for the closing. How do we represent that? Actually, we just write it as is.\n\nSimilarly, for program2: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut note: the modulus operation is done by pow? The pow function with three arguments: base, exponent, modulus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\",\n  \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says to output only the JSON without any additional information.\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\", \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nHowever, let me test the program2 code: the function `inv` is used to compute the inverse of the factorial at MAX-1. Then we compute the inverse factorials backwards. The function `invs` is defined and used. The rest of the code is given.\n\nBut note: the function `inv` must be defined before it is used in the precomputation of `invfact`.\n\nSo the code for program2.py after completion:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)   # This is the completed line\n\nMAX = 10 ** 6\n\nfact = [1]\nfor i in range(1, MAX):\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\ninvfact = [1] * (MAX)\ninvfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\nfor i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n    invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n... and so on.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nSimilarly, for program1.py, the completed inner loop:\n\n        for ab in islice(data, n):\n            a, b = ab\n            ctr[ab] += 1\n            for l in LETTERS:\n                if l != a:\n                    s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n                if l != b:\n                    s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, and the inner loop runs 11*2 = 22 per string, so 22 * (total n) <= 22 * 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
