Example 2: \"abc\" -> k=3, no consecutive duplicates -> then we build pos: \n                a: [0]\n                b: [1]\n                c: [2]\n            then we skip because each appears only once -> then we output \"YES\".

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the sum of weights eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the sum of weights eaten by Bob (from the right). We are allowed to have Alice eat a contiguous segment from the left and Bob eat a contiguous segment from the right (without overlapping). The goal is to maximize the total number of candies (i.e., the count) while having the same total weight.\n\nApproach for program1.py:\nWe use two pointers: one starting at the left (for Alice) and one at the right (for Bob). We maintain two running sums: lsum (for Alice) and rsum (for Bob). We move the pointers as follows:\n- If lsum < rsum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the new candy to lsum.\n- If rsum < lsum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the new candy to rsum.\n- If they are equal, we have a candidate: the total candies eaten so far is (i+1) from the left and (n - j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n - j). We record this in best. Then we try to continue by moving both pointers? But note: we can only have one contiguous segment from the left and one from the right. However, the problem allows us to have Alice eat any contiguous segment from the left (starting at the very left) and Bob from the right (starting at the very right). The note in the problem says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left\" meaning she eats the first three, and Bob eats the first three from the right (i.e., the last three). \n\nBut note: the example 4: \nAlice: [7, 3, 20] -> total 30\nBob: [10, 8, 11, 1] -> total 30\nSo the total candies is 3+4 = 7.\n\nIn the code, we have:\n  i starts at 0, j at n-1.\n  lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n\nThen we have a while loop (i < j). When the sums are equal, we record the total candies: (i+1) + (n - j). Then we can try to move both pointers? Because we might get a longer sequence? But note: if we move one pointer, we break the equality. However, we can try to move both? Actually, we can move both and then continue. Why? Because we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence with the same total. But note: we are allowed to have non-overlapping and contiguous from the ends.\n\nBut the problem: if we move both, then we are effectively starting a new segment? Actually, we are extending the segments. However, the condition is that we must have the same total. So after we record the current best, we can move the left pointer (or both) to see if we can get another equal segment? But note: we are not required to have the same total for the entire rest? Actually, we are only allowed to have one contiguous segment for Alice and one for Bob. So we cannot skip candies in the middle. Therefore, when we have an equality, we can record the total number of candies and then we can break? But wait, we might have a possibility of having a larger total by moving both? \n\nActually, we can do: when we have an equality, we record the total candies (i+1 + n - j) and then we move the left pointer (and update lsum) and then continue? But then we break the equality. Alternatively, we can move both pointers? Because if we move only one, the sums become unequal. However, we can try to move both to see if we can get another equality? But note: we are allowed to have only one contiguous segment. So we are building the segments from the ends. \n\nBut observe: the problem does not require that the segments are adjacent? They just cannot overlap. So the entire set of candies is partitioned into three: Alice's, the middle (uneaten), and Bob's. We are free to choose how much to take from the left and how much from the right. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies (i.e., the sum of the lengths of the two segments) under the condition that the total weights of the two segments are equal.\n\nSo we can do: when we have an equality, we record the total candies (i+1 + n - j) and then we move the left pointer (so we add the next candy to Alice) and then we continue? But then Bob's segment is still the same? Actually, we are going to then adjust by moving the right pointer if necessary? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total of the two segments must be equal. So we are free to adjust both. However, the method we are using is a two-pointer that starts at the ends and expands inward until the sums are equal. We want to record every time the sums are equal and then take the maximum total candies.\n\nSo in the else block (when lsum == rsum), we should:\n   best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))   # because Alice has eaten [0, i] (i+1 candies) and Bob has eaten [j, n-1] (n - j candies)\n   Then we move both pointers? Actually, we can move one? But if we move only one, then the sums become unequal. However, we can move both to see if we can get a longer total? But note: moving both means we are adding one candy to Alice and one to Bob. But we are not forced to do so. Alternatively, we can move one of them? \n\nBut note: we are traversing the entire array? The problem says the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do a while loop until i < j.\n\nHowever, if we move both, we can avoid missing a longer sequence? Actually, we can do:\n\n   best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n   Then we move the left pointer: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum. And then we continue? But then we break the equality? We can also move the right pointer? Actually, we can do:\n\n   We have two possibilities: we can move the left pointer or the right pointer? But the problem is that we are trying to cover the entire array? \n\nAlternatively, we can do: when we have an equality, we record and then we move the left pointer (so we break the equality) and then let the next iteration adjust? But we must be cautious: we might miss a longer sequence? \n\nActually, we can do: when we have an equality, we record and then we move the left pointer (because if we move the right pointer, we might get stuck? or vice versa). But note: we are allowed to move both? Actually, we can move both at the same time? \n\nBut the example: \n   [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n   Initially: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal, then we record 1+1 = 2.\n   Then we move both: i becomes 1, j becomes 4. Then lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equal, then we record 2+2=4.\n   Then we move both: i becomes 2, j becomes 3. Then lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> equal, then we record 3+3=6.\n   Then i=3, j=2 -> break.\n\nBut what if we don't move both? Then we might get stuck? \n\nAlternatively, we can move one of them? But then we might miss the opportunity to get a longer sequence? \n\nActually, the problem: we are allowed to take any contiguous segments from the left and right. So we are not forced to take adjacent segments? But the two segments must be contiguous from the ends? \n\nSo the segments are [0, i] and [j, n-1] for some i and j with i < j. We want to maximize (i+1) + (n - j) such that the sum of [0,i] equals the sum of [j, n-1].\n\nWe can do: when we have an equality, we record and then we move the left pointer? But then we break the equality? Then the algorithm will then adjust by moving the right pointer? But we might get the same equality again? \n\nActually, we can move both? Because if we move only one, we break the equality and then we have to adjust by moving the other until we get an equality again? But moving both is safe? \n\nBut note: we are not allowed to skip candies? So we must take contiguous from the ends. Therefore, we can move both? \n\nSo in the else block:\n   best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n   lsum += arr[i+1]   # but we are going to move i and j? \n   i += 1\n   rsum += arr[j-1]\n   j -= 1\n\nBut wait, what if after moving both, we break the condition? Then we continue the while loop and adjust? \n\nBut what if we are at the last step? For example, when i+1 == j? Then we break the loop? \n\nBut note: we must not let i and j cross. \n\nHowever, we must be cautious: if we move both, then we are effectively adding one candy to Alice and one to Bob. But we are not forced to do so? We could also move only one? \n\nBut the problem: we are free to choose the segments arbitrarily. So we can choose to take one more from the left and then one more from the right? \n\nBut the algorithm: we are trying to traverse the entire array? \n\nAlternatively, we can do: when we have an equality, we record and then we move the left pointer? Why? Because we want to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note: if we move the left pointer, we break the equality, but then we might get a chance to get a larger total? \n\nActually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known as the \"two pointers\" for the \"candy\" problem) does:\n\n   best = 0\n   left = 0\n   right = n-1\n   lsum = 0\n   rsum = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            lsum += arr[left]\n            left += 1\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            rsum += arr[right]\n            right -= 1\n        else:\n            # when equal, we record the current total: left + (n-1-right) \n            best = left + (n-1 - right)   # but note: we haven't added the current candy? Actually, we are about to add? \n\nBut wait, in the above, we start with zeros. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   lsum = arr[0]\n   rsum = arr[-1]\n   i = 0\n   j = n-1\n   best = 0\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because we have taken [0,i] and [j, n-1]\n            # then we move both? \n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:   # to avoid index out of bounds\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            # but if we break the loop, we don't add\n        elif lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            else:\n                break\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\nBut then we might miss an equality that occurs when we don't move both? \n\nActually, we can do:\n\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n            # We move both to see if we can get a longer sequence? \n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n        elif lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            else:\n                break\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\nBut note: we might have an equality at the next step without moving both? \n\nAlternatively, we can do without the inner breaks? We can just check at the beginning of the loop? \n\nBut the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test case? But note: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move both, and then we get an equality again? Then we record again? And we take the last one? But we want the maximum total candies. So we should take the maximum over all equalities? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   best = 0\n   i = 0\n   j = n-1\n   lsum = arr[0]\n   rsum = arr[n-1]\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum == rsum:\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total\n            # Then we move both to see if we can get a larger total? \n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n        elif lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: when we move both in the equality case, we are effectively starting a new segment? Actually, we are extending the segments: Alice now includes the next candy and Bob the next candy from the right. Then we check again.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we break? Then we have recorded the last equality? But we want the maximum total. However, the total candies in the equality case is increasing? Actually, no: the total candies in the next equality would be (i+1) + (n - j) = (i0+2) + (n - (j0-1)) = (i0+1+1) + (n - j0 + 1) = (i0+1) + (n - j0) + 2. So it increases by 2. Therefore, the last equality we get would be the largest? \n\nBut wait: what if we have an equality at two different positions? For example, we might have an equality at (i, j) and then at (i+2, j-2) and the total candies at the first is (i+1)+(n-j) and the second is (i+3)+(n - (j-2)) = (i+1+2) + (n - j + 2) = (i+1)+(n-j)+4. So the second is larger. Therefore, we want the last one? \n\nBut what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we don't get an equality again? Then we have recorded the last one? But we also had the previous one? We want the maximum. So we should record every time we have an equality? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if lsum == rsum:\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current best, but we might get a better one?\n        # Then we move both to try to get a larger total? \n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut then we overwrite the best? We should take the maximum? \n\nActually, we can do:\n\n   if lsum == rsum:\n        current = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        if current > best:\n            best = current\n        # Then move both? \n\nBut note: the total candies in the next equality would be larger? Because we are adding one candy to Alice and one to Bob? So the total increases by 2. Therefore, the last equality we get (if any) would be the largest. So we can just record the last one? \n\nBut what if we have two different equalities? For example, we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an equality again? Then the second one is larger. So we want the last one? \n\nBut what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we don't get an equality again? Then the best we have is the one at (i, j). But we also had the one at (i, j) and then we moved and then we broke? \n\nActually, we are not missing: we record the first one, then we move and then we break? Then we have the first one. But we might have a later one that is larger? \n\nBut note: we are moving both only when we have an equality? So we are effectively stepping through the array. \n\nHowever, the problem: we might have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an equality at (i+1, j-1) and then we move both and then we get an equality at (i+2, j-2) and so on. The total candies for the first equality: (i+1)+(n-j). For the next: (i+2)+(n - (j-1)) = (i+1+1) + (n - j + 1) = (i+1)+(n-j)+2. Then the next: (i+3)+(n - (j-2)) = (i+1)+(n-j)+4. So the last one is the largest. Therefore, we can break when we move both and then we don't get an equality? But we don't know the future. \n\nSo we should record every time we have an equality? \n\nBut note: the total n is 200000, and the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we can record every time. \n\nBut we can also note: the total candies is increasing by 2 each time we move both? So the last equality we get is the maximum. Therefore, we can just record the last one? \n\nBut what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an equality at (i+1, j-1) and then we move both and then we get an equality at (i+2, j-2) and then we break? Then the last one is the largest. \n\nBut what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an inequality? Then we have to adjust? Then we might get an equality again? But that equality would be at a later point? And the total candies would be less? \n\nFor example: \n   [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n   n=5\n   i=0, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal, record 1+ (5-4)=1+1=2.\n   Then we move both: i=1, j=3. Then lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equal, record (1+1) + (5-3) = 2+2=4.\n   Then we move both: i=2, j=2 -> break (i<j fails). So we have best=4.\n\nBut what if: \n   [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1] \n   We get:\n        i=0, j=5: 1==1 -> record 1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=4: 1+2=3, 1+2=3 -> record 2+2=4.\n        then i=2, j=3: 3+3=6, 3+3=6 -> record 3+3=6.\n        then i=3, j=2 -> break.\n\nBut what if we have:\n   [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n   We want: \n        Alice: [1,2,3] = 6\n        Bob: [1,3,2,1] = 7 -> not equal.\n\n        Or: \n        Alice: [1,2,3,1] = 7\n        Bob: [1,3,2,1] = 7 -> total candies = 4+4=8.\n\n        How does the algorithm run?\n        i=0, j=7: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal, record 1+1=2, then move both: i=1, j=6.\n        lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equal, record 2+2=4, then move both: i=2, j=5.\n        lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> equal, record 3+3=6, then move both: i=3, j=4.\n        lsum=6+1=7, rsum=6+1=7 -> equal, record 4+4=8, then move both: i=4, j=3 -> break.\n\n        So we get 8.\n\n        But what if we have an equality that is not consecutive? \n\n        Actually, the algorithm moves both only when we have an equality? So we are stepping through the array. \n\n        But what if we have:\n            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n            n=6\n            i=0, j=5: 1==1 -> record 1+1=2, then move both -> i=1, j=4: 2==2 -> record 2+2=4, then move both -> i=2, j=3: 3==3 -> record 3+3=6, then break.\n\n        So we get 6.\n\n        But what if we have:\n            [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n            We want: \n                Alice: [1,2] = 3\n                Bob: [1,1] = 2 -> not equal.\n\n                Alice: [1,2,1] = 4\n                Bob: [1,1] = 2 -> not.\n\n                Alice: [1,2,1,2] = 6\n                Bob: [1,1] = 2 -> not.\n\n                Alice: [1] = 1\n                Bob: [1] = 1 -> total=2.\n\n                But also: \n                Alice: [1,2,1] = 4\n                Bob: [2,1,1] = 4 -> total=3+3=6.\n\n            How does the algorithm run?\n                i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> record 2, then move both: i=1, j=4: lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> now lsum>rsum? \n                Then we move j: j=3, rsum=2+2=4 -> now lsum=3, rsum=4 -> then we move i: i=2, lsum=3+1=4 -> now lsum==rsum? -> record (2+1) + (6-3) = 3+3=6.\n                Then move both: i=3, j=2 -> break.\n\n            So we get 6.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            i=0, j=n-1\n            lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n            best = 0\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum == rsum:\n                    best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because we have taken [0..i] and [j..n-1]\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                elif lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n        But note: when we are in the equality case, we move both and then we break if i>=j? \n\n        However, we can avoid the inner breaks by:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum == rsum:\n                    best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                    # We move both\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i >= j:\n                        break\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                elif lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But what if i becomes j? Then we break? \n\n        However, we must be cautious: when we are in the equality case, we move both and then we break if i>=j? \n\n        But what if we have an even number of candies? \n\n        Actually, we break the loop when i>=j. \n\n        But note: when we move both, we do:\n            i = i+1, j = j-1\n            then if i>=j, we break. Then we don't update the sums? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then i==j? Then we break. \n\n        But what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then i>j? Then we break.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, there is a problem: in the non-equality cases, we move one pointer and then we break if i>=j? \n\n        But we do: \n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                if i < j: \n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But we can do without the inner condition? Because if i>=j, we break the loop? \n\n        Actually, we can restructure the loop to avoid the inner breaks? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum == rsum:\n                    best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                elif lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]   # but if i==j? then we break? but we are in the loop condition? \n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But what if in the non-equality case, we do i+=1 and then i becomes j? Then we break? But we have already added arr[i]? And then we break? \n\n        But the condition of the loop is i<j, so when we do i+=1 and then i==j, we break? But we have already updated lsum? Then we break? \n\n        But note: we are updating lsum even when i==j? That is not allowed because we are adding a candy that is in the middle? And then we break? \n\n        But the problem: the candy at the middle is not eaten by either? \n\n        Actually, we are not allowed to have overlapping. So if i==j, we break? \n\n        But we have updated lsum? Then we break? \n\n        However, we are not going to use that lsum? \n\n        But the next iteration we break? \n\n        So we can do without the inner breaks? \n\n        But what if we do:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum == rsum:\n                    best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                elif lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]   # even if i becomes j? \n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But if i becomes j, then we break the next iteration? \n\n        However, we might get an index out of bounds? \n\n        For example: \n            n=2: [1,2]\n            i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1 -> then we do lsum += arr[1] -> lsum=3, but then i=1, j=1 -> break the loop? \n\n        But we break the loop at the next iteration? \n\n        But we have updated lsum? But we don't use it? \n\n        But we break? \n\n        So it's safe? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at the last step? \n\n        Actually, we break the loop when i>=j. \n\n        However, we must be cautious: when we update lsum or rsum, we are using the current i or j? \n\n        But note: we start with i=0 and j=n-1. Then we update by moving i to i+1 or j to j-1. Then we add the candy at the new index. \n\n        But when we move i to i+1, we are including the candy at i+1? \n\n        This is the standard two-pointer. \n\n        But the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe. \n\n        However, we must record the best only when we have an equality? \n\n        But what if we break without having recorded an equality? Then best remains 0? \n\n        That is acceptable because if there is no non-zero equality, then 0 is the answer? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. And the maximum total number of candies. \n\n        Example 3: [100] -> no solution? because Alice and Bob must eat at least one candy? But they cannot: if Alice eats the only candy, Bob has nothing to eat? So the answer is 0. \n\n        So we start best=0, and if we never have an equality, we output 0. \n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n            for s in inp:\n                n = int(s[0])\n                arr = [int(x) for x in s[1].split()]\n\n                i = 0\n                j = n-1\n                lsum = arr[i]\n                rsum = arr[j]\n\n                best = 0\n                while i < j:\n                    if lsum == rsum:\n                        best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total\n                        i += 1\n                        j -= 1\n                        if i < j:\n                            lsum += arr[i]\n                            rsum += arr[j]\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    elif lsum < rsum:\n                        i += 1\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                    else:\n                        j -= 1\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n\n                print(best)\n\n        But wait: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we break? Then we break? \n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we are at i and j that are adjacent? Then we break? \n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we are at i and j that are the same? Then we break? \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: [1] -> n=1: \n            i=0, j=0 -> the loop condition i<j fails? so we break? then best=0 -> output 0. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: [1,1] -> \n            i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: best = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2.\n            then i becomes 1, j becomes 0 -> break. Then output 2. Correct.\n\n        Example 3: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> we get 6 as above. Correct.\n\n        Example 4: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n            We want: Alice: [7,3,20] = 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] = 30 -> total candies=3+4=7.\n\n            How does the algorithm run?\n                i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> lsum>rsum -> j becomes 6: rsum=1+11=12 -> lsum=7, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 1: lsum=7+3=10 -> lsum=10, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> i becomes 2: lsum=10+20=30, rsum=12 -> lsum>rsum -> j becomes 5: rsum=12+8=20 -> lsum=30, rsum=20 -> lsum>rsum -> j becomes 4: rsum=20+10=30 -> now lsum==rsum? -> best = (2+1) + (8-4) = 3+4=7.\n                Then we move both: i becomes 3, j becomes 3 -> break.\n\n            So we get 7. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we use this algorithm.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the initial lsum and rsum are set to the first and last element. Then we start the loop.\n\n        But what if n==1? Then we skip the loop and output 0. Correct.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is the entire else block? Actually, the TODO is in the else block. But the current code has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO block? But the current code has the while loop and the if-elif-else. The else block is for the equality case.\n\n        We are to write the code for the else block? \n\n        But note: the current code has:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we are to write the else block? \n\n        We write:\n\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But note: we must break the loop when we break? \n\n        However, the while loop condition is i<j. So if we break in the else, we break the loop? \n\n        But we are in the else block, and then we break? Then we break the while loop? \n\n        But what if we don't break? Then we continue the while loop? \n\n        Actually, we break only if i>=j? \n\n        But if we break, we break the while loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i >= j:\n                    break\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        This is equivalent.\n\n        But note: we must update best every time we have an equality? \n\n        However, the problem: we want the maximum total candies. And as we move both, the total increases? So we can just record the last one? \n\n        But what if we have multiple equalities? We want the maximum? \n\n        Actually, the total candies in the next equality would be larger? So we can just record the last one? \n\n        But the example: \n            [1,2,1,2,1,1] -> we had two equalities: one at (0,5) with total=2, and then at (2,3) with total=6. We want 6. \n\n        But if we only record the last one, we get 6. \n\n        However, in the code above, we update best every time we have an equality? \n\n        But the problem: we are updating best to the current one? But we want the maximum? \n\n        Actually, the total candies in the next equality is larger? So the last one is the maximum? \n\n        Therefore, we can simply assign best = (i+1)+(n-j) in the else block? \n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get an equality again? Then we update best again? \n\n        And the last one is the largest? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # we update best to the current total, but the next one might be larger? \n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But then if we have two equalities, we overwrite best? \n\n        For [1,1,1,1,1,1]:\n            First equality: i=0, j=5 -> best = 1+1=2.\n            Then we move to i=1, j=4 -> then we have an equality again? Then we set best = 2+2=4.\n            Then we move to i=2, j=3 -> then we set best = 3+3=6.\n\n        So we get 6. \n\n        But we want the maximum? So we should take the maximum over all equalities? \n\n        However, the total candies is increasing? So the last one is the maximum. \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total, but we are going to try to get a larger one?\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But note: we are updating best to the current one, but we might get a larger one later? \n\n        Actually, we are going to update best again if we get another equality? \n\n        So we are not storing the maximum? We are storing the last one? \n\n        But the last one is the largest? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # we record the current one, and then we move on? \n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we don't get an equality again? Then we have recorded the last one? But we had a previous one that was smaller? \n\n        But we want the maximum? So we should record the maximum? \n\n        Therefore, we should do:\n\n            else:\n                current = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                if current > best:\n                    best = current\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But note: the total candies in the next equality would be current+2? So if we get an equality again, we will update best to current+2, which is larger. \n\n        But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we break? Then we have updated best to the last one? \n\n        But what if we have two equalities and the first one is larger? That is impossible because the total candies increases by 2 each time we move both? \n\n        Therefore, the last one is the largest. So we can just record the last one? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an inequality? Then we break? Then we have recorded the last one? But the last one was the one we just had? \n\n        Actually, we record the one at (i, j) and then we move both and then we break? \n\n        But we did not get an equality at the new (i, j)? \n\n        So we have recorded the one at the old (i, j). \n\n        Therefore, we don't need to compare? We can simply update best to the current one? \n\n        But we want the maximum? So if we have multiple equalities, we want the last one? \n\n        However, we are updating best every time we have an equality? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # we update best to the current one, and then we move both? \n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But then if we have two equalities, we update best to the second one? \n\n        And the second one is larger? \n\n        So we output the last one? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at (0,5) and then at (1,4) and then at (2,3)? We update best to 2, then 4, then 6? Then we output 6? \n\n        So it's the maximum? \n\n        Therefore, we can do that. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we want the maximum. \n\n        Therefore, the code for the else block is:\n\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\n        However, we must break the loop when we break? \n\n        But the while loop condition is i<j, so if we break, we break the loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do without the break? Because the next iteration will break? \n\n        But we are updating i and j: if we set i=3 and j=2, then the next iteration condition i<j fails? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        Then the while loop condition will break if i>=j? \n\n        But what if i==j? Then we break? \n\n        But we are not adding the candy at i (which is j) to either? \n\n        So it's safe. \n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            else:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But note: we must not update the sums if i>=j? Because then we would be adding the same candy? or going out of bounds? \n\n        For example: \n            n=2: [1,1]\n            i=0, j=1: we do best = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2.\n            then i becomes 1, j becomes 0 -> then we check if i<j? 1<0 is false -> so we skip the update. Then the loop condition i=1, j=0 -> i<j fails -> break.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the initial lsum and rsum are set to the first and last. Then we start the loop.\n\n        This is the standard solution for the problem.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        Description: We are to determine if a string s is perfectly balanced. The condition: for every non-empty substring t of s, and for every two characters u and v that are present in s, the absolute difference between the frequency of u and the frequency of v in t is at most 1.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". \n\n        But note: the condition must hold for every substring t and for every pair of characters (u,v) that appear in the entire string s? \n\n        But the example: \"abb\" is not balanced because for the substring \"bb\", and for the pair (a,b): \n            frequency of a in \"bb\" is 0, frequency of b is 2 -> |0-2|=2>1.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        Observation: \n        The condition must hold for every substring t and for every pair of characters (u,v) that appear in s. \n\n        But note: if a character does not appear in the substring t, then its frequency is 0. \n\n        Therefore, the condition implies that in every substring t, the frequencies of any two characters that appear in the entire string s must not differ by more than 1. \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\", meaning the entire string s. \n\n        But what if u or v does not appear in t? Then the frequency is 0. \n\n        So the condition becomes: for every substring t, and for every two characters u and v that appear in s, |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n        This is a very strong condition.\n\n        Let's denote the entire string s. Let the set of distinct characters in s be D.\n\n        Consider a substring t. For any two characters u, v in D, we require |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n        What does this imply?\n\n        Consider the entire string s: then for every u, v in D, |f_s(u)-f_s(v)|<=1.\n\n        But also, consider every contiguous substring.\n\n        However, note the problem says \"non-empty substring\", so we must consider every contiguous substring.\n\n        How to check for a given string s?\n\n        Insight: \n        The condition is very strong. In fact, the only possible perfectly balanced strings are those that have at most two distinct characters? \n\n        But the example \"abc\" is perfectly balanced? \n\n        However, consider the substring \"a\": \n            f_t(a)=1, f_t(b)=0, f_t(c)=0 -> |f_t(a)-f_t(b)|=1, |f_t(a)-f_t(c)|=1, |f_t(b)-f_t(c)|=0 -> all <=1 -> okay.\n\n        Substring \"ab\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |a-b|=0, |a-c|=1, |b-c|=1 -> okay.\n\n        Substring \"abc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n        Substring \"b\": \n            a:0, b:1, c:0 -> |a-b|=1, |a-c|=0, |b-c|=1 -> okay.\n\n        So \"abc\" is okay.\n\n        But what about \"aab\"? \n            Entire string: a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay for the entire string.\n            Substring \"aa\": \n                a:2, b:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not okay.\n\n        So \"aab\" is not balanced.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails if there is a substring that has two of one letter and zero of another? \n\n        In fact, the condition fails if there is a substring that has two of one letter and zero of a letter that appears in the entire string? \n\n        How to check without enumerating all substrings? \n\n        Note: the total length of all strings over test cases is <= 200000.\n\n        Insight: \n        The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. But note: the condition is very strong. \n\n        Actually, we can prove that the string s must not contain any substring of the form \"aa\" (two consecutive same characters) if there is at least one other character in the entire string? \n\n        Why? \n        Consider the substring \"aa\": \n            For the entire string s, if there is a character 'b' (or any other character) that appears in s, then in the substring \"aa\", the frequency of 'a' is 2 and the frequency of 'b' is 0 -> |2-0|=2>1 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then we cannot have two consecutive same characters? \n\n        But what if the entire string has only one distinct character? \n            Then for any substring, the frequency of that character is the length of the substring, and the frequency of any other character (but there is none) -> wait, the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\". So if the entire string has only one distinct character, then D has only one character? Then we don't have to consider any pair? \n\n        Actually, the condition: for every substring t and for every pair (u,v) of characters present in s. But if there is only one character, then there is no pair? Or the pair (u,u) -> |f_t(u)-f_t(u)|=0<=1 -> holds.\n\n        Therefore, a string with only one distinct character is perfectly balanced.\n\n        Now, what if the entire string has two distinct characters? \n            Then we cannot have two consecutive same characters? \n            Also, we cannot have a substring that has three of one character and one of the other? \n\n        But consider \"ab\": \n            Entire string: distinct characters {a,b}. \n            Substrings: \n                \"a\": a:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                \"b\": a:0, b:1 -> okay.\n                \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n\n        Now \"aba\": \n            Entire string: distinct {a,b}. \n            Substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            Substring \"ab\": okay.\n            Substring \"ba\": okay.\n            Substring \"a\": okay.\n            Substring \"b\": okay.\n            Substring \"aa\": does not appear? \n\n        But wait, \"aba\" does not have \"aa\". \n\n        Now \"abc\": \n            We already saw it is balanced.\n\n        But what about \"aabb\"? \n            Entire string: a:2, b:2 -> okay.\n            But substring \"aa\": a:2, b:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not okay.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot have two consecutive same characters if there are at least two distinct characters.\n\n        But what about three distinct characters? \n            Consider \"abcabc\": \n                But we must check every substring.\n\n            However, note: the condition must hold for every substring. \n\n            Consider the substring \"aa\": if there is a substring \"aa\", then for any character that is not 'a' (say 'b') that appears in the entire string, we have |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, regardless of the number of distinct characters, we cannot have two consecutive same characters? \n\n        But what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then we can have consecutive same characters? \n\n        So the condition: \n            If the string has at least two distinct characters, then it must not contain any two consecutive same characters.\n\n        But is that sufficient? \n\n        Consider \"abab\": \n            distinct characters: {a,b}. \n            It has no two consecutive same characters? \n            Check substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"ab\": okay.\n            Check substring \"ba\": okay.\n            Check substring \"a\": a:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"b\": okay.\n            Check substring \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> okay.\n\n        But what about \"abc\": \n            distinct characters: {a,b,c}. \n            It has no two consecutive same characters? \n            Check substring \"a\": a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1, |0-0|=0 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |1-1|=0, |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"b\": okay.\n            Check substring \"bc\": b:1, c:1, a:0 -> |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1, |0-0|=0 -> okay.\n            Check substring \"c\": okay.\n\n        Now consider \"aba\" with distinct {a,b}: \n            It has no consecutive same? \n            But what about the substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n        Now consider \"a\": \n            distinct {a} -> okay.\n\n        Now consider \"abac\": \n            distinct {a,b,c}. \n            Check substring \"aa\": \n                But wait, we have \"aa\" in \"aba\" and then the next 'c'? Actually, the substring \"aa\" does not appear? \n            But we have \"a\" at index0 and \"a\" at index2: they are not consecutive? \n            Then the substring \"a\" (from index0 to index0) and then the substring \"a\" (from index2 to index2) are okay? \n            But what about the substring from index0 to index2: \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> |2-1|=1, |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails for \"abac\" because of the substring \"aba\": \n            For the pair (a,c): |2-0|=2>1.\n\n        So we cannot have a substring that has two of one character and zero of another? \n\n        How to avoid that? \n\n        In fact, the condition fails if there is a substring that has two of one character and zero of a character that appears in the entire string? \n\n        Therefore, we must ensure that for every contiguous substring, the frequency of any character that appears in the entire string is either 0 or 1? \n\n        But then the entire string would have at most 1 occurrence of each character? \n\n        But the example \"abc\" has 1 occurrence of each -> okay.\n\n        But \"aba\" has two a's -> not allowed? \n\n        But wait, in \"aba\", the entire string has two a's, but the condition holds? \n\n        However, in the substring \"aba\", we have two a's and one b, and the entire string has distinct characters {a,b}. The condition: \n            |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n        But the condition also requires that for the pair (a,c) and (b,c) if c is in the entire string? But in \"aba\", the entire string has only a and b. \n\n        So the condition only applies to the characters that are in the entire string.\n\n        Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n          Let D be the set of distinct characters in s.\n          For every contiguous substring t of s, and for every u in D, the frequency of u in t must be at most 1? \n\n        But that is not true: in \"aba\", the frequency of 'a' in the entire substring is 2.\n\n        But the condition is not that the frequency is at most 1, but that the difference between any two is at most 1.\n\n        How to check efficiently? \n\n        Insight: \n        The condition is violated if there exists a contiguous substring t and two characters u and v in D such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2.\n\n        This is equivalent to: there exists a contiguous substring t and a character u in D such that f_t(u) >= 2 and there exists a character v in D such that f_t(v)=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can scan for any contiguous substring that contains at least two occurrences of some character and misses at least one character from D.\n\n        How to do that without enumerating all substrings? \n\n        Note: the total length of all strings over test cases is 200000.\n\n        We can try to find the minimal violation: \n          The violation occurs if there is a substring that has two of one letter and zero of another letter that is in D.\n\n        The smallest such substring would be of length 2: \"aa\" -> then if there is any other character in D, we have a violation.\n\n        But also, a substring of length 3: \"aba\" -> if there is a character in D that is not in this substring? Then we have a violation? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: the entire string s has a set D. In the substring \"aba\", if there is a character c in D that does not appear in \"aba\", then we have a violation: |f_t(a)-f_t(c)| = |2-0|=2.\n\n        Therefore, for a substring t, if there is a character in D that does not appear in t, then we require that the frequency of every character in t is at most 1? \n\n        Why? Because if there is a character u in t with frequency>=2, then for a character v in D that is not in t, we have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |f_t(u)|>=2.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is equivalent to: \n          For every contiguous substring t, either \n            (a) t contains all characters of D, or \n            (b) if t does not contain all characters of D, then every character in t appears at most once.\n\n        But condition (a) is very strong: the entire string s must be such that every contiguous substring that does not cover the entire set D must have all characters distinct? \n\n        And also, if a contiguous substring covers the entire set D, then we don't care about the frequencies? \n\n        But wait: consider a contiguous substring t that covers all characters of D. Then we require that for every two characters u,v in D, |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n        This is also a strong condition: the frequencies of the characters in t must be almost equal.\n\n        How to check? \n\n        Given the constraints (total length 200000), we cannot iterate over all substrings.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n        We know that the only violations come from:\n          - Two consecutive same characters (if |D|>=2) -> because then we have a substring of length 2 that has two of one letter and zero of at least one letter (since |D|>=2, there is at least one letter missing in that substring).\n          - Or a substring of length 3 that has two of one letter and one of another, and misses at least one letter from D (if |D|>=3) -> then we have |2-0|=2.\n\n        But note: if we have two consecutive same characters, then we have a violation (if |D|>=2). \n\n        What if we have no two consecutive same characters? \n          Then the string is an alternation of different characters.\n\n        But then consider a substring that is \"aba\" and |D|>=3: \n          The substring \"aba\" has two a's and one b, and if there is a third letter c in D, then in the substring \"aba\", the frequency of c is 0, so |f_t(a)-f_t(c)| = |2-0|=2 -> violation.\n\n        Therefore, if |D|>=3, then we cannot have any letter repeated? \n\n        But wait, the entire string might be \"abcabc\", which has no two consecutive same, but has repeated letters? \n\n        And in the substring \"abca\", we have a:2, b:1, c:1 -> then for the entire set D={a,b,c}, we have |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |1-1|=0 -> okay? \n\n        But what about a substring that does not contain all letters? \n          For example, the substring \"abca\" contains all letters? \n          But consider a substring \"aba\" in \"abcabc\": \n            \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> then |2-0|=2 -> violation.\n\n        Therefore, if the entire string has at least three distinct characters, then we cannot have any letter repeated? \n\n        Why? Because if a letter is repeated, then we can find a minimal substring that contains two of that letter and misses one of the distinct characters? \n\n        Specifically, between the two occurrences of the same letter, there might be not all distinct characters? \n\n        But note: the substring from the first occurrence to the second occurrence (inclusive) will have two of that letter and then the characters in between. If the entire string has at least three distinct characters, then there is at least one character that is not in that substring? \n\n        Actually, not necessarily: the substring might contain all distinct characters? \n\n        But if the substring contains all distinct characters, then we don't have a violation? \n\n        However, the condition for the substring that is from the first occurrence to the second occurrence: \n          It has two of the repeated letter, and one of the others? \n          Then for a character that is not in the substring? But if the substring contains all distinct characters, then there is no character in D missing? \n\n        But wait, the entire string has distinct characters D. The substring might not contain all of D? \n\n        For example, in \"abcda\", the substring from the first 'a' to the last 'a' is \"abcda\", which contains all distinct characters? \n          Then we require that the frequencies of the characters in this substring are almost equal? \n          Here, a:2, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> then the maximum difference is 1 (between 2 and 1) -> okay.\n\n        But what about a substring that is \"aba\" in the string \"abc\": \n          The string \"abc\" has distinct characters {a,b,c}. The substring \"aba\" is not in \"abc\", so we don't care? \n\n        We are only concerned with substrings of the given string.\n\n        Therefore, the violation in the case of three distinct characters occurs only if there is a contiguous substring that contains two of one letter and misses at least one letter from D.\n\n        How to find such a substring? \n\n        We can do: \n          For each character, we can record the positions. Then for each character c, we look at consecutive occurrences: \n            Let the consecutive occurrences of c be at positions i and j (with no c in between). \n            Then consider the substring from i to j. \n            If this substring does not contain all distinct characters of D, then we have a violation.\n\n        But note: the substring from i to j might be long. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n          For each character c, and for each consecutive occurrence of c (say at i and next at j), then the distinct characters in the substring s[i:j+1] must be exactly D? \n\n        But that is not necessary: we require that if it does not contain all distinct characters, then we have a violation? \n\n        Actually, if the substring s[i:j+1] does not contain all distinct characters of D, then we have a violation: \n          In this substring, the frequency of c is 2, and for a character d in D that is not in the substring, the frequency of d is 0 -> |2-0|=2.\n\n        Therefore, we must have that every contiguous substring that starts and ends with the same character and has no occurrence of that character in between must contain all distinct characters of D.\n\n        But note: the entire string might have more than two distinct characters.\n\n        How to check efficiently? \n          We are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is 200000.\n\n          We can precompute the distinct characters for the entire string: D = set(s)\n\n          Then, for each character c, we can iterate over the consecutive occurrences. For each consecutive occurrence (i, j), we can check the distinct characters in the substring s[i:j+1]. \n\n          But the length of the substring might be large, and the total number of consecutive occurrences is O(n) per string? \n\n          And the total length of all strings is 200000, but the sum of the lengths of the substrings we check might be O(n^2)? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to precompute the distinct characters in a substring? \n\n        But we cannot iterate over all consecutive occurrences for all characters.\n\n        Another idea: \n          The condition is violated if there exists a character c and two indices i<j such that s[i]=s[j]=c and the substring s[i:j+1] does not contain all distinct characters of the entire string.\n\n          We can try to find, for each distinct character c, the minimal gap between two consecutive c's such that the substring between them (inclusive) does not cover D.\n\n          How to check if a substring covers D? We can use a sliding window and a frequency array? \n\n          But we have to do it for every consecutive occurrence of every character? \n\n          The total number of consecutive occurrences for one character is (count(c)-1). The sum of count(c) over the entire string is n. So the total number of consecutive occurrences over all characters is O(n). \n\n          But for each consecutive occurrence, we need to check if the substring s[i:j+1] contains all distinct characters. \n\n          We can precompute the distinct characters for the entire string: D, and |D|=k.\n\n          We can use a sliding window to compute the number of distinct characters in a substring? But we have many queries: O(n) queries? \n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute an array for the next occurrence of each character? \n\n        However, note: we only care about whether the substring contains all distinct characters. \n\n        We can precompute the positions of each character. Then for a given substring, we can check if for every character d in D, there is at least one occurrence in the substring? \n\n        But that would be O(k) per query, and k can be up to 26 (since only lowercase letters) -> so 26 * O(n) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          t = number of test cases, and the total length of strings is <=200000.\n\n          For each test case:\n            s = given string\n            D = set(s)\n            k = len(D)\n\n            # If k==1, then we return \"YES\"\n            # If k>=2, then we check for two consecutive same characters: \n            for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                if s[i]==s[i+1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else: \n                # then no two consecutive same\n                if k<=2:\n                    # then we return \"YES\", because for any substring, if it misses a character, then the frequency of any character in the substring is at most 1? \n                    # But wait: consider \"aba\" in a string with k=2: \n                    #   The entire string has distinct {a,b}. \n                    #   The substring \"aba\" has a:2, b:1 -> and there is no character in D missing? \n                    #   But the entire string has only a and b, so the substring \"aba\" contains both? \n                    #   Actually, we require that every substring that does not contain all distinct characters must have distinct letters? \n                    #   But in a string with k=2, if a substring does not contain both, then it contains only one letter? and then the frequency of that letter is the length, and the frequency of the other is 0. \n                    #   But if the substring has length>=2, then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |length - 0| = length>=2 -> violation.\n                    #   Therefore, we must ensure that every substring that does not contain both letters has length 1? \n                    #   But that is not the case: consider the substring \"a\" (length1) -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                    #   But what about a substring of length2: \"ab\" -> contains both -> then we require |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n                    #   But what about a substring of length3: \"aba\" -> contains both -> then we require |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n                    #   But what about a substring of length1: \"a\" -> okay.\n                    #   But what about a substring of length2: \"aa\"? -> but we already ensured there are no consecutive same, so \"aa\" cannot appear as contiguous substring? \n                    #   Therefore, for k=2, if there are no consecutive same, then every substring that does not contain both letters must be of length1? \n                    #   And for a substring of length1, the condition holds? \n                    #   And for a substring that contains both, the condition holds? \n                    #   So k=2 is okay? \n                    #   But consider the substring \"a\" at the beginning: it has one a and zero b -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                    #   And the substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n                    #   Therefore, for k=2 and no consecutive same, it is okay.\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    # k>=3\n                    # We need to check for every consecutive occurrence of the same character: \n                    #   For each character c, we get the list of indices where c occurs.\n                    #   For each consecutive pair (i, j) in that list (i.e., the next occurrence of c after i), we consider the substring s[i:j+1].\n                    #   We check if this substring contains all k distinct characters.\n                    #   If we find one that does not, then we output \"NO\" and break.\n                    #   If we don't find any, then we output \"YES\".\n\n                    # But note: the entire string might be \"abcba\": \n                    #   Consider the two 'a's: \n                    #       substring from first a to last a: \"abcba\" -> distinct: {a,b,c} -> contains all -> okay.\n                    #   Consider the two 'b's: \n                    #       substring from first b to the next b: \"bcb\" -> distinct: {b,c} -> which is not the entire set? \n                    #       Then we have a violation: in the substring \"bcb\", the frequency of b is 2, and the frequency of a is 0 -> |2-0|=2 -> violation.\n\n                    # Therefore, we need to check for every consecutive occurrence of every character.\n\n                    # Precompute the positions for each character.\n                    pos = {}\n                    for idx, char in enumerate(s):\n                        if char not in pos:\n                            pos[char] = []\n                        pos[char].append(idx)\n\n                    found_violation = False\n                    for char, positions in pos.items():\n                        # if the character appears only once, skip\n                        if len(positions) < 2:\n                            continue\n                        # check consecutive pairs\n                        for p in range(len(positions)-1):\n                            i = positions[p]\n                            j = positions[p+1]\n                            # substring s[i:j+1]\n                            substr = s[i:j+1]\n                            if len(set(substr)) < k:\n                                found_violation = True\n                                break\n                        if found_violation:\n                            break\n\n                    if found_violation:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n\n        But wait, what if the consecutive occurrence is not the next one? \n          We are only checking consecutive in the list of positions, which are consecutive occurrences of the same character? \n\n        However, the condition: we require that for any two occurrences of the same character, the substring between them (inclusive) must contain all distinct characters? \n\n        Why? \n          Consider a character c that appears at i, then j, then k. \n          We check the substring from i to j: if it contains all distinct characters, then we are good for that substring.\n          But what about the substring from i to k? \n          If the substring from i to k does not contain all distinct characters, then we have a violation? \n          But note: the substring from i to k contains the substring from i to j, which contains all distinct characters? Then the entire substring from i to k also contains all distinct characters? \n\n        Therefore, if the substring between two consecutive occurrences of c (with no c in between) contains all distinct characters, then any substring that starts and ends with c and contains these two consecutive ones will also contain all distinct characters? \n\n        So it is sufficient to check consecutive occurrences? \n\n        Therefore, the algorithm for program2.py:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                D = set(s)\n                k = len(D)\n\n                # Case 1: only one distinct character -> YES\n                if k == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for any two consecutive same characters\n                consecutive_same = False\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        consecutive_same = True\n                        break\n\n                if consecutive_same:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # If k==2, then YES\n                if k == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now k>=3\n                # Build the positions for each character\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                pos = defaultdict(list)\n                for idx, char in enumerate(s):\n                    pos[char].append(idx)\n\n                found_violation = False\n                for char, positions in pos.items():\n                    if len(positions) < 2:\n                        continue\n                    # Check consecutive occurrences\n                    for i in range(len(positions)-1):\n                        start = positions[i]\n                        end = positions[i+1]\n                        # Get the distinct characters in s[start:end+1]\n                        # We can do: \n                        #   substr = s[start:end+1]\n                        #   distinct_in_sub = set(substr)\n                        #   if len(distinct_in_sub) < k:\n                        #       found_violation = True\n                        #       break\n                        # But we can break early if we know the substring is long? \n                        # But the total length of all these substrings? \n                        # The total number of consecutive pairs is O(n) and the total length of the string is 200000, but the sum of the lengths of these substrings might be O(n^2). \n\n                # We need to avoid O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\n                Alternative: \n                  We can precompute the distinct characters in the entire string: k.\n                  We can use a segment tree or a sparse table for distinct characters? But k is at most 26, so we can do a 26-sized array and use a sliding window? \n\n                But note: we are only checking O(n) substrings (one per consecutive occurrence) and the length of each substring is the distance between the two indices. The total work would be O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\n                Worst-case: a string of length 200000 with only one character? But we already handled k==1. \n                Or a string with two characters? but we handled k<=2. \n                So k>=3, but then the consecutive occurrences: worst-case, a character that appears many times? \n\n                For example, the string could be \"abcabcabc...\", and we are checking for the consecutive occurrences of 'a': the distance between consecutive a's is 3, and there are about n/3 occurrences -> so the total work would be O(n * 3) = O(n). \n\n                But worst-case: a character that appears many times and the gaps are large? \n                  For example, a string of the form \"a\" + (n-2)*'b' + \"a\", then the gap is n-1, and we do one substring of length n. \n                  And we do this for each character? \n\n                The total work over all consecutive occurrences: \n                  For a fixed character c, the work is the sum_{consecutive pairs} (gap+1). \n                  The gaps are the distances between consecutive occurrences. The sum of gaps for one character is O(n). \n                  And there are at most 26 characters. \n\n                But note: the same gap might be used for multiple characters? \n\n                Actually, we are iterating over characters. For one character, the sum of the lengths of the substrings we check is the sum of (positions[i+1]-positions[i]+1) for consecutive pairs. \n                  = (positions[1]-positions[0]+1) + (positions[2]-positions[1]+1) + ... + (positions[-1]-positions[-2]+1)\n                  = (positions[-1] - positions[0] + (number of consecutive pairs))\n                  <= n + (number of consecutive pairs) \n                And the number of consecutive pairs for one character is (count(c)-1) <= n.\n\n                Therefore, the total work for one character is O(n). And there are at most 26 characters, so total work is 26 * O(n) = O(26*n) = O(n), which is acceptable for n=200000? \n\n                26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    for char in pos:\n                        if len(pos[char]) < 2:\n                            continue\n                        positions = pos[char]\n                        total_length = 0\n                        for i in range(len(positions)-1):\n                            start = positions[i]\n                            end = positions[i+1]\n                            substr = s[start:end+1]\n                            if len(set(substr)) < k:\n                                found_violation = True\n                                break\n                        if found_violation:\n                            break\n\n                Then output.\n\n        However, we can optimize by not building the substring explicitly? We can use a set and update it? But we are only doing 5.2e6 total characters? \n\n        But 5.2e6 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                D = set(s)\n                k = len(D)\n\n                if k == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for consecutive duplicates\n                has_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        has_dup = True\n                        break\n\n                if has_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                if k == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # k>=3\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                pos = defaultdict(list)\n                for idx, char in enumerate(s):\n                    pos[char].append(idx)\n\n                violation = False\n                for char, lst in pos.items():\n                    if len(lst) < 2:\n                        continue\n                    # Check every consecutive pair in lst\n                    for i in range(len(lst)-1):\n                        start = lst[i]\n                        end = lst[i+1]\n                        # Extract substring from start to end (inclusive)\n                        # We can avoid building the substring by using a set? But we are only going to do 26 per substring? \n                        # But the length of the substring might be large, but we are only interested in the distinct characters.\n                        # We can use a set and add all characters in the substring? \n                        # But building a set of a substring of length L is O(L). \n                        # We do as above.\n                        sub_str = s[start:end+1]\n                        if len(set(sub_str)) < k:\n                            violation = True\n                            break\n                    if violation:\n                        break\n\n                print(\"NO\" if violation else \"YES\")\n\n        But note: the total length of the string over test cases is 200000, but the inner loop might be heavy? \n\n        However, we have already handled the cases for k==1, k==2, and consecutive duplicates. \n        And for k>=3, the total work is O(26 * (sum of gaps for one character)) and the sum of gaps for one character is O(n). \n        And the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total work is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"aba\" -> k=2 -> we output \"YES\" (but note: the example says \"aba\" is balanced? but our example above was for k=2? and we output \"YES\" for k=2) -> but wait, the example \"aba\" has distinct {a,b} -> k=2 -> so we output \"YES\". \n\n          Example 2: \"abc\" -> k=3, no consecutive duplicates -> then we build pos: \n                a: [0]\n                b: [1]\n                c: [2]\n            then we skip because each appears only once -> then we output \"YES\".\n\n          Example 3: \"aab\" -> we detect consecutive duplicates -> \"NO\".\n\n          Example 4: \"abac\" -> \n                k = set('abac') = {'a','b','c'} -> k=3.\n                consecutive duplicates? no.\n                then we build pos:\n                    a: [0,2]\n                    b: [1]\n                    c: [3]\n                For 'a': consecutive pair: from 0 to 2 -> substring = s[0:3] = \"aba\" -> distinct = {'a','b'} -> size=2<3 -> violation -> \"NO\".\n\n          Example 5: \"abcba\" -> \n                k = 3.\n                consecutive duplicates? no.\n                pos:\n                    a: [0,3]\n                    b: [1,4]\n                    c: [2]\n                Check 'a': substring from 0 to 3: \"abcb\" -> distinct = {'a','b','c'} -> 3, so no violation.\n                Check 'b': consecutive pair: from 1 to 4: substring = s[1:5] = \"bcb\" -> distinct = {'b','c'} -> size=2<3 -> violation -> \"NO\".\n\n          Example 6: \"abcabc\" -> \n                k=3.\n                consecutive duplicates? no.\n                pos:\n                    a: [0,3]\n                    b: [1,4]\n                    c: [2,5]\n                Check 'a': substring from 0 to 3: \"abca\" -> distinct = {'a','b','c'} -> 3 -> no violation.\n                Check 'b': substring from 1 to 4: \"bcab\" -> distinct = {'a','b','c'} -> 3 -> no violation.\n                Check 'c': substring from 2 to 5: \"cabc\" -> distinct = {'a','b','c'} -> 3 -> no violation.\n                Then output \"YES\".\n\n          But is \"abcabc\" perfectly balanced? \n            Consider the substring \"abca\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> |2-1|=1, |2-1|=1, |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n            Consider the substring \"bca\": \n                a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n            Consider the substring \"ca\": \n                a:1, c:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1, |0-0|=0 -> okay.\n            Consider the substring \"aba\": -> but wait, \"aba\" is not contiguous in \"abcabc\"? \n                The contiguous substrings are: \n                    \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"abca\", \"abcab\", \"abcabc\", \n                    \"b\", \"bc\", \"bca\", \"bcab\", \"bcabc\", \n                    \"c\", \"ca\", \"cab\", \"cabc\", \n                    \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \n                    \"b\", \"bc\", \n                    \"c\"\n                There is no \"aba\" as contiguous substring? \n                But there is \"a\" (at index0), \"b\" (index1), \"c\" (index2), \"a\" (index3) -> so the substring from index0 to index3 is \"abca\", and the substring from index2 to index3 is \"ca\", and the substring from index0 to index1 is \"ab\", etc.\n\n            However, the substring \"aba\" is not contiguous? \n\n            But note: the substring must be contiguous. \n\n            Therefore, \"abcabc\" is balanced.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of all strings over test cases is 200000. \n          We have t test cases, and the sum of |s| <= 200000.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            total_n = 0\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                total_n += n\n                # ... \n\n        But the problem says the sum of |s| over test cases is <=200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, we must note that the inner loop for k>=3 might be heavy? But the total work is O(26 * total_n) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire block.\n\n        But the TODO is: \n            for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n                # TODO: Your code here\r\n\n        We write:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            distinct_all = set(s)\n            k = len(distinct_all)\n\n            if k == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue\n\n            # Check for consecutive duplicates\n            has_dup = False\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    has_dup = True\n                    break\n\n            if has_dup:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                continue\n\n            if k == 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue\n\n            # For k>=3\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            pos = defaultdict(list)\n            for idx, char in enumerate(s):\n                pos[char].append(idx)\n\n            violation = False\n            for char, lst in pos.items():\n                if len(lst) < 2:\n                    continue\n                for i in range(len(lst)-1):\n                    start_index = lst[i]\n                    end_index = lst[i+1]\n                    substring = s[start_index:end_index+1]\n                    if len(set(substring)) < k:\n                        violation = True\n                        break\n                if violation:\n                    break\n\n            print(\"YES\" if not violation else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: we must be cautious: the substring extraction s[start_index:end_index+1] might be expensive? But the total work is O(26 * total_n) as argued.\n\n        However, we can avoid building the substring by using a precomputed structure? But 5.2e6 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in the required JSON format.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        program1.py: \n            In the else block (when lsum==rsum), we write:\n                best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                i += 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n\n        program2.py: \n            We write the entire block as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". \n\n        And the format: \n            { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n        We must put the code as a string? \n\n        We must escape the quotes? \n\n        But the problem does not specify, so we assume we can put the code as a string without extra escaping? \n\n        However, we are in JSON, so we must escape double quotes and backslashes and newlines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a multi-line string? \n\n        But the problem says \"completion\" is a string.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            \"program1\": \"best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n                i += 1\\n                j -= 1\\n                if i < j:\\n                    lsum += arr[i]\\n                    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n        And for program2, it is a longer string.\n\n        But note: the program2 code has newlines and quotes.\n\n        We can use a triple quoted string in JSON? But the JSON standard does not allow. \n\n        We must escape newlines as \\n and quotes as \\\".\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact escaping, but we are to output a JSON string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n        We'll write the code as a string with newlines and without extra quotes? \n\n        But the JSON requires that the string is quoted and special characters escaped.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n                i += 1\\n                j -= 1\\n                if i < j:\\n                    lsum += arr[i]\\n                    rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n        And for program2:\n\n            \"program2\": \"s = input().strip()\\n        n = len(s)\\n        distinct_all = set(s)\\n        k = len(distinct_all)\\n\\n        if k == 1:\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n            continue\\n\\n        # Check for consecutive duplicates\\n        has_dup = False\\n        for i"
