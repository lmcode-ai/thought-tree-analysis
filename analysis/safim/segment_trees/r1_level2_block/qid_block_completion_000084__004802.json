For the initial array [1,2,3,4,5]:\n            base = 15\n            transitions: i0: 1!=2 -> 1*4=4\n                i1: 2!=3 -> 2*3=6\n                i2: 3!=4 -> 3*2=6\n                i3: 4!=5 -> 4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35. Then the first update: change index 3 (which is the third element, so index=2 in 0-indexed) from 3 to 2.\n\n          Steps for update at index=2 (0-indexed) to value 2:\n\n            Current array: [1,2,3,4,5] -> we are going to change a[2] to 2 -> becomes [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n            We remove the contributions for the transitions that are adjacent to index2: \n                left: index2-1 = 1 (which is the transition between a[1] and a[2]): currently 2 and 3 -> they are different -> so we remove the contribution for i=1: 2*(5-1-1)=2*3=6? But note: the formula for the transition at i=1: (i+1)=2, n-i-1=5-1-1=3 -> 2*3=6. right: index2 = 2 (which is the transition between a[2] and a[3]): currently 3 and 4 -> different -> remove the contribution for i=2: 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6. Then we set a[2]=2. Then we add the contributions for the same transitions if they now exist:\n                left: at i=1: a[1]=2, a[2]=2 -> same -> skip. right: at i=2: a[2]=2, a[3]=4 -> different -> add 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6. Also note: the transition at i=0 (between a[0] and a[1]) is unchanged: 1 and 2 -> different -> remains 4. The transition at i=3 (between a[3] and a[4]) is unchanged: 4 and 5 -> different -> remains 4. So the new total = 35 (initial) - 6 (from i=1) - 6 (from i=2) + 6 (from i=2) + 0 (for i=1) = 35 - 6 = 29. Therefore, the update works.

Let me do the second query: Query: 4 2 -> set the 4th element (index=3) to 2. Current array: [1,2,2,4,5] -> change a[3] to 2 -> becomes [1,2,2,2,5]\n\n          Steps:\n            pos = 3 (0-indexed)\n\n            Remove adjacent transitions:\n              left: at index=2 (between a[2] and a[3]): currently 2 and 4 -> different -> remove: (3+1)*(n-3-1)=4*(5-4)=4*1=4? But wait: the left transition is at index=3-1=2? Actually, the adjacent transitions for index3 are:\n                    left: between a[2] and a[3] -> index2: which is at position i=2 -> (2+1)=3, n-2-1=2 -> 3*2=6? But note: the formula for the transition at index i: (i+1)*(n-i-1). For the transition at index2 (which is the one between a[2] and a[3]): (2+1)=3, n-2-1=2 -> 3*2=6. However, in the current state (before update) the array at index3 is 4, so a[2]=2 and a[3]=4 -> different -> remove 6.\n\n              right: between a[3] and a[4]: currently 4 and 5 -> different -> remove: (3+1)*(n-3-1)=4*(5-4)=4*1=4? But the transition at index3: (3+1)=4, n-3-1=1 -> 4*1=4. So we remove 6 and 4 -> current ans = 29 - 6 - 4 = 19. Then set a[3]=2. Now check:\n              left: a[2] and a[3]: 2 and 2 -> same -> skip. right: a[3] and a[4]: 2 and 5 -> different -> add: (3+1)*(n-3-1)=4*1=4. Then ans = 19 + 4 = 23. Also, the other transitions: i0: 1 and 2 -> different -> still 4 (contribution 1*4=4) \n                i1: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n                i2: now 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n                i3: 2 and 5 -> different -> 4 (as above) So total = base (15) + 4 (from i0) + 4 (from i3) = 15+4+4=23.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\n The awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\n Insight:\n Initially, note that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is equal to the number of indices i (from l to r-1) \n such that a[i] != a[i+1] plus 1. Therefore, for a subarray of length L, the awesomeness is 1 + (number of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1]).\n\n Then the total sum over all contiguous subarrays is:\n   Sum_{l=0}^{n-1} Sum_{r=l}^{n-1} [1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1])]\n\n The 1's contribute: \n   There are n*(n+1)//2 contiguous subarrays.\n\n For the transitions (a[i]!=a[i+1]): \n   Consider a transition at position i (between a[i] and a[i+1]). This transition will be present in a subarray [l, r] \n   if and only if l <= i and r >= i+1. \n   The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n-i-1). \n\n However, note: the above counts the contribution of each transition. Therefore, the total sum is:\n   total = n*(n+1)//2 + Sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (i+1)*(n-i-1) * (1 if a[i]!=a[i+1] else 0) ]\n\n But wait: the problem states that after each query we update an element and then output the total.\n\n However, note that updating an element at index i may affect the transitions at positions i-1 (if i>0) and i (if i<n-1).\n\n Therefore, we can maintain:\n   total_ans = base + contributions from transitions.\n\n Base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n Then for each transition i (from 0 to n-2) we add (i+1)*(n-i-1) if the transition exists.\n\n How to update?\n   We are going to store the current array and also the current transitions.\n\n   Let's define:\n      base = n*(n+1)//2   [this is fixed]\n\n   And we maintain a variable 'ans' that is base plus the contributions of the transitions.\n\n   We also maintain an array 'a' of the current values.\n\n   For each transition i (from 0 to n-2), we have:\n        if a[i] != a[i+1]: then we add (i+1)*(n-i-1) to the base.\n\n   However, note: the problem has m queries. We start with an initial array.\n\n   Steps for a query (i, x): \n        index = i-1 (because the array is 0-indexed, and the input index is 1-indexed)\n\n        We are going to change a[index] to x.\n\n        This change might break the transitions at positions index-1 (if index>=1) and index (if index < n-1) that were previously existing?\n        And also, it might create new transitions at these positions if the new value causes a difference.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          Let the current array be 'a'\n\n          We are going to remove the contributions of the transitions at positions index-1 and index (if they currently exist) from the total.\n\n          Then update a[index] = x.\n\n          Then add the contributions of the transitions at positions index-1 and index (if they now exist) to the total.\n\n        How to compute the contribution of a transition at position i?\n            It is (i+1)*(n-i-1)   [if the transition exists, i.e., a[i]!=a[i+1]]\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          Let ans = base (which is n*(n+1)//2) plus the sum of contributions from all transitions.\n\n          We maintain an array for the current a.\n\n          We also precompute the initial contributions.\n\n        Steps for a query (i, x):\n            pos = i-1\n\n            # Remove the contributions of the transitions at pos-1 and pos (if they exist) from the current ans.\n\n            # But note: if we remove the element at pos, it affects the transitions at:\n            #   left: between pos-1 and pos (if pos>=1)\n            #   right: between pos and pos+1 (if pos < n-1)\n\n            # So:\n            if pos >= 1:\n                if a[pos-1] != a[pos]: \n                    # then the transition at (pos-1) is present -> remove its contribution\n                    ans -= pos * (n - pos)   # because the transition at index (pos-1) is at position i = pos-1 -> (i+1) = pos, so (pos)*(n-pos) [but note: n-i-1 = n - (pos-1) - 1 = n-pos]\n            if pos < n-1:\n                if a[pos] != a[pos+1]:\n                    ans -= (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)   # transition at i=pos: (i+1)=pos+1, and n-i-1 = n-pos-1\n\n            # Now update a[pos] = x\n\n            # Then add the contributions for the same transitions if they now exist.\n            if pos >= 1:\n                if a[pos-1] != x: \n                    ans += pos * (n - pos)\n            if pos < n-1:\n                if x != a[pos+1]:\n                    ans += (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)\n\n            # Also, note: the update might break or create a transition at the same positions.\n\n            # But wait: we updated a[pos] to x, so we must update the array at position pos.\n            a[pos] = x\n\n            # Then output the current ans.\n\n        However, note: the above does not account for the fact that the update at pos might also affect the transition at pos-2? \n        Actually, no. Only adjacent transitions are affected: the one to the left (if any) and the one to the right (if any).\n\n        But note: the transition at pos-1 is between a[pos-2] and a[pos-1]? \n        Actually, the transition at index i is between a[i] and a[i+1]. \n        So the update at pos only affects:\n            the transition at i = pos-1 (if exists) because it involves a[pos-1] and a[pos] (which we updated)\n            the transition at i = pos (if exists) because it involves a[pos] and a[pos+1]\n\n        Therefore, the above is correct.\n\n        However, note: the initial array is given. We must compute the initial ans.\n\n        Steps for initial array:\n            base = n*(n+1)//2\n            ans = base\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                    ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\n        Then process each query.\n\n        But note: the constraints: n, m up to 10^5 -> the initial loop is O(n) and each query is O(1). This is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array is 0-indexed? The input gives the array as a1, a2, ... an.\n\n        Let's test with the example:\n\n          Example: \"5 5\" and then \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n          Then the initial array: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n          Transitions: \n            i=0: 1!=2 -> add 1*(5-1-1)=1*3=3\n            i=1: 2!=3 -> add 2*(5-2-1)=2*2=4\n            i=2: 3!=4 -> add 3*(5-3-1)=3*1=3\n            i=3: 4!=5 -> add 4*(5-4-1)=4*0=0\n\n          Then base = 5*6//2 = 15, and total = 15+3+4+3+0 = 25.\n\n          But the example says after the first query (which changes the third element to 2) the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29.\n\n          How do we get 29?\n\n          For [1,2,2,4,5]:\n            base = 15\n            transitions:\n              i0: 1!=2 -> add 1*(5-1-1)=3\n              i1: 2==2 -> skip\n              i2: 2!=4 -> add 3*(5-3-1)=3*1=3\n              i3: 4!=5 -> add 4*(5-4-1)=0\n            total = 15+3+3 = 21 -> but expected 29.\n\n          This does not match.\n\n        What went wrong?\n\n        Let me recalc the example by hand: \n          [1;1]:1 -> 1\n          [1;2]:1,2 -> 2\n          [1;3]:1,2,2 -> 2\n          [1;4]:1,2,2,4 -> 3\n          [1;5]:1,2,2,4,5 -> 4\n          [2;2]:2 -> 1\n          [2;3]:2,2 -> 1\n          [2;4]:2,2,4 -> 2\n          [2;5]:2,2,4,5 -> 3\n          [3;3]:2 -> 1\n          [3;4]:2,4 -> 2\n          [3;5]:2,4,5 -> 3\n          [4;4]:4 -> 1\n          [4;5]:4,5 -> 2\n          [5;5]:5 -> 1\n\n          Sum = 1+2+2+3+4+1+1+2+3+1+2+3+1+2+1 = 29.\n\n        How to compute by our formula?\n\n          We said: total = base (which is 15) + contributions from transitions.\n\n          But note: the formula for a transition at i: \n            It is counted in every contiguous subarray that includes both i and i+1. \n            The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n-i-1). \n\n          However, note: the transition at i (if present) adds 1 to the awesomeness of every contiguous subarray that crosses it.\n\n          Therefore, the total awesomeness = base (each subarray has at least 1) + (for each transition i, the number of subarrays that include that transition).\n\n          In the example [1,2,2,4,5]:\n            base = 15.\n            Transition at i0: 1 and 2 -> present. The number of subarrays that include this transition: \n                l in [0,0] and r in [1,4] -> 1 * 4 = 4.\n            Transition at i1: 2 and 2 -> not present -> 0.\n            Transition at i2: 2 and 4 -> present. The number of subarrays that include this transition:\n                l in [0,2] and r in [3,4] -> 3 * 2 = 6.\n            Transition at i3: 4 and 5 -> present. The number of subarrays that include this transition:\n                l in [0,3] and r in [4,4] -> 4 * 1 = 4.\n\n            Then total = 15 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 29.\n\n          So the formula for the contribution of a transition at i is: (i+1) * (n-i-1) is not correct.\n\n          Why? \n            The subarray must start at any index from 0 to i (so i+1 choices) and end at any index from i+1 to n-1 (so n-i-1 choices). \n            But note: the example for i0: \n                i0: i=0 -> (0+1)=1, n-0-1=4 -> 1*4=4 -> correct.\n            i2: i=2 -> (2+1)=3, n-2-1=5-3=2 -> 3*2=6 -> correct.\n            i3: i=3 -> (3+1)=4, n-3-1=1 -> 4*1=4 -> correct.\n\n          So the formula is correct.\n\n          Then why did we get 21 earlier? \n            Because we did:\n              base = 15\n              then added for i0: 3 -> 18\n              then for i1: skipped\n              then for i2: 3 -> 21\n              then for i3: 0 -> 21.\n\n          But wait: the example has three transitions: at i0, i2, i3 -> 4+6+4=14, so total=15+14=29.\n\n          So the initial calculation for the array [1,2,2,4,5] should be:\n            base = 15\n            then for i0: 1*(5-1) = 1*4 = 4 -> but wait, the formula is (i+1)*(n-i-1) -> for i0: (0+1)*(5-0-1)=1*4=4.\n            for i1: skip -> 0\n            for i2: (2+1)*(5-2-1)=3*2=6\n            for i3: (3+1)*(5-3-1)=4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+4 = 29.\n\n          So the initial code for the example [1,2,2,4,5] is correct.\n\n          But then why did we get 25 for [1,2,3,4,5]? \n            base = 15\n            i0: 1*4=4\n            i1: 2*3=6\n            i2: 3*2=6\n            i3: 4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n          But the example says after the first query (which changes the third element to 2) we get 29, and the initial array [1,2,3,4,5] is not given an output? \n          The problem says: after each query print the answer.\n\n          The input: \n            5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2   -> then output 29\n            ...\n\n          So the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5] and then we do the first update: set the 3rd element to 2 -> becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and then output 29.\n\n          Therefore, we must compute the initial state of the array [1,2,3,4,5] and then update.\n\n          For the initial array [1,2,3,4,5]:\n            base = 15\n            transitions: \n                i0: 1!=2 -> 1*4=4\n                i1: 2!=3 -> 2*3=6\n                i2: 3!=4 -> 3*2=6\n                i3: 4!=5 -> 4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n          Then the first update: change index 3 (which is the third element, so index=2 in 0-indexed) from 3 to 2.\n\n          Steps for update at index=2 (0-indexed) to value 2:\n\n            Current array: [1,2,3,4,5] -> we are going to change a[2] to 2 -> becomes [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n            We remove the contributions for the transitions that are adjacent to index2: \n                left: index2-1 = 1 (which is the transition between a[1] and a[2]): currently 2 and 3 -> they are different -> so we remove the contribution for i=1: 2*(5-1-1)=2*3=6? \n                    But note: the formula for the transition at i=1: (i+1)=2, n-i-1=5-1-1=3 -> 2*3=6.\n                right: index2 = 2 (which is the transition between a[2] and a[3]): currently 3 and 4 -> different -> remove the contribution for i=2: 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6.\n\n            Then we set a[2]=2.\n\n            Then we add the contributions for the same transitions if they now exist:\n                left: at i=1: a[1]=2, a[2]=2 -> same -> skip.\n                right: at i=2: a[2]=2, a[3]=4 -> different -> add 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6.\n\n            Also note: the transition at i=0 (between a[0] and a[1]) is unchanged: 1 and 2 -> different -> remains 4.\n            The transition at i=3 (between a[3] and a[4]) is unchanged: 4 and 5 -> different -> remains 4.\n\n            So the new total = 35 (initial) - 6 (from i=1) - 6 (from i=2) + 6 (from i=2) + 0 (for i=1) = 35 - 6 = 29.\n\n          Therefore, the update works.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We'll maintain:\n            n, m\n            a: the current array of size n\n            base = n*(n+1)//2   (this is constant)\n\n            We also maintain a variable 'ans' that is base plus the sum of contributions for each transition that exists.\n\n          Precomputation for initial array:\n            ans = base\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                    ans += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n          Then for each query:\n            i, x = map(int, input().split())\n            pos = i-1   # 0-indexed\n\n            # We are going to update a[pos] to x.\n\n            # We need to remove the contributions of the transitions at pos-1 (if exists) and at pos (if exists) if they are currently present.\n\n            # For the left transition (if pos>=1): the transition at index = pos-1 (between a[pos-1] and a[pos])\n            if pos >= 1:\n                if a[pos-1] != a[pos]:\n                    # This transition currently exists: remove its contribution: (pos) * (n-pos) \n                    # because the index of the transition is i = pos-1 -> (i+1)=pos, and n-i-1 = n -

\n                 But wait: the left transition is at index=3-1=2? \n                 Actually, the adjacent transitions for index3 are:\n                    left: between a[2] and a[3] -> index2: which is at position i=2 -> (2+1)=3, n-2-1=2 -> 3*2=6? \n                 But note: the formula for the transition at index i: (i+1)*(n-i-1). \n                 For the transition at index2 (which is the one between a[2] and a[3]): (2+1)=3, n-2-1=2 -> 3*2=6.\n\n                 However, in the current state (before update) the array at index3 is 4, so a[2]=2 and a[3]=4 -> different -> remove 6.\n\n              right: between a[3] and a[4]: currently 4 and 5 -> different -> remove: (3+1)*(n-3-1)=4*(5-4)=4*1=4? \n                 But the transition at index3: (3+1)=4, n-3-1=1 -> 4*1=4.\n\n            So we remove 6 and 4 -> current ans = 29 - 6 - 4 = 19.\n\n            Then set a[3]=2.\n\n            Now check:\n              left: a[2] and a[3]: 2 and 2 -> same -> skip.\n              right: a[3] and a[4]: 2 and 5 -> different -> add: (3+1)*(n-3-1)=4*1=4.\n\n            Then ans = 19 + 4 = 23.\n\n            Also, the other transitions: \n                i0: 1 and 2 -> different -> still 4 (contribution 1*4=4) \n                i1: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n                i2: now 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n                i3: 2 and 5 -> different -> 4 (as above)\n\n            So total = base (15) + 4 (from i0) + 4 (from i3) = 15+4+4=23.\n\n          Therefore, output 23.\n\n        The example does not provide the expected outputs for the next queries, but we trust the logic.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total sum of awesomeness over all subarrays. \n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the constraints: n, m up to 10^5 -> each update is O(1) so total O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Important: we must use sys.stdin for speed.\n\n        Code for program1.py:\n\n          import sys\n\n          data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n          # The first two tokens: n, m\n          n = int(data[0]); m = int(data[1])\n          a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          ans = base\n\n          # Precompute initial contributions for transitions\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                  # contribution: (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n                  ans += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n          # We'll store the array and update\n          # The next m queries: each has two integers: i and x\n          out_lines = []\n          index = 2+n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              # next two tokens: i and x\n              i = int(data[index]); x = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n              pos = i-1   # 0-indexed\n\n              # Remove the contributions of the adjacent transitions (if they exist) at positions pos-1 and pos.\n              if pos >= 1:\n                  if a[pos-1] != a[pos]:\n                      ans -= pos * (n - pos)\n              if pos < n-1:\n                  if a[pos] != a[pos+1]:\n                      ans -= (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)\n\n              # Update the array\n              a[pos] = x\n\n              # Add the contributions for the same transitions if they now exist.\n              if pos >= 1:\n                  if a[pos-1] != a[pos]:\n                      ans += pos * (n - pos)\n              if pos < n-1:\n                  if a[pos] != a[pos+1]:\n                      ans += (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)\n\n              out_lines.append(str(ans))\n\n          # Output each answer on a new line.\n          print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output the answer to each query on a new line.\"\n\n        We'll output the list of answers.\n\n        But note: the example input has 5 queries, so we output 5 lines.\n\n        We'll test with the example: \n          First query: 3 2 -> output 29\n          Second query: 4 2 -> output 23\n\n        The example input then has:\n          3 1\n          2 1\n          2 2\n\n        We'll compute the next:\n\n          After second query: array = [1,2,2,2,5]\n\n          Third query: 3 1 -> set the 3rd element (index2) to 1 -> becomes [1,2,1,2,5]\n\n          Steps for index2 (pos=2):\n\n            Remove adjacent transitions:\n              left: at index1 (between a[1] and a[2]): currently 2 and 2 -> same -> skip.\n              right: at index2 (between a[2] and a[3]): currently 2 and 2 -> same -> skip.\n\n            Then set a[2]=1.\n\n            Then add:\n              left: a[1]=2, a[2]=1 -> different -> add: (2)*(n-2)=2*(5-2)=2*3=6 -> ans=23+6=29\n              right: a[2]=1, a[3]=2 -> different -> add: (2+1)*(n-2-1)=3*(5-3)=3*2=6 -> ans=29+6=35.\n\n            So output 35.\n\n          Fourth query: 2 1 -> set the 2nd element (index1) to 1 -> becomes [1,1,1,2,5]\n\n          Steps for index1 (pos=1):\n\n            Remove adjacent transitions:\n              left: at index0 (between a[0] and a[1]): currently 1 and 2 -> different?

\n          But note: the problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\". So if a character does not appear in s, then we don't consider it.\n\n          However, note: the substring t might not contain both u and v? Then the condition: \n            If u is not in t, then frequency of u is 0. Similarly for v.\n            So if u is in s and v is in s, but one or both are not in t, then the condition must still hold? \n            Example: t does not contain u -> then frequency of u is 0. If v is in t, then frequency of v is at least 1 -> difference is at least 1 -> which is acceptable? \n            But note: the condition says \"not more than 1\", so 1 is acceptable.\n\n          However, consider: if t does not contain u but contains v, then |0 - f_t(v)| <= 1 -> so f_t(v) must be 0 or 1? \n          But if t has two v's? then |0-2|=2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the condition implies that in any substring t, no character that appears in s can appear more than once? \n          Why? \n            Let u be a character that appears in s. Then for any substring t that contains at least one occurrence of u, and for any other character v that appears in s (and might not be in t) we have |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n          But note: we can choose v to be a character that does not appear in t. Then f_t(v)=0, so we require f_t(u) <= 1.\n\n          Therefore, every character that appears in the entire string s must appear at most once in every substring? \n\n          However, that is too strong: consider the entire string s: if a character appears more than once in s, then in the substring t = s, we have f_t(u) = frequency of u in s. \n          Then for any other character v that appears in s, we require |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n          But also, consider a substring that is two identical characters: then for that substring, the frequency of that character is 2, and for any other character v (which is not in that substring) we have |2-0|=2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the condition forces that every substring must not contain any character more than once? \n\n          However, note: the problem says \"abc\" is perfectly balanced. \n          In \"abc\", every substring has distinct characters. \n\n          But what about \"aba\"? \n          The example says \"aba\" is perfectly balanced.\n\n          In \"aba\": \n            substring \"aba\": \n                f('a')=2, f('b')=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"aa\" does not occur? \n            Actually, the substring \"aa\" is not present.\n\n          How about the substring \"a\" and \"a\" (which are two different substrings) but the condition is per substring.\n\n          However, note: the condition must hold for every substring. In \"aba\", the substring \"a\" (the first 'a') has f('a')=1, f('b')=0 -> |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n          The substring \"b\": f('b')=1, f('a')=0 -> acceptable.\n          The substring \"ab\": f('a')=1, f('b')=1 -> |1-1|=0 -> acceptable.\n          The substring \"ba\": similarly acceptable.\n          The substring \"aba\": f('a')=2, f('b')=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n\n          But what about the substring \"aa\"? It doesn't appear.\n\n          However, what if we have \"aab\"? \n          Then we have substring \"aa\": \n            f('a')=2, f('b')=0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is equivalent to: \n            In every contiguous substring, the frequency of any character that appears in the entire string s is at most 1? \n          But wait: in \"aba\", we have a substring \"aba\" that has two a's. However, the condition is not that each character appears at most once, but that for any two characters u and v (that appear in s) the difference in frequencies is at most 1.\n\n          Actually, the condition is: \n            For a substring t, let M = max{ f_t(c) for c in s } and m = min{ f_t(c) for c in s }? \n            But note: the min and max are taken only over the characters that appear in s. However, the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\".\n\n          So we require for every substring t and for every pair (u,v) of characters that appear in s: |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n          This implies that in the substring t, the frequencies of any two characters that appear in s differ by at most 1.\n\n          This is equivalent to: \n            There exists an integer k such that for every character c in s, f_t(c) is either k or k+1.\n\n          And note: if a character c is not in t, then f_t(c)=0, so then k must be 0 and then every character must appear either 0 or 1 time? \n          But if k=0, then we can have at most one character that appears 1 time and the rest 0? \n          Actually, if we have two characters that appear in s: u and v, and in t we have u appears 1 time and v does not appear, then |1-0|=1 -> acceptable. \n          But if we have three characters: u, v, w, and in t we have u appears 1 time and v and w appear 0 times, then |1-0|=1 for (u,v) and (u,w) -> acceptable. \n          However, if we have two characters that appear 1 time? then |1-1|=0 -> acceptable. \n\n          But wait: what if we have a substring t that has two different characters? \n            Then we can have two characters each appearing once: then k=1? but then the condition is satisfied? \n          However, what if we have a substring that has three characters? \n            Then we can have each appearing once -> then k=1 -> all are 1 -> acceptable.\n\n          The problem is when we have a substring that has one character appearing twice and another character not appearing? \n            Then |2-0|=2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is violated if there is a substring that has at least one character appearing at least twice and at least one character (that appears in s) that does not appear in that substring.\n\n          Also, if a substring has two characters: one appearing twice and the other once? \n            Then |2-1|=1 -> acceptable? \n          But what if there is a third character that does not appear? Then we require |2-0|<=1 -> 2<=1? false.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is violated if there is a substring t and a character c in s that does not appear in t, and there is a character d that appears at least twice in t.\n\n          How to check for a string s?\n\n          Observation 1: \n            The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. \n\n          Observation 2:\n            Consider the entire string s: \n              Let the distinct characters in s be D.\n              Then for the entire string, we require that the frequencies of the characters in D differ by at most 1. \n              But note: the entire string might not contain all characters? Actually, by definition, the entire string s contains exactly the set D. \n              So the entire string must have frequencies that are either k or k+1 for some k.\n\n          However, that is necessary but not sufficient: we also require that every contiguous substring satisfies the condition.\n\n          Observation 3:\n            Consider a substring of length 1: \n              Then the frequency of the character in that substring is 1, and for any other character in D, the frequency is 0 -> |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n\n          Observation 4:\n            Consider a substring of length 2: \n              If the two characters are the same: then we have one character with frequency 2 and the other characters in D (if any) with frequency 0. \n                  Then for a character c that is not this one, we have |2-0|=2 -> not acceptable.\n              Therefore, the string cannot have two consecutive identical characters.\n\n          Therefore, if there is any two consecutive identical characters, then the substring of those two is not acceptable.\n\n          But note: the example \"aba\" does not have two consecutive identical characters? \n            \"aba\": \n                a, then b, then a -> no consecutive identical.\n\n          However, what about \"abc\": \n            consecutive: a and b -> different, b and c -> different.\n\n          Therefore, a necessary condition: the string has no two consecutive identical characters.\n\n          But is that sufficient? \n\n          Consider \"abc\": \n            We must check every substring.\n\n          How about a substring of length 3: \"abc\": \n            frequencies: a:1, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          How about a substring of length 2: \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> acceptable; \"bc\": same.\n\n          How about a substring of length 1: acceptable.\n\n          Now consider \"aba\": \n            substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n            But note: the condition requires for every pair: \n                (a,b): |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                (a,c): but c is not in the entire string? \n            The entire string s=\"aba\" has distinct characters: {'a','b'}. \n            So we only consider u and v in {'a','b'}.\n\n            Therefore, in the substring \"aba\", we have a:2, b:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          But what about a substring \"ab\" in \"aba\": \n            a:1, b:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          And \"ba\": same.\n\n          And the single letters: acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, \"aba\" is acceptable.\n\n          However, what about \"abcab\": \n            distinct characters: {'a','b','c'}.\n\n            Consider the substring \"abca\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n                |2-1|=1 for (a,b) and (a,c) -> acceptable? \n                But note: the condition requires for every pair: \n                    a and b: |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                    a and c: |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                    b and c: |1-1|=0 -> ok.\n\n            Now consider the substring \"bca\": \n                b:1, c:1, a:1 -> ok.\n\n            But what about the entire string \"abcab\": \n                a:2, b:2, c:1 -> \n                |2-1|=1 for (a,c) and (b,c) -> ok.\n                |2-2|=0 for (a,b) -> ok.\n\n            However, is there a problem? \n            Consider the substring \"a\" (the last a) and the substring \"ab\" (the last two) -> \n                \"a\": a:1 -> for any other character (b and c) -> |1-0|=1 -> ok.\n                \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> ok.\n\n            But wait: what about the substring \"aa\"? \n                The string \"abcab\" has two a's that are not consecutive: \n                    positions: 0 and 3 -> so the substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? \n                Actually, contiguous substring must be consecutive. So we cannot jump.\n\n            Therefore, the contiguous substrings of \"abcab\" that have two a's must include the characters in between? \n                The substring from index0 to index3: \"abca\" -> which we already checked.\n\n          However, what if we have \"abacaba\": \n            distinct: a,b,c.\n            substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"aca\": a:2, c:1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"aba\" at the end: same.\n\n            But what about the substring \"a\" at the beginning and the next 'a' at index2: \n                substring from index0 to index2: \"aba\" -> already checked.\n\n            But what about the substring from index0 to index3: \"abac\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n            And the entire string: \n                a:4, b:1, c:1 -> \n                |4-1|=3 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, \"abacaba\" is not acceptable.\n\n          How to check without enumerating all substrings? \n\n          We know:\n            Condition 1: The entire string must have frequencies that are either k or k+1 for the distinct characters? \n                But note: the entire string must satisfy: for every pair of distinct characters u and v: |f(u)-f(v)|<=1 -> so the frequencies are either k or k+1.\n\n            Condition 2: There are no two consecutive identical characters.\n\n            Condition 3: ??? \n\n          However, the entire string condition is necessary. But the consecutive condition is also necessary.\n\n          But are they sufficient? \n\n          Consider \"aba\": \n            entire string: a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n            no consecutive identical -> ok.\n\n          Consider \"abc\": \n            entire string: a:1, b:1, c:1 -> ok.\n            no consecutive identical -> ok.\n\n          Consider \"a\": \n            entire string: a:1 -> only one character -> no pair -> condition holds? \n            Actually, the condition: for every pair (u,v) of characters present in s: \n                There is only one character -> no pair? \n            The problem says \"for all possible triplets (t,u,v)\" ... but if there is only one character, then the set of pairs (u,v) is empty? \n            Then the condition holds.\n\n          Consider \"abacaba\": \n            entire string: a:4, b:1, c:1 -> |4-1|=3 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n            Step 1: Check the entire string: \n                Let freq = frequency of each character in s.\n                Let min_freq = min(freq.values())\n                Let max_freq = max(freq.values())\n                If max_freq - min_freq > 1: then \"NO\"\n\n            Step 2: Check consecutive identical: \n                For i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i]==s[i+1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else: \n                    # passed consecutive check\n\n            But wait: what if the entire string fails the frequency condition? Then we output \"NO\". \n\n          However, what about \"aab\": \n            entire string: a:2, b:1 -> max-min=1 -> passes the entire string condition.\n            consecutive: \"aa\" -> fails.\n\n          So we must check consecutive.\n\n          But is that sufficient? \n\n          Consider \"abcab\": \n            entire string: a:2, b:2, c:1 -> max-min=1 -> passes.\n            consecutive: no consecutive identical -> passes.\n\n            But we argued that the substring \"abcab\" (the entire string) is acceptable? \n                a:2, b:2, c:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> acceptable? \n                But note: the condition requires for every substring. \n                We also have the substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? \n                However, we have the substring \"abca\" (from index0 to index3): \n                    a:2, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n            But what about the substring \"a\" at index0 and the substring \"a\" at index3? \n                They are not contiguous? \n\n            However, the problem says contiguous substring. \n\n          But wait: the entire string \"abcab\" is acceptable? \n            We must check every contiguous substring.\n\n          How about the substring \"ca\": \n            c:1, a:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"ab\": acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"bc\": acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"abc\": acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"bca\": acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"cab\": acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"abca\": a:2, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          How about the substring \"bcab\": b:2, c:1, a:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          How about the entire string: a:2, b:2, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, \"abcab\" is acceptable.\n\n          But wait: what about the substring that is the two a's? \n            The two a's are not consecutive, so there is no contiguous substring that is \"aa\". \n\n          Therefore, the consecutive condition is only about adjacent characters.\n\n          However, what about \"abacaba\"? \n            entire string: a:4, b:1, c:1 -> fails the entire string condition -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n          But what about \"aabbaa\": \n            entire string: a:4, b:2 -> max-min=2 -> fails.\n\n          What about \"aabbcc\": \n            entire string: a:2, b:2, c:2 -> max-min=0 -> passes.\n            consecutive: \n                a and a -> consecutive -> fails.\n\n          What about \"abab\": \n            entire string: a:2, b:2 -> passes.\n            consecutive: no consecutive identical -> passes.\n\n            Now check substrings:\n                \"a\": a:1 -> for b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> ok.\n                \"b\": similar.\n                \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> ok.\n                \"ba\": same.\n                \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                \"bab\": b:2, a:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n                \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> ok.\n\n            So \"abab\" is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions we have so far are:\n            Condition 1: The entire string has the property that the frequencies of the distinct characters differ by at most 1.\n            Condition 2: The string has no two consecutive identical characters.\n\n          But is that sufficient? \n\n          Consider a string that satisfies these two conditions. Why would it be perfectly balanced?\n\n          We note that in any contiguous substring, the characters are distinct in consecutive positions? \n          But the substring might have repeated characters that are not consecutive? \n\n          However, the condition 2 ensures that no two consecutive are the same, but non-consecutive can be the same.\n\n          How to guarantee that in every contiguous substring, the frequencies of the distinct characters (that appear in the entire string) do not differ by more than 1?\n\n          Consider a substring t. The substring t might contain several occurrences of a particular character. \n          But note: because there are no consecutive identical, the occurrences of the same character must be separated by at least one other character.\n\n          Therefore, the maximum frequency of any character in a substring of length L is at most ceil(L/2). \n\n          And the minimum frequency of a character that appears in the entire string but might not appear in t is 0.\n\n          Therefore, we require that the maximum frequency in the substring is at most 1? \n          But that is not true: in \"aba\", the substring \"aba\" has a:2 -> which is more than 1.\n\n          However, we argued that \"aba\" is acceptable because the other character in the entire string (which is 'b') appears once, so the difference is 1.\n\n          But what if we have a substring that has one character appearing 2 times and another character that does not appear? \n            Then we require |2-0|<=1 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, the condition 1 (on the entire string) is not enough to prevent this in a substring? \n\n          How to ensure that in every substring, every character that appears in the entire string appears in the substring? \n          That is impossible: for example, a substring of length 1 cannot contain all distinct characters.\n\n          Therefore, the condition must be: \n            For every contiguous substring t, and for every character c that appears in the entire string s, the frequency of c in t is either 0 or 1? \n          But that is not true: in \"aba\", the substring \"aba\" has two a's.\n\n          Alternatively, we require that the entire string has at most two distinct characters? \n          Why? \n            Consider a string with three distinct characters: \n                entire string: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable for the entire string.\n                consecutive: no consecutive identical -> acceptable.\n\n            But consider the substring \"a\" (the first a): \n                a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n          So we must require that the entire string has at most two distinct characters? \n\n          Then \"aba\" has two distinct characters -> then it is acceptable? \n          But \"abc\" has three distinct characters -> then it is not acceptable? \n          But the example says \"abc\" is acceptable.\n\n          In \"abc\": \n            distinct characters: a, b, c.\n            substring \"a\": a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> acceptable.\n\n          Why did the substring \"aba\" in the three distinct character case fail? \n            Because we had a substring that had two a's and one b, and the character c was missing -> |2-0|=2.\n\n          But in \"abc\", we never have a substring that has two of the same character? \n            Because there are no repeated characters? \n\n          Therefore, if the string has no repeated characters at all, then every contiguous substring has distinct characters -> then the frequencies are 0 or 1 -> so the difference between any two is at most 1.\n\n          So we have two cases:\n\n            Case 1: The string has no repeated characters. Then it is acceptable.\n\n            Case 2: The string has repeated characters. Then by condition 2, the repetitions are not consecutive. \n                     But then we require that the entire string has exactly two distinct characters? \n\n          Why two? \n            Consider a string with three distinct characters and one character repeated (non-consecutive) -> then there will be a substring that contains two of that character and misses the third -> then |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, the only possibilities are:\n            - The string has no repeated characters (so it has distinct consecutive characters) -> acceptable.\n            - The string has exactly two distinct characters and the entire string has frequencies that differ by at most 1? \n              But wait: the entire string condition is necessary, but what about substrings?\n\n          Let the two distinct characters be a and b.\n\n          Consider a substring t. \n            The frequency of a in t: f_a, and frequency of b in t: f_b.\n            The condition: |f_a - f_b| <= 1? \n            But note: the problem requires for every pair of characters in the entire string (which are a and b) -> so we require |f_a - f_b|<=1.\n\n          Is that true for every contiguous substring? \n\n          Consider \"aba\": \n            substring \"a\": f_a=1, f_b=0 -> |1-0|=1 -> ok.\n            substring \"b\": f_a=0, f_b=1 -> ok.\n            substring \"ab\": f_a=1, f_b=1 -> ok.\n            substring \"ba\": same.\n            substring \"aba\": f_a=2, f_b=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n\n          Consider \"abab\": \n            substring \"aba\": f_a=2, f_b=1 -> |2-1|=1 -> ok.\n            substring \"bab\": f_a=1, f_b=2 -> |1-2|=1 -> ok.\n\n          Consider \"aabbaa\" (but wait, consecutive identical? -> not allowed) so we cannot have \"aa\". \n\n          How about \"abba\": \n            consecutive: 'b' and 'b' -> not allowed.\n\n          Therefore, the string with two distinct characters must be such that the two characters alternate.\n\n          But note: \"aba\" alternates: a, b, a.\n          \"abab\": a, b, a, b.\n\n          How about \"ababa\": \n            entire string: a:3, b:2 -> |3-2|=1 -> ok.\n            consecutive: no consecutive identical -> ok.\n\n            Check a substring: \n                \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> ok.\n                \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> ok.\n                \"bab\": a:1, b:2 -> |1-2|=1 -> ok.\n                \"aba\" (from index2 to index4): a:2, b:1 -> ok.\n                \"a\" (last) -> ok.\n\n          But what about the substring from index0 to index2: \"aba\" -> already checked.\n\n          Therefore, it seems that if the string has two distinct characters and they alternate (so no consecutive identical) and the entire string has frequencies that differ by at most 1, then it is acceptable.\n\n          However, note: the entire string condition is necessary, but is it sufficient for the substrings? \n            In a substring, the frequencies of a and b might differ by more than 1? \n            Example: \"aba\" -> substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> difference 1 -> ok.\n\n          How about a longer one: \"ababab\": \n            entire string: a:3, b:3 -> ok.\n            substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> difference 1 -> ok.\n            substring \"ababa\": a:3, b:2 -> difference 1 -> ok.\n\n          How about \"abababa\": \n            entire string: a:4, b:3 -> difference 1 -> ok.\n            substring \"ababa\": a:3, b:2 -> ok.\n            substring \"ababab\": a:3, b:3 -> ok.\n\n          But what about a substring that is not aligned? \n            substring from index0 to index3: \"abab\": a:2, b:2 -> ok.\n            substring from index1 to index4: \"baba\": a:2, b:2 -> ok.\n\n          Therefore, it seems that for two distinct characters that alternate, the condition holds.\n\n          But what if the alternation is broken? \n            We already require no consecutive identical, so the alternation is enforced.\n\n          Therefore, we can summarize:\n\n            Let D = set(s)\n\n            Case 1: |D| == 1: \n                Then the entire string is composed of one character. \n                Then for any substring: \n                    The frequency of that character is the length of the substring, and for any other character (there are none) -> condition holds? \n                    Actually, there are no pairs (u,v) to consider? \n                    So it is acceptable.\n\n            Case 2: |D| >= 2:\n                Condition A: The entire string must have frequencies that are either k or k+1 for the distinct characters? \n                    Actually, we require max_freq - min_freq <= 1.\n                Condition B: The string has no two consecutive identical characters.\n                Condition C: |D| must be 2? \n                    Why? Because if |D|>=3, then we can find a substring that contains two of one character and misses a third -> then |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n            Therefore, we require |D|==2.\n\n          But wait: what about \"abc\"? \n            |D|=3 -> fails condition C -> but the example says \"abc\" is acceptable.\n\n          How does \"abc\" avoid the problem? \n            In \"abc\", there is no repeated character. So every character appears at most once in the entire string? \n            Actually, in the entire string, each character appears once -> so max_freq=1, min_freq=1 -> condition A holds.\n            Condition B: no consecutive identical -> holds.\n            Condition C: |D|=3 -> but then we would fail? \n\n          However, in \"abc\", every contiguous substring has distinct characters? \n            So in any substring, the frequency of any character is either 0 or 1. \n            Therefore, for any two characters u and v that appear in the entire string, in a substring t: \n                |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| is either |0-0|=0, |0-1|=1, or |1-1|=0 -> always <=1.\n\n          Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n          So the key is: \n            If the string has no repeated character (i.e., all characters are distinct) then it is acceptable.\n\n          But note: \"aba\" has repeated 'a' -> so it is not distinct.\n\n          Therefore, we have two cases:\n\n            Case 1: The string has no repeated character -> then it is acceptable.\n\n            Case 2: The string has repeated characters -> then we require:\n                    (a) The entire string has exactly two distinct characters.\n                    (b) The entire string has frequencies that differ by at most 1.\n                    (c) The string has no two consecutive identical characters.\n\n          But note: if the string has repeated characters, then it must have at least one character that appears at least twice. \n          And if it has two distinct characters and no consecutive identical, then it is an alternating sequence of two characters.\n\n          However, what if the string has two distinct characters and one character appears only once and the other appears many times? \n            Example: \"ababab\" -> a:3, b:3 -> difference 0 -> acceptable.\n            Example: \"ababa\" -> a:3, b:2 -> difference 1 -> acceptable.\n\n          But what if the entire string has two distinct characters and the frequencies differ by more than 1? \n            Example: \"abaab\": \n                distinct: a,b -> a:3, b:2 -> difference 1 -> acceptable.\n            Example: \"abaa\": \n                distinct: a,b -> a:3, b:1 -> difference 2 -> not acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we require the entire string to have frequencies for the two characters differing by at most 1.\n\n          But note: the entire string condition is necessary, but is it sufficient for the substrings? \n            Consider \"abaa\": \n                consecutive: \n                    a and b -> ok.\n                    b and a -> ok.\n                    a and a -> not allowed -> fails condition (c) -> so we don't even get to the entire string condition.\n\n          Therefore, we must check condition (c) first.\n\n          Algorithm for one test case:\n\n            s = given string.\n\n            Step 1: Check for consecutive duplicates:\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else:\n                    # no consecutive duplicates found\n\n                    distinct = set(s)\n                    n_distinct = len(distinct)\n\n                    if n_distinct == 1:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        # Count frequencies\n                        from collections import Counter\n                        cnt = Counter(s)\n                        freqs = cnt.values()\n                        max_freq = max(freqs)\n                        min_freq = min(freqs)\n\n                        if n_distinct == 2 and max_freq - min_freq <= 1:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        elif n_distinct >= 3:\n                            # But if there is no repeated character?

TODO.\n\n          What is w? \n            s[:i] is the prefix of length i.\n            Then (s[:i]*a) repeats that prefix a times (which is the length of the string) and then takes the first a characters.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"aba\", a=3, i=2: \n                s[:2] = \"ab\"\n                (s[:2]*3) = \"ababab\"\n                then w = \"ababab\"[:3] = \"aba\" -> equals s -> then print \"YES\".\n\n          Example: s=\"abc\", \n            We skip the first part: b=3, a=3 -> so we don't enter the else.\n\n          Example: s=\"abacaba\": \n            We would find at i=2: \n                s[2] = 'a', which is in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> so we compute w = (s[:2]*7)[:7] = \"abababab\"[:7] = \"abababa\" -> which is not equal to \"abacaba\" -> so we do the TODO.\n\n          What should we do in the TODO? \n\n          Our solution: \n            We would output \"NO\" for \"abacaba\".\n\n          How about \"abab\": \n            i=2: s[2]='a', which is in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2]*4)[:4] = \"abab\" -> equals s -> then \"YES\".\n\n          How about \"ababa\": \n            i=2: s[2]='a' in \"ab\" -> then w = (s[:2]*5)[:5] = \"ababab\"[:5] = \"ababa\" -> equals s -> \"YES\".\n\n          How about \"abcab\": \n            We would not enter the for-loop? \n                i=0: skip (range(1,5))\n                i=1: s[1]='b' -> is it in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n                i=2: s[2]='c' -> not in \"ab\" -> no.\n                i=3: s[3]='a' -> in s[:3]=\"abc\" -> yes.\n                    w = (s[:3]*5)[:5] = \"abcabcabcabcabc\"[:5] = \"abcab\" -> equals s -> \"YES\".\n\n          But our solution for \"abcab\" is \"YES\", and the provided code would output \"YES\".\n\n          How about \"abb\": \n            The else part: \n                i=1: s[1]='b' -> in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n                i=2: s[2]='b' -> in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> yes.\n                    w = (s[:2]*3)[:3] = \"ababab\"[:3] = \"aba\" -> not equal to \"abb\" -> then we do TODO.\n\n          We want to output \"NO\" for \"abb\".\n\n          Therefore, in the TODO, we should output \"NO\" and break.\n\n          But note: the for-loop breaks after the first i where s[i] in s[:i]. \n\n          How about a string that has multiple repetitions? \n            Example: \"aabc\": \n                i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes.\n                    w = (s[:1]*4)[:4] = \"a\"*4 = \"aaaa\" -> not equal to \"aabc\" -> then output \"NO\".\n\n          But our solution: \n            consecutive duplicates: at i0: 'a' and 'a' -> duplicate -> output \"NO\".\n\n          However, the provided code already skipped the consecutive duplicate? \n            The provided code does not check consecutive duplicates? \n\n          How does the provided code ensure the consecutive duplicate condition? \n\n          The condition \"s[i] in s[:i]\" does not necessarily mean consecutive duplicate? \n            It means that the character at i has appeared before, but not necessarily at i-1.\n\n          But the problem requires no consecutive duplicates. \n\n          The provided code does not check consecutive duplicates explicitly? \n\n          However, note: the first part: \n            if b==1 or a==b: \n                print('YES')\n            else: \n                ... \n\n          Then in the else, we are in the case: \n            the string has repeated characters and the entire string has more than one distinct character and the entire string is not composed of distinct characters.\n\n          But the provided code then tries to see if the string is of the form (prefix)* (repeated) and then truncated to length a.\n\n          Why would that work? \n\n          Consider: \n            The condition for being perfectly balanced (with two distinct characters and alternating) is equivalent to the string being periodic with period = the number of distinct characters? \n            But note: the distinct characters are the ones in the prefix of length i? \n\n          Actually, the prefix s[:i] must contain all distinct characters? \n            Because if a character appears later that is not in the prefix, then the condition fails? \n\n          But the code breaks at the first i such that s[i] is in s[:i]. \n\n          How about a string with three distinct characters that has a repetition? \n            Example: \"abcab\": \n                The distinct characters are 3, and the entire string is not composed of distinct characters (because 5>3) -> so we enter the else.\n                Then we iterate i from 1 to 4:\n                    i=1: s[1]='b' in \"a\"? no.\n                    i=2: s[2]='c' in \"ab\"? no.\n                    i=3: s[3]='a' in \"abc\"? yes.\n                    Then w = (s[:3]*5)[:5] = \"abcabcabcabcabc\"[:5] = \"abcab\" -> equals s -> output \"YES\".\n\n          How about \"abac\": \n                distinct: 3, and length=4>3 -> else.\n                i=1: 'b' in \"a\"? no.\n                i=2: 'a' in \"ab\"? yes.\n                w = (s[:2]*4)[:4] = \"abab\" -> not equal to \"abac\" -> then we do TODO: output \"NO\".\n\n          But our solution: \n                consecutive: no consecutive duplicates -> \n                distinct=3, and there is repetition -> then we require distinct==2 -> fails -> \"NO\".\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          How about \"abacaba\": \n                i=2: 'a' in \"ab\" -> yes.\n                w = (s[:2]*7)[:7] = \"abababab\"[:7] = \"abababa\" -> not equal to \"abacaba\" -> output \"NO\".\n\n          Matches.\n\n          How about \"aab\": \n                consecutive: 'a' and 'a' -> we would hope to output \"NO\", but the provided code:\n                    distinct: 2, and length=3>2 -> else.\n                    i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes.\n                    w = (s[:1]*3)[:3] = \"aaa\" -> not equal to \"aab\" -> then output \"NO\".\n\n          But note: the consecutive duplicate is not explicitly checked, but the repetition at i=1 is caught.\n\n          However, what if the consecutive duplicate is at the beginning? \n            \"aa\": \n                distinct=1 -> then we output \"YES\" in the first if? \n                But distinct=1 -> b=1 -> output \"YES\", but that is wrong.\n\n          But wait: the consecutive duplicate in \"aa\" -> we should output \"NO\".\n\n          The provided code for \"aa\": \n                b = len(set(s)) = 1 -> so it outputs \"YES\".\n\n          This is a problem.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code has a flaw: it does not check consecutive duplicates.\n\n          How to fix? \n\n          We must check consecutive duplicates first.\n\n          But the problem says: the provided code is missing a block.\n\n          We can add a consecutive duplicate check at the beginning? \n\n          However, the provided code structure:\n\n            if b==1 or a==b:\n                print('YES')\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        ... \n\n          We can add the consecutive duplicate check in the else part? \n\n          But note: the consecutive duplicate might occur in the entire string, even if the entire string has distinct characters? \n            But if the entire string has distinct characters, then we don't enter the else.\n\n          So the consecutive duplicate must occur in the else part? \n\n          Actually, if there is a consecutive duplicate, then the string is not perfectly balanced.\n\n          We can do:\n\n"
