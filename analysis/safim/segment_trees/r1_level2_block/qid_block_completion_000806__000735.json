Then the if we are adding is at 8, and its body (the inner if and the assignment) should be at 12 and 16. But the existing code in the right for loop has:\n\n        s += i   # at 8\n        if s in d:   # at 8 So the block we are adding is the body of the if, so it should be at 12 and 16. Therefore, the string for program1 should be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1) But with the following spaces:\n\nLine1: 8 spaces + \"if s in d:\"\nLine2: 12 spaces + \"if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\"\nLine3: 16 spaces + \"r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nSo we represent as:\n\n\"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nThis uses 8, 12, and 16 spaces (which is 8, 8+4, 8+8). But the problem says the entire program is given with the TODO, and we are to replace the TODO line with this block. Therefore, we output the JSON as:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\",\n  \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n}\n\nBut for program2, we use two tabs for the print.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code so that it solves the problem of finding the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat while having the same total weight.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n1. It reads the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case:\n   a. Reads n (number of candies) and the list of weights.\n   b. Computes x as half of the total weight (using integer division). However, note that the goal is to have the same total weight, so the maximum possible common weight is at most half the total.\n   c. Then, it initializes a dictionary `d` and a variable `s` (to accumulate the sum from the left).\n   d. It iterates over the candies from left (index 0 to n-1) and for each:\n        s += current candy weight\n        if s exceeds x, break (since we cannot have a common sum greater than half the total? Actually, note: the common sum must be at most half, but we are building a dictionary of prefix sums that are <= x).\n        Otherwise, it maps the prefix sum to the number of candies taken (idx+1).\n\n   e. Then, it initializes s to 0 again and r (which will be the result for the test case) to 0.\n   f. It iterates over the candies from the right (reversed list) and for each:\n        s += current candy weight (from the right)\n        Then, there is a condition: if s in d, then we do something.\n\nThe problem: We are to find the maximum total number of candies (from both sides) such that the sum of the candies Alice ate (from the left) equals the sum of the candies Bob ate (from the right). And we want to maximize the total count.\n\nThe idea: \nWe can precompute the prefix sums from the left and store the number of candies (the index) for each prefix sum that does not exceed half the total. Then, we traverse from the right, accumulating the suffix sum. For each suffix sum, if we have seen the same sum from the left (and note: the same sum value must appear in the prefix and suffix without overlapping), then we can update the total candies as: \n   total_candies = (number of candies from the left for that sum) + (number of candies from the right for that sum)\n\nBut note: the dictionary `d` built from the left maps a prefix sum to the number of candies (which is the index+1). However, if the same prefix sum appears again, we want the earliest occurrence? Actually, we want the maximum number of candies? But note: we break when the prefix sum exceeds x (half the total). Also, we are traversing from left to right, so the last time we see a prefix sum is the one with the most candies? Actually, no: we want the maximum total candies. However, when we build the dictionary, we are storing the last index that gives that prefix sum? Actually, we are storing the index for the first time we achieve a prefix sum? No, we are storing the last index that achieves that prefix sum because we break when we exceed x. But note: we are iterating without skipping, so for a given prefix sum, we store the earliest index? Actually, we store the index at which we achieve that sum. But if the same sum appears again, we would overwrite? However, the prefix sums are increasing. So each prefix sum is unique? Actually, no: the weights are positive so the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, each prefix sum appears only once.\n\nBut note: the problem says the weights are positive, so the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, the dictionary `d` will have unique keys.\n\nIn the second loop (from the right), we accumulate the suffix sum. When we find that the current suffix sum `s` is in `d`, that means we have a prefix sum (from the left) that equals the suffix sum (from the right). Then, the total candies for that common sum would be: \n   left_count = d[s]   (the number of candies from the left)\n   right_count = idx+1 (because we are iterating from the right, and we have taken idx+1 candies from the right? Actually, note: we are iterating with `idx` starting at 0 for the first candy from the right. So after adding the first candy from the right, idx=0 and we have taken 1 candy. Similarly, after the second, idx=1 and we have taken 2 candies, etc.)\n\nBut note: the loop is over `a[::-1]`, which is the reversed list. The variable `idx` in the loop goes from 0 to n-1. However, we must note that the left part and the right part must not overlap. The condition for non-overlap: the left part must be taken from the beginning and the right part from the end, and the two segments must not meet in the middle. Specifically, the left part ends at index `d[s]-1` (0-indexed) and the right part ends at index `n-1-idx` (0-indexed). We require that the left part does not extend beyond the right part, i.e., `d[s] <= n-1-idx`? Actually, the candies taken by Alice are from 0 to d[s]-1, and by Bob from n-1 down to n-1-idx. So the next candy for Alice would be at d[s] and for Bob at n-1-idx-1. We require that the two segments do not overlap, meaning that the last candy of Alice is strictly to the left of the first candy of Bob. Therefore, we require: d[s] <= n - (idx+1)  [because Bob has taken idx+1 candies from the right, so the leftmost candy Bob took is at n-1-idx, and we require that the last candy Alice took (at index d[s]-1) is less than n-1-idx]. \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the candies in the middle are left? Actually, they can leave some in the middle. The condition is that the two sets of candies (Alice's and Bob's) are disjoint. Therefore, we must have:\n   d[s] + (idx+1) <= n   (because the total candies taken is d[s] from the left and idx+1 from the right, and they must not exceed n and not overlap). However, note that the entire set of candies is fixed. The two segments are disjoint by construction: one is at the beginning and one at the end. The only condition is that the left segment does not extend into the right segment. Therefore, we require that the left segment ends before the right segment begins: \n        d[s] <= n - (idx+1)\n\nBut note: the dictionary `d` was built without considering the right part. So when we have a suffix sum `s` that is in `d`, we must check that the left part does not overlap with the right part. However, the problem does not explicitly say that they cannot overlap? Actually, the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". So they cannot eat the same candy. Therefore, the two segments must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, when we have a common sum `s`, we can only consider it if the total number of candies taken (d[s] + (idx+1)) is at most n. But note: if we take d[s] from the left and idx+1 from the right, then the total candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). And we require that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is necessary and sufficient for non-overlap? Because the left segment covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the right segment covers [n-1-idx, n-1]. The two segments do not overlap if and only if d[s]-1 < n-1-idx, which is equivalent to d[s] <= n-1-idx. But note: we can also write d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n        d[s] + (idx+1) <= n   =>   d[s] <= n - (idx+1)\nThis is the same as the condition above.\n\nTherefore, we can update:\n        if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies is the number of candies they eat in total. And we are to maximize that.\n\nHowever, note: the dictionary `d` was built only for prefix sums that are at most x (half the total). But the suffix sum might exceed x? Actually, we break the left loop when the prefix sum exceeds x, but the suffix loop does not break? And we are iterating the entire right? But if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we might not have that sum in d? But also note: the common sum must be at most half the total? Actually, the common sum must be at most half the total because the entire total is fixed. So if the suffix sum is greater than half the total, then we cannot have a matching prefix sum? Because the prefix sums we stored are at most half. Therefore, we can break the right loop when the suffix sum exceeds x? But the problem does not require that, and the code does not break. However, it is safe to break if we want to optimize, but the constraints say the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we don't need to break. However, the left loop breaks when the prefix sum exceeds x. We can do the same for the right? Actually, we can break the right loop if the suffix sum exceeds x? Because then we won't find a matching prefix sum (since the prefix sums we stored are <= x). So we can add:\n        if s > x: \n            break   # but note: we are in the middle of the loop, and we break after updating?\n\nBut the provided code does not have that. We are only to complete the TODO part.\n\nThe TODO part in program1.py is inside the right loop. We have:\n        if s in d: \n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete the TODO block.\n\nSo we can do:\n        if s in d:\n            # Check non-overlap: the left part has d[s] candies, the right part has idx+1 candies, and we require that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable `idx` in the loop for the right part is the index in the reversed list. The first element in the reversed list is the last candy, so when we take one candy from the right, idx=0 and we have taken 1 candy. Similarly, two candies: idx=1 -> 2 candies. So the number of candies taken from the right is `idx+1`.\n\nHowever, note: the entire array might be taken? For example, in the second test case: n=3, [1,2,1] -> total=4, so x=2. \nLeft: \n   s=1 -> d[1]=1\n   s=3 -> break (because 3>2) -> so d has {1:1}\nRight:\n   reversed: [1,2,1]\n   idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes. Then total candies = d[1] (which is 1) + (0+1)=2. And 1+1=2<=3 -> valid. Then r=2.\n   Then add next: s=1+2=3 -> not in d? because d only has 1? and 3>2 so we didn't store it? Actually, we broke at the left when we got 3. Then next: s=3+1=4 -> not in d.\n\nBut the expected answer for the second test case is 6? Actually, wait: the second test case in the note is: \n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\nBut in the example above, we had n=3? Actually, the second test case: \n   Input: n=3, [7,3,20] -> no, wait: the note says the second test case: \n        \"The second line of each test case contains n integers: the weights. For the second test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8]? Actually, the note says: \n        For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6.\n\nSo the array must be of length 6: [7,3,20,5,10,8]? \nTotal weight = 7+3+20+5+10+8 = 53 -> half is 26.5, but we are using integer? Actually, the common sum is 30? Wait, the note says: \n        For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1] -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\nLet me re-read the note:\n\nNote:\nFor the first test case: ... answer=2.\nFor the second test case: ... answer=6.\nFor the third test case: ... answer=0.\nFor the fourth test case: ... answer=7.\n\nAnd the fourth test case: \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n   So the array must be [7,3,20, ... ,10,8,11,1]? Actually, the array is [7,3,20, ... ,10,8,11,1] and the middle is left? The total candies taken is 3+4=7.\n\nSo the second test case: \n   n=6, array = [7,3,20,5,10,8]? \n   Then total weight = 7+3+20+5+10+8 = 53. \n   Alice takes the first three: 7+3+20 = 30? But 30 is more than half (26.5). \n\nActually, the note says: \n   Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) -> wait, that doesn't add up: 7+3+20 = 30, but the note says 7? \n\nI see: the note says: \n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo? It should be 30? \n\nBut then the note says: Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7) -> that would be 8+10+5=23? \n\nWait, the note says: \"the first three candies from the right\" -> so the rightmost three: 8,10,5 -> 8+10+5=23? That doesn't equal 30.\n\nAlternatively, the note might have meant: \n   The second test case: n=3, [1,2,1] -> but then the answer would be 2? but the note says 6.\n\nI think the note has a typo. The problem says: \n   For the second test case: the answer is 6.\n\nAnd the array must be of length 6. And the common sum must be 30? \n\nActually, the sample input for the second test case is not provided. But the problem says: \n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nThis is inconsistent. But the problem states: \n   \"the second test case: ... the answer is 6\"\n\nSo the array has 6 candies. And they eat all 6. Then the common sum must be half the total? \n   total = 2 * s, so s = total/2. And they each eat s. Then the total candies eaten is 6.\n\nBut the note says: \n   Alice: first three -> total weight 7? \n   Bob: first three from the right -> total weight 7? \n   Then the entire array is eaten? Then the total weight is 7+7=14? Then half is 7. \n\nSo the array: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] -> \n   Alice: a0, a1, a2 -> 7\n   Bob: a5, a4, a3 -> 7\n   Then the middle is empty? \n\nSo the array: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] such that a0+a1+a2=7 and a3+a4+a5=7? Then total=14.\n\nSo the array: for example [1,2,4,3,3,1] -> \n   Alice: 1+2+4=7\n   Bob: 1+3+3=7? \n   But then the array is [1,2,4,3,3,1] -> and the middle is between a2 and a3? \n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nLeft prefix: \n   s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n   s1=3 -> d[3]=2\n   s2=7 -> d[7]=3 -> then break? because x = 14//2 = 7 -> so we break when s>7? but 7==7, so we store and then break at the next? Actually, the condition is \"if s > x: break\", so at the next candy we break? But we are at the last candy? \n\nThen we go to the right:\n   reversed: [1,3,3,4,2,1]\n   idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes. Then total candies = d[1] (1) + 1 = 2. And 1+1=2<=6 -> valid.\n   idx1: s=1+3=4 -> in d? no (d has 1,3,7) -> skip.\n   idx2: s=4+3=7 -> in d? yes. Then total candies = d[7] (3) + 3 (because idx2 -> 3 candies) = 6. And 3+3=6<=6 -> valid. So r=6.\n\nSo we get 6.\n\nTherefore, the code for the TODO in program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            # Check non-overlap: the left part has d[s] candies, the right part has idx+1 candies, and we require that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                if r < d[s] + (idx+1):\n                    r = d[s] + (idx+1)\n\nBut note: we can use max.\n\nSo we can write:\n        if s in d:\n            total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\n            if total_candies <= n:\n                r = max(r, total_candies)\n\nBut note: the condition total_candies<=n is necessary to avoid overlap? Actually, it ensures non-overlap? Because if total_candies<=n, then the left segment (d[s] candies) and the right segment (idx+1 candies) together take total_candies, which is at most n, meaning they don't overlap? Actually, they might overlap if the left segment extends beyond the middle? \n\nWait: the left segment takes the first d[s] candies (indices 0 to d[s]-1). The right segment takes the last (idx+1) candies (indices n-1-idx to n-1). The condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n ensures that the left segment does not extend into the right segment? \n\nExample: n=5, d[s]=3, idx+1=3 -> total=6>5 -> invalid. \nBut if d[s]=2, idx+1=2 -> total=4<=5 -> valid. Then the left segment: indices0,1 and the right segment: indices3,4 -> no overlap.\n\nTherefore, the condition is correct.\n\nBut note: what if the entire array is taken? Then d[s] + (idx+1) = n, which is valid.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n        if s in d:\n            total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\n            if total_candies <= n:\n                r = max(r, total_candies)\n\nBut note: the problem says that they can also choose to eat zero candies? and the answer for the third test case is 0. \n\nIn the third test case: \n   \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\nIn our code, initially r=0. Then we iterate and if we don't find any common sum, r remains 0. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            total_candies = d[s] + idx + 1\n            if total_candies <= n:\n                if total_candies > r:\n                    r = total_candies\n\nBut we can write more concisely:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut note: the variable `idx` is the index in the reversed array, so the number of candies from the right is `idx+1`. Therefore, we use `d[s] + (idx+1)`. But in the condition and the expression, we must use `d[s] + idx + 1` (which is the same as d[s] + (idx+1)).\n\nSo the code for the TODO block in program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we don't worry about performance.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe code is:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\telif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\telif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 3)\n\telse:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",4)\n\tt -= 1\n\nThe TODO is in the condition for division 2. The condition is: \n   if n >= 1600 and n <1900: \n        # TODO\n\nWe are to output the division for that rating. According to the problem:\n\nDivision 1: rating >= 1900\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\nDivision 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\nDivision 4: rating <= 1399\n\nSo for the condition 1600<=n<1900, we should print \"Division 2\".\n\nBut note: the condition in the code is written as:\n   if n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n\nThis condition is correct for division 2.\n\nSo the TODO block should be:\n   print(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the problem says to output exactly as the format: \"Division X\", and the existing prints are: \n   print(\"Division\",1) -> which outputs \"Division 1\" (without quotes, and with a space).\n\nSimilarly, we want \"Division 2\".\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n   print(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the condition for division 2 is already checked: n>=1600 and n<1900.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n   print(\"Division\", 2)\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nThe JSON object:\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\",\n  \"program2\": \"\t\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py TODO block is only one line? Actually, the existing code for the other conditions are one line. So we output one line.\n\nHowever, the TODO block in program2.py is in the middle of an elif, so we just need to replace the TODO comment with the print statement.\n\nBut note: the existing code for the other conditions are on the same line as the condition? Actually, the condition for division 1 is:\n\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nSo we do the same for division 2.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the line: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the indentation: it should be one level indented.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\",\n  \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n}\n\nBut the program1.py missing code is a block of three lines. We must output exactly the code that goes in the TODO block.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the program1 part as a string with newlines.\n\nBut note: the program1.py code currently has:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO comment with the three lines.\n\nBut the TODO comment is at the end of the if condition. So we replace the entire line? Actually, we replace the entire line with the block? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nSo we output the block that should replace the line with the TODO.\n\nTherefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut note: the original line was:\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that line and adding two more.\n\nSo the string for program1 should be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut note: the next line after the TODO in the original code is the end of the for loop? So we must not break the structure.\n\nTherefore, we output the three lines as above.\n\nBut note: the variable `r` is updated only when we have a common sum and non-overlap.\n\nNow, for program2, we output the line:\n\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the existing code uses tabs for indentation? The program2.py provided uses a mix: the condition is indented with a tab? Actually, the provided code:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\telif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\telif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 3)\n\telse:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",4)\n\tt -= 1\n\nWe see that the body of the while loop is indented by one tab. The conditionals are indented by one tab, and the print statements are indented by two tabs? Actually, the print statements are indented by one tab and then one more tab? Or spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. We can use the same as the existing print statements: they have a tab (or 8 spaces?).\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We can use the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nIn the provided program2.py, the print statements for division 1, 3, and 4 are indented with one tab (or 4 spaces? we can't see). But the TODO is in the same block. So we output the same as the print for division 1: which is:\n\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nSo for division 2, we output:\n\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\nBut with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the existing code for division 1 has no space after the comma? Actually, it has: \"Division\",1 -> no space. But we can put a space? It doesn't matter. However, to be consistent, we can write without a space: \"Division\",2.\n\nBut the problem does not care about the space. The output is: \"Division X\", and the space between the comma and the number in the print statement will result in a space? \n\nIn Python: \n   print(\"Division\", 2) -> outputs \"Division 2\"\n\nBecause the print function by default separates arguments by a space.\n\nSo we can write: \n   print(\"Division\", 2)\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut note: the condition for division 2 is written as: \n   elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n\nSo we replace the TODO line with the print.\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"}\n\nBut wait: the program2.py code uses tabs? The provided code in the problem for program2.py uses:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\t...\n\nThe indentation for the inner block is one tab? Actually, we can't see. But the problem does not specify. We can use the same as the existing print statements: they are indented by one level. In the provided code, the print for division1 is indented by two tabs? Or one tab? \n\nActually, the code:\n\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = ...   -> one tab\n\tif ...:    -> one tab\n\t\tprint(...)   -> two tabs\n\nSo we use two tabs for the print in the condition.\n\nBut in the TODO, we are replacing a line that is at the same level as the condition? Actually, the TODO is in the elif block, which is at the same level as the if. Then the body of the elif should be indented one more level.\n\nSo the existing code for the division1 condition has the print indented by one more tab (or 4 spaces). \n\nTo be safe, we can use the same as the existing print in the division1 condition: which is two tabs? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the provided code for program2.py in the problem uses:\n\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nSo the print is indented by one level (one tab or 4 spaces) relative to the if.\n\nTherefore, we can use the same: one tab (or 4 spaces) for the print. But the problem does not specify tabs or spaces. \n\nSince the provided code in the problem uses spaces? Actually, we can't tell. But the problem says: output the missing code. We can use 4 spaces for each level? \n\nBut the program2.py provided in the problem has:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\t...\n\nThe body of the while is indented by 4 spaces? The body of the if is indented by 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. We can output the same as the existing print in the if block: which is 8 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact string that is in the existing print for division1. \n\nBut note: the problem says to output the missing code. We are to replace the TODO line with a print statement that is at the same indentation level as the print in the if block.\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output the string: \n\t\"print(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n\nBut with the same indentation as the print for division1. Since the print for division1 is at one level of indentation inside the if, we do the same.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact whitespace. However, the example output for program1 uses 8 spaces for the inner block? \n\nTo be safe, we can use 4 spaces for the first indent and 4 more for the inner? \n\nBut the provided program1.py code uses spaces? \n\nActually, the program1.py provided:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n    n = int(input())\n    a = [*map(int, input().split())]\n    ...\n\nIt uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nSimilarly, program2.py provided:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\t...\n\nIt uses tabs? Or spaces? We can't tell. But the problem says: output the missing code. We can use the same as the existing code in the same program.\n\nFor program2.py, the existing print for division1 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nWe can output the same for division2: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\nBut with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output the string: \"print(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\" with the same indentation as the existing print in the if block.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact whitespace. Since the existing code in program2.py for the print uses 8 spaces (if we assume 4 per indent) or one tab and then one more tab? \n\nTo avoid ambiguity, we can use the exact string that is in the existing print for division1, but change the 1 to 2.\n\nBut the existing print for division1 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nSo we output: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\nBut note: the comma and the 2: we can have a space? It doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the line exactly as:\n\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut the existing division1 print has no space: \"Division\",1 -> so we do \"Division\",2.\n\nBut the space is not significant. The print function will output a space between the two arguments.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\nFor program2: \"print(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n\nBut with the same indentation as the existing print in the if block. Since the problem does not specify the exact whitespace for the indentation, we assume that the environment will accept the same as the existing code.\n\nIn summary:\n\nprogram1: \n  We replace the line \"        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\" with:\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut note: the original line had a comment. We remove the comment.\n\nSo the block is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nprogram2:\n  We replace the line \"\t\t# TODO: Your code here\" with:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\", 2)\n\nBut the existing print for division1 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nSo we write:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases for program1 is at most 200000, so the inner loops are acceptable.\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nImportant: We must escape the quotes and newlines.\n\nFor program1: \n  The string: \n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n  We represent as: \n        \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nFor program2:\n  The string: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\n  But note: the existing code in program2 uses two tabs? We'll use the same as the existing print. We represent as:\n        \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n\nBut wait, the existing code in program2 for the print in division1 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nWe assume it is indented by two tabs? Actually, the code:\n\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = ...   -> one tab\n\tif ...:    -> one tab\n\t\tprint(...)   -> two tabs\n\nSo we use two tabs.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. Alternatively, we can use 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are to replace the TODO line, which is at the same level as the condition, and the body of the condition should be indented one more. \n\nSince the provided code for program2 uses tabs for the inner blocks, we use two tabs for the print.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"}\n\nBut note: the program2 part: we use two tabs? But the existing print for division1 is also two tabs? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact string that would be in the program: \n\nFor program2: the line should be exactly as the print for division1, but with 2. So if the existing print for division1 is two tabs and then the print statement, then we do the same.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact whitespace. We'll use two tabs for program2.\n\nBut the program1 uses spaces? The program1 provided:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n    n = int(input())\n    a = [*map(int, input().split())]\n    ...\n\nIt uses 4 spaces per indent. The TODO block is inside two loops? \n\nThe outer loop: for _ in ... -> 4 spaces\nThen n = ... -> 8 spaces\nThen a = ... -> 8 spaces\nThen the rest: 8 spaces for the outer, and then the inner loops add 4 more.\n\nThe TODO block is inside:\n   for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   -> 12 spaces (if 4 per indent) \n        s += i   -> 16 spaces\n        if s in d: ...   -> 16 spaces\n\nSo the block we are adding should be at 16, 20, 20 spaces? \n\nBut the provided code for program1 has:\n\n    x = sum(a) // 2\n    s, d = 0, {}\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: break\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO line is at 12 spaces? (if 4 per indent) \n\nActually, the code:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):   # 0\n    n = int(input())            # 4\n    a = [*map(int, input().split())]   # 4\n    x = sum(a) // 2             # 4\n    s, d = 0, {}                # 4\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a): # 4\n        s += i                  # 8\n        if s > x: break         # 8\n        d[s] = idx + 1          # 8\n    s, r = 0, 0                 # 4\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   # 4\n        s += i                  # 8\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here   # 8\n\nSo the TODO line is at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are to replace the TODO line with a block. The block should be:\n\n        if s in d:   -> 8 spaces? \n            if ...   -> 12 spaces\n            ...      -> 12 spaces\n\nBut the existing code for the left loop has:\n\n        s += i                  # 8\n        if s > x: break         # 8\n        d[s] = idx + 1          # 8\n\nSo the inner block of the for loop is indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 in total, since the for is at 4).\n\nTherefore, the block we add for the right loop should be:\n\n        if s in d:   # at 8 spaces\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:   # at 12 spaces\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)   # at 12 spaces? or 16? \n\nBut the existing code in the left loop: the inner if and the assignment are at 8 and 8? \n\nActually, the left loop:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):   # 4 spaces\n        s += i                    # 8 spaces\n        if s > x: break           # 8 spaces\n        d[s] = idx + 1            # 8 spaces\n\nSo the inner block of the for loop is at 8 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, the right loop:\n\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   # 4 spaces\n        s += i                          # 8 spaces\n        ...   # the block we add: \n        if s in d:                      # 8 spaces\n            ...                         # 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the existing code for the right loop has the line:\n\n        s += i   # at 8 spaces\n\nand then the if condition at 8 spaces.\n\nSo the block we add should be:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nwith the first if at 8 spaces, the inner if at 12, and the assignment at 12? \n\nBut the problem says: the entire program is given and we are to fill the missing lines. We are replacing the line:\n\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nwith:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut the assignment to r is a single statement, so it can be at the same level as the inner if? \n\nActually, the inner if has a block of one statement. So:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nThis is three lines.\n\nThe first line: 8 spaces + \"if s in d:\"\nThe second line: 12 spaces + \"if ...:\"\nThe third line: 16 spaces? or 12 spaces? \n\nIn Python, the body of an if is indented one level. The standard is 4 spaces per indent.\n\nSo:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nThis would be:\n\nLine1: 8 spaces + \"if s in d:\"\nLine2: 12 spaces + \"if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\"\nLine3: 16 spaces + \"r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nBut the existing code in the left loop does not use 16 spaces for the inner block? \n\nActually, the left loop does not have nested ifs. But the right loop we are writing has nested ifs.\n\nTherefore, we use 16 spaces for the innermost assignment.\n\nBut the provided code for the left loop has:\n\n        if s > x: break\n\nThis is at 8 spaces. It is a single statement.\n\nSo for nested ifs, we must indent further.\n\nTherefore, the block should be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nWith 8, 12, and 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, to be safe, we use the standard.\n\nBut the program1.py provided uses 4 spaces per indent. So:\n\n- The outer for: 4\n- The inner for: 8\n- The if: 12\n- The inner if: 12? and the assignment: 16? \n\nActually, the first for loop (left) is at 4, and its body is at 8. The right for loop is at 4, and its body is at 8. Then the if we are adding is at 8, and its body (the inner if and the assignment) should be at 12 and 16.\n\nBut the existing code in the right for loop has:\n\n        s += i   # at 8\n        if s in d:   # at 8\n\nSo the block we are adding is the body of the if, so it should be at 12 and 16.\n\nTherefore, the string for program1 should be:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\nBut with the following spaces:\n\nLine1: 8 spaces + \"if s in d:\"\nLine2: 12 spaces + \"if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\"\nLine3: 16 spaces + \"r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nSo we represent as:\n\n\"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\nThis uses 8, 12, and 16 spaces (which is 8, 8+4, 8+8).\n\nBut the problem says the entire program is given with the TODO, and we are to replace the TODO line with this block.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\",\n  \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"\n}\n\nBut for program2, we use two tabs for the print.\n\nAlternatively, if the program2 uses 4 spaces per indent, then the while body is 4, the if is 8, and the print is 12. But the provided code in the problem for program2 uses:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile t > 0:\n\tn = int(input())\n\tif n >= 1900:\n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\t...\n\nThe while body is indented by 4 spaces? The if is indented by 8 spaces? The print is indented by 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. We'll use two tabs for program2 to match the existing print in the if block.\n\nBut the existing print for division1 is: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",1)\n\nWe output the same for division2: \n\t\tprint(\"Division\",2)\n\nWith the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + idx + 1 <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"\\t\\tprint(\\\"Division\\\", 2)\"}\n\nBut note: in program2, the existing code for the division1 print might be with two tabs, so we use two tabs.\n\nWe output this JSON string."
