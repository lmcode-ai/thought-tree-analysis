So for the root with d children, we need at least 1 (to infect the root) + 1 (to inject the first child) + (d-1) (to spread the remaining children) = d+1 seconds? But wait, the spreading at second 3: we infect one more child of the root. Then at second 4, we can spread again?

But the condition: \"if at least one child of v is infected\" -> none of the children are infected, so we cannot spread. Therefore, the known solution might be flawed for n=3. However, note: the problem says: \n                        \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\"\n\n                    The key: \"at least one child of v is infected\" -> so if no child is infected, we cannot spread. So the minimal seconds for n=3 is 3. But then why does the provided code for program2.py return 2 for n=3? Let me check the subtraction: count =",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about determining if we can obtain a given array `a` by performing operations that:\n   - Start with an array of zeros and a pointer at the first element.\n   - Operations: \n        1. If not at the last element: increase current element by 1 and move to next.\n        2. If not at the first element: decrease current element by 1 and move to previous.\n   - After all operations, the pointer must be at the first element.\n\n We are given the constraints and the note that the total sum of the array must be zero (because every time we move forward we add 1 and backward we subtract 1, and we end at the first element so the net movement is zero? Actually, note: the operations change the array and move the pointer. The net effect on the array's total sum: \n   - Operation 1: adds 1 to the current and moves to next -> total sum increases by 1.\n   - Operation 2: subtracts 1 from the current and moves to previous -> total sum decreases by 1.\n   But note: we start and end at the first element. The entire journey: we must have the same number of forward moves as backward moves? Actually, no: because we start at the first and end at the first, the net displacement is zero. However, the total sum of the array is the net number of times we added 1 without subtracting? Actually, we can break down:\n\n   Let x_i be the number of times we left the i-th element to the next (so we did operation1 at i) and y_i the number of times we left the i-th element to the previous (operation2 at i). But note that we also have arrivals: \n   - For the first element: we start there. We leave it by operation1 (if we ever do) and we can come back by operation2 from the second element. Similarly, for the last element, we can only leave by operation2? Actually, we can only leave the first element by going forward, and the last by going backward.\n\n   Actually, we can model the array as:\n        a[0] = (number of times we left the first element by operation1) - (number of times we arrived at the first element by operation2 from the second) \n        But note: we start at the first and end at the first. So the net times we leave the first by forward must equal the net times we arrive at the first by backward? Actually, we start at first and end at first, so the net forward moves from first must be one more than the backward moves to first? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the entire path as a sequence of moves. The array element a[i] is the number of times we were at i and moved forward (adding 1) minus the number of times we were at i and moved backward (subtracting 1). \n\n   Also, the transitions: \n        The number of times we enter an element i (from i-1 by a forward move or from i+1 by a backward move) must equal the number of times we leave it (by a forward move to i+1 or a backward move to i-1), except for the first element at the start and the end.\n\n   However, note the problem states that after operations the pointer is at the first element. So the entire journey is a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\n   We can use the following known conditions:\n        1. The total sum of the array must be 0. (Because every forward move adds 1 and every backward move subtracts 1, and the entire journey is a closed loop? Actually, no: the moves are not independent. But note: the entire set of operations: \n           - Each forward move: adds 1 to the current and moves to next -> total sum += 1.\n           - Each backward move: subtracts 1 from the current and moves to previous -> total sum -= 1.\n           So the total sum of the array is the net number of forward moves minus backward moves. However, we start at 0 and end at 0? Actually, we start at the first and end at the first, but the moves are not independent of the position. \n\n   Actually, we can consider the entire sequence of moves: \n        Let F = total forward moves, B = total backward moves. Then the total sum of the array is F - B. \n        Also, the net displacement: F - B = 0? But note: we start at index0 and end at index0, so the net displacement is 0. However, the total sum of the array is F - B? And indeed F-B must be 0. So condition: sum(a) = 0.\n\n   But there are more conditions. We can model the array as:\n        Let b_i be the net number of times we passed through i? Actually, we can use a prefix sum.\n\n   Consider: \n        Let p0 = 0 (the starting point, and we haven't done any move)\n        After the first move: if we go forward: then we set a0 = a0+1 and move to index1 -> so the prefix sum for index0 becomes 1? \n\n   Actually, we can define a prefix sum array P where:\n        P0 = a0\n        P1 = a0 + a1\n        ...\n        P_{n-1} = a0 + ... + a_{n-1}\n\n   How does the operation affect the prefix sum?\n        Operation1 at position i: we add 1 to a_i and then move to i+1. This adds 1 to all prefix sums from i to the end? Actually, no: the prefix sum at j>=i becomes increased by 1? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the operations are similar to a walk. We can define the state as (position, the current array). \n\n   However, known solution for this problem: \n        Conditions:\n          1. The total sum must be 0.\n          2. The prefix sums must be non-negative (because we cannot have negative \"available\" moves?).\n          3. Additionally, once the prefix sum becomes zero at some index i, then from that point on the entire array from i to the end must be zero? Why? Because we cannot go back to the beginning without leaving a negative prefix? Actually, no: but note that if we have a zero at some point, then the entire segment from that point onward must be traversed without ever going back beyond that point? \n\n   Actually, the known solution from similar problems (like Codeforces Round 844 (Div. 1 + Div. 2) problem A) is:\n        - The total sum must be 0.\n        - The prefix sums must be non-negative.\n        - And once the prefix sum becomes zero at some index, then we cannot have any non-zero element after that? Why? Because if we have a non-zero element after a zero prefix, then we would have to come back and that would break the non-negativity? \n\n   But note the example: \n        n=4, a = [2, -1, -1, 0] -> Yes.\n\n        Prefix: \n            p0 = 2 (>=0)\n            p1 = 2 + (-1) = 1 (>=0)\n            p2 = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> then we set a flag that we have encountered zero.\n            p3 = 0 + 0 = 0 -> but then we have non-zero? Actually, no: the last element is zero.\n\n        However, what if we have: [1, -1, 1, -1]? \n            p0=1 (>=0)\n            p1=0 -> then we set flag.\n            p2=1 -> but then we have a positive after zero? This is not allowed? \n\n        Actually, the example [1, -1, 1, -1] is not possible? Why? Because we start at index0. We do:\n            Operation1: [1,0] and pointer at index1 -> then we cannot go back to index0 without decreasing index1? But then we do:\n            Operation2: [1, -1] and pointer at index0 -> then we do operation1 again: [2, -1] and pointer at index1 -> then we do operation1: [2,0] and pointer at index2 -> then we do operation2: [2,0,-1] and pointer at index1 -> then operation2: [2,-1,-1] and pointer at index0 -> then we have to stop? But we have [2,-1,-1] and we need [1,-1,1,-1]? \n\n        Actually, the array has 4 elements? The example [1,-1,1,-1] has 4 elements. How would we get the last element? \n\n        Alternatively, known solution from similar problems: \n          We traverse the array and maintain the prefix sum. \n          We require that the prefix sum is non-negative and that once we have encountered a zero in the prefix sum, then the rest of the array must be zero.\n\n        Why? Because if we have a zero prefix at index i, that means we have returned to the start (in terms of the entire journey from the start to i and back) and then we cannot leave the start again? Actually, the pointer is at the first element at the end, so if we have a zero prefix at index i, then we are at the first element at that moment? But note: the operations are continuous. \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n          - The prefix sums must be non-negative.\n          - And if at some point i (with i < n-1) the prefix sum becomes zero, then we cannot have any non-zero element after that? Because if we do, we would have to leave the first element again? But the rule says after we are done the pointer has to be on the first element. So if we have a zero prefix at index i, that means we are at the first element at that moment? Then we can start a new journey? \n\n        However, the problem does not require that we are at the first element during the operations, only at the end. So we can leave and come back multiple times? \n\n        But note: the operations are sequential. The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              total = 0\n              valid = True\n              seen_zero = False\n              for i in range(n):\n                  total += a[i]\n                  if total < 0:\n                      valid = False\n                  if total == 0:\n                      seen_zero = True\n                  else:\n                      if seen_zero:\n                          valid = False\n              if total != 0:\n                  valid = False\n              print(\"Yes\" if valid else \"No\")\n\n        However, the example [2, -1, -1, 0] would be:\n          total: \n            i0: 2 -> not zero, and we haven't seen zero? -> valid so far.\n            i1: 1 -> not zero, but we have seen zero? -> no, because we set seen_zero only when we hit zero? Actually, we set seen_zero when we hit zero. In this example, we haven't hit zero until i2? \n            i2: 0 -> set seen_zero to True.\n            i3: 0 -> but then we are at a zero and we have seen_zero? and then we check: if the current total is non-zero? no, it's zero -> then we don't set the else condition. \n\n        But the example [1, -1, 1, -1]:\n          total: \n            i0: 1 -> not zero, seen_zero=False -> then set seen_zero=False? \n            i1: 0 -> set seen_zero=True.\n            i2: 1 -> non-zero and seen_zero is True -> invalid.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is to set the condition: if we have seen a zero prefix (meaning we have returned to the start at some point) and then we encounter a non-zero element (so the prefix becomes non-zero again) then it's invalid.\n\n        In the code provided, we have:\n            if psum < 0: return 0\n            if psum==0: f = 1   # meaning we set a flag that we have seen zero\n            elif f: \n                # then we have non-zero prefix and we have seen zero before -> invalid\n\n        So we should return 0 in that case.\n\n        Therefore, in the TODO block: we should write:\n            return 0\n\n        But note: we cannot break immediately? Because we have to check the entire array? Actually, if we see one violation we can return 0.\n\n        So the code for the for-loop:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return 0\n                if psum==0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:\n                    return 0\n\n        However, what if we have multiple zeros? For example: [1, -1, 0, 0] -> \n            i0: psum=1 -> f=0\n            i1: psum=0 -> f=1\n            i2: psum=0 -> then we do the if psum==0: set f=1 (it's already 1) -> then no problem.\n            i3: psum=0 -> same.\n\n        But what about [0,0,0]? \n            i0: psum=0 -> f=1\n            i1: psum=0 -> then we do if psum==0: set f=1 (already 1) -> then no problem.\n            i2: same.\n\n        So the condition: if we have seen a zero (f becomes 1) and then we get a non-zero, then we return 0.\n\n        But note: the condition is written as \"elif f\": meaning if psum !=0 and f is true -> then return 0.\n\n        However, what if we have a negative? We already check psum<0 and return 0.\n\n        So the missing line is: \n            return 0\n\n        But note: we must break the loop as soon as we see an invalid condition.\n\n        Therefore, in the TODO block, we can write:\n            return 0\n\n        However, we must note that the function returns 0 (meaning \"No\") as soon as we see a non-zero after a zero.\n\n        But what if we have multiple segments? Actually, the condition is that once we return to zero (meaning we are back at the start) we cannot leave again. So any non-zero after that is invalid.\n\n        So the code for program1.py: the missing line is \"return 0\"\n\n        But wait: the example in the note: \n            The second test case: n=4, a = [2,0,-1,0] -> but wait, the example in the note was: \n                $$$\\langle \\underline{0}, 0, 0, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 1, \\underline{0}, 0, 0 \\rangle \\to \\langle \\underline{1}, -1, 0, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, \\underline{-1}, 0, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, 0, \\underline{0}, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, \\underline{0}, -1, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle \\underline{2}, -1, -1, 0\\rangle$$$\n            The resulting array is [2, -1, -1, 0]? \n\n            But the example input says: \n                The second test case: n=4, and the array is [2,0,-1,0]? Actually, the note says: \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case\" and the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]? \n\n            The problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n            So the example array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\n            Let's check with our conditions:\n                total = 2 -1 -1 +0 = 0 -> condition 1 passed.\n                prefix: \n                    i0: 2 -> non-negative, and not zero -> f=0\n                    i1: 1 -> non-negative, not zero -> f=0\n                    i2: 0 -> set f=1\n                    i3: 0 -> non-zero? no, it's zero -> so we don't trigger the elif f.\n\n            So it would be valid.\n\n            But the example in the note also says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so that test case is invalid? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\". So the first test case in the note is invalid? \n\n            The problem states: \"You are given an array a. Determine whether it's possible to obtain a after some operations or not.\" and the operations must end with the pointer at the first element.\n\n            The example in the note for the second test case is valid.\n\n            Now, what if we have [2,0,-1,0]? \n                total = 2+0-1+0 = 1 -> not zero -> invalid.\n\n            So the example in the note is [2,-1,-1,0] and not [2,0,-1,0]. \n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n            in the block: \n                elif f:\n                    return 0\n\n        So we write: \n            return 0\n\n        But note: we must also check that at the end the prefix sum is zero? Actually, we already check the total sum at the beginning: if sum(arr)!=0: return 0. So we don't need to check again at the end.\n\n        However, what if the total sum is zero but the prefix becomes negative at the last element? Actually, we check in the loop for every prefix. \n\n        So the code for program1.py is complete with the missing line: \"return 0\"\n\n        But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can break early.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \"return 0\"\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: minimal seconds to infect a rooted tree (root at 1). \n Operations per second:\n   - Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, you can choose at most one other child to infect (so you can infect one additional child per vertex that has at least one child already infected? But note: the spreading operation: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\". So if a vertex v has multiple children and at least one is infected, then we can infect one more in this second? \n   - Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\n We start with no infected, and we repeat until the whole tree is infected.\n\n We are to compute the minimal seconds.\n\n Known solution: \n   We note that the root can be infected by injection at time 0? Actually, the problem says initially all are healthy. Then the first second: \n        Injection: we can choose the root? Then the root becomes infected at time 1? \n        But note: the process: each second we do spreading then injection? Actually, the problem says: \"each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation\". \n\n   So at time 1 (first second):\n        Spreading: nothing because no child of any vertex is infected? Then injection: we inject the root.\n\n   Then at time 2: \n        Spreading: the root has at least one child infected? Actually, no: we only infected the root. Then we can spread from the root? The root has children that are healthy? But the condition: \"if at least one child of v is infected\" -> the root has no infected child? So we cannot spread from the root. Then we do injection: we inject one of the children.\n\n   Alternatively, we can inject a child in the first second and the root in the second second? But the problem: we can choose any healthy vertex in the injection step. \n\n   However, we are free to choose the order of injections and the spreading choices.\n\n   We can use a BFS or DFS to compute the children. \n\n   The known solution from similar problems (like Codeforces Round 844 (Div. 1 + Div. 2) problem C) is:\n\n        We build the tree. The root is 1. Then for each vertex, we count the number of children.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            Let deg[i] = number of children of i.\n\n            Then we consider the root: initially, we must inject the root? Actually, we can start by injecting the root at time 1. Then the root is infected. Then in the next second, we can spread from the root to one child? But note: the spreading operation: we can only spread if at least one child is infected? At the beginning of the next second, the root has no infected child? So we cannot spread? Then we have to inject a child? Then the root now has one infected child, so in the next second we can spread to another child? \n\n        Actually, the process:\n\n            Second 1: \n                Injection: infect the root -> infected: {root}\n            Second 2:\n                Spreading: for the root, it has no infected child? -> so we don't spread from the root.\n                Injection: we can infect one child of the root (say u) -> infected: {root, u}\n            Second 3:\n                Spreading: for the root, now it has one infected child (u) -> so we can spread to another child (say v) -> now infected: {root, u, v}\n                Injection: we can infect a child of u? or a child of v? or a child of the root? \n\n        How to generalize?\n\n        We can use a greedy strategy: \n            We note that the spreading operation can be done on multiple vertices at the same second. \n\n        Alternate solution:\n\n            We can use a DFS to compute the maximum time needed for the subtree? \n\n        However, note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n        Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces problem \"Falling Anvils\"?) actually not. \n\n        Actually, from a known solution for the same problem (Codeforces Round 844, problem C) \"Another Array Problem\":\n\n            We can do:\n\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    parent = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    # Build children list\n                    children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n                    for i in range(2, n+1):\n                        p = parent[i-2]   # because the input has p2, p3, ... p_n for vertices 2..n\n                        children[p].append(i)\n\n                    # Count the number of children for each node\n                    deg = [len(children[i]) for i in range(1, n+1)]\n\n                    # We are going to simulate the infection? \n                    # Instead, we can use a greedy: \n                    #   We start with the root infected at time 1 (by injection at second 1).\n                    #   Then we have to clean the children.\n\n                    # But note: the spreading operation: we can only spread one child per vertex that has at least one infected child? \n\n                    # Actually, we can model: \n                    #   Let f(u) be the minimal time to infect the entire subtree rooted at u, assuming that at time 0 we start with u not infected and we are about to do the next second? \n                    #   However, the problem is global.\n\n                Alternate known solution (from a known submission for the same problem):\n\n                    We count the number of children for the root and for other nodes? \n\n                    Steps:\n\n                        We collect the degrees (number of children) for each node.

Actually, the input `a` is the list of parents for vertices 2..n. So the parent of vertex 2, vertex 3, ... vertex n. \n\n                        Then `counter` counts how many times each parent appears? That is, the number of children of a node? \n\n                        But note: the root (node 1) is not in the list? So we must account for the root? \n\n                    Actually, the root will appear in the list? Because the parent of vertex 2 might be 1. \n\n                    Then `count = list(counter.values())` -> this is the list of the number of children for each node that has at least one child? But note: a node might appear multiple times? Actually, no: the keys of counter are the node indices that are parents. \n\n                    However, the root might be included? Yes.\n\n                    Then `num_level = len(count)` -> the number of nodes that have at least one child? \n\n                    Then we sort the count.\n\n                    Then we do: for i in range(num_level): \n                         count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                    Why i-2? \n\n                    Then we set L=0, R = max(count). If R==0, then we return num_level+1.\n\n                    Then we define a function check(k) that for each element in count, subtracts k (but not below 0) and then checks if the sum of the remaining is <= k.\n\n                    Then we do a binary search on k in [L, R] to find the minimal k such that check(k) is true.\n\n                    Then the answer is num_level + 1 + R.\n\n                    What does R represent? \n\n                    Explanation:\n\n                        The variable `num_level` is the number of nodes that have children. \n\n                        The initial infection: we start by injecting the root at time 1. Then we have to handle the children.\n\n                        The idea is that for a node with `d` children, we can spread to one child per second after the first child is infected (by injection). But the first child must be infected by injection? \n\n                        Actually, the infection of the children of a node can be done in two ways: \n                            - By injection: which takes one injection operation (so one second for the injection step)\n                            - By spreading: which is free? but only after one child is infected.\n\n                        However, the spreading operation happens once per second for the entire tree, and we can choose one additional child per node that has at least one infected child.\n\n                        The known solution:\n\n                            We consider the nodes that have children. For each such node, we need to infect its children. \n\n                            The minimal time to infect the children of a node with `d` children is: \n                                - We must use one injection to get the first child infected. \n                                - Then we can spread one child per second. But note: we can also use injections for the remaining children? \n\n                            However, we are allowed one injection per second (globally) and one spreading per node that has at least one infected child.\n\n                        Actually, the problem is solved by:\n\n                            Let `f(d)` be the time needed to infect the children of a node that has `d` children.\n\n                            How to compute `f(d)`? \n                                - At time t0, the node becomes infected? Actually, the node must be infected before we can spread from it? \n\n                            But note: the node itself might be infected by its parent spreading? \n\n                            Actually, the entire tree infection is a process that starts at the root. \n\n                        Alternate known solution (from a known submission for the same problem):\n\n                            We consider the children counts for each node. We sort the counts in descending order? \n\n                            Then we simulate:\n\n                                time = 0\n                                We start with the root infected.\n\n                                We maintain an array `rem` for the number of children that still need to be infected for each node.\n\n                                Then each second:\n                                    Spreading: for each node that has at least one infected child and still has uninfected children, we can infect one more child (if we choose) -> so we reduce the `rem` for that node by 1.\n                                    Injection: we can choose one node to inject -> we choose the node with the largest `rem`? \n\n                            But the total time is the number of seconds.\n\n                        However, the provided code uses:\n\n                            count = sorted list of the number of children for each node that has children? \n                            Then we do: \n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                            Why? \n\n                            Explanation from known editorial:\n\n                                We start at time 0. \n                                We consider the nodes that have children. We sort them by the number of children (ascending? or descending? the code sorts in ascending by default? because count.sort() is ascending).\n\n                                Then we subtract an amount that depends on the index: for the i-th node (0-indexed) we subtract (i+2). \n\n                                Why i+2? \n\n                                The idea: \n                                    The root (which is one of the nodes with children) must have its first child infected by injection. Then the time for the root to start spreading is at time 2? \n\n                                Actually, the process:\n\n                                    Second 1: \n                                        Injection: we inject the root -> root becomes infected at time 1.\n                                    Then for the root, we can start spreading at second 2? \n\n                                But note: at second 2, we do spreading first: the root has one infected child? Actually, we haven't infected any child of the root yet. So we cannot spread at second 2. \n\n                                So we must inject a child of the root at second 2 (in the injection step of second 2). Then at second 3, we can spread from the root to another child? \n\n                                So for the root with d children, we need at least 1 (to infect the root) + 1 (to inject the first child) + (d-1) (to spread the remaining children) = d+1 seconds? \n\n                                But wait, the spreading at second 3: we infect one more child of the root. Then at second 4, we can spread again? So the total time for the root's children is 1 (for root) + 1 (first child) + (d-1) (for the rest) = d+1? \n\n                                However, we can also inject other nodes in the injection steps? \n\n                                But the problem is that we have multiple nodes. \n\n                            The known solution in the code:\n\n                                We sort the list of children counts (for nodes that have children) in ascending order? Actually, the code sorts without reversing.\n\n                                Then we subtract from each count an initial value: i+2, meaning:\n\n                                    For the node with the smallest number of children, we subtract 0+2 = 2.\n                                    For the next, subtract 3, then 4, etc.\n\n                                Then we get a list of remaining children that we have to handle by additional injections or spreading? \n\n                                Then we do a binary search on k: the number of extra seconds we need? \n\n                                The total time is then: num_level (which is the number of nodes with children) + 1 (the initial second for the root?) + k? \n\n                            Why num_level+1? \n\n                            Actually, the initial setup: we have the root and we have to account for the time to get the nodes with children activated? \n\n                            The binary search function: \n                                check(k): \n                                    b = [max(0, count[i] - k) for i in range(len(count))]\n                                    then if sum(b) <= k -> then k is enough.\n\n                            Why? \n\n                            Explanation: \n                                After we subtract the initial (i+2) from the children count of the i-th node, we get the remaining work. Then we have k extra seconds. In each extra second, we can use the injection to reduce one unit of work (by injecting one child) and the spreading can reduce one unit per node? But note: the spreading is limited to one per node per second? \n\n                            Actually, the spreading operation: in one second, we can spread to one child per node that has at least one infected child. So in one second, we can reduce the remaining work of multiple nodes by 1? \n\n                            But the injection: we can only inject one node per second.\n\n                            So in one extra second, we can reduce the total remaining work by at least 1 (from the injection) and also by the number of nodes that we can spread? But note: the spreading operation is \"at most one\" per node, but we can do one per node that has at least one infected child. However, the remaining work is the number of children that still need to be infected? \n\n                            Actually, the remaining work for a node is the number of children that we haven't infected yet. But we can only spread to one child per node per second. So in one second, we can reduce the remaining work of each node by at most 1 (via spreading) and also we can use the injection to reduce one more? \n\n                            Therefore, the total reduction in one second is at most (number of nodes that have remaining work) + 1 (from injection). But note: the number of nodes that have remaining work is the number of nodes that have at least one child left? \n\n                            However, the condition in the check: \n                                We require that the total remaining work (after subtracting k from each node's remaining work? but we do max(0, count[i]-k)) is at most k? \n\n                            Actually, the check function does:\n\n                                b[i] = max(0, count[i] - k)   # meaning: we are going to use k seconds to inject k times? but we can also spread? \n\n                            Why is the condition: sum(b) <= k? \n\n                            Explanation: \n                                The k seconds can be used to inject k times, which can reduce the total work by k. But also, in each second, we can spread to one child per node that has at least one infected child. However, note that the spreading can happen in the same second for multiple nodes? \n\n                                But the catch: we can only spread to one child per node per second. So the total reduction from spreading is at most k * (number of nodes) ? -> no, because we have k seconds and each second we can spread to one child per node that has at least one infected child? \n\n                            Actually, the reduction from spreading is not bounded by k but by the number of nodes? \n\n                            The known solution: \n                                We have already accounted for the initial spreading schedule by subtracting (i+2). The remaining work is the number of children that we still need to infect. We can use the injection to cover one child per second, and the spreading to cover one child per node per second? \n\n                            But note: the spreading operation: we can only spread if the node has at least one infected child. So we can only spread to one child per node per second, but we can do that for every node that has remaining work? \n\n                            Therefore, in one second, we can reduce the remaining work by at least (number of nodes that have remaining work) + 1 (if we inject one child) -> but wait, the injection is one per second. \n\n                            Actually, the total reduction in one second is: \n                                - Injection: 1\n                                - Spreading: one per node that has at least one child infected and still has uninfected children? \n\n                            But note: we are in the extra seconds. The condition for spreading: the node must have at least one child infected. How do we ensure that? \n\n                            The initial setup (the subtraction of i+2) has already accounted for the first few seconds? \n\n                            The known editorial: \n                                We sort the children counts in increasing order. \n                                Then we let t0 = 0, and we consider the time when a node can start spreading: \n                                    For the node with the largest number of children, we need to assign more injections? \n\n                                The formula: \n                                    Let f = 0\n                                    For i from 0 to len(count)-1:\n                                        f = min(f+1, count[i])   # but this is not.\n\n                            Actually, the provided code does:\n\n                                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n                                Then we are left with an array of nonnegative numbers. \n\n                                Then we do a binary search for k: the minimal k such that the total of max(0, count[i] - k) over i is <= k.\n\n                                Why? \n\n                                Explanation: \n                                    The term (i+2) accounts for the initial i+2 seconds that we use to set up the spreading for the i-th node? \n\n                                    Then the remaining work for the i-th node is count[i] - (i+2). But if that is negative, we set to 0.\n\n                                    Then we have k extra seconds. In each extra second, we can do:\n                                        - One injection: which can reduce one unit of work (anywhere)\n                                        - And spreading: which can reduce one unit per node that has remaining work? \n\n                                    But note: in one second, the spreading can reduce the remaining work of every node by at most 1? \n\n                                    Therefore, after k extra seconds, the remaining work for node i is max(0, count[i] - (i+2) - k) ??? \n\n                                    But wait, the spreading happens every second for every node that has at least one infected child? So if a node has remaining work, then in each second we can reduce it by 1? \n\n                                    Therefore, the total reduction for node i in k seconds is k (from spreading) plus possibly an injection? \n\n                                    However, we can also use the injection to reduce the work of a specific node? \n\n                                    The total reduction we can achieve in k seconds: \n                                        - We can inject k times: so we can reduce the total work by k (by injecting k children) \n                                        - And we can spread: which can reduce the total work by k (because in each second, we can spread to one child, and we have k seconds) but note: we can spread to one child per node per second? So if we have m nodes with work, then we can reduce the work by min(m, k) per second? \n\n                                    Actually, the spreading: in one second, we can reduce the work of every node that has at least one infected child by one? But we are allowed to choose one child per node? So we can reduce the work of each node by one per second? \n\n                                    Therefore, the total reduction from spreading in k seconds is k * (number of nodes that have work) ? -> no, because we can only reduce one per node per second? \n\n                                    Actually, the reduction from spreading: in one second, we can reduce the work of every node that has work? But we are allowed to do at most one per node? So we can reduce each node by one per second? \n\n                                    Therefore, the reduction for node i from spreading is min(remaining_work[i], k) ? \n\n                                    And the reduction from injection: we can assign the k injections arbitrarily to the nodes? \n\n                                    So the total reduction for node i is: min(remaining_work[i], k) + (the number of injections assigned to node i) \n\n                                    But we have only k injections total. \n\n                                    We want: \n                                        For each node i: \n                                            min(remaining_work[i], k) + x_i >= remaining_work[i]\n                                            => x_i >= remaining_work[i] - min(remaining_work[i], k) \n                                            => x_i >= max(0, remaining_work[i] - k)\n\n                                    And the total x_i <= k.\n\n                                    Therefore, the condition is: \n                                        sum_i max(0, remaining_work[i] - k) <= k\n\n                                    Which is exactly the condition in the check function.\n\n                            Therefore, the binary search is for the minimal k such that the condition holds.\n\n                            Then the total time is: \n                                base = num_level + 1   (because we have num_level nodes that we accounted for by the initial i+2, and then we add 1 for the root? or the initial second?) \n                                plus the extra k seconds.\n\n                            But why base = num_level+1? \n\n                            Note: the subtraction we did: for the i-th node (0-indexed) we subtracted i+2. The largest i is num_level-1, so the largest subtraction is (num_level-1+2) = num_level+1. \n\n                            And we started at time 0? \n\n                            Actually, the initial setup: \n                                The first second: we inject the root -> time 1.\n                                Then for the node with index0 (the smallest count) we subtract 2: meaning we account for 2 seconds? \n                                For the next node: subtract 3, etc.\n\n                            So the base time is the maximum of (i+2) for i in [0, num_level-1]? which is num_level+1? \n\n                            But note: we are not taking the maximum, we are subtracting from each node's count. \n\n                            Actually, the base time is the time when we have finished the initial setup for all nodes? That is, we have spent up to (num_level+1) seconds to set up the spreading for the last node? \n\n                            Then the remaining work is what we do in the extra k seconds.\n\n                            Therefore, the total time is base + k = num_level+1 + k.\n\n                            But note: the root infection is at time 1, and then we do the initial setup for the nodes: which takes up to num_level+1 seconds? \n\n                            Actually, the initial setup: \n                                For the first node (smallest count): we need 2 seconds? \n                                For the second: 3 seconds? \n                                ... \n                                For the last: num_level+1 seconds.\n\n                            So the base time is the maximum time we need to set up any node? But we are doing the setup in parallel? \n\n                            However, the process is sequential: one second at a time. \n\n                            The known solution: the base time is the maximum over i of (i+2) is not taken, but we subtract the same amount from each node? \n\n                            Actually, the subtraction is independent per node. The base time is the time when the last node's initial setup is done? \n\n                            But note: the initial setup for the i-th node: \n                                We need to have the node itself infected and one child infected by injection? \n                                The time to get the node infected: we don't know, but the entire process is sequential.\n\n                            This solution is known from a known problem (Codeforces Round 844, problem C) and it passed.\n\n                    Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is in the binary search loop:\n\n                        while R - L > 1:\n                            mid = (R + L) // 2\n                            if check(mid):\n                                R = mid\n                            else:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        We need to set L = mid when the condition is not satisfied? \n\n                    So:\n\n                        if check(mid) is True, then we set R = mid (because we are looking for the minimal k that satisfies the condition).\n\n                        else, we set L = mid.\n\n                    Therefore, the missing line is: \n                        L = mid\n\n                    But note: the binary search is for the minimal k such that check(k) is true. We are searching in [0, max_count]. \n\n                    The loop condition: while R-L>1, so we break when R-L<=1.\n\n                    Then we return R.\n\n                    However, the code returns num_level+1+R.\n\n                    Example: \n                        n=2: tree: \n                            vertex 1 (root) has one child: vertex 2.\n\n                        Then the input: \n                            t=1\n                            n=2\n                            p2: 1\n\n                        Then the list `a` for the test case: ['1'] (for vertex2)\n\n                        Then counter: \n                            counter[1] = 1 -> so count = [1]\n                        num_level = 1\n                        Then for i=0: count[0] = max(1 - 0 - 2, 0) = max(-1,0)=0.\n                        Then R = max(count)=0 -> so we return num_level+1+0 = 2.\n\n                        How many seconds? \n                            Second1: \n                                Injection: we can inject the root? Then infected: {1}\n                            Second2: \n                                Spreading: the root has one child? and at least one child is infected? Actually, no: the child (vertex2) is not infected. So we cannot spread. \n                                Injection: we inject vertex2 -> infected: {1,2}. \n                            So total 2 seconds -> matches.\n\n                    Another example: \n                        n=3: root has two children: vertices 2 and 3. \n                        Input: n=3, and the next line: p2, p3 = [1,1]\n\n                        Then counter: \n                            counter[1] = 2 -> count = [2]\n                        num_level=1\n                        Then for i=0: count[0] = max(2-0-2,0)=0 -> then R=0 -> answer=1+1+0=2.\n\n                        But how? \n                            Second1: inject root -> infected: {1}\n                            Second2: \n                                Spreading: the root has two children, none infected -> cannot spread.\n                                Injection: inject one child, say vertex2 -> infected: {1,2}\n                            Second3:\n                                Spreading: the root has at least one infected child (vertex2) -> we can spread to vertex3 -> infected: {1,2,3}\n                            So that's 3 seconds? \n\n                        Why does the code return 2? \n\n                        We must note: the problem says \"each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation\". \n\n                        In second2: \n                            Spreading: we can spread from the root to vertex3? But at the beginning of second2, the root has one infected child? Actually, we infected vertex2 in the injection step of second1? Then at the spreading step of second2, the root has one infected child? So we can spread to vertex3? Then we don't need to inject? \n\n                        But the injection step is after spreading. So in second2:\n                            Spreading: we spread from the root to vertex3 -> now infected: {1,2,3} (because we also had vertex2 from the previous injection? and the root from the first injection). \n                            Then we don't need an injection? \n\n                        So the entire tree is infected at the end of second2? \n\n                        Therefore, the minimal seconds is 2.\n\n                        How? \n                            Second1: \n                                Injection: inject root -> infected: {1}\n                            Then spreading: nothing? \n                            Then the state after second1: infected={1}\n\n                            Second2: \n                                Spreading: the root has no infected child? because we haven't infected any child of the root? -> so we cannot spread.\n                                Injection: we inject vertex2 -> infected: {1,2}\n\n                            Then we are not done? \n\n                        But note: the problem says \"after that, the injection operation\". So after spreading we do injection. \n\n                        However, at the spreading step of second2: the root has no infected child? \n\n                        We must note: the root was infected at the end of second1. Then at the spreading step of second2, we consider: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected -> the root has no child infected? \n\n                        So we cannot spread at second2.\n\n                        Then we do injection: we inject vertex2.\n\n                        Then at the end of second2, we have infected {1,2}. \n\n                        Then we need a third second? \n\n                        But wait, the problem says: \"each second you do two operations\". \n\n                        Actually, the minimal seconds is 3? \n\n                        However, known solution returns 2? \n\n                        This is a contradiction.\n\n                    Let me re-read the problem: \n                        \"each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation\"\n\n                    And the example: \n                        The image in the note: \n                            Second 1: \n                                Injection: we inject the root? \n                            Then the root is blue at the end of second1.\n\n                            Second2: \n                                Spreading: we can spread from the root to one child? -> then that child becomes green.\n                                Injection: we can inject the other child? -> then that child becomes blue.\n\n                            Then at the end of second2, the entire tree is infected? \n\n                    But in the example of n=3, we have two children. \n\n                    How to do in 2 seconds? \n                        Second1: \n                            Injection: inject the root -> root becomes infected (blue).\n                        Second2: \n                            Spreading: the root has two children? and at least one child is infected? -> no, so we cannot spread? \n                            Injection: we inject one child -> now we have two nodes: root and one child.\n\n                    Then we need a third second to infect the other child? \n\n                    But note: the problem says: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\". \n\n                    At the spreading step of second2, the root has no child infected? because we haven't infected any child yet? \n\n                    So we cannot spread at second2.\n\n                    Then the known solution for n=3 should be 3? \n\n                    However, the code returns 2? \n\n                    There is a known fix: the root is considered to have been infected at time0? \n\n                    Actually, the problem: \"Initially, all vertices are healthy.\" and then the first second starts.\n\n                    The known solution: \n                        We start with the root already infected?

The root has no infected child? because its children are not infected yet. \n\n                    Then we do injection: we inject vertex2.\n\n                    Then at the end of second2, we have infected the root and vertex2. \n\n                    We need to infect vertex3: that will be in second3.\n\n                    Therefore, the minimal seconds should be 3.\n\n                    But the known solution outputs 2? \n\n                    There is a known issue: the problem might allow the root to spread in the first second? \n\n                    Rethink: \n                        The root is infected at the end of second1. \n                        In second2, during the spreading phase: the root is infected and has two children that are not infected. But the condition: \"if at least one child of v is infected\" -> none of the children are infected, so we cannot spread.\n\n                    Therefore, the known solution might be flawed for n=3.\n\n                    However, note: the problem says: \n                        \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of v of your choice\"\n\n                    The key: \"at least one child of v is infected\" -> so if no child is infected, we cannot spread.\n\n                    So the minimal seconds for n=3 is 3.\n\n                    But then why does the provided code for program2.py return 2 for n=3? \n\n                    Let me check the subtraction: \n                        count = [2]  (because the root has two children)\n                        then we do: count[0] = max(2 - 0 - 2, 0) = 0.\n\n                    Then the condition: R=0, so we return 1+1+0=2.\n\n                    This is not matching.\n\n                    I see: the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n                        for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n                    This reads the test cases: \n                        [*open(0)] is all lines.\n                        [2::2] means starting from index2 (the third line) and every two lines.\n\n                    For a test case: \n                        first line: t\n                        then for each test case: \n                            first line: n\n                            second line: the list of parents\n\n                    So the first test case: \n                        line0: t\n                        line1: n1\n                        line2: parents for test1\n                        line3: n2\n                        line4: parents for test2\n\n                    So [2::2] are the lines: index2, index4, index6, ... -> which are the parent lines.\n\n                    But for the first test case, the parent line is at index1? \n\n                    Actually, the first two lines are:\n                        line0: t\n                        line1: n for the first test case\n                        line2: the parents for the first test case\n\n                    So [2::2] would be line2, line4, ... -> the parents lines.\n\n                    Then in the first test case with n=2: \n                        a = the string of the parents line for the first test case.\n\n                    For n=3: \n                        a = the string of the parents line: \"1 1\"\n\n                    Then we split: a.split() -> ['1','1'] -> then counter[1] becomes 2.\n\n                    Then the rest as above.\n\n                    But the node with index1 (the root) has two children. \n\n                    The intended solution might be that the base time is the number of nodes with children (which is 1) plus 1 (which is 2) and then extra 0 seconds -> total 2 seconds.\n\n                    But we need 3 seconds.\n\n                    There is a known editorial for the problem: \n                        https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/111861\n\n                    Problem: \"Infection\"\n\n                    The solution in the editorial: \n                        Let d be the number of nodes that have children. \n                        Then sort the children counts in increasing order.\n                        Then for i in range(d):\n                            count[i] = count[i] - (d - i)   [not exactly]\n\n                    Actually, the editorial solution is different.\n\n                    Given the complexity, and since the provided code has a binary search that is known to work in other submissions, we will complete the code as:\n\n                        In the TODO block: \n                            L = mid\n\n                    And hope that the logic is correct.\n\n                    Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"L = mid\"\n\nSummary:\n\n    program1.py: in the block \"elif f:\", we write: return 0\n\n    program2.py: in the block \"else:\", we write: L = mid\n\n    We output in JSON format: \n        {\"program1\": \"return 0\", \"program2\": \"L = mid\"}\n\nBut note: the code in program1.py has an indentation. The missing line is at the same level as the comment.\n\n    In program1.py:\n\n        if psum==0:\n            f = 1\n        elif f:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We must replace the TODO comment with \"return 0\", and remove the comment.\n\n    Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We replace the TODO comment with \"L = mid\", and remove the comment.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". And we are to output a JSON with two strings.\n\n    We output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    return 0\",\n            \"program2\": \"    L = mid\"\n        }\n\n    But note: the indentation level. In program1.py, the missing line is inside the for-loop and inside the elif block. The current indentation is 8 spaces? \n\n    Actually, the code in program1.py:\n\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            psum += arr[i]\n            if psum < 0:\n                return 0\n            if psum==0:\n                f = 1\n            elif f:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The TODO is at the same level as the inner if. We need to replace the TODO line with \"return 0\", and we must preserve the indentation.\n\n    Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if(check(mid)):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The TODO is at the same level as the if block.\n\n    Therefore, we output the line with the same indentation as the comment. But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n    In program1.py, the missing line is at an indentation level of 12 spaces? (because the for-loop is 4, then the inner block is 8, then the if-elif is 8, and the elif block is 12). \n\n    But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\n    We assume the code is:\n\n        program1: \"        return 0\"   (8 spaces at the beginning? but the current line is at 12? Actually, the code in the example uses 4 per level: \n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the for block\n                if ...:   # 8 spaces\n                elif ...:   # 8 spaces\n                    ...   # 12 spaces for the elif block\n\n        So we need 12 spaces? But the problem does not specify. However, the existing code in the example for program1.py uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        The current line of the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the line that goes in place of the TODO.\n\n        We output: \"        return 0\" (with 8 spaces) for program1? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return 0\n                if psum==0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:\n                    return 0\n\n        The last line should be at the same indentation as the inner if's. The inner if's are at 8 spaces. The elif is at 8 spaces, and the block inside the elif should be at 12 spaces? \n\n        But the example code uses 4 spaces per indent. So:\n\n            for ...:   # 4\n                ...    # 8\n                if ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12\n                elif ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12\n\n        So we need 12 spaces for the return.\n\n        However, the problem does not require the exact spaces? But the program must run.\n\n        We output the code as it would appear in the program. \n\n        In program1.py, the missing line is at the same indentation as the comment, so we output \"    return 0\" with 8 spaces? \n\n        But the comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the example code for program1.py uses:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return 0\n                if psum==0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO line is at 12 spaces (if the code uses 4 per indent: 4 for for, 8 for the inner, 12 for the block inside elif).\n\n        So we output 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line that replaces the TODO. We output that line with the same indentation.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact string of spaces. \n\n        Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the statement, we assume the indentation is already handled by the existing program. We only output the statement without the comment.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"        return 0\"   (with 8 spaces) -> but wait, the current block is at 8 spaces for the if and elif, and the body of the elif should be indented one more level.\n\n        In Python, the body of an if/elif must be indented. The existing code has a comment at the body, so we replace it with a statement at the same indentation.\n\n        We output: \"        return 0\" for program1? \n\n        But the existing code in the example for program1.py has 4-space indents. So:\n\n            Level0: 0\n            Level1: 4\n            Level2: 8\n            Level3: 12\n\n        The elif is at level2 (8 spaces) and the body should be at level3 (12 spaces). \n\n        So we output 12 spaces: \"            return 0\"\n\n        But the example code in the problem statement for program1.py uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return 0\n                if psum==0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The if, elif are at the same level (inside the for loop) and the bodies of the if and elif are at the next level.\n\n        We count the spaces in the given code:\n\n            The line \"for i in range(len(arr)):\" has 4 spaces at the beginning? \n            Then \"psum += arr[i]\" has 8 spaces? \n            Then \"if psum < 0:\" has 8 spaces? \n            Then \"return 0\" has 12 spaces? \n\n        So the body of the if is at 12 spaces.\n\n        Similarly, the body of the elif should be at 12 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1: \"            return 0\" (12 spaces).\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO line is:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace that entire line with:\n\n                    return 0\n\n        So the string is \"            return 0\" (with 12 spaces).\n\n        Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The else block is at the same level as the if block. The if block is at 8 spaces (if the while is 4, then the if is 8, and the else is 8, and the body of the else should be 12).\n\n        We output: \"                L = mid\" (12 spaces).\n\n        But the example code in program2.py uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n        The while loop: \n            while ...:   # 4\n                ...      # 8\n                if ...:  # 8\n                    ...  # 12\n                else:    # 8\n                    ...  # 12\n\n        So the body of the else should be at 12 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"            return 0\"\n            program2: \"            L = mid\"\n\n        But note: the program2.py code in the example has:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The line \"mid = ...\" is at 8 spaces, and the if and else are at 8 spaces, and the body of the if and else are at 12 spaces.\n\n        So we output for program2: \"            L = mid\" (with 12 spaces).\n\n    However, to be safe, we count the spaces in the example:\n\n        program1.py:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the for, then 4 more for the inner block -> 8\n                if ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12\n                ...   # 8\n\n        The elif is at 8 spaces, and the body is at 12.\n\n        So we output 12 spaces for the return.\n\n        Similarly, program2.py:\n\n            while ...:   # 4\n                mid = ...   # 8\n                if ...:     # 8\n                    R = mid   # 12\n                else:       # 8\n                    ...       # 12\n\n        So we output 12 spaces for the L=mid.\n\n    But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the string that would replace the TODO line.\n\n    We output:\n\n        program1: \"            return 0\"\n        program2: \"            L = mid\"\n\n    However, the exact number of spaces might be 8 for the inner block? \n\n    Since the example code in the problem statement does not show the exact spaces, and to be safe, we output the same indentation as the existing bodies.\n\n    In program1.py, the body of the if psum<0 is \"return 0\", which is at the same level as the body we are filling. So we output the same.\n\n    In program2.py, the body of the if is \"R = mid\", so we output \"L = mid\" at the same level.\n\n    Therefore, we output:\n\n        program1: the string \"    return 0\" but wait, the existing return in the if psum<0 is at 4 spaces? \n\n        Let me count:\n\n            The code:\n\n                for i in range(len(arr)):\n                    psum += arr[i]   # 4 spaces for the for, then 4 more -> 8\n                    if psum < 0:     # 8\n                        return 0     # 12\n                    if psum==0:      # 8\n                        f = 1        # 12\n                    elif f:           # 8\n                        ...           # 12\n\n        So the return 0 in the first if is at 12 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1: 12 spaces and \"return 0\".\n\n        How to represent 12 spaces? We use 12 spaces.\n\n    But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, and the existing code in the problem uses 4 spaces per indent. We assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\n    Therefore, for program1, the missing line is 12 spaces: 3 indents (4*3=12) -> so we output 12 spaces and then \"return 0\".\n\n    Similarly, for program2, the missing line is 12 spaces: 3 indents -> 12 spaces and then \"L = mid\".\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line without the comment. We output the line as it should appear.\n\n    We output:\n\n        program1: \"            return 0\"   (12 spaces: 12 times ' ')\n        program2: \"            L = mid\"    (12 spaces)\n\n    But note: the program2.py code has in the if block: \"R = mid\" at 12 spaces, so we output \"L = mid\" at 12 spaces.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem says spaces.\n\n    We output the string with spaces.\n\n    But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n    We output the JSON with the two strings.\n\n    Example: \n        \"program1\": \"            return 0\",\n        \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n\n    But note: the quotes and escaping. We are writing JSON.\n\n    We escape the string appropriately.\n\n    However, the strings do not have newlines or quotes, so we can write as is.\n\n    Final output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"            return 0\",\n            \"program2\": \"            L = mid\"\n        }\n\n    But wait, in program1.py, after adding the line, the code becomes:\n\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            psum += arr[i]\n            if psum < 0:\n                return 0\n            if psum==0:\n                f = 1\n            elif f:\n                return 0\n\n        And then the loop continues? \n\n        Actually, we break out of the function as soon as we see a non-zero after zero.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    Similarly, in program2.py, the binary search becomes:\n\n        while R - L > 1:\n            mid = (R + L) // 2\n            if check(mid):\n                R = mid\n            else:\n                L = mid\n\n    This is a standard binary search.\n\n    We output the JSON."
