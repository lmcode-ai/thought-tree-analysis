(but 0-indexed: 1 and 8) -> same as above.\n                operation2: 5 and 6? (0-indexed: 4 and 5) -> same as above. Therefore, it matches. But note: the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). And we are doing that. So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(str(i2+1) + \" \" + str(j+1))\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        However, we can use f-strings? But the problem does not specify the Python version. But the original code uses print(1,2) for n=1. So we can use:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1) But that prints with a space? and as two integers? Alternatively, we can do: \n\n            print(f\"{i2+1} {j+1}\") But to be safe, we can use string concatenation? But the problem does not care about the format as long as we output two integers per line. So we can do:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1) But note: the example n=1: we did print(1,2). So that prints \"1 2\". So we can do:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1) Then update the list and break. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        But note: the variable i3 is the loop variable.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The provided code uses two pointers (l from left, h from right) and two variables (a for Alice's total weight, b for Bob's total weight). The goal is to find the maximum total candies eaten (ans) such that a == b at some point.\n\nThe current code has a while loop that runs while l <= h. Inside, if a > b, then Bob eats the candy at h (adds w_h to b and moves h left). Otherwise, we are to complete the code for the else branch (which currently is a TODO).\n\nIn the else branch, we should have Alice eat from the left. So we add the left candy to a and move l right. Also, note that whenever a == b, we update ans to be the current total candies eaten (l candies from the left and (n - h - 1) from the right).\n\nHowever, note that the update for ans should only happen when a == b, and we want the maximum such total. But note: the condition a==b might occur multiple times and we want the maximum total candies.\n\nBut observe: the current code updates ans only when a==b. However, we must note that the condition a==b might be reached in different ways. We are traversing the array and updating a and b until the pointers cross.\n\nBut the current code does not break when the pointers cross? Actually, the condition is while l<=h, so when l>h we break.\n\nWe must complete the else branch: when a <= b (because the condition is if a>b then do Bob, else do Alice). So:\n\n    else:\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\nBut note: after updating a, we might have a==b? Then we update ans. However, the code already has an if(a==b) block that updates ans. So we don't need to do anything extra.\n\nBut wait: what if we update a and then a becomes greater than b? Then in the next iteration we will update b. The condition a==b might be hit at different times.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: the total candies eaten is l (from left) and (n-h-1) from right. And we update ans whenever a==b. We are taking the last time they are equal? But note: we want the maximum total candies. However, the pointers are moving and we are increasing the total candies as we go. But when a==b, the total candies is l + (n-1-h). And as we move, l increases and h decreases, so the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) might not be monotonic? Actually, it is increasing? No: because when we add to the left, l increases and the term (n-1-h) remains the same? Then the total becomes l + (n-1-h) which is increasing by 1. Similarly, when we add to the right, h decreases so (n-1-h) increases by 1. So the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies is l + (n-1-h). Initially, l=0, h=n-1, so total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then if we add left: l becomes 1, h remains n-1 -> total = 1 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 1. Then if we add right: l=1, h=n-2 -> total = 1 + (n-1 - (n-2)) = 1+1=2. So it increases by one each time we do an operation? Actually, no: because we do one operation per iteration. So the total candies eaten is the number of operations? But note: we are not counting the operations, we are counting the candies: each operation eats one candy. So the total candies eaten is the number of operations? But the problem asks for the total number of candies eaten.\n\nBut note: the update for ans is done only when a==b. And we want the maximum total candies (i.e., the maximum value of l + (n-1-h) for which a==b). Since the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing as we do operations (because each operation increases either l by 1 or decreases h by 1, so the total increases by 1 each time), then the last time a==b would be the maximum? But note: it might be that after we update, a==b and then we update again and then a==b again? Actually, the values a and b are changing arbitrarily. However, we are traversing the array from both ends until we meet. And we update ans every time we have a==b. Then at the end, we print ans. But note: it is possible that we have multiple a==b? And we want the maximum total candies? Since the total candies is increasing, the last time we have a==b would be the maximum. But the code updates ans every time a==b, so the last update would be the maximum. However, what if we have a==b at the beginning and then not again? Then we have the initial ans=0? But note: initially a=0 and b=0, so we have a==b? Then we set ans = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we start. But the problem says: they eat at least one candy? Actually, the note says for the first test case the answer is 2. So we must not count the initial state? How do we avoid that?\n\nLooking at the code: initially l=0, h=n-1, a=0, b=0. Then we enter the loop. The condition a==b is true? Then we set ans=0. Then we go to the else branch (because a<=b) and we add the left candy. Then we break the condition a==b? Then we continue. So we are updating at the initial state. But we don't want that because they haven't eaten any candy? The problem says: they eat candies. So we want at least one candy from Alice and one from Bob? Actually, the note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> total 2.\n\nSo we must avoid the initial state? How? We can note that the condition a==b at the initial state (0==0) is not a valid solution because they haven't eaten any candy? But the problem does not say they must eat at least one? Actually, the note for the third test case: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So zero is acceptable? But in the first test case, the answer is 2, not 0. So we must not count the state when no candy is eaten? However, the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". The initial state has 0 candies, which is less than 2. So we are safe because we update when we have 2? But the problem says: they eat the same total weight. The initial state has 0, which is the same. But the problem does not require non-zero? Actually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" and \"eat the same total weight\". The initial state is fair. But the problem also says: \"the most number of candies\". So we want the maximum number of candies? The initial state has 0, which is the minimum. We are updating with the current total candies (l + (n-1-h)) which is increasing. So the last time we have a==b will be the maximum. But note: the initial state is updated at the beginning? Then we update again when we have 2? Then we update ans to 2. Then we break? Actually, the first test case: n=2, weights? The example says: for the first test case, they eat one from left and one from right. So the array has two candies? Then we do:\n\nInitially: l=0, h=1, a=0, b=0 -> a==b -> ans=0.\nThen since a<=b, we do: a = a + w0, l=1.\nThen we check: a and b? Now a = w0, b=0 -> not equal? Then we do the next iteration: now a>0? Then we do: b = b + w1, h=0. Then we check: a==b? If w0==w1, then we set ans = l + (n-1-h) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2. Then we break because l=1 and h=0 -> l>h? Then we break. So we output 2.\n\nBut what if the weights are not equal? Then we break without updating? Then we output 0? But that would be wrong. Actually, we must update only when a==b. So if w0 != w1, then after the two operations, a = w0, b = w1, and if w0 != w1, then we don't update ans. Then we break. Then we output 0? But the problem says: they can only eat if the total weight is the same. So if the two candies are different, they cannot eat? Then the answer is 0? But the example says: for the first test case, they eat one each. So we assume the two candies are equal? Actually, the problem statement for the first test case does not specify the weights? But the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" and the answer is 2. So we assume the two candies are equal? Then the code works.\n\nBut what if we have a test case with two candies that are not equal? Then we do:\n\nInitial: a=0, b=0 -> ans=0.\nThen we add left: a = w0, l=1 -> then a!=b? Then we check: a>0? Then we add right: b = w1, h=0 -> then a and b: w0 and w1. If w0 != w1, then we break without updating ans again? Then we output 0? That is correct because they cannot have the same total.\n\nBut the problem says: they can choose any number from the left and any number from the right? But they must eat in a row without skipping. So if they eat one each and the weights are different, that's not fair. So they don't eat? Then the answer is 0? But note: they can choose to eat zero? Then they both eat zero? Then the total candies is 0. But the problem says: \"the most number of candies\". So 0 is the answer? But the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" and they can choose to eat zero. So 0 is acceptable? But the example: the third test case: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So they can have zero? Then why in the first test case the answer is 2? Because they can have non-zero? So the problem does not require non-zero? They can have zero? But the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we want the maximum number of candies such that the total weights are equal. And if they can achieve non-zero, then that is better than zero.\n\nSo the algorithm: we traverse until the pointers cross. We update a and b. Every time a==b, we update ans to the current total candies (l + (n-1-h)). Since the total candies is increasing, the last time we update ans is the maximum? But note: the total candies is increasing by one each operation. So the last time we have a==b is the maximum. However, we update ans every time we have a==b. Then at the end, we output ans.\n\nBut what if we have a==b at the beginning (0) and then never again? Then we output 0? That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says: the total candies eaten is the number of candies eaten by Alice (from the left) and Bob (from the right). And we are counting: Alice has eaten l candies (from index0 to l-1) and Bob has eaten (n-1-h) candies (from h+1 to n-1). So the total is l + (n-1-h).\n\nBut the code currently has:\n\n    if(a==b):\n        ans=l+n-h-1\n\nAnd then we print ans.\n\nBut what if we never have a==b? Then ans remains 0? That is correct.\n\nSo the missing part for program1.py is:\n\n        else:\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nBut note: the code after the if-else has the condition for a==b. So we must do the update for a and l, and then the condition for a==b is checked.\n\nBut the current code has the condition for a==b inside the loop, after updating either a or b. So it's in the right place.\n\nHowever, note that the condition for a==b is checked after every update. So we are good.\n\nBut wait: the condition for a==b is checked even if we updated a or b? Yes.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is two lines.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given: \n    t = number of test cases.\n    For each test case: n, then we form a list b = list('ban'*n) (but note: the problem uses \"BAN\", but the code uses 'ban'? Actually, the problem says s(1)=\"BAN\", but the code uses lowercase? The problem says: we are swapping indices. The problem does not say case sensitivity? But the example: swapping indices 1 and 2 in \"BAN\" -> \"ABN\". So the code uses lowercase? But the problem uses uppercase. However, the problem does not require the actual string? We are only concerned with the subsequence \"BAN\". But the problem says: we are swapping characters. So we must use the same case? The problem says: the string is \"BAN\" repeated. So we should use uppercase? But the code uses 'ban' (lowercase). \n\nBut the example: swapping indices 1 and 2 in \"BAN\" (which is ['B','A','N']) -> swapping the first and second character: becomes 'A','B','N' -> \"ABN\". But the code uses list('ban'*n) -> for n=1: ['b','a','n'].\n\nThe problem says: we want to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence. But the string is now in lowercase? Then the subsequence we are avoiding is \"BAN\" (uppercase) or \"ban\" (lowercase)? The problem says: the string is \"BAN\" repeated. So we should use uppercase? But the code uses lowercase. This might be a problem? However, the problem does not specify case in the subsequence? Actually, the problem says: the string s(n) is \"BAN\" repeated. So the characters are uppercase. But the code uses lowercase. This is a bug? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require to output the string. It only requires the indices of the swaps. And the indices are the same regardless of the case? So we can use lowercase? But the problem says: the string is \"BAN\", so the first character is 'B', the second 'A', the third 'N'. In the code, we have 'b','a','n'. So we are representing the same structure? The subsequence \"ban\" in the lowercase string is the same as \"BAN\" in the uppercase? So we are avoiding the subsequence \"ban\". \n\nBut the problem says: we are to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence. So if we use lowercase, we must avoid \"ban\" as a subsequence? That is the same. So it's okay.\n\nNow, the code:\n\n    if n==1:\n        print(1)\n        print(1, 2)\n    else:\n        z = n*3-1   # This variable is defined but not used? We might not need it.\n        print(n//2+n%2)   # This is the minimum number of operations? The problem says: output the minimum number of operations. And then output the operations.\n\n        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):   # This loop runs ceil(n/2) times? \n            for i2 in range(n*3):    # This inner loop is inefficient? n<=100, so 300*ceil(n/2) <= 150, which is acceptable.\n                if b[i2]=='a':       # We are looking for an 'a'? Then what?\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe problem says: we are to output the minimum number of operations and then the operations (each operation is two indices).\n\nThe example: \n  n=1: we output 1 operation: swap indices 1 and 2.\n\n  n=2: we output 1 operation? But the example says: swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6. But note: the problem says: the string for n=2 is \"BANBAN\", which is 6 characters. The indices: \n        index0: 'B', index1: 'A', index2: 'N', index3: 'B', index4: 'A', index5: 'N'\n        The example swaps index1 (which is the second character, because the problem uses 1-indexing) and index5 (the last). \n\nBut the code uses 0-indexing? The problem says: indices from 1 to 3n. So we must output indices in 1-indexed.\n\nThe code: \n    We have a list b = list('ban'*n) -> for n=2: ['b','a','n','b','a','n']\n\nThe example operation: swap index1 and index5 (in 0-indexing: index1 and index5). Then the string becomes:\n    swap b[1] and b[5]: \n        originally: \n            index0: 'b'\n            index1: 'a' -> becomes the character at index5: 'n'\n            index2: 'n'\n            index3: 'b'\n            index4: 'a'\n            index5: 'n' -> becomes 'a'\n        So the string becomes: 'b', 'n', 'n', 'b', 'a', 'a' -> \"bnnbaa\", which is the example.\n\nBut the example output: \"BNNBAA\" (uppercase) but we have lowercase? But the problem does not care about the actual letters? We are only outputting the indices.\n\nSo for n=2, we want to swap the second character (index1) and the last character (index5). \n\nHow do we do that in the code?\n\nThe code for n>=2:\n\n    We are going to do ceil(n/2) operations. For each operation, we are iterating over the entire string (from 0 to 3*n-1) and when we find an 'a', we do something? But note: we are in a loop that runs ceil(n/2) times. And for each operation, we are scanning the entire string until we find an 'a'. Then what?\n\nThe idea: we want to break the pattern so that we don't have the subsequence \"ban\". How can we do that? \n\nNote: the problem says: we can do at most 10^5 operations, but n<=100, so we are safe.\n\nBut the example solution: \n   For n=1: swap the first and second character? But the problem example swapped index1 and index2 (which are the first and second). In 1-indexed: 1 and 2.\n\n   For n=2: swap the second and the last? In 1-indexed: 2 and 6.\n\nWhat is the pattern? \n\nWe can think: \n   The string is composed of n blocks of \"ban\". We want to break every occurrence of the subsequence \"ban\" that might appear. But note: we don't need to break every occurrence of the substring? Because the problem says: as a subsequence. \n\nHowever, a known solution for this problem is:\n\n   m = (n+1)//2   (which is the same as n//2 + n%2)\n   Then, for k in range(m):\n        swap the 'a' in the k-th block with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block? \n\nBut let me check:\n\n   For n=2: \n        k=0: swap the 'a' in the 0-th block (which is at index1) with the last character of the (2-1-0)=1st block? The 1st block (0-indexed) is the second block? The last character of the second block is at index5? So swap index1 and index5.\n\n   For n=3: \n        m = (3+1)//2 = 2.\n        k=0: swap the 'a' in the 0-th block (index1) with the last character of the (3-1-0)=2nd block? The 2nd block is the last block? The last character of the last block is at index8? \n        k=1: swap the 'a' in the 1st block (which is at index4) with the last character of the (3-1-1)=1st block? The last character of the 1st block is at index5? \n\n        So we swap:\n            operation1: index1 and index8\n            operation2: index4 and index5\n\n        Then the string: \n            Initially: ['b','a','n','b','a','n','b','a','n']\n            After swap1: \n                swap index1 and index8: \n                    index1 becomes the original index8: 'n'\n                    index8 becomes the original index1: 'a'\n                    Now: \n                        block0: ['b','n','n']? -> actually: \n                            index0: 'b'\n                            index1: 'n' (from the last block)\n                            index2: 'n' -> but wait, we swapped index1 and index8, so:\n                                index0: 'b'\n                                index1: 'n' (from the last block's last character)\n                                index2: 'n' (unchanged? no, because we didn't touch index2) -> but the second block: \n                                index3: 'b'\n                                index4: 'a'\n                                index5: 'n'\n                                index6: 'b'\n                                index7: 'a'\n                                index8: 'a' (from the first block's 'a')\n            Then swap2: swap index4 and index5: \n                index4: 'a' and index5: 'n' -> swap: \n                index4 becomes 'n', index5 becomes 'a'\n                Now: \n                    block0: \"b\", \"n\", \"n\"\n                    block1: \"b\", \"n\", \"a\"\n                    block2: \"b\", \"a\", \"a\"\n\n        Now, check for subsequence \"ban\": \n            We need a 'b' then an 'a' then an 'n'. \n            The first 'b' at index0, then we can take the 'a' at index5? then the 'n' at index2? But that would be: \n                b at0, a at5, n at2 -> but 0<5<2? No, because 5>2. So the subsequence must be in increasing order of indices? \n            Actually, the subsequence must appear in order. So we cannot take an 'a' that comes after an 'n' and then a 'n' that comes before? \n\n        How about: \n            b at0, then a at7 (from the last block) and then n at? We need an 'n' after index7. There is an 'n' at index1? but index1<index0? no. Actually, we can only take increasing indices.\n\n        Let me list the positions of the letters:\n\n            b: at indices0, 3, 6\n            a: at indices5, 7, 8\n            n: at indices1,2,4\n\n        Now, to form \"ban\": we need a b, then an a, then an n, with increasing indices.\n\n        For the first b (index0): \n            we need an a after index0: we have a at 5,7,8 -> then for each a, we need an n after that a? \n            a at5: then n after 5? we have n at? indices1,2,4 are before 5. So no n after 5? \n            a at7: then n after 7? we have no n after 7? \n            a at8: then n after 8? none.\n\n        For the b at3:\n            a after 3: 5,7,8 -> then n after a: none.\n\n        For the b at6:\n            a after 6: 7,8 -> then n after: none.\n\n        So there is no subsequence \"ban\".\n\n        Therefore, the solution is: \n            For k in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                swap the 'a' in the k-th block with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block.\n\n        How to get the index of the 'a' in the k-th block?\n            Each block is 3 characters. The k-th block (0-indexed) starts at index 3*k.\n            The block is \"ban\", so the 'a' is at index 3*k+1.\n\n        How to get the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block?\n            The (n-1-k)-th block: starts at index 3*(n-1-k). The last character of the block is at index 3*(n-1-k)+2.\n\n        Then we swap these two indices.\n\n        But note: the problem uses 1-indexed. So we output:\n            first index: 3*k+1 + 1? -> 3*k+2? \n            second index: 3*(n-1-k)+2 + 1? -> 3*(n-1-k)+3 = 3*(n-k) \n\n        Actually: \n            The k-th block's 'a' is at 0-indexed: 3*k+1 -> 1-indexed: 3*k+2.\n            The last character of the (n-1-k)-th block is at 0-indexed: 3*(n-1-k)+2 -> 1-indexed: 3*(n-1-k)+3 = 3*(n-k).\n\n        Example n=2, k=0:\n            first index: 3*0+2 = 2? but the example swapped index2? but the example swapped index1 and index6? Actually, wait: the example swapped the second character (which is index1 in 0-indexed) and the last (index5 in 0-indexed). \n\n        But according to our calculation for the k-th block (k=0): \n            'a' at 0-indexed: 3*0+1 = 1 -> 1-indexed: 2? \n            last character of the (2-1-0)=1st block: 0-indexed: 3*(2-1-0)+2 = 3*1+2 = 5 -> 1-indexed: 6.\n\n        So we output: 2 and 6.\n\n        Example n=1: \n            k=0: \n                'a' at 0-indexed: 3*0+1 = 1 -> 1-indexed: 2.\n                last character of the (1-1-0)= -1? block? This is not defined.\n\n        But n=1 is handled separately: we output swap(1,2). \n\n        So for n>=2, we do:\n\n            for k in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                i1 = 3*k+1   (0-indexed position of the 'a' in the k-th block)\n                i2 = 3*(n-1-k)+2   (0-indexed position of the last character in the (n-1-k)-th block)\n\n                Then we swap b[i1] and b[i2]? But the problem does not require to actually build the string? We only output the indices. But the code has the list b? And we are scanning for an 'a'? \n\n        The code currently has:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):   # which is ceil(n/2) times\n                for i2 in range(n*3):    # scanning the entire string\n                    if b[i2]=='a': \n                        # then what? \n\n        This inner loop is inefficient? But n<=100, so 300*ceil(n/2) <= 15000, which is acceptable? But 100 test cases? The problem says t<=100. Then worst-case: 100 * 15000 = 1.5e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But we don't need to scan? We know the positions? \n\n        However, the problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any. So we can do the known solution.\n\n        But the code currently is scanning for an 'a'. Why? Maybe the author intended to do something else? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break out of the inner loop once we find the first 'a'? But note: we are going to do ceil(n/2) operations, and in each operation we want to swap a specific 'a'? \n\n        How about: we break the inner loop immediately? Then we do:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                # We know we want to swap the 'a' in the i3-th block and the last character of the (n-1-i3)-th block.\n                pos1 = 3*i3+1   # 0-indexed position of the 'a' in the i3-th block\n                pos2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2   # 0-indexed position of the last character of the (n-1-i3)-th block\n\n                # But we must output 1-indexed: so we output (pos1+1, pos2+1)\n\n                print(f\"{pos1+1} {pos2+1}\")\n\n                # Also, we should update the list b? Because the next operation might see a changed string? \n                # But the problem does not require to simulate the swaps? It only requires the sequence of operations? \n                # However, the problem says: after all operations, the string must not contain \"ban\" as a subsequence. \n                # And we are outputting the operations. But if we do the swaps in the order we output, then the string changes. \n                # But the known solution works regardless of the order? Actually, we are swapping two positions that are not overlapping? \n                # Because the blocks we are swapping are distinct? \n\n                # But note: when we swap, the 'a' in the k-th block is moved to the (n-1-k)-th block, and the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block (which is an 'n') is moved to the k-th block? \n                # Then in the next operation, we are going to the next block? The k-th block we have already swapped? Then the next block is the (k+1)-th block? But the (k+1)-th block might have been altered? \n\n                # Example n=3: \n                #   Operation1: swap block0's 'a' (index1) and block2's last (index8). \n                #       Then block0: becomes: \n                #           originally: ['b','a','n'] -> after swapping the 'a' (index1) with the 'n' at index8: \n                #           block0: [b, n, n]? but the last character of block0 is still at index2? \n                #       block2: becomes: [b, a, a]? because we swapped the last character (index8) with the 'a' from block0 -> so the last character of block2 becomes 'a'. \n                #   Then operation2: we want to swap block1's 'a' (which is at index4) and block1's last character? But wait: we intended to swap with the last character of block (n-1-1)=3-1-1=1 -> block1. But the last character of block1 is now at index5? and we are going to swap the 'a' at index4 with the last character of block1 (index5). \n                #       But note: after the first swap, the block1 is still ['b','a','n']? because we didn't touch it? \n                #       Actually, we swapped index1 (in block0) and index8 (in block2). So block1 (indices3,4,5) remains unchanged. \n                #   So the second swap: swap index4 and index5: \n                #       block1: [b, n, a]? \n\n                # Therefore, the blocks we are swapping are distinct: the k-th block and the (n-1-k)-th block. And as long as k < n-1-k, then the blocks are distinct? \n                #   k in [0, ceil(n/2)-1] and n-1-k in [n-1, ceil(n/2)]? \n                #   For k < ceil(n/2), we have k <= n-1-k? \n                #   Because: k <= (n-1)/2? \n                #   Since we are running k from 0 to ceil(n/2)-1, and ceil(n/2) = (n+1)//2, then k < (n+1)//2 -> k <= (n-1)//2? \n                #   Then k <= n-1-k? \n                #   Solve: k <= n-1-k  => 2k <= n-1. \n                #   For k in [0, (n+1)//2 - 1]: \n                #       the maximum k is (n+1)//2 - 1.\n                #       If n is even: ceil(n/2)=n/2, then k in [0, n/2-1] -> then 2k <= n-2 < n-1? so yes.\n                #       If n is odd: ceil(n/2)=(n+1)/2, then k in [0, (n+1)/2 - 1] = [0, (n-1)/2] -> then 2k <= n-1? so yes.\n\n                # Therefore, the two indices we swap are from two distinct blocks that are not touched by other swaps? \n\n                # So we don't need to update the list b? Because the swaps in different pairs of blocks are independent? \n\n                # But the inner loop is scanning for an 'a'. We are going to break the pattern? \n\n        However, the problem does not require to simulate the swaps? We only output the operations. So we don't need to update the list b? \n\n        But the code has the list b? And the inner loop is scanning for an 'a'. If we don't update b, then the same 'a' might be found again? \n\n        Actually, the inner loop is inside the operation loop. For the first operation, we scan and find the first 'a'? But we want the first 'a'? But we want the k-th block's 'a'. \n\n        How about: we break the inner loop after we find the first 'a'? Then we do the swap? But then we update the list b? \n\n        The problem does not require the actual string? But the next operation might be affected? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the inner loop and use the known positions.\n\n        But the problem says: \"if there are multiple possible answers, output any\". So we can output the known solution.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                # Calculate the two indices in 0-indexed:\n                idx1 = 3*i3+1\n                idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                # Then output in 1-indexed: idx1+1 and idx2+1\n                print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n        But note: the example n=1 is handled separately. So for n>=2, we do the above.\n\n        However, what about n=1? We have a separate branch. So for n>=2, we do the above.\n\n        But the problem says: the total number of operations is ceil(n/2). And we are outputting ceil(n/2) operations.\n\n        So the missing code in the else branch for program2.py is:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                # We break out of the inner loop? Actually, we don't need the inner loop? \n                # But the code has an inner loop that we must complete? \n\n        The code has:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                for i2 in range(n*3):\n                    if b[i2]=='a':\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must complete the TODO. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if b[i2]=='a':\n                # Then we have found an 'a'. But we want the k-th block's 'a'? \n                # How do we know which block? We are in the i3-th operation. We want the i3-th block's 'a'. \n                # So we break the inner loop and then compute the other index? \n\n                # But note: the inner loop is iterating i2 from 0 to 3*n-1. We are at the first 'a'? But the first 'a' is in the first block? \n                # But after swapping, the next operation we might have moved an 'a' to an earlier position? \n\n                # Alternatively, we can avoid the inner loop and use the known positions. But the problem says: we can output any. \n\n                # Since we know the position we want: 3*i3+1, we can break the inner loop and then use that position? \n\n                # But the inner loop is scanning for an 'a'. We can break after the first 'a'? But that would be the first block? \n                # But after the first swap, the first block's 'a' is gone? Then the next operation we will find the next 'a'? \n\n                # However, we are swapping the k-th block's 'a' with the last character of the (n-1-k)-th block. The (n-1-k)-th block's last character is an 'n'. So after swapping, the k-th block's 'a' becomes an 'n'. And the (n-1-k)-th block's last character becomes an 'a'. \n\n                # Then in the next operation, when we scan for an 'a', we will find the next block's 'a'? But the k-th block we swapped is now without an 'a'. \n\n                # But the next operation is for k+1. We want the (k+1)-th block's 'a'. And that block has not been touched? \n\n                # Therefore, the first 'a' we find in the inner loop for the k-th operation is the k-th block's 'a'? \n\n                # How? The inner loop starts from 0. The k-th block's 'a' is at 3*k+1. And we haven't swapped any block with index less than k? So the k-th block's 'a' is the first 'a' we encounter? \n\n                # But what if we swapped an 'a' to an earlier position in a previous operation? \n                #   In the previous operation (for k'=k-1), we swapped the (k-1)-th block's 'a' with the last character of the (n-1-(k-1))-th block. The (n-1-(k-1))-th block is at a higher index? So the 'a' we moved from the (n-1-(k-1))-th block to the (k-1)-th block is now at the (k-1)-th block? which is before the k-th block? \n                #   But we already processed the (k-1)-th block. And we are now at the k-th block. The (k-1)-th block now has an 'n'? because we swapped the 'a' out? \n\n                #   Actually, we swapped the (k-1)-th block's 'a' with the last character of the (n-1-(k-1))-th block. So the (k-1)-th block now has the character that was at the last of the (n-1-(k-1))-th block, which is an 'n'. And the (n-1-(k-1))-th block now has an 'a'? \n\n                #   Then the next time we scan, we start from 0. The (k-1)-th block is at 3*(k-1) to 3*(k-1)+2. The first character is 'b', then we have the swapped character: originally the last character of the (n-1-(k-1))-th block, which is an 'n'. So the (k-1)-th block: ['b','n','?'] -> the last character we swapped was the last character of the block? So the (k-1)-th block becomes: \n                #       index0: 'b'\n                #       index1: (originally the 'a') -> now swapped to the last character of the other block? but we swapped the entire element? \n                #       Actually, we swapped the element at 3*(k-1)+1 (which was 'a') with the element at 3*(n-1-(k-1))+2 (which was 'n'). \n                #       So the (k-1)-th block: \n                #           index0: 'b' (unchanged)\n                #           index1: becomes the 'n' from the other block.\n                #           index2: remains the original last character? but wait, we swapped the element at index1? so the last character of the (k-1)-th block (index2) remains the original 'n'? \n                #       Then the (k-1)-th block becomes \"b\", \"n\", \"n\" -> no 'a'. \n                #   The (n-1-(k-1))-th block: \n                #       originally: ['b','a','n'] -> \n                #       we swapped the last character (index2 of the block) with the 'a' from the (k-1)-th block? \n                #       So the block becomes: \n                #           index0: 'b'\n                #           index1: 'a' (unchanged? because we swapped the last character) -> but wait, we swapped the entire element at the last character index? \n                #           index2: becomes the 'a' from the (k-1)-th block? \n                #       So the block becomes: \"b\", \"a\", \"a\" -> has two 'a's? \n\n                #   Then when we scan for the next 'a', we start from 0. We will first hit the (k-1)-th block? but it has no 'a'. Then we hit the k-th block? which has an 'a' at 3*k+1? \n\n                #   But what about the (n-1-(k-1))-th block? It is at a higher index? So we will not hit it until after the k-th block? \n\n                #   Therefore, the first 'a' we find in the k-th operation is the k-th block's 'a'. \n\n                # So we can do:\n\n                #   We have found an 'a' at position i2. Then we want to swap it with the last character of the (n-1-i3)-th block? \n                #   The position of the last character of the (n-1-i3)-th block is: 3*(n-1-i3)+2.\n\n                #   Then we output: i2+1 and (3*(n-1-i3)+2+1) in 1-indexed.\n\n                #   But note: we must update the list b? because the next scan will see the swapped string? \n\n                #   We do:\n\n                #       j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                #       swap b[i2] and b[j]   (so that the next scan doesn't see the same 'a' again)\n\n                #   Then break the inner loop? because we only need one swap per operation.\n\n                #   So:\n\n                j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                # Output the swap: in 1-indexed: i2+1 and j+1\n                print(f\"{i2+1} {j+1}\")\n                # Now update the list b: swap b[i2] and b[j]\n                b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n                break   # break the inner for loop\n\n        But note: we break the inner loop after the first 'a'. \n\n        Why break? Because we only want to do one swap per operation. And we break the inner loop so that we move to the next operation.\n\n        This will work.\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(f\"{i2+1} {j+1}\")\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says: output the operation: two integers. And we are outputting in the same line? The problem says: the k-th of these lines should contain two integers.\n\n        We are printing: \n            print(f\"{i2+1} {j+1}\")\n\n        And then we break the inner loop.\n\n        We also update the list b so that the next scan is on the updated string.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(str(i2+1) + \" \" + str(j+1))\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). And we are doing ceil(n/2) operations. And in each operation, we output one swap.\n\n        Example n=2: \n            Operation: \n                i3=0: \n                    inner loop: i2=0: b[0]=='b' -> skip.\n                                 i2=1: b[1]=='a' -> found.\n                    j = 3*(2-1-0)+2 = 3*1+2 = 5.\n                    print: 1+1=2, 5+1=6 -> \"2 6\"\n                    swap b[1] and b[5]: \n                         b becomes: \n                            originally: ['b','a','n','b','a','n']\n                            after swap: ['b','n','n','b','a','a'] -> then break inner loop.\n\n            Then next operation? n//2+n%2 = 1, so only one operation.\n\n        So we output:\n            1\n            2 6\n\n        Which matches.\n\n        Example n=3: \n            ceil(n/2)=2.\n            Operation1 (i3=0):\n                find first 'a': at index1 -> i2=1.\n                j = 3*(3-1-0)+2 = 3*2+2 = 8.\n                swap b[1] and b[8]: \n                    b[1] becomes the original b[8] which is 'n' (from the last block's last character)\n                    b[8] becomes the original b[1] which is 'a'\n                Then break.\n\n            Operation2 (i3=1):\n                Now the string: \n                    index0: 'b'\n                    index1: 'n'\n                    index2: 'n'   (from the first block? but originally the first block: index0,1,2: 'b','a','n' -> now 'b','n','n')\n                    index3: 'b'\n                    index4: 'a'\n                    index5: 'n'\n                    index6: 'b'\n                    index7: 'a'\n                    index8: 'a'\n                Now we scan for the first 'a': \n                    i2=0: 'b'\n                    i2=1: 'n'\n                    i2=2: 'n'\n                    i2=3: 'b'\n                    i2=4: 'a' -> found.\n                j = 3*(3-1-1)+2 = 3*(1)+2 = 5.\n                swap b[4] and b[5]: \n                    b[4] becomes 'n', b[5] becomes 'a'\n                Then output: 5 and 6? (1-indexed: 4+1=5, 5+1=6) -> \"5 6\"\n\n            Then we output:\n                2\n                2 9\n                5 6\n\n            But the known solution was: \n                operation1: 2 and 9 -> 1-indexed: 2 and 9? (but 0-indexed: 1 and 8) -> same as above.\n                operation2: 5 and 6? (0-indexed: 4 and 5) -> same as above.\n\n        Therefore, it matches.\n\n        But note: the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). And we are doing that.\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(str(i2+1) + \" \" + str(j+1))\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        However, we can use f-strings? But the problem does not specify the Python version. But the original code uses print(1,2) for n=1. So we can use:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n\n        But that prints with a space? and as two integers? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n\n            print(f\"{i2+1} {j+1}\")\n\n        But to be safe, we can use string concatenation? \n\n        But the problem does not care about the format as long as we output two integers per line.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n\n        But note: the example n=1: we did print(1,2). So that prints \"1 2\".\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n\n        Then update the list and break.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n        But note: the variable i3 is the loop variable. We are using it.\n\n        However, the outer loop is:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n\n        And the inner loop is:\n\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n\n        So we are using i3 and i2.\n\n        Therefore, we have the completions.\n\nSummary:\n\nFor program1.py: \n    We add two lines in the else branch:\n\n        else:\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nFor program2.py: \n    We add four lines in the if block (inside the inner loop) for the else branch:\n\n        if b[i2]=='a':\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\nBut note: the break is important to break the inner loop and move to the next operation.\n\nNow, output in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: The problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the two lines for the else branch.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the four lines for the if block inside the inner loop.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program1.py is in the else branch, and in program2.py the TODO is in the if block.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code.\n\nIn program1.py, the else branch is at the same level as the if. The provided code:\n\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with two lines that are indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\nThe else branch is at the same level as the if. The if branch has two lines: \n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n\nSo the else branch should have two lines with the same indentation? \n\nIn the provided code, the TODO is at the same level as the two lines in the if branch? \n\nSo we write:\n\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nEach line indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the if branch is indented by 8 spaces? \n\nLet me count:\n\nThe while loop: \n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\nThe if and else are at the same level: 4 spaces for the while, then 4 more for the if/else -> 8 spaces.\n\nThen the two lines in the if branch: 12 spaces.\n\nSo the two lines we add for the else branch must be 12 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py:\n\nThe code:\n\n        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe if is inside two loops: \n    for i3: 4 spaces\n        for i2: 8 spaces\n            if: 12 spaces\n                TODO: 16 spaces\n\nSo the code we add must be at 16 spaces.\n\nBut the four lines we add: \n    j = ... -> 16 spaces\n    print ... -> 16 spaces\n    swap ... -> 16 spaces\n    break -> 16 spaces\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut wait: the program1.py code has 12 spaces? The string we output for program1 has 12 spaces? \n\nActually, the two lines:\n\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nEach line has 12 spaces? \n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the four lines:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\nEach line has 12 spaces? But in the program2.py, the TODO is at 16 spaces? \n\nWe must output the exact indentation.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program1.py is at 12 spaces? and we are replacing it with two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nIn program2.py, the TODO is at 16 spaces? and we are replacing it with four lines at 16 spaces? \n\nBut the code we are writing for program2.py: the first line is at 16 spaces? \n\nHowever, the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\nLet me count:\n\nThe entire code:\n\nfrom sys import stdin\nt = int(stdin.readline().strip())\nfor i in range(t):\n    n = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n    b = list('ban'*n)\n    if n==1:\n        print(1)\n        print(1, 2)\n    else:\n        z = n*3-1\n        print(n//2+n%2)\n        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else branch: \n        else:   -> 8 spaces\n            z = ... -> 12 spaces\n            print ... -> 12 spaces\n            for i3 in ...: -> 12 spaces\n                for i2 in ...: -> 16 spaces\n                    if ...: -> 20 spaces\n                        # TODO -> 24 spaces\n\nSo the TODO is at 24 spaces? \n\nBut the code we are adding must be at 24 spaces? \n\nBut the example output we wrote for program2.py was at 12 spaces? \n\nWe must adjust.\n\nActually, the TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\nThe for loops:\n\n    for i3 in ...:   -> 12 spaces (because the else branch is 8, then the next level is 12)\n        for i2 in ...: -> 16 spaces (inside the for i3)\n            if ...: -> 20 spaces (inside the for i2)\n\nSo the TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\nBut the code we are adding must be at 20 spaces? \n\nBut the example we wrote:\n\n            j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n\nThis is intended for 16 spaces? \n\nWe must output the code with the correct indentation.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code should be indented by 20 spaces? \n\nSo:\n\n                    j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                    print(i2+1, j+1)\n                    b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n                    break\n\nBut note: the break is at the same level.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"                    j = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\\n                    print(i2+1, j+1)\\n                    b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\\n                    break\"\n}\n\nBut wait: the program1.py: the two lines are at 12 spaces? \n\nIn the provided program1.py:\n\n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe else branch is at 8 spaces? and the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\nSo the two lines we add must be at 12 spaces? \n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
