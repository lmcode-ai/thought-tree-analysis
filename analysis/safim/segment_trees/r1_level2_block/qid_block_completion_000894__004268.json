So for the first i locks, we require: \n    k_i * t_j >= s_i\nwhere k_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks. But note: we are not forced to put pipes only in the first i locks? But the pipes beyond i do not help the first i locks. So to fill the first i locks, we must have at least ceil(s_i / t_j) pipes in the first i locks. But the problem: we want to fill all locks (all n locks). So we require for every i from 1 to n: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(s_i / t_j). Therefore, the total number of pipes k must be at least max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(s_i / i) ??? Wait, the provided code computes:\n\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0)) This computes t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i). Why i? In the denominator? But note: the condition we derived: for the first i locks, we require k_i * t_j >= s_i, so k_i > = ceil(s_i / t_j).",

Then the total number of pipes k (which is the sum of all pipes) must be at least max_i (ceil(s_i / t_j)). But note: k_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks, and k_i <= k (the total pipes). So k must be at least max_i (ceil(s_i / t_j)). Therefore, the minimal k for a given t_j is k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j). But the problem: we are to compute the minimal number of pipes k such that the entire system is filled by time t_j. And we have shown that k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j).

But then k_min = x_n? \n\nBut consider: the constraint for i is k_i >= x_i, and since x_i is non-decreasing, the last constraint (i=n) is the strongest: k_n >= x_n. And if we set k = x_n, then we can put all x_n pipes in the first n locks? But we must also satisfy the earlier constraints. Since x_i <= x_n for all i, then k_i (which is the number of pipes in the first i locks) can be at most k = x_n. But we need k_i >= x_i. How can we ensure that?",

And since the function floor((s_i-1)/q) is non-decreasing in i, then the maximum over i is at i=n: floor((s_n-1)/q)+1. Therefore, k_min = ceil(s_n / q) = (s_n + q - 1) // q. But wait, this is not true! Example earlier: \n    n=2, v1=1, v2=2, t_j=2. s1=1, s2=3. ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2. The maximum is 2, which is ceil(s2/2)=ceil(3/2)=2. floor((3-1)/2)+1 = floor(2/2)+1 = 1+1 = 2. But also, ceil(3/2)=2. And for the first lock: ceil(1/2)=1, which is less than 2. Therefore, k_min = ceil(s_n / q) ? But then in the example n=3, v1=3, v2=1, v3=1, t_j=2.\n    s1=3, s2=4, s3=5. ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3. so k_min=3. ceil(s_n / q) = ceil(5/2)=3.

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first challenge involves finding the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice (from the left) equals that eaten by Bob (from the right). The second challenge requires counting the number of distinct ways to express a given integer as a sum of palindromic integers, considering multisets.\n\n### Approach for Program 1: Candy Distribution\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Alice and Bob eat candies from the left and right ends respectively. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten while ensuring the sum of weights of candies eaten by Alice equals that eaten by Bob.\n2. **Intuition**: Use a two-pointer technique where one pointer starts at the beginning (left) for Alice and another at the end (right) for Bob. Maintain two sums, `s1` for Alice and `s2` for Bob. Move the pointers inward, adjusting the sums until they are equal, recording the total candies eaten each time the sums are equal.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize pointers `p1` (left) at 0 and `p2` (right) at `n-1`.\n   - While `p1 - 1 <= p2` (ensuring pointers haven't crossed):\n     - If `s1` equals `s2`, record the total candies eaten (sum of left and right candies).\n     - If `s1` is less than `s2`, move the left pointer right and add the candy's weight to `s1`.\n     - If `s2` is less than `s1`, move the right pointer left and add the candy's weight to `s2`.\n   - The last recorded value when sums were equal is the answer.\n\n### Approach for Program 2: Palindromic Partitions\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to count distinct multisets of palindromic integers that sum to a given number `n`. The solution involves dynamic programming to count partitions where each partition element is a palindrome.\n2. **Intuition**: Precompute all palindromic numbers up to the maximum possible `n` (40,000). Use dynamic programming to build an array `pm` where `pm[i]` represents the number of ways to form the sum `i` using these palindromic numbers.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Generate all palindromic numbers up to 40,000.\n   - Initialize a dynamic programming array `pm` with `pm[0] = 1` (one way to make sum 0: using no numbers).\n   - For each palindromic number `p`, iterate through all possible sums `i` from 0 to `size - 1`:\n     - If `i + p` exceeds the array size, break the loop early for efficiency.\n     - Otherwise, update `pm[i + p]` by adding `pm[i]` (modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"            break\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program 1**: The solution uses two pointers to traverse the candy array from both ends. Whenever the sums of weights from the left (Alice) and right (Bob) are equal, the total number of candies eaten is recorded. The pointers are adjusted based on which sum is smaller to balance the weights. The last recorded value of total candies when sums were equal is the answer.\n- **Program 2**: The solution involves generating all palindromic numbers up to 40,000. Using dynamic programming, it counts the number of ways to form each sum up to `n` by iterating through the palindromic numbers and updating the DP array. If adding a palindromic number would exceed the array bounds, the loop breaks early to optimize performance. The result for each test case is then read from the precomputed DP array.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is to count the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) of two-character strings (from 'a' to 'k') that differ in exactly one position.\n\nThe provided code uses a dictionary `d1` to count the frequency of each string. The idea is to iterate over each string and for each position (0 and 1) and for each possible letter (from 'a' to 'l', note: 109 is 'm', but the problem says up to 'k' which is 107) we generate a string that is the same as the current string except at one position. Then we add the count of that generated string from the dictionary to `ans1`. However, note that when we generate the same string as `s` (i.e., when we don't change the letter) we skip? Actually, the code has a comment `# TODO: Your code here` and then after the inner loops we do `d1[s] += 1`.\n\nBut note: the current approach would count the same string (if it has been seen before) for the two positions and for every possible letter that we change to (including the same letter). However, when we change to the same letter, we get the same string. We don't want to count the same string for the same position? Actually, we are trying to count pairs that differ in exactly one position. The idea is that for a given string `s`, we want to count all the strings that are exactly one character different from `s` and that have been seen before (so that we form a pair (i, j) with i<j).\n\nBut note: the current code does:\n   for each string s:\n        for each position l in [0,1]:\n            for each letter m from 'a' to 'l' (but note: 109 is 'm', and the problem says up to 'k', so we should only go to 107? Actually, the problem says from 'a' to 'k', so 97 to 107. The current loops go from 97 to 108 (since range(97,109) is 97 to 108). That's 12 letters: a to l. But the problem says a to k (11 letters). This might be an error.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\", so 11 letters. The current code uses 12 (a to l). We should fix that? But note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and the letters are from a to k (11 letters). So we should change the inner loop to range(97, 108) (which is 11 letters: 97 to 107 inclusive) and also the initialization of the dictionary.\n\nBut wait, the initialization of the dictionary is for all pairs from a to l? That's 12*12=144. But we only have 11 letters? So we are including an extra letter? This might cause the dictionary to have keys that never appear? That's acceptable, but then when we generate a string with a letter beyond 'k', it won't be in the input? So it's safe? However, the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k', so we should not generate beyond 'k'. \n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we can change the inner loop to go from 97 to 107 (inclusive). However, the provided code has:\n\n    for i in range(97,109):   # 97 to 108 (12 letters: a to l)\n    for j in range(97,109):\n\nWe should change that to 97 to 107? But the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k'. So the generated strings that we consider should also be in that set? Actually, the input strings are in that set, but when we change one character we might generate a string that is not in the set? But the problem does not say we cannot have a letter beyond 'k'. However, the input is guaranteed to be from 'a' to 'k'. So the generated string might have a letter beyond 'k'? Then we would be counting a string that has never been seen? That's acceptable because the dictionary was initialized to 0 for all keys from a to l. But if we generate a string with a letter beyond 'k', then it's not in the input? So the count for that key would be 0? So it's safe? But we are wasting iterations.\n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we can restrict the inner loop to 97 to 107. However, the current code uses 109 as the end. We can leave it as is? But the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k', so we are generating keys that are not in the input? That's acceptable.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the TODO part. The code currently:\n\n    for y in range(n):\n        s = input()\n        for l in range(2):\n            for m in range(97,109):\n                a = list(s)\n                a[l] = chr(m)\n                a = ''.join(a)\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                ans1 += d1[a]\n        d1[s] += 1\n\nThe problem: when we generate a string `a` that is the same as `s` (which happens when we set the letter to the same letter at that position), we have a condition. We should skip counting that? Because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. The same string would be a pair that differs in zero positions. Also, note that we are going to count the same string multiple times? Actually, we are iterating over two positions and 12 letters. For each string, we are generating 2*12=24 strings. But when we generate the same string, we are going to add the count of that string (which includes the same string that we are processing, but note: we haven't added the current string to the dictionary yet because we do `d1[s] += 1` after the inner loops). So at the time we process the current string, the dictionary has counts for the previous strings.\n\nBut the issue: when `a == s`, we are going to add `d1[s]` (which is the count of `s` from previous strings). But that would count pairs where the two strings are the same? But we don't want that. We want exactly one position different. So we should skip when `a == s`.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut note: the code currently has `ans1 += d1[a]` for every generated string. We want to skip the same string. So we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n    else:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut the code already has `ans1 += d1[a]` after the if. So we can change the TODO to:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut note: we cannot break the inner loops because we have to consider other changes. So we just skip this particular `a`.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid generating the same string? But the inner loop goes over all letters including the current one. So we can change the inner loop to skip the current letter? But that would be more efficient. However, the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and 2*12=24 per string, so 2.4e6 iterations which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem: the inner loop goes from 97 to 108 (12 letters). We are generating 12*2 = 24 per string. However, we are including the same letter. So we can skip the same letter? Then we would generate 11*2 = 22 per string. But the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters). So we can change the inner loop to skip the current letter? Actually, we can do:\n\n    for m in range(97, 109):\n        if chr(m) == s[l]:\n            continue\n        ... \n\nBut then we don't need the `if a == s` check? Because we skip the same letter. Then we avoid generating the same string. So we can remove the TODO and the condition? But the code currently has the condition. We can replace the TODO with a `continue` and then remove the condition? Actually, the code has:\n\n    if a == s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut note: the code after the if is `ans1 += d1[a]`. So if we do `continue` in the if block, then for the same string we skip the addition.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip generating the same letter. That would be more efficient. But the problem does not require efficiency beyond the constraints. However, let's do the skip by letter to avoid generating the same string.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and 2*11=22 per string, so 2.2e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo we can change the inner loop to skip the current letter? But the problem says the input letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we are generating only valid letters? Actually, we are generating from 'a' to 'l', but the input strings are only from 'a' to 'k'. So when we change a letter to 'l', that string has never been seen? So we can skip the same letter and also we can change the inner loop to go from 97 to 107? But the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k'. So we can do:\n\n    for m in range(97, 108):   # 97 to 107 inclusive (11 letters)\n        if chr(m) == s[l]:\n            continue\n        a = list(s)\n        a[l] = chr(m)\n        a = ''.join(a)\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut note: the dictionary was initialized for keys from 97 to 108? Now we are generating keys that are in the set of 97 to 107? But the dictionary has keys for 97 to 108? So it's safe? However, we are not generating keys with 'l'? But the input doesn't have 'l'? So the dictionary has 0 for those keys? So it's safe.\n\nBut the initialization of the dictionary was for 97 to 108? We can change that to 97 to 107? Actually, the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we can initialize the dictionary for 97 to 107? But the code currently:\n\n    for i in range(97,109):\n        for j in range(97,109):\n            d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n\nWe can change both loops to 97 to 107? That would be 11*11=121 keys. But the input strings are in that set? Yes. And we are generating only keys in that set? Yes, because we are using m in 97 to 107. So we can do that to save memory? But 144 vs 121 is negligible.\n\nBut the problem: the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are doing 2*11=22 per string, so 2.2e6 per test case? But note: the total n over test cases <= 10^5. So the total number of strings is 10^5. So the total operations would be 10^5 * 22 = 2.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan for program1.py:\n1. Change the initialization of the dictionary to 97 to 107 (inclusive) for both loops.\n2. In the inner loop for m, skip the current letter at position l.\n3. Remove the condition `if a == s` and the TODO, and instead skip by the letter.\n\nBut note: the code currently has:\n\n    for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\nWe want to change to:\n\n    for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97, 108):   # 97 to 107 inclusive (11 letters)\n            if chr(m) == s[l]:\n                continue\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut note: we must also change the dictionary initialization to 97 to 107.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave the dictionary initialization as 97 to 108? Then we are including keys for 'l'? But we are not generating keys with 'l'? So when we do `ans1 += d1[a]` for a string that has a letter beyond 'k', we are accessing a key that we initialized? Yes, because we initialized for 97 to 108. But if we change the inner loop to 97 to 107, then we are not generating keys with 'l'. So it's safe.\n\nBut the problem: the input strings are from 'a' to 'k', so the dictionary keys for 'l' will always be 0? So we can leave the dictionary as 12x12? But then we are using more memory? 144 keys is negligible. So we can leave it? But the problem says the input is from 'a' to 'k'. So we can change the inner loop to 97 to 107 and leave the dictionary as 97 to 108? Then we are generating keys that are in the set of the dictionary? Yes.\n\nBut to be consistent, we can change the dictionary initialization to 97 to 107? Since the input is only from 'a' to 'k'. And we are generating only from 'a' to 'k'. So we can do:\n\n    for i in range(97,108):\n        for j in range(97,108):\n            d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are of length 2, and each character from 'a' to 'k'. So we are covering all possible strings? Yes.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is actually the entire program? But we are only to output the missing parts? The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The provided code has a TODO and also the dictionary initialization and inner loops might be fixed? But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nActually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nBut note: the provided code for program1.py has a TODO and also the inner loops are written with 109 (which we want to change to 108? because range(97,108) goes from 97 to 107). Actually, the end of range is exclusive. So:\n\n    range(97,108) -> 97 to 107 (inclusive) -> 11 letters: 107-97+1 = 11.\n\nBut the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters). So we must change the dictionary initialization and the inner loop.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is in the inner loop. However, we are also changing the initialization and the inner loop. How to represent?\n\nWe are to output the entire fixed program? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". Actually, the problem says: \"with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in\". So we are to fill in the missing parts? But the TODO is a block. However, we are also changing the initialization and the inner loop? But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the initialization and the inner loop are provided, but they are incorrect? We are to fix them? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is explicitly missing. The other parts are not missing, they are present but incorrect? The problem does not say we can fix existing code? It says \"fill in\" missing lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". So we are allowed to change the existing code? But the output format says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we are only to output the parts that are missing? The TODO is missing. The rest we are not to change? But then the program might not work.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect that we only fill the TODO? Then we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut then the inner loop still runs for 12 letters and includes the same letter? Then we would be generating the same string and skipping it. But that would work? And the dictionary is initialized for 12x12? But the input strings are only 11 letters? So the dictionary has keys for the 11x11? Actually, 12x12 includes the 11x11? So it's safe.\n\nSo if we are only allowed to fill the TODO, then we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut note: the code after the if is `ans1 += d1[a]`. So we skip the same string.\n\nBut what about the letter 'l'? We are generating strings with 'l'? Then we are adding `d1[a]` for a string that has a letter 'l'. But the input strings never have 'l', so `d1[a]` is 0? So it's safe.\n\nSo we can leave the initialization and the inner loop as they are and just fill the TODO with `continue`.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nBut note: the code has:\n\n        if a == s:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        ans1+=d1[a]\n\nWe want to skip the `ans1 += d1[a]` when `a == s`. So we can put `continue` in the TODO block? Then the rest of the block for that a is skipped? But the `ans1 += d1[a]` is after the if block. So we need to skip that line. We can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n\nThen the `ans1 += d1[a]` is not executed for that a.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    if a != s:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut then we have to remove the existing `ans1 += d1[a]`? But we are not allowed to change existing code? The problem says \"fill in\" the missing lines. So we are only to write the TODO part? Then we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        pass\n    else:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut that would require changing the existing line? We cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    if a == s:\n        continue\n    # else: the existing line\n\nBut the existing line is after the if block. So if we do `continue`, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the inner loop (for this m) and go to the next m. Then the `ans1 += d1[a]` is skipped.\n\nSo the TODO block should be:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n\nBut note: the code has an indentation of 8 spaces for the TODO? Actually, the code has:\n\n        if a == s:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        ans1+=d1[a]\n\nWe are to replace the TODO comment with `continue`? Then the code becomes:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n        ans1+=d1[a]\n\nThat is correct.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is just the line `continue` in the TODO block? But note: the TODO block is a comment. We are to replace the entire comment with `continue`? Actually, we are to write the code that goes in place of the TODO.\n\nSo the completion for program1.py is the string: \"        continue\" (with 8 spaces) but note the existing code has 12 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the code:\n\n    for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans1+=d1[a]\n\nThe if block is indented by 12 spaces? Then the TODO comment is at 16? We are to put `continue` at the same indentation? So:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n\nBut the existing line `ans1 += d1[a]` is at 12 spaces? So the entire block becomes:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\nBut we are only to output the missing code? So we output the line \"                continue\" for program1.py? But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the TODO comment with a line of code.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the entire fixed program? But the output format says: only the missing code.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\". And the example output format is a json with two strings: the completions for program1 and program2.\n\nSo for program1.py, the completion is the string: \"                continue\" (with 16 spaces? or 12? Actually, the existing code has 12 spaces for the inner block and 16 for the inner if?).\n\nBut note: the code we are given for program1.py has:\n\n    for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans1+=d1[a]\n\nThe if block is at the same indentation as the inner for loop? Actually, the inner for loop body is indented by 8 (relative to the outer for) and then the if is indented by 12? Actually, the code:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor x in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    d1 = {}\n    for i in range(97,109):\n        for j in range(97,109):\n            d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n    ans1 = 0\n    for y in range(n):\n        s = input()\n        for l in range(2):\n            for m in range(97,109):\n                a = list(s)\n                a[l] = chr(m)\n                a = ''.join(a)\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                ans1+=d1[a]\n        d1[s]+=1\n    print(ans1)\n\nThe inner block for the for m loop is:\n\n                a = list(s)\n                a[l] = chr(m)\n                a = ''.join(a)\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                ans1+=d1[a]\n\nThe if block is at the same indentation as the assignment to a? So 16 spaces? Then the TODO comment is at 20? We are to put `continue` at 20 spaces? But the next line `ans1 += d1[a]` is at 16 spaces.\n\nSo the completion for the TODO block is the line: \"                    continue\"\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the json as a string.\n\nSo for program1.py, the completion string is: \"                    continue\"\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider that the inner loop runs for 12 letters and we are generating the same string? But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and 2*12=24 per string, so 2.4e6, which is acceptable. And the dictionary has 12x12=144 keys, which is acceptable.\n\nSo we leave the initialization and the inner loop as is.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We have n locks with volumes v1, v2, ..., vn. We have q queries. For each query t_j, we want the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n    volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n    queries = map(int, queries)\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n    res = []\n    for q in map(int, queries):\n        if q < t_min:\n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        res.append(ans)\n\n    print('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))\n\nWe are to fill the TODO.\n\nWhat is t_min? The code computes:\n\n    s = total volume up to lock i (from lock 1 to lock i)\n    then for the i-th lock, we compute the minimal time required to fill the first i locks? Actually, the condition: \n        t_min = max(t_min, ceil(s / i))\n\nWhy? Consider: to fill the first i locks, the water must pass through lock 1, then lock 2, etc. The total water that must have entered the system to fill the first i locks is s (the sum of the volumes). But note: the water flows through the pipes. However, the water that goes beyond lock i doesn't help. \n\nBut the problem: the water that enters at any lock before i will eventually fill the locks up to i? Actually, the water from a pipe at lock j (for j<=i) will contribute to filling locks from j to i. But the total water that must have passed through lock 1 is at least v1. The total water that must have passed through lock 2 is at least v1+v2, and so on. Therefore, the total water that has entered the system (from any pipes) must be at least the sum of the volumes of the first i locks. And since we can have at most t_j seconds, the total water that can be poured is (number of pipes) * t_j. But note: the water is distributed arbitrarily? Actually, the water from a pipe at lock j only starts contributing to lock j at time 0? But the water from a pipe at lock j doesn't have to go through the previous locks? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second.\" and then if the lock is full, the water overflows to the next lock. So the water from a pipe at lock j does not go through the previous locks. Therefore, the total water that must be poured into the first i locks is the sum of the volumes of the first i locks? And the water poured into the first i locks can come from any pipe at lock 1 to i. \n\nBut note: a pipe at lock j (j>i) does not contribute to the first i locks? Actually, the water from a pipe at lock j (j>i) goes to lock j and then to j+1, etc., so it doesn't go to the first i locks. Therefore, the total water that can be used for the first i locks is the water from the pipes in the first i locks. \n\nSo to fill the first i locks, we need at least ceil(s_i / k) seconds? where k is the number of pipes in the first i locks? But the time t_j is fixed. The condition is: the total water that the pipes in the first i locks can pour in t_j seconds is k * t_j. And we require k * t_j >= s_i.\n\nBut note: the water poured at lock j (for j<=i) might not all stay in the first i locks? Actually, if a lock j (j<=i) is full, then the excess water goes to lock j+1, and if j+1 is full, then to j+2, etc. So the entire water poured in the first i locks is used to fill the first i locks? Because any water that overflows from lock i goes to lock i+1 and beyond, so it doesn't help the first i locks. Therefore, the water that is poured in the first i locks must be at least the sum of the volumes of the first i locks.\n\nSo for the first i locks, we require: \n    k_i * t_j >= s_i\nwhere k_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to put pipes only in the first i locks? But the pipes beyond i do not help the first i locks. So to fill the first i locks, we must have at least ceil(s_i / t_j) pipes in the first i locks.\n\nBut the problem: we want to fill all locks (all n locks). So we require for every i from 1 to n: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(s_i / t_j). Therefore, the total number of pipes k must be at least max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(s_i / i) ??? \n\nWait, the provided code computes:\n\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nThis computes t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i). Why i? In the denominator? \n\nBut note: the condition we derived: for the first i locks, we require k_i * t_j >= s_i, so k_i >= ceil(s_i / t_j). Therefore, the minimal total number of pipes k (which is at least k_i for every i) must be at least max_i ceil(s_i / t_j). But wait, that is for a fixed t_j. \n\nBut the code computes t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i). What is the meaning of i in the denominator? \n\nActually, the code uses `i` as the number of locks? But in the condition we have k_i * t_j >= s_i, so for a fixed t_j, the minimal k_i is ceil(s_i / t_j). Then the total number of pipes k must be at least max_i (ceil(s_i / t_j)). \n\nBut the code computes:\n\n    t_min = max(t_min, ceil(s_i / i))\n\nThis is independent of t_j. What is this t_min? \n\nNote: the problem says that the mayor asks for the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds all locks are filled. And if it is impossible (if t_j < t_min) then output -1.\n\nSo t_min is the minimal time required to fill all locks? How? \n\nActually, consider: the total water that must be poured to fill the entire system is the sum of all volumes, say S. But that is not sufficient because of the overflow constraints. The key is the chain: the water for lock i must come from the pipes at lock i or from the overflow of lock i-1. But the overflow of lock i-1 is limited by the time? \n\nThe minimal time to fill the entire system is determined by the bottleneck: the first lock must be filled in at least ceil(v1 / k1) seconds? but k1 is the number of pipes at lock1? But we don't know k1. \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the constraint for the first i locks: the total water that must be poured into the first i locks is s_i. And the water can only come from the pipes in the first i locks. And the time is t_j. So we require that the number of pipes in the first i locks, say k_i, satisfies k_i * t_j >= s_i. Therefore, k_i >= ceil(s_i / t_j). Then the total number of pipes k (which is the sum of all pipes) must be at least max_i (ceil(s_i / t_j)).\n\nBut note: k_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks, and k_i <= k (the total pipes). So k must be at least max_i (ceil(s_i / t_j)).\n\nTherefore, the minimal k for a given t_j is k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j).\n\nBut the problem: we are to compute the minimal number of pipes k such that the entire system is filled by time t_j. And we have shown that k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j). \n\nBut note: the provided code computes:\n\n    t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i)\n\nWhat is the meaning of i in the denominator? It is not t_j. \n\nActually, the code uses `i` as the index (number of locks). But we see that if we set t_j = ceil(s_i / i) for each i, then the minimal k would be at least i? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, consider: the minimal time required to fill the entire system is at least max_i (ceil(s_i / k))? But k is the total number of pipes? But k is not known.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the mayor asks: for a given t_j, what is the minimal k? \n\nThe provided code computes a value t_min and then for a query q (which is t_j) if q < t_min then it's impossible. What is t_min? \n\nThe code:\n\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nThis computes t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i). \n\nWhy? Consider: the first i locks require s_i liters. The water for the first i locks must come from the pipes in the first i locks. But the maximum number of pipes that can be placed in the first i locks is i (one per lock). Therefore, the minimal time to fill the first i locks is at least ceil(s_i / i). And the entire system requires at least max_i (ceil(s_i / i)) seconds? Because the first i locks cannot be filled faster than ceil(s_i / i) seconds, no matter how we distribute the pipes? \n\nTherefore, t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i) is the minimal time required to fill the entire system? And if t_j < t_min, then it's impossible.\n\nNow, for a query t_j >= t_min, we want the minimal number of pipes k.\n\nWe have: k must be at least max_i ceil(s_i / t_j). Why? Because for the first i locks, we require k_i * t_j >= s_i, so k_i >= ceil(s_i / t_j). And k >= k_i, so k >= ceil(s_i / t_j) for every i. Therefore, k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j).\n\nBut note: we can achieve k = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j) by placing the pipes optimally? \n\nActually, we can place one pipe per lock? But we are allowed to put any number of pipes per lock? The problem does not say we can put at most one pipe per lock. It says \"open pipes\", and we can open any set of pipes. So we can open multiple pipes at the same lock? The problem does not say we cannot. So we can open k pipes arbitrarily distributed? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"open pipes in locks\", meaning we choose a set of locks to open pipes. But it does not say we can open more than one pipe per lock. The picture shows one pipe per lock. The problem says: \"the pipe attached to it\" (singular). So we assume one pipe per lock? \n\nBut the problem says: \"For the j-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open\" and in the example: \"open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4\" (three pipes). So we can open at most one pipe per lock? \n\nTherefore, the set of pipes is a subset of the locks. \n\nBut then the condition: for the first i locks, the number of pipes in the first i locks is k_i, and we require k_i * t_j >= s_i. Therefore, k_i >= ceil(s_i / t_j). And the total number of pipes k is the total number of locks we open, and k_i is the number of pipes we open in the first i locks. \n\nWe want to minimize k. How? We want to choose a set of locks (any subset) such that for every i, the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(s_i / t_j). And we want the minimal total k.\n\nThis is a classic greedy problem: we want to cover the constraints for every i with the minimal number of pipes. The constraint for i is: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least x_i = ceil(s_i / t_j). \n\nBut note: the constraints are: \n    k_1 >= x_1\n    k_2 >= x_2\n    ...\n    k_n >= x_n\n\nwhere k_i is the number of pipes chosen in the first i locks.\n\nAnd we want to minimize k = k_n.\n\nHow to compute k_min? We can use a greedy algorithm: we traverse from left to right and whenever the current k_i (which is the count of pipes chosen so far) is less than x_i, we need to add pipes in the locks from i to n? But we can add pipes anywhere? Actually, we can add pipes in the locks beyond i? But that doesn't help the constraint for i because pipes beyond i are not in the first i locks.\n\nTherefore, we must have the pipes for the constraint i placed in the first i locks. \n\nSo the minimal k is the maximum over i of x_i? \n\nBut note: the constraints are increasing? Not necessarily. For example, if s_i grows linearly, then x_i = ceil(s_i / t_j) might be increasing? But if the volumes are arbitrary, then s_i is increasing, but x_i = ceil(s_i / t_j) might not be increasing? For example, if t_j is large, then x_i might be 1 for all i? Then the maximum is 1. But we can cover all constraints with 1 pipe? Not necessarily: if we put the pipe at lock n, then for the first i locks (i<n) we have k_i=0, which is less than 1. So we must have at least one pipe in the first n-1 locks? \n\nActually, the constraint for i is: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least x_i. Therefore, the minimal total pipes k must be at least max_i x_i. But is it sufficient? \n\nSuppose we set k = max_i x_i. Can we assign the pipes to locks so that for every i, the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least x_i? \n\nNote: the constraints are: \n    x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \nand we know that x_i is non-decreasing? Actually, s_i is increasing (since volumes are positive) and t_j is fixed, so x_i = ceil(s_i / t_j) is non-decreasing? \n\nBut is it? \n    s_{i} = s_{i-1} + v_i >= s_{i-1}\n    so ceil(s_i / t_j) >= ceil(s_{i-1} / t_j)\n\nTherefore, x_i is non-decreasing. \n\nThen the maximum of x_i is x_n. But then k_min = x_n? \n\nBut consider: the constraint for i is k_i >= x_i, and since x_i is non-decreasing, the last constraint (i=n) is the strongest: k_n >= x_n. And if we set k = x_n, then we can put all x_n pipes in the first n locks? But we must also satisfy the earlier constraints. Since x_i <= x_n for all i, then k_i (which is the number of pipes in the first i locks) can be at most k = x_n. But we need k_i >= x_i. How can we ensure that? \n\nWe can put the pipes arbitrarily in the locks. The minimal way: we need to cover the constraint that the cumulative count of pipes up to lock i is at least x_i. Since the x_i are non-decreasing, we can put the pipes as far to the left as possible? \n\nBut note: if we put all x_n pipes in the last x_n locks, then for the first i locks (for i < n - x_n + 1) we have 0 pipes, which might be less than x_i. \n\nSo we must distribute the pipes to cover the constraints. The minimal total pipes is the maximum of the x_i, but we must also ensure that the cumulative counts are at least the x_i. \n\nHow to compute the minimal k? \n\nWe have: k_min = max_i x_i = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j)\n\nBut is that sufficient? \n\nExample: \n    n=2, v1=1, v2=2, t_j=2.\n    s1 = 1 -> x1 = ceil(1/2)=1\n    s2 = 1+2=3 -> x2 = ceil(3/2)=2\n    k_min = 2.\n\nWe need 2 pipes. We can put one at lock1 and one at lock2. Then at time 2:\n    lock1: 2 liters (from pipe1) -> fills 1 liter and overflows 1 liter to lock2.\n    lock2: gets 1 liter from overflow and 2 liters from its own pipe -> 3 liters? but it only needs 2. So it fills at time 2? \n    Actually, at time1: lock1 gets 1 liter (from pipe1) and becomes full. Then the overflow of 1 liter at time1 goes to lock2? Then at time2: \n        pipe1: 1 liter to lock1 -> overflows to lock2 (because lock1 is full) -> 1 liter to lock2.\n        pipe2: 1 liter to lock2.\n        so lock2 gets 1 (from overflow at time1) + 1 (from pipe1 at time2) + 1 (from pipe2 at time2) = 3 liters? \n    But we only need 2. \n\nBut the constraint: the water that enters lock1 at time1: 1 liter (from pipe1) -> fills lock1. Then the overflow at time1: 0? because only 1 liter entered and lock1 has volume 1. Then at time2: \n    pipe1: 1 liter -> lock1 is full, so overflows to lock2 -> 1 liter to lock2.\n    pipe2: 1 liter to lock2.\n    so lock2 gets 2 liters at time2? which is exactly full.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what if we put both pipes at lock2? \n    Then at time1: \n        lock2 gets 2 liters? but lock2 has volume 2, so it becomes full? \n        but lock1 is empty? \n    Then at time2: \n        lock2 gets 2 more liters -> overflows 2 liters to the river? \n        lock1 remains empty.\n\nSo we must have a pipe in lock1? \n\nThe constraint for i=1: we need at least 1 pipe in the first 1 lock. So we must put a pipe in lock1. \n\nTherefore, the minimal k is 2, and we must put one pipe in lock1 and one in lock2.\n\nBut the formula k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j) = max(ceil(1/2), ceil(3/2)) = max(1,2)=2.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what if we have:\n    n=3, v1=3, v2=1, v3=1, t_j=2.\n    s1=3 -> x1 = ceil(3/2)=2\n    s2=4 -> x2 = ceil(4/2)=2\n    s3=5 -> x3 = ceil(5/2)=3\n    k_min = 3.\n\nWe need 3 pipes. We put one in each lock? \n    At time1: \n        lock1: 1 (from pipe1) -> not full\n        lock2: 1 (from pipe2) -> full? (volume=1) -> overflows 0? \n        lock3: 1 (from pipe3) -> full? (volume=1) -> overflows 0?\n    At time2:\n        lock1: 1 more -> total 2, not full (needs 3) -> so not filled.\n\nWhat's the issue? The constraint for the first lock: we need 2 pipes in the first lock? But we only put one pipe in lock1. So the constraint for i=1: k1=1, but we need 2. \n\nTherefore, we must have two pipes in the first lock? \n\nBut we have three pipes: we can put two in lock1 and one in lock2? \n    Then at time1:\n        lock1: 2 liters -> not full (needs 3)\n        lock2: 1 liter -> full? then overflows 0? \n    At time2:\n        lock1: 2 more liters -> total 4? but volume 3 -> so 3 liters and 1 overflow to lock2.\n        lock2: already had 1 liter (full) so the overflow from lock1 (1 liter) overflows to lock3? \n        lock2: also gets 1 liter from its own pipe? -> but we only have one pipe at lock2? \n        Actually, we have two pipes at lock1 and one at lock2? \n        So at time2: \n            lock1: 2 liters (from its two pipes) -> total 4? but volume 3 -> so 3 in lock1 and 1 overflow to lock2.\n            lock2: 1 liter from its own pipe and 1 liter from lock1 -> total 2, but volume 1 -> so 1 in lock2 and 1 overflow to lock3.\n            lock3: 1 liter from lock2 -> fills to 1 (its volume).\n        So at time2, all locks are full.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j).\n\nSo for the TODO in program2.py, we can do:\n\n    ans = (s + q - 1) // q   # for the entire sum? but that is ceil(s_n / q) but we need max_i ceil(s_i / q)\n\nBut note: we have to compute the maximum over i of ceil(s_i / t_j). But we have already computed s_i for all i? \n\nBut the code has already read the volumes and computed t_min, but we did not store the s_i. We only stored the maximum of ceil(s_i / i) for the t_min.\n\nWe need to compute k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j) for the given query t_j.\n\nBut we did not store the partial sums s_i. The code:\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nWe stored the entire sum s? But we need the partial sums for each i.\n\nBut the problem: n and q can be up to 200,000. We cannot store the volumes and then for each query iterate over n to compute the maximum ceil(s_i / t_j) because that would be O(n*q) = 200,000 * 200,000 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\nWe must precompute the partial sums? But the code has already read the volumes and then we are iterating over the volumes to compute t_min. We can store the partial sums in an array? But the problem says we are reading from stdin and we have already read the volumes. \n\nWe are given:\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n    volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n    queries = map(int, queries)\n\nThen we do:\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nBut after this, the `volumes` is exhausted? And we don't have the partial sums.\n\nWe need to store the partial sums? But the problem says the sum of the volumes is large (v_i up to 1e9, n up to 200,000, so s_i up to 2e14). We can store the partial sums in a list? That would be 200,000 integers, which is acceptable.\n\nSo we can change the code to store the partial sums? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are not allowed to change existing code? \n\nAlternatively, we can recompute the partial sums for each query? But that would be O(n) per query, and q up to 200,000, so 200,000 * 200,000 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\nTherefore, we must store the partial sums.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are only to fill the TODO block? \n\nHow can we do it without changing the existing code? \n\nWe see that the existing code does not store the partial sums. So we must change the existing code? But we are not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the volumes again? But the stdin has been read.\n\nWe are given:\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n\nHere, `volumes` is a string of the second line? and then we split it and mapped to int, but we did not store the list? We did:\n\n    volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n\nThis is an iterator. We exhausted it in the first loop. \n\nSo we cannot recompute the partial sums.\n\nTherefore, we must store the partial sums in the first loop. But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\nThe problem says: \"Complete the code in python\" and \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nBut the TODO block is in the last part. We are allowed to add code above? The TODO block is only in the else branch.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the partial sums in a list during the first loop? But that would be changing the existing code.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the missing parts. The existing code is given, but we can add code in the TODO block? But the TODO block is only in the else branch.\n\nWe can do: in the else branch, we recompute the partial sums? But we don't have the volumes anymore.\n\nWe must change the existing code to store the partial sums? But the problem says only to output the missing code.\n\nThis is a dilemma.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" \n\nSo we must output the entire fixed program? But the output format is a json with two strings: the completions for program1 and program2.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the partial sums in the first loop by converting the `volumes` to a list first? But that would be changing the existing code.\n\nBut the existing code is:\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n    volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n    queries = map(int, queries)\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nWe can change it to:\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n    volumes = list(map(int, volumes.split()))   # change to list\n    queries = list(map(int, queries))            # not necessary, but for safety\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    partial_sums = []\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        partial_sums.append(s)   # store the partial sum for index i (which is the sum of the first i volumes)\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\nBut then in the TODO block, we can use partial_sums.\n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing code? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow us to output the entire fixed program for program2.py? But the output format is only the missing code.\n\nBut the example output format is a json with two strings: the completions for program1 and program2. And the completions are the missing code.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is only the else branch? \n\nHow to compute k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j) without the partial sums? \n\nWe cannot. \n\nTherefore, we must store the partial sums. And that requires changing the existing code. But the problem says only to output the missing code.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nLet me read the provided code again for program2.py:\n\n    from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n    def debug(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(*args, file=stderr, **kwargs)\n\n    _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n    volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n    queries = map(int, queries)\n\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n    res = []\n    for q in map(int, queries):\n        if q < t_min:\n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        res.append(ans)\n\n    print('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))\n\n We see that after the first loop, `s` is the total sum of all volumes. But we need the partial sums for each i.\n\n We also see that the variable `volumes` is an iterator that is exhausted. \n\n One solution: we can read the input again? But stdin is read.\n\n Or: we can store the volumes in a list in the first place. \n\n But we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n We can do: \n\n    else:\n        # We need to compute max_i ceil(s_i / q)\n        # But we don't have the partial sums.\n        # We can read the input again? \n        # But stdin is already read.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can store the partial sums in the first loop by changing the code? \n        # But we are not allowed.\n\n        # We must change the existing code? \n\n Given the constraints, we must store the partial sums. \n\n Since the problem says the total sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200,000, but here there is only one test case? The input is one n, then a list of n volumes, then q, then q queries.\n\n So we are allowed to store the volumes? \n\n But the existing code does not. \n\n How about we change the existing code to store the volumes? But again, we are only to output the missing code.\n\n This is not possible. \n\n Therefore, the intended solution might be to precompute the partial sums and store them. \n\n And the problem expects us to change the existing code? But the output format says only the missing code.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow us to output the entire program for program2.py? But the instructions say only the missing code.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the provided code for program2.py: it does not store the partial sums. \n\n How did the author compute t_min? They did a loop and computed s_i for i=1..n, but did not store them. \n\n For the TODO, we need the s_i for i=1..n. \n\n So we must store them. \n\n Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code includes changes to the existing code? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n We can output for program2.py a string that includes the fixed existing code and the TODO block? \n\n But the output format is: \n    {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n And the completion for program2.py should be the entire program? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n Alternatively, we can output for program2.py the code that goes in the TODO block, and also assume that we have stored the partial sums? \n\n But how? \n\n Let me try to reframe: maybe we can compute the maximum ceil(s_i / t_j) without the partial sums by using a different method. \n\n We have to compute: \n    k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(s_i / t_j)\n\n But we don't have s_i. \n\n One idea: the sequence s_i is the prefix sums. And the function ceil(s_i / t_j) is unimodal? not necessarily. \n\n Another idea: we can binary search on k_min? but we don't have the volumes anymore.\n\n This is not possible.\n\n Therefore, I think we are allowed to change the existing code to store the partial sums. \n\n And the problem expects us to output the entire fixed code for program2.py? But the instructions say only the missing code.\n\n Given the instructions, I think we are to output only the code that goes in the TODO block, and for the existing code we cannot change. \n\n But then program2.py will not work. \n\n The only solution is to output for program2.py the following in the TODO block: \n\n    ans = 0\n    s_i = 0\n    # We need to iterate over the volumes again, but we don't have them.\n    # volumes is exhausted.\n\n This is not possible.\n\n Therefore, I must assume that the intended solution for program2.py is to store the partial sums in the first loop. \n\n So for program2.py, the completion includes changes to the existing code and the TODO block. \n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n How to output changes to existing code? \n\n The problem might allow us to output the entire program for program2.py? \n\n But then for program1.py, we only output a single line. \n\n The output format is a json with two string fields. \n\n For program2.py, the string would be the entire fixed program? \n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n Alternatively, we can output for program2.py the following string:\n\n    volumes = list(map(int, volumes.split()))\n    queries = list(map(int, queries))\n    partial_sums = []\n    s = t_min = 0\n    for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n        s += v\n        partial_sums.append(s)\n        div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n        t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n    res = []\n    for q in queries:\n        if q < t_min:\n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            max_ceil = 0\n            for i in range(1, len(partial_sums)+1):\n                # s_i = partial_sums[i-1] because i starts at 1\n                s_i = partial_sums[i-1]\n                # ceil(s_i / q) = (s_i + q - 1) // q\n                ceil_val = (s_i + q - 1) // q\n                if ceil_val > max_ceil:\n                    max_ceil = ceil_val\n            ans = max_ceil\n        res.append(ans)\n\n But then we are doing a loop over n for each query, and q can be 200,000, and n=200,000, so 40e9 iterations, which is too slow.\n\n We must optimize. \n\n Note: k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / q) = max_i floor((s_i - 1) / q) + 1 = floor((max_i (s_i - 1)) / q) + 1?  -> No, because ceil(a/b) = floor((a-1)/b)+1 only for integer a,b? \n\n But s_i and q are integers. \n\n However, ceil(s_i / q) = floor((s_i - 1) / q) + 1.\n\n And we want max_i floor((s_i - 1) / q) + 1.\n\n = [max_i floor((s_i - 1) / q)] + 1.\n\n But note: the maximum might not be assumed by the maximum s_i? because floor is not necessarily increasing with s_i? \n\n Example: \n    s_i = 3, q=2 -> floor((3-1)/2)= floor(2/2)=1 -> then 2.\n    s_i = 4, q=3 -> floor((4-1)/3)= floor(3/3)=1 -> then 2.\n    s_i = 4, q=2 -> floor((4-1)/2)= floor(3/2)=1 -> then 2.\n    s_i = 5, q=3 -> floor((5-1)/3)= floor(4/3)=1 -> then 2.\n\n But also: \n    s_i = 1, q=1 -> floor(0/1)=0 -> 1.\n    s_i = 2, q=1 -> floor(1/1)=1 -> 2.\n\n So floor((s_i-1)/q) is non-decreasing in s_i? \n\n Therefore, the maximum is floor((s_n - 1) / q) + 1? \n\n But wait: \n    s_i might be not the maximum at i=n? \n    s_i is the prefix sum, so s_i is increasing. \n    Therefore, floor((s_i-1)/q) is non-decreasing in i.\n\n So the maximum is floor((s_n - 1) / q) + 1? \n\n But then k_min = floor((s_n - 1) / q) + 1.\n\n But is that equal to ceil(s_n / q)? \n    ceil(s_n / q) = floor((s_n - 1) / q) + 1.\n\n And since the function floor((s_i-1)/q) is non-decreasing in i, then the maximum over i is at i=n: floor((s_n-1)/q)+1.\n\n Therefore, k_min = ceil(s_n / q) = (s_n + q - 1) // q.\n\n But wait, this is not true! \n\n Example earlier: \n    n=2, v1=1, v2=2, t_j=2.\n    s1=1, s2=3.\n    ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2.\n    The maximum is 2, which is ceil(s2/2)=ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n    floor((3-1)/2)+1 = floor(2/2)+1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n    But also, ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n    And for the first lock: ceil(1/2)=1, which is less than 2.\n\n Therefore, k_min = ceil(s_n / q) ? \n\n But then in the example n=3, v1=3, v2=1, v3=1, t_j=2.\n    s1=3, s2=4, s3=5.\n    ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3.\n    so k_min=3.\n    ceil(s_n / q) = ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n So it is! \n\n Therefore, k_min = ceil(s_n / q) = (s_n + q - 1) // q.\n\n But wait, what is s_n? It is the total sum of all volumes. \n\n And we have that from the first loop: the variable `s` is the total sum.\n\n Therefore, in the TODO block, we can simply do:\n\n    ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n But is that sufficient? \n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: n=2, s=3, q=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2. -> correct.\n Example 2: n=3, s=5, q=2 -> (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2 = 3. -> correct.\n\n But wait, the example in the note: \n    In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4. \n    The first example test: \n        Input: \n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5 \n            6\n            1\n            2 \n            3 \n            4 \n            5 \n            6 \n        Output: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            4\n            3\n\n        For the sixth query: t_j=6, the answer is 3.\n\n        s = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.\n        ceil(15/6) = ceil(2.5) = 3.\n\n        For the fifth query: t_j=5, ceil(15/5)=3, but the answer is 4? \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n Let me read the example note: \n    \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4.\"\n\n    and for the fifth query: \"one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\".\n\n    So for the fifth query, the answer is 4.\n\n    But ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n    Why is the answer 4?\n\n Let me simulate for the fifth query (t_j=5) with 3 pipes: \n    We try to open 3 pipes, say at locks 1, 3, 4.\n    After 5 seconds:\n\n        lock1: 5 liters (from pipe1) -> but volume=1, so filled at time1 and overflows 4 liters to lock2.\n        lock2: receives 4 liters from lock1 at time1? and then at each second, does it get more? \n                but there is no pipe at lock2. \n                lock2 has volume=2, so at time1: 4 liters -> it only needs 2, so it becomes full and overflows 2 liters to lock3 at time1.\n        lock3: at time1: receives 2 liters from lock2, and also has its own pipe (1 liter per second) -> so at time1: 2 liters (from overflow) + 1 liter (from its pipe) = 3 liters? but volume=3, so filled at time1? and overflows 0 at time1.\n                then from time2 to time5: \n                    lock3: gets 1 liter per second for 4 seconds -> 4 liters, but already full, so overflows 4 liters to lock4.\n        lock4: at time1: 0\n                at time1: overflow from lock3 is 0.\n                then from its own pipe: 1 liter per second for 5 seconds -> 5 liters.\n                and from time2 to time5: overflow from lock3: 4 liters at time2? and then 1 liter per second from its own pipe? \n                Actually, the water from the pipe at lock4: 1 liter per second for 5 seconds = 5 liters.\n                the water from lock3: 4 liters (overflow from lock3 from time2 to time5) -> total 9 liters, but volume=4, so filled at time4? \n        lock5: overflow from lock4: 5+4 - 4 = 5 liters at lock4 overflow? \n                and its own pipe? none.\n                so lock5 gets 5 liters at time5? but volume=5, so filled at time5.\n\n        So it seems to work with 3 pipes.\n\n    But the example says the answer for the fifth query is 4.\n\n    Why? \n\n    The example says: \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\" (4 pipes). \n\n    But they don't say it is minimal. \n\n    However, the example output is 4 for the fifth query.\n\n    So is 3 sufficient for the fifth query? \n\n    Let me recast the example: \n        locks: [1,2,3,4,5] with volumes [1,2,3,4,5]\n        pipes at 1,3,4.\n\n        We need to ensure that by time5, each lock is full.\n\n        lock1: gets 1 liter at time1 -> full. (overflow 0 at time1? because only 1 liter and volume=1) -> then at time2: 1 more liter -> lock1 full, so overflow 1 to lock2.\n        lock2: at time2: 1 liter from lock1 -> not full (volume=2).\n                at time3: lock1 gives 1 overflow, so lock2 gets 1 -> total 2, full. Then overflow to lock3: 0 at time3? because only 1 liter overflow at time3.\n        lock3: has its own pipe: 1 liter per second for 5 seconds = 5 liters.\n                and from lock2: \n                    at time4: lock2 is full, so overflow from lock1 at time4: 1 liter -> lock3 gets 1 at time4.\n                    at time5: lock2 overflows 1 from lock1 -> lock3 gets 1.\n                so lock3: 5 (from its pipe) + 1 (at time4) + 1 (at time5) = 7, but volume=3, so filled by time3? \n                overflow from lock3: \n                    time1: 1 liter (from its pipe) -> not full.\n                    time2: 1 more -> total 2, not full.\n                    time3: 1 more -> total 3, full. Then overflow at time3: 0? because exactly full.\n                    then at time4: 1 liter from its pipe -> overflow 1 to lock4.\n                    and at time4: also gets 1 from lock2 overflow? -> then total at lock3 at time4: 3 (full) and then 1 overflow from lock2 -> but lock3 is full, so overflow 1 to lock4.\n                    at time5: 1 from its pipe -> overflow 1 to lock4.\n        lock4: has its own pipe: 1 per second for 5 seconds = 5.\n                overflow from lock3: \n                    time4: 1+1 = 2 (one from its own pipe at time4 and one from overflow from lock3 at time4? \n                    but how does the water from the pipe at lock4 and the overflow from lock3 interact? \n                lock4: \n                    time1: 1 from its pipe -> 1\n                    time2: 1 -> 2\n                    time3: 1 -> 3\n                    time4: 1 (from its pipe) + 1 (from lock3) = 2 more -> total 5, but volume=4, so full at time4? and overflow 1 to lock5 at time4.\n                    time5: 1 (from its pipe) + 1 (from lock3) = 2 -> overflow 2 to lock5.\n        lock5: \n            time4: 1 from lock4\n            time5: 2 from lock4 -> total 3, but volume=5 -> not full.\n\n        So at time5, lock5 has only 3 liters, not 5.\n\n    Therefore, 3 pipes are not sufficient.\n\n    How about with 4 pipes? \n        say pipes at 1,2,3,4.\n        lock5 has no pipe, so it relies on overflow from lock4.\n\n        lock4: with its own pipe (1 per second) and overflow from lock3.\n        lock5: only from lock4 overflow.\n\n        We need lock5 to get 5 liters by time5.\n\n        The water from lock4: \n            lock4 gets: \n                from its own pipe: 5 seconds * 1 = 5 liters.\n                from lock3: overflow from lock3.\n\n        lock3: \n            from its own pipe: 5 seconds * 1 = 5 liters.\n            from lock2: overflow.\n\n        lock2: \n            from its own pipe: 5 seconds * 1 = 5 liters.\n            from lock1: overflow.\n\n        lock1: \n            from its own pipe: 5 seconds * 1 = 5 liters.\n            volume=1, so overflows 4 liters to lock2.\n\n        lock2: \n            from lock1: 4 liters (overflow) \n            from its own pipe: 5 liters.\n            total = 9 liters, volume=2, so overflows 7 liters to lock3.\n\n        lock3: \n            from lock2: 7 liters.\n            from its own pipe: 5 liters.\n            total = 12, volume=3, so overflows 9 liters to lock4.\n\n        lock4: \n            from lock3: 9 liters.\n            from its own pipe: 5 liters.\n            total = 14, volume=4, so overflows 10 liters to lock5.\n\n        lock5: \n            from lock4: 10 liters, volume=5, so filled at some time? \n            specifically, by time5, it has 10 liters, which is more than enough.\n\n        Therefore, 4 pipes work.\n\n    So the answer for t_j=5 is 4.\n\n    Now, ceil(s_n / q) = ceil(15/5)=3, but we need 4.\n\n    Therefore, our earlier formula k_min = ceil(s_n / q) is not sufficient.\n\n    Why? \n\n    Because the constraint for the first i locks might require more than ceil(s_n / q) pipes? \n\n    For example, consider the first lock: \n        s1 = 1, so ceil(1/5)=1.\n    second lock: s2=3, ceil(3/5)=1.\n    third lock: s3=6, ceil(6/5)=2.\n    fourth lock: s4=10, ceil(10/5)=2.\n    fifth lock: s5=15, ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n    But the strongest constraint is not the last lock? \n\n    The constraint for the third lock: ceil(6/5)=2, meaning we need at least 2 pipes in the first 3 locks.\n    for the fifth lock: ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n    But the example requires 4 pipes. \n\n    What is the catch? \n\n    The catch is that the number of pipes in the first i locks cannot exceed i. \n    And the constraint for the first i locks is: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(s_i / t_j).\n\n    Therefore, the minimal total number of pipes is at least max_i ceil(s_i / t_j), but also, it must be at least the number of pipes required for the individual locks? \n\n    In the example for the fifth query (t_j=5), we have:\n        i=1: ceil(1/5)=1 -> need at least 1 pipe in the first 1 locks.\n        i=2: ceil(3/5)=1 -> need at least 1 pipe in the first 2 locks.\n        i=3: ceil(6/5)=2 -> need at least 2 pipes in the first 3 locks.\n        i=4: ceil(10/5)=2 -> need at least 2 pipes in the first 4 locks.\n        i=5: ceil(15/5)=3 -> need at least 3 pipes in the first 5 locks.\n\n    So the maximum over i is 3. \n\n    Therefore, k_min = 3.\n\n    But we saw that 3 pipes do not work.\n\n    Why? \n\n    Because the water from the pipes in the first i locks might not be enough to fill the first i locks within t_j seconds, if the pipes are not placed optimally? \n\n    But the condition ceil(s_i / t_j) is the minimal number of pipes in the first i locks to have enough water for the first i locks. \n\n    However, the water from the pipes in the first i locks might not be applied in time to the first i locks because of the overflow mechanism? \n\n    Actually, the water from a pipe at lock j (j<=i) will eventually reach the locks from j to i. And the total water is k_i * t_j, which must be >= s_i. \n\n    So the condition is necessary and sufficient. \n\n    Therefore, with 3 pipes in the first 5 locks, we should be able to fill the first 5 locks. \n\n    But our simulation showed that with 3 pipes (at locks 1,3,4) we did not fill lock5 by time5.\n\n    What is the issue in the simulation? \n\n    In the simulation, lock5 only got 3 liters by time5. \n\n    Let me simulate the 3 pipes (at 1,3,4) for 5 seconds in detail:\n\n        lock1: pipe1 -> 1 liter per second.\n        lock3: pipe2 -> 1 liter per second.\n        lock4: pipe3 -> 1 liter per second.\n\n        Second 1:\n            lock1: 1 liter -> full, overflow 0.\n            lock3: 1 liter.\n            lock4: 1 liter.\n            lock2: 0.\n            lock5: 0.\n        Second 2:\n            lock1: 1 liter -> full, so overflow 1 to lock2.\n            lock2: 1 liter.\n            lock3: 1+1=2.\n            lock4: 1+1=2.\n            lock5: 0.\n        Second 3:\n            lock1: 1 -> overflow 1 to lock2.\n            lock2: 1+1=2 -> full, overflow 0+1 (from second3) = 1 to lock3.\n            lock3: 2+1 (from pipe) +1 (from overflow) = 4 -> full (volume=3), overflow 1 to lock4.\n            lock4: 2+1 (from pipe) +1 (from overflow) = 4 -> full (volume=4), overflow 0+1 = 1 to lock5.\n            lock5: 1.\n        Second 4:\n            lock1: 1 -> overflow 1 to lock2.\n            lock2: 0 (because at the end of second3, lock2 was full and then we don't carry over? but at the beginning of second4, lock2 is full) -> so overflow 1 to lock3.\n            lock3: 0 (full) -> overflow 1 (from pipe) +1 (from lock2) = 2 to lock4.\n            lock4: 0 (full) -> overflow 1 (from pipe) +2 (from lock3) = 3 to lock5.\n            lock5: 1+3=4.\n        Second 5:\n            lock1: 1 -> overflow 1 to lock2.\n            lock2: overflow 1 to lock3.\n            lock3: overflow 1 (from pipe) +1 (from lock2) = 2 to lock4.\n            lock4: overflow 1 (from pipe) +2 (from lock3) = 3 to lock5.\n            lock5: 4+3=7 -> but volume=5, so filled at second5.\n\n        So lock5 gets 1 at second3, 3 at second4, and 3 at second5 -> total 7, which is more than 5.\n\n        Therefore, it is filled at second5.\n\n        So it does work with 3 pipes.\n\n    But then why does the example say the answer for the fifth query is 4? \n\n    There is a mistake in the example note. \n\n    The example input and output is: \n        Input: \n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5 \n            6\n            1\n            2 \n            3 \n            4 \n            5 \n            6 \n        Output: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            4\n            3\n\n    But our simulation shows that for t_j=5, 3 pipes work.\n\n    Therefore, the example output might be in error.\n\n    Or there is a condition that we cannot open a pipe at a lock that is not completely filled? \n\n    The problem does not say that. The pipe is opened at time0 and water flows in from time0.\n\n    So the intended solution is: k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / t_j)\n\n    Therefore, for the TODO block, we can do:\n\n        ans = 0\n        # We need to compute max_i ceil(s_i / q)\n        # But we have the total sum s, and we know that the maximum is ceil(s_n / q) because the sequence s_i is increasing and so is ceil(s_i / q) \n        # However, wait: is ceil(s_i / q) non-decreasing in i? \n        #   s_i is increasing, and ceil(s_i / q) is non-decreasing.\n        #   Therefore, the maximum is ceil(s_n / q).\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    But then for the fifth query in the example: \n        s = 15, q=5 -> (15+5-1)//5 = 19//5 = 3 (since 19//5=3 in integer division).\n\n    and for the sixth query: q=6 -> (15+6-1)//6 = 20//6 = 3 (since 20//6=3 in integer division in Python? 20//6=3.33 -> integer division floors, but we want ceil).\n\n    In Python, (s+q-1)//q is floor((s+q-1)/q) = ceil(s/q) for integer s and q.\n\n    For s=15, q=6: ceil(15/6)=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n    So the sixth query gives 3.\n\n    But the example output for the sixth query is 3.\n\n    for the fifth query, we get 3, but the example output is 4.\n\n    However, we saw that 3 pipes work for the fifth query.\n\n    Therefore, the example output for the fifth query might be a mistake.\n\n    Or the problem has additional constraints.\n\n    Let me read the sample input from the note: \n        \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n    The first lock has volume=1. If we open all pipes (5 pipes), then the first lock gets 5 liters in 1 second. So it should be filled in 1 second. \n\n    unless the first lock has volume=1, and we open one pipe at lock1: then it takes 1 second.\n    if we open a pipe elsewhere, it doesn't help the first lock.\n\n    So to fill the first lock, we must have at least one pipe in the first lock, and then it takes 1 second.\n\n    but the mayor says \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> this is not true.\n\n    unless the volumes are not 1 for the first lock? \n\n    The input is: \n        5\n        1 2 3 4 5 \n\n    so the first lock has volume=1.\n\n    Therefore, the example note has a mistake.\n\n    So the intended solution is: \n        if q < t_min: \n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    where s is the total sum.\n\n    Therefore, for the TODO block in program2.py, we can do:\n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    But note: s might be very large, and q up to 1e9, so this is safe.\n\n    Let me test with the provided example in the problem note.\n\n    Example 1: \n        t_min = max_i ceil(s_i / i) \n        locks: [1,2,3,4,5] -> s_i = [1, 1+2=3, 6, 10, 15]\n        i=1: ceil(1/1)=1\n        i=2: ceil(3/2)=2\n        i=3: ceil(6/3)=2\n        i=4: ceil(10/4)=3\n        i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n        t_min = 3.\n\n        Query: 1,2,3 -> -1.\n        Query: 4: \n            q=4: \n                ans = (15+4-1)//4 = 18//4 = 4.5 -> in integer division: 4 (because 18//4=4 in Python? 18//4=4.5 -> no, in integer division it is 4).\n                ceil(15/4)=4.\n        Query: 5: 3\n        Query: 6: 3\n\n        So output: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            4\n            3\n            3\n\n        But the example output is:\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            4\n            3\n\n        for query 4: we output 4, but the example output is -1.\n\n        Why? \n        The example note says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\", so query 4 is -1.\n\n        But our t_min=3, and 4>=3, so we don't output -1.\n\n        What is the minimal time required? \n            The minimal time is t_min=3 seconds.\n        Therefore, query 4 (4 seconds) is possible.\n\n        then why does the example output -1 for query 4?\n\n        The example note: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n        This is not true. \n\n        So there is a mistake in the example note.\n\n        Therefore, we output for the TODO block in program2.py:\n\n            ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    But note: the variable for the total sum is `s`.\n\n    However, in the first loop, we did:\n\n        s = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n\n    So after the loop, `s` is the total sum.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    But note: the answer might be a floating point number? but we use integer division.\n\n    And the problem says the answer is an integer.\n\n    So we output that.\n\n    However, the example note is confusing, but the logic and simulation support this.\n\n    Let me double-check with the example of the sixth query: \n        q=6, s=15, ans = (15+6-1)//6 = 20//6 = 3 (in Python, 20//6 = 3).\n\n    and the example output is 3.\n\n    Therefore, we will use this.\n\n    But the fifth query: q=5, ans = (15+5-1)//5 = 19//5 = 3.\n\n    and the example output for the fifth query is 4, but we believe 3 is sufficient.\n\n    Given the above, I think the example output for the fifth query is in error.\n\n    So the completion for program2.py is: \n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n    in the else branch.\n\n    But note: the existing code has `q` as the variable for the query, and `s` as the total sum.\n\n    Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n    with the same indentation as the else branch.\n\n    However, the else branch is at 4 spaces, and then we need 8 spaces for the body.\n\n    In the code:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    so we need to output a line with 8 spaces and the code.\n\n    So: \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n    But note: in Python, // is integer division, and (s+q-1)//q is the ceiling of s/q for integers.\n\n    This matches ceil(s/q).\n\n    Therefore, we output for program2.py: \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n    But wait, what if the maximum over i is not ceil(s_n/q)? \n        We have: k_min = max_i ceil(s_i / q) = ceil(s_n / q) because s_i is increasing and so is ceil(s_i/q) (since s_i increases and q is fixed).\n\n    So it is safe.\n\n    However, note that s_i might be not strictly increasing? but it is because volumes are positive.\n\n    Therefore, the completions are:\n\n        program1: \"                    continue\"\n        program2: \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n    But for program1, we output the string for the TODO block, which is \"                    continue\", and for program2, the string for the TODO block is \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\".\n\n    However, for program1, we have to output the entire missing code for program1.py? But the TODO block is only one line.\n\n    And for program2, similarly.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the lines that are missing.\n\n    Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"                    continue\",\n            \"program2\": \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n        }\n\n    But wait, in program1, the TODO block is:\n\n        if a == s:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    and we replace the TODO comment with `continue`, so the missing code is the line `continue` at the same indentation.\n\n    In the provided code for program1, the if block is indented by 16 spaces, and the TODO comment is at 20 spaces? \n\n    But in the code we are given for program1, the if block is at 12 spaces? \n\n    Let me count the spaces in the provided program1.py:\n\n        for y in range(n):\n            s = input()\n            for l in range(2):\n                for m in range(97,109):\n                    a = list(s)\n                    a[l] = chr(m)\n                    a = ''.join(a)\n                    if a == s:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    ans1+=d1[a]\n            d1[s]+=1\n\n    The for m loop is at 12 spaces.\n    The if a==s is at 16 spaces.\n    The TODO is at 20 spaces.\n\n    So the continue should be at 20 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program1 is a line with 20 spaces and \"continue\".\n\n    So: \"                    continue\" (20 spaces)\n\n    How many spaces? \n        for y: 4\n        for l: 8\n        for m: 12\n        if: 16\n        then: 20\n\n    So 20 spaces.\n\n    In the string, we output 20 spaces and then \"continue\".\n\n    For program2, the else branch is at 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n    In the code:\n\n        for q in map(int, queries):\n            if q < t_min:\n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The else is at 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\n    So the code in the else branch should be at 8 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\" (8 spaces)\n\n    But"
