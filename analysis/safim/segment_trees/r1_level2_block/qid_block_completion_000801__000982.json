Then we avoid the next conditions? But what if we break in the TODO block? Then we break the entire loop? Then we skip the s2 < s1 condition? That is acceptable. Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n   But note: the code is in the same indentation level as the other conditions? We write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   However, the problem: the existing code for the condition s1==s2 does not have a break? And we are not changing that. But we are only to fill the TODO. Let me test with the third test case: [1,2] -> \n        t=1, n=2, l=[1,2]\n        s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=1 -> true.\n        s1==s2 -> true: then we record l2.append(0 + (2-1-1)=0) -> then we do s1+=l[0]=1, p1=1. Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the TODO: s1 < s2? no, 1>=0 -> skip. Then we check: s2 < s1? yes -> then we do: s2+=l[1]=2, p2=0. Then we break the loop? No, we go to the next iteration: \n            p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true. s1=1, s2=2 -> then we do the TODO: s1 < s2 -> true. Then we check: p1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> then we break the loop. Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? -> correct. Another test: [1,2,1] as above -> \n        Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1. Then s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the condition for s2 < s1: s2 becomes 1, p2=1 (from 2 to 1? because we did p2-=1 from 2 to 1? but wait: initially p2=2, then we do p2-=1 -> becomes 1? Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true. Then s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total = 1 (from p1) + (n-1-p2)= (1) + (2-1)=1+1=2? -> then we add l[1]=2 to s1 -> s1=3, p1=2. Then we break the loop? Then we print 2? -> correct. But wait: after we record 2, we then update p1 to 2. Then we break the loop? Then we print the last recorded which is 2? correct.",

Then we get p2=-1. Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1<=-1 -> which is false if p1>=0? Then we break the loop? But wait: if p1=0, then condition: 0-1=-1<=-1 -> true? Then we enter the loop?

The example: \n                \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that is one move: index0: subtract -> b0=-1. \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> that is three moves: one for index2, one for index3, one for index4? -> total 4 moves.

The example says: \"The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5]\" -> so b2=3? How did b2 become 3? They said they added a3? a3 is the third element? which is a[2] (0-indexed). So they did an operation on index2? then b2 becomes 0+ a[2] = 1? not 3. They must have done three operations on index2: then b2=0+1+1+1=3. But then the moves for index2 is 3, not 1. So the example: \n                index0: 1 move (subtract)\n                index2: 3 moves (add three times) -> cost=3\n                index3: 1 move (add) -> cost=1\n                index4: 1 move (add) -> cost=1\n            -> total 6 moves?

So the answer is 1.\n\n        Example2: [1,1,1] \n            i=0: right: a[1:]=[1,1]\n                    t=0, d1 = (0//1)+1 = 1 -> cost=1, t=1. d2 = (1//1)+1 = 1+1=2 -> cost=1+2=3, t=2.\n                left: [] -> cost=3.\n            i=1:\n                right: a[2:]=[1]\n                    t=0, d = (0//1)+1=1 -> cost=1, t=1.\n                left: a[:1]=[1] -> \n                    for k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, cost=1+1=2. i=2: right: []\n                left: a[:2]=[1,1] -> reversed: [1,1]\n                    for the first: k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, t=1.\n                    for the second: k=1: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2, cost=1+2=3. then c = min(3,2,3)=2. But the moves: \n                One solution: \n                    b0 = -1 (1 move)\n                    b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n                    b2 = 1 (1 move)\n                total=2. So it works. Therefore, for the right part, we can do:\n\n            t = 0   # the initial value for b[i] is 0.\n            for k in a[i+1:]: # d = smallest integer such that d * k > t\n                # d = floor(t / k) + 1   -> this works for nonnegative t? # But what if t is negative? # Example: t = -5, k=2: floor(-5/2) = -3 (in Python), then d = -3+1 = -2.\n                # Then we would have p += -2 -> which is negative, and then we set t = -4.\n                # But the moves for that element is |d|=2, not -2. So we should use p += abs(d), but the code does not. However, in the left part, they use p += d and d is positive.",

But the example says: subtract a1 from b1 -> that is index0? then b0=-1. Then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5? -> that is indices2,3,4? so b2=1, b3=1, b4=1? but that is not increasing? Correction: the example says: \n                \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that is index0? then b0=-1. \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> then b2=0 (unchanged) -> then b3=1, b4=1, b5=1? -> not increasing. Actually, the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so:\n                b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0=1 -> 0-1=-1)\n                b1 = 0 (zero moves? but we start at 0) -> then we require b0 < b1: -1<0 -> ok.\n                b2 = 3: we must have done 3 moves: add a2=1 three times? cost=3.\n                b3 = 4: add a3=1 four times? cost=4? but total cost=1+3+4+5=13? But the example says 4 moves. How? b0: we subtract once: cost=1 -> b0=-1. b1: we do nothing: cost=0 -> b1=0. b2: we add three times: cost=3 -> b2=3.\n                b3: we add once: cost=1 -> b3=1? -> but that is 3+1=4? and then b3=1? -> but then we have 0, then 3, then 1? -> not increasing.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The code provided for program1.py is intended to solve the problem of two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the two ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The current code has a while loop that runs while (p1-1<=p2) [Note: This condition might be a typo? It should probably be p1<=p2?] and then has three conditions:\n  1. If s1 (Alice's current sum) equals s2 (Bob's current sum), then we record the total candies eaten (p1 from the left and (n-1-p2) from the right) in l2, then add the next left candy to Alice and move p1.\n  2. If s1 < s2, we are supposed to add a candy to Alice (from the left) to increase her sum? But note: the condition after that is for s2 < s1, which adds a candy to Bob from the right.\n\n However, the note in the code says: \"if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n Looking at the problem, we have two pointers: p1 for the next candy Alice can eat (from the left) and p2 for the next candy Bob can eat (from the right). We have two sums: s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob.\n\n The idea is:\n   We want to record every time the two sums are equal. Then we try to add candies to the side that has a smaller current sum.\n\n But note: the current code does:\n   if s1 == s2: ... then we add to Alice (and then we break the equality? because we then check the next condition? Actually, after adding to Alice, we then check the next condition? But note: the condition for s1==s2 is followed by two more if conditions (which are not elif). So we might do multiple steps in one iteration? That might be problematic.\n\n Actually, the code structure is:\n\n   while condition:\n        if s1 == s2: ... (then we add a candy to Alice and move p1)\n        if s1 < s2: ... (we should add a candy to Alice? but wait, we just did that in the first condition? Actually, no: because if we entered the first condition, we updated s1 and p1, so now s1 might be greater than s2? Then we would then also check the next condition? But note: the problem says we can't skip candies, so we are moving from the two ends inward.\n\n However, the problem is that after the first condition, we have two independent ifs. This might lead to multiple operations in one iteration? But note: the condition for s1==s2 might be followed by s1 then being greater than s2? Then we would also do the s2 < s1 condition? Actually, the next condition is \"if s1 < s2\", and then \"if s2 < s1\" (which is the same as s1>s2). So we are covering all cases.\n\n But the problem: the TODO is for the case when s1 < s2. What should we do? We should add a candy from the left to Alice? Because she has less and we want to increase her sum? But note: we are already in a state where s1 < s2. So we do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n However, we must be cautious: we are in a loop and we are moving the pointers. Also, we must avoid going out of bounds.\n\n But note: the condition of the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). Let me check: initially p1=0, p2=n-1. Then condition: 0-1 = -1 <= n-1 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we do the operations. Then we break when p1-1>p2? Actually, when p1-1>p2, meaning p1>p2+1? That might be too late? Because we are using p1 and p2 as indices. We should break when p1>p2? Because then we have no more candies to eat.\n\n Alternatively, the condition might be intended to be p1<=p2? But the code says (p1-1<=p2). Let me see: when p1=0, then condition: -1<=p2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we update p1 to 1: then condition becomes 0<=p2 -> true until p1 becomes p2+1? Then condition: p1-1 = p2 <= p2 -> true? Then we do one more step? Then p1 becomes p2+2? Then condition: p2+1<=p2 -> false.\n\n Actually, the condition (p1-1<=p2) is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. So we are allowing p1 to go one beyond p2? But note: we are adding candies one by one. We must not access out of bounds.\n\n However, in the code, when we do s1+=l[p1] and then p1+=1, we must have p1 in the range [0, n-1] at the time of access? But we are checking the condition at the beginning of the loop. So we must break when p1>p2? Actually, we have two pointers: we can let p1 go from 0 to n and p2 from n-1 to -1? But we must avoid accessing l[p1] when p1>=n? Similarly for p2.\n\n But note: the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). When p1 becomes n, then p1-1 = n-1, and if p2 is at least n-1? Actually, p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. So when p1 becomes n, then condition: n-1<=p2 -> but p2 is at most n-1? So if p2 is still n-1, then condition holds? Then we enter the loop? Then we try to access l[p1] which is l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n Therefore, we must adjust the condition. Alternatively, we can break inside the loop when we are about to access an invalid index.\n\n However, the problem states: the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test case.\n\n But the intended logic is:\n\n   We have two pointers and two sums. We start with s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=n-1.\n   We want to consider:\n        if s1 == s2: we record the total candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) and then we try to add a candy to Alice? But note: we are going to continue? Because we might get a better result? Actually, we record the current total and then we add a candy to Alice? Then we break the equality? But the problem says: we want the maximum total candies. So we record every time we have an equality? Then we take the last recorded one? Actually, the code prints l2[-1]. But note: we are recording every time we have an equality? But we are also moving the pointers. The maximum total candies might occur at the last equality we get? But note: as we move inward, the total candies eaten increases? Actually, no: because we are adding candies one by one, the total number of candies eaten is p1 + (n-1-p2). And p1 is increasing and p2 is decreasing, so the total is increasing? But when we add a candy to one side, the total increases by one. However, we might have multiple equalities? But the problem says: we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the last (largest) total when we have an equality.\n\n However, the problem: we are moving the pointers and we might have an equality at different points. The total candies eaten at an equality is the number of candies eaten so far. And we want the maximum.\n\n But note: the code records every time we have an equality. Then at the end, we print the last one. But what if we have multiple equalities? The last one would be the one with the largest total? Because we are moving from the ends inward? Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing as we add more candies. So the last equality we get would be the one with the most candies? But wait: we might have an equality at the beginning and then we add more and then we break the equality and then we get another equality? Actually, the total candies is increasing, so the last equality we get is the one with the most candies.\n\n However, the problem: we are not guaranteed that we get an equality at the end? We might break the equality and then never get it again? But the problem says: we want the maximum total candies. So we must record every time we have an equality? Then we take the maximum? But the code only records in the list l2 and then prints the last one. Why the last one? Because the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies is increasing: we start with 0 and then we add one candy at a time. So the last time we have an equality is the one with the most candies? But note: we might have an equality at 2 candies, then we add more and break the equality, then we add more and then we get an equality at 6 candies? Then the last one (6) is the maximum. So the code is correct to take the last one? But what if we never get an equality? Then l2 is empty? Then we get an error.\n\n The problem says: if they cannot be fair, the answer is 0? But note: we start with s1=0 and s2=0 -> that's an equality. So we record 0 candies? Then we add one to Alice? Then we break the equality. Then we continue. But the problem says: they can choose to eat zero candies? Actually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning same total weight. They can choose to eat zero? Then the total candies eaten is 0. So we must record 0? But the problem note: for the third test case, the answer is 0.\n\n How does the current code handle the third test case? \n   The third test case: [1,1] -> but wait, the note says: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\". But they can both eat one candy? Then they both have weight 1? Then the total candies eaten is 2? But the note says 0? \n\n Actually, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". But the example test cases:\n\n   Example 1: [1,1] -> answer 2? But wait, the first test case in the note: \n        \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. ... The answer is 2\"\n\n   Then the third test case: \n        \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\n   So the third test case must be different. The sample input for the third test case is not provided in the note? But the problem says: the input is the weights. The third test case must be such that the only way to have the same weight is to have zero? For example: [1,2]. \n        Alice can eat [1] -> weight=1, Bob can eat [2] -> weight=2 -> not equal.\n        Alice can eat [1,2] -> weight=3, Bob eats nothing -> 0 -> not equal.\n        Bob can eat [1,2] -> weight=3, Alice nothing -> 0 -> not equal.\n        Alice eats nothing and Bob eats nothing -> 0=0 -> but that's zero? So they can eat zero? But the problem says: \"they can eat the same non-zero weight\" -> meaning they want non-zero? Actually, the problem does not say non-zero? It says \"same total weight\". So zero is allowed? But the note says: \"the answer is 0\" for the third test case? \n\n   However, the problem statement: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" -> if they eat zero candies, then they eat zero candies. But the problem says \"the most number\". So if they can eat more than zero, we want that. But in the third test case, they cannot eat any candy without breaking the fairness? Then the maximum total candies is zero? \n\n   But wait: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> meaning she must eat contiguous from the left? Similarly Bob. So they cannot skip? But they can choose to eat zero? \n\n   Therefore, the answer for the third test case is 0? \n\n   How does the code handle it? \n        We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> we record: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0? Then we add the first candy to Alice: s1 becomes 1, p1 becomes 1. Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the condition: s1>s2 -> so we add the last candy to Bob: s2 becomes 2, p2 becomes n-2 (which is -1? if n=2, then p2 becomes 0? Actually, n=2: p2 starts at 1, then we do p2-=1 -> 0. Then we break the loop? Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? \n\n   But wait: we recorded 0 at the beginning. Then we did two moves and then the loop condition: \n        Initially: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1 = -1 <= 1 -> true.\n        Then we record 0, then we update: p1=1, then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the condition for s1>s2? Actually, the code has:\n            if s1 < s2: ... (we skip because 1>=0)\n            then if s2 < s1: ... (0<1 -> true) -> then we add l[1] (which is 2) to s2 and p2 becomes 0.\n        Then we break the loop? No, we go to the next iteration: \n            p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n            Now s1=1, s2=2 -> then we check: s1==s2? no. Then if s1 < s2: true -> then we should do: ... but the TODO is there.\n\n   So we must complete the TODO: for the condition s1 < s2, we should add a candy from the left? But wait: we have already taken the left candy at index0? Now p1 is 1, which is the next left candy? But we have two candies: [1,2]. We have already taken the left candy (1) for Alice and the right candy (2) for Bob? Then we have no more candies? Actually, we have the candy at index1 (which is the second candy) and the candy at index0 (which is the first candy) but they are the same? \n\n   Actually, the array is [1,2]. We have:\n        Initially: p1=0, p2=1 -> we record 0 (because s1=0, s2=0) -> then we add l[0]=1 to s1 -> s1=1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the condition for s2 < s1: we add l[1]=2 to s2 -> s2=2, p2=0.\n        Then we enter the loop again: p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n        Now s1=1, s2=2 -> then we check: s1==s2? no. Then we check s1 < s2: true -> then we should add a candy from the left? But the left pointer p1=1 is at the second candy? We can add it? Then we do:\n            s1 += l[1] -> s1=1+2=3, p1=2.\n        Then we break the loop? Then we check: condition for the next iteration: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 2-1=1<=0? false -> break.\n        Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? \n\n   But we never recorded an equality after the initial zero? So the answer printed is 0? which is correct.\n\n   However, what if we have an equality in the middle? For example: [1,2,1] -> \n        n=3, l=[1,2,1]\n        Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total=0 (p1=0, p2=2 -> total=0+ (3-1-2)=0? Actually, total = p1 (0) + (n-1-p2) = 0 + (2-2)=0 -> record 0.\n        Then we add l[0]=1 to s1 -> s1=1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we add to Bob: s2+=l[2]=1 -> s2=1, p2=1.\n        Then we enter the loop: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n        Now s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total = p1 (1) + (n-1-p2)=1 + (2-1)=1+1=2? Then we add l[1]=2 to s1 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n        Then we break the loop? Then we print the last recorded which is 2? But the answer should be 2? because they eat two candies: Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> total 2.\n\n   But wait: the problem says: they can eat more? Alice can eat [1,2] and Bob can eat [1]? Then Alice has 3, Bob has 1 -> not equal. Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> 1=1 -> total 2. Or Alice eats nothing and Bob eats nothing -> 0=0 -> total 0. So the maximum is 2.\n\n   So the code for program1.py: we need to complete the TODO for the condition s1 < s2: we should add the next left candy to Alice? \n\n   Therefore, we do:\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But note: we must be cautious of the index: we are about to use p1. We are in the loop condition (p1-1<=p2) which means p1<=p2+1. But when p1 is already at n? Then we cannot add? Actually, the condition of the loop ensures that we are still in bounds? But note: when p1 is n, then we cannot access l[p1] because the list l has indices from 0 to n-1. So we must break the loop when p1>p2? But the condition (p1-1<=p2) is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. So when p1==p2+1, we are still in the loop? Then we might try to access l[p1] when p1==n? \n\n   How to avoid? We can check inside the condition? But the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:   # we have at least one candy on the left to add?\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break   # but the problem: we are in the loop condition? Actually, if p1>p2, then we break? But the condition of the loop is p1-1<=p2 -> if p1>p2+1, we break. So if p1==p2+1, we are still in the loop? But then we try to add a candy at p1 which is beyond the array? \n\n   Alternatively, we can change the condition of the loop to p1<=p2? But the current condition is (p1-1<=p2). We can change it to p1<=p2? Then we avoid accessing beyond the array? But note: when we have an equality and we add a candy to Alice, we do p1++ and then we break the loop? But we might have an equality at the last candy? Then we add one more and then p1 becomes p2+1? Then we break? \n\n   However, the problem: we are already in the loop and we are about to access l[p1] when p1>p2? We must avoid that.\n\n   Since the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, we can do:\n\n        while p1 <= p2:   # this is the standard two pointers condition.\n\n   But the original code has a different condition. Why? \n\n   Let me see: the original condition: (p1-1<=p2) -> that is the same as p1<=p2+1. So we are allowing p1 to be p2+1? Then we do the loop? Then we might try to access l[p1] when p1==p2+1? which is out of bounds? \n\n   Therefore, we should change the condition? But the problem says: we are not allowed to change the given code? Only fill the TODO? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that in the condition s1 < s2, we can only add a candy from the left if p1<=p2? But the condition of the loop is p1-1<=p2, which means p1<=p2+1. So if p1==p2+1, then we cannot add from the left? Similarly, in the condition s2 < s1, we can only add from the right if p1<=p2? But if p1==p2+1, then we are done? \n\n   Therefore, we should break the loop when we cannot add? Or we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:   # we have at least one candy on the left?\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break   # no more candies? then break.\n\n   Similarly, for the condition s2 < s1, we have:\n\n        if s2 < s1: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s2 += l[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But wait, the existing code for s2 < s1 does not have a check? It does:\n        s2 += l[p2]; p2 -=1\n\n   without checking if p2 is valid? But the condition of the loop: p1-1<=p2 -> so p2>=p1-1. But if p2 is negative? Then we cannot access? Actually, p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. We break when p1>p2? But the condition of the loop is p1-1<=p2, which is equivalent to p2>=p1-1. So if p1=0, then p2>=-1? Then we might have p2=-1? Then we try to access l[-1]? which is the last element? That is not what we want.\n\n   Therefore, we must change the condition of the loop? But the problem says: we can only fill the TODO? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the problem states: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and we are only moving the pointers inward. So we will not get an infinite loop? But we might get an index error.\n\n   Since we are only allowed to fill the TODO, we must assume that the condition of the loop is set and we must avoid accessing invalid indices. So in the TODO for s1 < s2, we should check if p1 is within the bounds? Actually, the condition of the loop ensures that p1-1<=p2, which means p1<=p2+1. But we are going to use p1 as an index? Then we must have p1 < n? But we don't know n? We know that p1 is at most p2+1, and p2 is at least 0? But if p2 is negative? Then p1<=0? Then we are safe? \n\n   Actually, we have two pointers: p1 and p2. The condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1 is at most p2+1. But when p2 is negative, then p1<=0? Then we are safe? But we are going to do s1 += l[p1] when p1=0? But if p2 is negative, then we have already passed the last candy on the right? Then we are only adding from the left? But we should break? \n\n   Therefore, to be safe, we should break the loop when we cannot add any more candies? But we are not allowed to change the loop condition? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:   # we can add from the left?\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break   # break the loop\n\n   But note: the problem says we can only fill the TODO? We cannot change the existing code? The TODO is only for the block of s1 < s2. So we can write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But wait: the existing code for s2 < s1 does not have a break? It does:\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   without checking? So we must also add a check there? But we are not allowed to change that? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" for the TODO. So we only write the code for the TODO.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and we are to output in json: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n   So for program1, we write the missing code for the TODO.\n\n   But the existing code for s2 < s1 might cause an index error? For example, if we are in the state: s1 < s2 and we break because p1>p2? Then we break the loop? Then we don't do the s2 < s1 condition? Actually, the code structure:\n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):\n            if s1 == s2: ... \n            if s1 < s2: ... (our TODO)\n            if s2 < s1: ... \n\n        So if we break in the TODO block (by using a break statement), then we break the entire loop? Then we avoid the next conditions? \n\n   But what if we don't break? Then we do the next conditions? So we must break the entire loop? Or we can just break out of the current iteration? Actually, we want to break the entire loop? Because if we cannot add a candy to Alice when s1 < s2, then we cannot make progress? Similarly, we might get stuck? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                # we break the loop? but we cannot break the entire loop from inside an if? \n                # We can set p1 to a value that will break the loop condition? \n                # Or we can break? \n                break\n\n   But note: the break will break the while loop.\n\n   However, the problem: if we break in the middle of the loop, then we skip the rest of the conditions? But that's acceptable because we are breaking the entire loop.\n\n   But what if we break in the TODO block? Then we don't check the other conditions? That's acceptable because we are done.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But wait: the condition of the loop is p1-1<=p2. After we break, we break the loop? Then we print l2[-1]. \n\n   However, what if we don't break? Then we do the next condition? For example, after we add to Alice, we then check if s2 < s1? That is acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are in the same iteration? We do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: ... (we do the above)\n        then we do the next if: if s2 < s1: ... (if now s1 becomes greater than s2, we then add to Bob? in the same iteration? \n\n   That is: we might do two moves in one iteration? But that is not intended? The problem: we are moving one candy at a time? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify the order? But the two moves in one iteration might cause the pointers to cross? \n\n   Therefore, we should not break the entire loop? We should only avoid the invalid index? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                # we cannot add, so we break the condition? but we cannot break the loop? \n                # Then we set s1 to a value that will break the condition? \n                # Or we can break the loop? \n                # But the problem: we are stuck? \n                # Actually, we break the loop because we cannot make progress? \n                break\n\n   But the problem: if we break the loop, we avoid the next conditions? That is acceptable.\n\n   However, the existing code for s2 < s1 does not have a break? So we must be consistent? \n\n   But note: the condition for s2 < s1: we do:\n\n        if s2 < s1: \n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n   without checking? We can get an index error? \n\n   Therefore, we must also add a check in the s2 < s1 condition? But we are not allowed to change that? \n\n   The problem says: we are only to fill the TODO? So we only do the TODO.\n\n   And the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and the individual n is at most 200000, so we might get an index error? \n\n   But the condition of the loop: p1-1<=p2. When we are about to do the s2 < s1 condition, we have p1-1<=p2. Then we do p2-=1 -> then p2 becomes p2-1. Then the next iteration: we check p1-1<=p2? which is p1-1<=p2-1? \n\n   But we are accessing l[p2] in the condition: we must have p2>=0? \n\n   How do we ensure that? The condition p1-1<=p2 does not guarantee p2>=0? \n\n   For example: if p2=0, then we do s2 += l[0] and then p2 becomes -1. Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1<=-1? which might be true? Then we enter the loop? Then we try to access l[p2] in the condition for s2 < s1? But p2=-1 -> l[-1] is the last element? which is not what we want? \n\n   Therefore, the existing code has a flaw? \n\n   But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO? \n\n   Since the problem states that the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and the individual n is at most 200000, we might not get an index error in practice? But we are not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can rely on the condition of the loop to avoid accessing out of bounds? \n\n   Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p2>=p1-1. But when we use p2 as an index, we require p2>=0 and p2<n. Since p2 starts at n-1 and decreases, we only go below 0 if we do p2-=1 when p2=0? Then we get p2=-1. Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1<=-1 -> which is false if p1>=0? Then we break the loop? \n\n   But wait: if p1=0, then condition: 0-1=-1<=-1 -> true? Then we enter the loop? Then we try to access l[p1] in the condition for s1==s2? or in the condition for s1<s2? \n\n   So we must avoid that.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since we are only allowed to fill the TODO, we will do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:   # we can add from the left?\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   This will break the loop when we cannot add from the left? Then we avoid the next conditions? \n\n   But what if we break in the TODO block? Then we break the entire loop? Then we skip the s2 < s1 condition? That is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n   But note: the code is in the same indentation level as the other conditions? \n\n   We write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   However, the problem: the existing code for the condition s1==s2 does not have a break? And we are not changing that. \n\n   But we are only to fill the TODO.\n\n   Let me test with the third test case: [1,2] -> \n        t=1, n=2, l=[1,2]\n        s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=1 -> true.\n        s1==s2 -> true: then we record l2.append(0 + (2-1-1)=0) -> then we do s1+=l[0]=1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the TODO: s1 < s2? no, 1>=0 -> skip.\n        Then we check: s2 < s1? yes -> then we do: s2+=l[1]=2, p2=0.\n        Then we break the loop? No, we go to the next iteration: \n            p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n            s1=1, s2=2 -> then we do the TODO: s1 < s2 -> true.\n            Then we check: p1=1<=p2=0 -> false -> then we break the loop.\n        Then we print l2[-1] which is 0? -> correct.\n\n   Another test: [1,2,1] as above -> \n        Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n        Then s1=1, s2=0 -> then we do the condition for s2 < s1: s2 becomes 1, p2=1 (from 2 to 1? because we did p2-=1 from 2 to 1? but wait: initially p2=2, then we do p2-=1 -> becomes 1? \n        Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n        Then s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total = 1 (from p1) + (n-1-p2)= (1) + (2-1)=1+1=2? -> then we add l[1]=2 to s1 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n        Then we break the loop? Then we print 2? -> correct.\n\n   But wait: after we record 2, we then update p1 to 2. Then we break the loop? Then we print the last recorded which is 2? correct.\n\n   Therefore, we complete program1.py as above.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n The problem: We are given an array a of n positive integers. We start with b=[0,0,...,0]. In one move, we can choose an index i and either add a[i] or subtract a[i] to b[i]. We want to make b strictly increasing (b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1]) with the minimum number of moves.\n\n The code provided:\n\n    import math\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split(' '))) # numbers w/ ws\n\n    c = None\n    d = 0\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        p = 0\n        t = 0\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n        if c == None or p < c:\n            c = p\n\n    print(c)\n\n The code iterates for each index i. For each i, it initializes p=0. Then it does two loops: \n   one for the elements after i (a[i+1:]) and one for the elements before i (a[:i] in reverse).\n\n The second loop (for the elements before i) is provided: \n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n What is this doing? \n   We are going backwards from i-1 down to 0. \n   We have a variable t that represents the current value that we require for the next element? \n   Actually, we are trying to assign values to b[0..i-1] such that they are strictly increasing and then we have b[i]=0? (but note: we are free to choose the moves arbitrarily) \n\n   The idea: \n        We want to assign values to b[0..i] such that b[i] is fixed to 0? But note: we are iterating i and we are considering the entire array? \n\n   Actually, the problem: we are allowed to do moves independently on each index. We are trying to minimize the total moves.\n\n   The known solution: \n        We can use dynamic programming. But the constraints: n<=5000.\n\n   Alternatively, we can fix the sign of the moves? \n\n   However, the provided code: \n        For the left part (from 0 to i-1), we are going backwards (from i-1 down to 0). \n        We have t=0 initially? Then for each k (which is a[j] for j from i-1 down to 0), we compute:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n        What is d? It seems the number of moves for this element? \n\n        Why (t+1)/k? \n        We require that the current element (b[j]) is less than the next element (b[j+1])? \n        But we are going backwards: so we are setting b[j] such that it is less than b[j+1]? \n\n        Actually, we are setting the value for b[j]? We require b[j] < b[j+1]. \n        We know the value we set for b[j] must be a multiple of a[j] (because we can only add or subtract multiples of a[j]? Actually, we can do multiple moves: but the net effect is that b[j] = m * a[j] for some integer m (positive or negative). \n\n        But note: we can do multiple moves? The problem: one move: we can add or subtract a[i] once. But we can do multiple moves? The problem says: \"in one move you can choose an integer i, and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So we can do multiple moves on the same index? Then the total effect is any integer multiple of a[i]? \n\n        Therefore, b[j] = c_j * a[j] for some integer c_j (which can be positive or negative). The cost is |c_j|.\n\n        Now, we are going backwards: \n            We start from the element at index i: we set b[i] = 0? Then we move to index i-1: we require b[i-1] < b[i] = 0. \n            Then we choose the largest multiple of a[i-1] that is less than 0? But we want to minimize the moves? \n\n        Actually, we want to minimize the absolute value of c_j? But we also have to satisfy the condition for the entire sequence.\n\n        The known solution: \n            We traverse from right to left. For the last element, we can set it to 0 (cost 0) but then the element before must be negative? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set the last element to any multiple? But we want to minimize the total moves.\n\n        The provided code for the left part (reversed(a[:i])):\n            t = 0   # initially, what is t? \n            for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # k is a[j] for j from i-1 down to 0.\n                d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)   # note: t is the current value that we have for the next element? \n                t = k * d\n                p += d\n\n        What is t? It seems that t is the value we set for b[j]? But we are going backwards: \n            We start with t=0? Then for the first element (which is the element at index i-1), we compute d = ceil((0+1)/k) = ceil(1/k). Since k>=1, ceil(1/k)=1? Then t = k*1 = k. Then p (the total moves) becomes 1.\n\n        Then for the next element (index i-2): \n            d = ceil((k+1)/a[i-2])\n            t = a[i-2] * d\n            p += d\n\n        This seems to be setting b[j] to a value that is at least (t+1) in absolute value? But we require b[j] < b[j+1]. And we are going backwards: so we require b[j] < b[j+1] = current t? \n\n        Actually, we require b[j] < b[j+1]. We are setting b[j] to be k * d? and we set d = ceil((t+1)/k). Then k*d >= t+1? Then b[j] = k*d >= t+1 > t = b[j+1]? That is the opposite of what we want: we want b[j] < b[j+1] = t.\n\n        So we must set b[j] to a negative value? \n\n        The known solution: \n            We want b[j] < b[j+1]. We can set b[j] to a negative multiple? \n\n        How about: we set b[j] = -d * k, and then we require -d*k < b[j+1]. Then we want d to be the smallest integer such that -d*k < b[j+1]? \n            => d > -b[j+1]/k   (since k is positive) \n            => d = floor((-b[j+1])/k) + 1? but then we take the absolute value? \n\n        But the cost is d (the number of moves: we did d subtractions).\n\n        Alternatively, we can set b[j] to a positive multiple? But then it would be positive and we require it to be less than b[j+1] which might be negative? \n\n        Actually, we are free to choose the sign? \n\n        The problem: we want to minimize the total moves. \n\n        The known solution from the note: \n            Example1: a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> we can do: \n                b0 = -1 (cost 1: subtract once)\n                b1 = 0 (cost 0: we leave it at 0? but we can do 0 moves? but then b0=-1, b1=0 -> then we require b2>0? we set b2=1 (cost 1: add once), b3=2 (cost 1), b4=3 (cost 1) -> total cost 4.\n\n            But the example says: subtract a1 from b1 -> that is index0? then b0=-1. Then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5? -> that is indices2,3,4? so b2=1, b3=1, b4=1? but that is not increasing? \n\n            Correction: the example says: \n                \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that is index0? then b0=-1.\n                \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> then b2=0 (unchanged) -> then b3=1, b4=1, b5=1? -> not increasing.\n\n            Actually, the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so:\n                b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0=1 -> 0-1=-1)\n                b1 = 0 (zero moves? but we start at 0) -> then we require b0 < b1: -1<0 -> ok.\n                b2 = 3: we must have done 3 moves: add a2=1 three times? cost=3.\n                b3 = 4: add a3=1 four times? cost=4? but total cost=1+3+4+5=13? \n\n            But the example says 4 moves.\n\n            How? \n                b0: we subtract once: cost=1 -> b0=-1.\n                b1: we do nothing: cost=0 -> b1=0.\n                b2: we add three times: cost=3 -> b2=3.\n                b3: we add once: cost=1 -> b3=1? -> but that is 3+1=4? and then b3=1? -> but then we have 0, then 3, then 1? -> not increasing.\n\n            Correction: the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" -> that is three moves: \n                b3: add a3 once -> 1\n                b4: add a4 once -> 1\n                b5: add a5 once -> 1\n            -> then we have [-1,0,0,1,1,1]? \n\n            But the example says: [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so it must be that they did multiple moves on the same index? \n\n            Actually, the problem: we can do multiple moves on the same index. \n\n            For b2: we add three times: then b2=0+1+1+1=3? cost=3.\n            For b3: we add four times: then b3=0+1*4=4? cost=4? but then total cost=1 (for b0) + 3 (for b2) + 4 (for b3) + 5 (for b4) = 13? \n\n            The example says 4 moves.\n\n            The example: \n                \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that is one move: index0: subtract -> b0=-1.\n                \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> that is three moves: one for index2, one for index3, one for index4? -> total 4 moves.\n\n            And the array: \n                b0 = -1\n                b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> but wait, we did not change b1? then b1=0.\n                b2 = 0 (unchanged) -> but the example says b2=3? \n\n            The example says: \"The final array will be [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5]\" -> so b2=3? \n\n            How did b2 become 3? They said they added a3? a3 is the third element? which is a[2] (0-indexed). So they did an operation on index2? then b2 becomes 0+ a[2] = 1? not 3.\n\n            They must have done three operations on index2: then b2=0+1+1+1=3.\n\n            But then the moves for index2 is 3, not 1.\n\n            So the example: \n                index0: 1 move (subtract)\n                index2: 3 moves (add three times) -> cost=3\n                index3: 1 move (add) -> cost=1\n                index4: 1 move (add) -> cost=1\n            -> total 6 moves? \n\n            But the example says 4 moves.\n\n            I see: the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" -> but a3, a4, a5 are the values at indices2,3,4? and they are all 1. And they did one move on each? then:\n                b0=-1, b1=0, b2=1, b3=1, b4=1 -> not increasing.\n\n            The example final array: [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so they must have done 3 moves on index2, 4 moves on index3, 5 moves on index4? -> total moves=1+3+4+5=13.\n\n            But the example says 4 moves.\n\n            I think there is a misunderstanding: the problem says: \"add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". One move is one operation on one index. So to get b2=3, we need 3 moves on index2.\n\n            The example says: \"the final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves\". \n\n            How? \n                Move1: subtract a0 from b0: b0 = 0-1 = -1.\n                Move2: add a2 to b2: b2=0+1=1 -> but we want 3? \n                Move3: add a2 to b2 again: b2=1+1=2.\n                Move4: add a2 to b2 again: b2=2+1=3.\n                Then we also need to set b3=4 and b4=5? that would be 4 more moves? total 8.\n\n            The example must be using a different method? \n\n            The example says: \"you can subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively\". \n                a_1 is the first element? which is a0=1? so b0 = 0-1 = -1.\n                a_3 is the third element? which is a2=1? so b2 = 0+1 = 1.\n                a_4 is the fourth element? which is a3=1? so b3 = 0+1 = 1.\n                a_5 is the fifth element? which is a4=1? so b4 = 0+1 = 1.\n            -> then we have [-1,0,1,1,1] -> not increasing.\n\n            The example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so they must have done multiple moves on the later indices? \n\n            I see the example has 5 elements: indices0 to 4. \n                They did one move on index0: subtract -> b0=-1.\n                They did three moves on index2: add three times -> b2=3.\n                They did four moves on index3: add four times -> b3=4.\n                They did five moves on index4: add five times -> b4=5.\n            -> total moves=1+3+4+5=13.\n\n            But the example says 4 moves.\n\n            There is a note: \"Example1: you can ... after 4 moves\". \n\n            I see the example in the problem statement: \n                \"Example1: you can subtract a_1 from b_1, and add a_3, a_4, and a_5 to b_3, b_4, and b_5 respectively. The final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n            This is a contradiction. \n\n            After re\u2010examining the problem: the array a is given as a1, a2, ..., an. \n            The moves: \n                subtract a1 from b1: that is index0? -> b0 = -1.\n                add a3 to b3: that is index2? -> b2 = 1.\n                add a4 to b4: that is index3? -> b3 = 1.\n                add a5 to b5: that is index4? -> b4 = 1.\n            -> then b = [-1,0,1,1,1] -> and the example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> which is not matching.\n\n            I think the example meant: \n                b0 = -1 (by subtracting a1 from b1? wait, they said b1: but the array b has indices b1,...,b5? \n\n            The problem says: \"b_i\" for 1<=i<=n. So the array b has indices 1..n? \n\n            Then the final array is: \n                b1 = -1, b2=0, b3=3, b4=4, b5=5.\n\n            How? \n                We start: b1=0, b2=0, b3=0, b4=0, b5=0.\n                Move1: subtract a1 from b1: b1 = 0 - a1 = -1.\n                Move2: add a3 to b3: b3 = 0+a3 = a3 = (what is a3? the third element) -> a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] = [1,?,?,?,?] \n                The example does not specify the array a? \n\n            The example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so b1=-1, b2=0, b3=3, b4=4, b5=5.\n\n            How to achieve b2=0? we do nothing on b2.\n            b3=3: we must do 3 moves on b3: if a3=1, then we add three times: 0+1+1+1=3.\n            b4=4: add four times: 0+1+1+1+1=4.\n            b5=5: add five times: 0+1*5=5.\n\n            Total moves: 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 4 (for b4) + 5 ( for b5) = 13.\n\n            The example says 4 moves.\n\n            There is a known solution for this problem: \n                We let b[0] = -a[0] * x for some x>=1? \n                Then we want b[0] < b[1]. We can set b[1] = a[1] * y for some y>=1 such that a[1]*y > -a[0]*x.\n\n            But the moves for b[0] is x, for b[1] is y.\n\n            The total moves is x+y.\n\n            We want to minimize.\n\n            This is complex.\n\n        After reading a known solution: \n            We can use a greedy method from right to left. \n            We want b[n-1] to be as small as possible (to make it easy for the left) but we also want to minimize the moves.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming: \n                dp[i][j] = minimum moves for the prefix ending at i if b[i] = j. \n            But j can be very large.\n\n        Another known solution: \n            We can use a greedy method: \n                Let b[0] = -a[0] * k for the smallest k such that the sequence can be built? \n\n            Instead, we can traverse from right to left, and for each i from n-2 down to 0, we set b[i] to the largest value that is less than b[i+1] and is a multiple of a[i] (in absolute value) but we want to minimize the moves.\n\n            Specifically, we want b[i] < b[i+1]. \n            We can set b[i] = -a[i] * k for the smallest k such that -a[i]*k < b[i+1]. \n            Then the moves for index i is k.\n\n            But then the total moves is the sum of k over i.\n\n            However, we might also set b[i] to a positive multiple? whichever gives fewer moves.\n\n            The moves if we set b[i] = a[i]*k is k, and we require a[i]*k < b[i+1]. \n            The moves if we set b[i] = -a[i]*k is k, and we require -a[i]*k < b[i+1] (which is always true if b[i+1] is not constrained? but we also have to consider the next left element?).\n\n            We want the minimum moves for the entire sequence.\n\n        The provided code: \n            for i in range(len(a)):\n                p = 0\n                t = 0\n                for k in a[i+1:]:   # the elements after i\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                t = 0\n                for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # the elements before i, in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0)\n                    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n                    t = k*d\n                    p += d\n                if c is None or p < c:\n                    c = p\n\n        In the second loop (for the left part), they are setting the value for the elements before i to be at least t+1? and then they use that to compute d = ceil((t+1)/k) and then set t = k*d, and add d to the moves.\n\n        But we require the sequence to be increasing: so for the left part, we are going from left to right: b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[i-1] < b[i] (which is 0).\n\n        In the left part loop (reversed(a[:i])), we are processing from b[i-1] down to b[0]. \n            We start with t=0 (which is b[i]=0).\n            For the first element (b[i-1]), we require b[i-1] < b[i] = 0.\n            We set d = ceil((0+1)/k) = ceil(1/k) = 1 (since k>=1), then b[i-1] = k * 1 = k? but then k>0, so b[i-1] = k >0, which is not less than 0.\n\n        This is not what we want.\n\n        What we want for b[i-1] is a value less than 0. The largest possible value (to make it easier for the next left element) is -1? but if k>1, then we can set b[i-1] = -k, then the cost is 1 (because we did one subtraction) and then we require b[i-2] < b[i-1] = -k.\n\n        How do we compute the minimal moves for the left part? \n\n        We can do: \n            We require b[i-1] < b[i] = 0.\n            The possible settings for b[i-1] are: ..., -2*k, -k, 0, k, 2*k, ... \n            We want the largest value that is less than 0, which is -k? because -k <0 and it is one move (subtract once).\n\n            Then for the next element (b[i-2]), we require b[i-2] < b[i-1] = -k.\n            We want the largest value that is less than -k? and is a multiple of a[i-2] (say m). \n            The largest value less than -k is floor(-k-1) in the multiples? but we are in integers.\n\n            Specifically, we want the largest multiple of m that is < -k.\n            If we set b[i-2] = -d * m, then we require -d*m < -k  => d*m > k  => d > k/m.\n            The smallest integer d satisfying this is floor(k/m)+1? then the value is -d*m.\n\n            But then the cost for this element is d.\n\n            Then we move to the next.\n\n        In the provided code for the left part, they are doing:\n\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)   # here k is the value a[j] for the current element.\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n        But in our example for the first element (i-1): \n            k = a[i-1]\n            t = 0\n            d = ceil((0+1)/k) = ceil(1/k) = 1.\n            t = k * 1 = k.\n            p += 1.\n\n        This is not matching our requirement (we want to set it to -k, not k).\n\n        So they are setting it to a positive value? \n\n        The only explanation: they are not using the negative multiples. \n\n        But then the condition b[i-1] < b[i] = 0 is not satisfied if we set b[i-1]=k>0.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code for the left part must be for a different approach.\n\n        Alternatively, they might be setting the differences? \n\n        Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #766 (Div. 2), problem C): \n            We can do: \n                Let b[0] be any multiple of a[0]. \n                We want to minimize the total moves = |b[0]|/a[0] + |b[1]|/a[1] + ... \n\n            But the moves: if we set b[i] = c_i * a[i], then the cost is |c_i|.\n\n            We require b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1].\n\n            We can use DP: let dp[i][j] = minimum moves for the prefix up to i if b[i] = j. \n            But j can be very large.\n\n        Another solution: \n            We can use a greedy backwards: \n                Let b[n-1] = 0.\n                For i from n-2 down to 0:\n                    // We require b[i] < b[i+1]\n                    // We want to choose b[i] = the largest multiple of a[i] that is < b[i+1]\n                    // Specifically, we want the number of moves for index i to be as small as possible, \n                    // but also we want b[i] to be as large as possible to make it easier for the next left element.\n\n                    // The largest multiple of a[i] that is < b[i+1] is: \n                    //   if b[i+1] > 0, then we can set b[i] = floor((b[i+1]-1)/a[i]) * a[i]\n                    //   if b[i+1] <=0, then we set b[i] = b[i+1] - a[i]   (then the cost is ceil(|b[i]|/a[i])? )\n\n            But the moves for index i is |c_i|, and c_i = b[i] / a[i] (if we are only using additions/subtractions, then c_i can be positive or negative integer).\n\n            However, the moves: if we set b[i] = c_i * a[i], then the cost is |c_i|.\n\n            How to compute c_i: \n                We require c_i * a[i] < b[i+1].\n                We want the largest possible b[i] (to make the condition for the next left easier) that is < b[i+1]. \n                So c_i = floor((b[i+1]-1) / a[i])   [if we are allowing negative?]\n\n            But note: floor((b[i+1]-1)/a[i]) might be negative if b[i+1] is negative.\n\n            Then the cost for index i is |c_i|.\n\n            Then we can do from right to left.\n\n        The provided code for the left part (reversed(a[:i])) is similar to this? \n            They have a variable t that represents b[i+1] (the next right element) for the current element. \n            For the first element (i-1), t=0.\n            Then for the element a[i-1]=k, they set:\n                d = ceil((t+1)/k)   -> which is ceil(1/k)=1.\n                then t = k * d = k.\n                cost += d = 1.\n\n            This sets b[i-1]=k, but we require b[i-1] < b[i]=0? -> not satisfied.\n\n        What if we use negative? \n            For the first element (i-1): \n                we require b[i-1] < 0.\n                the largest multiple of k that is <0 is -k.\n                then c_i = -1.\n                cost = 1.\n\n            then for the next element (i-2): \n                we require b[i-2] < b[i-1] = -k.\n                the largest multiple of a[i-2] (say m) that is < -k is: \n                    c_i = floor((-k-1)/m)   [because we want the largest multiple that is < -k]\n                then cost += |c_i|.\n\n            In the provided code, they do for the left part in the loop: \n                for k in reversed(a[:i]): \n                    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k) \n                    t = k * d \n                    p += d \n\n            If we try with the negative approach: \n                For the first element (i-1): \n                    t=0.\n                    d = ceil((0+1)/k) = 1.\n                    t = k*1 = k.   -> we want -k.\n\n            So it's not matching.\n\n        I think the provided code for the left part is for the condition: we want the sequence to be decreasing? or for the right part? \n\n        The TODO is for the right part: for k in a[i+1:]: \n\n        In the right part, we are processing the elements after i. \n            We have b[i]=0.\n            We require b[i] < b[i+1] < b[i+2] < ... \n\n            For the first element after i (at index i+1): \n                we require b[i+1] > b[i]=0.\n                the smallest multiple of a[i+1] that is >0 is a[i+1] (cost 1).\n                then for the next element (i+2): we require b[i+2] > b[i+1]=a[i+1].\n\n            So for the right part, we can do: \n                t = 0   # b[i]=0.\n                for k in a[i+1:]: \n                    # we require b[j] > t (where t is the previous b[j-1])\n                    # then we want the smallest integer d such that d * k > t.\n                    # d = floor(t/k) + 1   if we are using positive multiples.\n                    # then the cost for this element is d.\n                    # then we set t = d * k.\n\n            Example: a[i+1]=1, then d = floor(0/1)+1 = 1, cost=1, t=1.\n                     next: a[i+2]=1, then d = floor(1/1)+1 = 2, cost=2, t=2.\n                     next: a[i+3]=1, then d = floor(2/1)+1 = 3, cost=3, t=3.\n\n            Total cost for the right part = 1+2+3 = 6.\n\n            But the moves for each element: \n                b[i+1] = 1 (1 move)\n                b[i+2] = 2 (2 moves)\n                b[i+3] = 3 (3 moves)\n            -> cost=6.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO for the right part should be:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            t = d * k\n            p += d\n\n        But note: if t is negative? then // is floor division? \n            We require d such that d*k > t.\n            d = floor(t/k) + 1 might not work for negative? \n\n        Example: t = -5, k=2: \n            floor(-5/2) = -3 (because -5//2 in Python is -3), then d = -3+1 = -2.\n            then t = -2 * 2 = -4, and -4 > -5 -> true.\n            cost = -2 (absolute value not used) -> but the moves are absolute? \n\n        But wait, the moves for an element is |d|, because if d is negative, we are doing |d| moves of subtraction.\n\n        In the code, they are not using absolute value; they are doing p += d.\n\n        But if d is negative, then we are reducing the total moves? that is not intended.\n\n        Therefore, we should use the absolute value of d? \n\n        However, the problem: the number of moves is |d|, but in the right part, we are only using positive multiples? because we want b[j] > t. We can also use negative multiples? but then we would get a negative number, and then the next element must be > that negative number, which might be easier? \n\n        But the known solution: we can use either positive or negative. \n\n        The optimal for the right part: \n            We want to minimize the moves. \n            We can set b[j] = d * a[j] for any integer d (positive or negative) such that b[j] > t.\n            We want to minimize |d|.\n\n        How to compute d? \n            We require d * a[j] > t.\n            We want d to be the integer with the smallest absolute value satisfying the condition.\n\n            If there exists a positive d: then the smallest d is ceil((t+1)/a[j])? \n            If we allow negative d: then we can also do d = floor((t+1)/a[j]) might be negative? \n\n        Specifically, we can solve: \n            d > t / a[j]\n\n            The integer d with smallest |d| satisfying d > t/a[j] is:\n                candidate1: ceil((t+1)/a[j])   [positive candidate]\n                candidate2: floor((t+1)/a[j])   [might be negative] -> but floor might be not > t/a[j]? \n\n            Actually, we can do: \n                d0 = floor(t/a[j]) + 1   [the smallest integer greater than t/a[j]]\n\n            Then the smallest |d| is min(|d0|, |d0- something|)? \n\n        But note: because a[j] is positive, the function is linear. \n\n        However, the known solution in the provided code for the left part used ceil((t+1)/k) for a positive setting? \n\n        For the right part, we can use: \n            d = (t // a[j]) + 1\n            if we are in Python, for positive t this is floor division, for negative t, // is floor (which is towards -infinity).\n\n        But then the moves for that element is |d|.\n\n        In the code, they are not using |d|; they are doing p += d. \n\n        This is a mistake.\n\n        Let me look at the entire structure: \n            for i in range(n): \n                p = 0\n                # TODO: the right part: for k in a[i+1:]: \n                # then the left part: for k in reversed(a[:i]): \n                #   which uses: d = ceil((t+1)/k); then p += d; \n                #   and d is always positive because ceil((t+1)/k) is at least ceil(1/k)=1.\n\n            then we do c = min(c, p)\n\n        In the left part, d is always positive. \n        In the right part, if we use d = (t//k)+1, then d might be negative if t is negative.\n\n        Example: \n            n=2, a=[1,1]\n            i=0: \n                right part: a[1:]=[1]\n                    t=0 (initial)\n                    d = (0//1)+1 = 1 -> then p=1, then t=1*1=1.\n                left part: a[:0] = [] -> skip.\n                p=1.\n\n            i=1: \n                right part: a[2:] = [] -> skip.\n                left part: a[:1]=[1] -> reversed is [1]\n                    for k=1: \n                        d = ceil((0+1)/1)=ceil(1)=1, then t=1, p=1.\n                p=1.\n\n            then c = min(1,1)=1.\n\n            then we print 1.\n\n        But the example: \n            We have two elements. \n            We can set:\n                b0 = -1 (cost 1)\n                b1 = 0 (cost 0) -> then -1<0 -> valid.\n            -> total cost=1.\n\n            or \n                b0=0 (cost0), b1=1 (cost1) -> valid.\n            -> total cost=1.\n\n            So the answer is 1.\n\n        Example2: [1,1,1] \n            i=0: \n                right: a[1:]=[1,1]\n                    t=0, d1 = (0//1)+1 = 1 -> cost=1, t=1.\n                    d2 = (1//1)+1 = 1+1=2 -> cost=1+2=3, t=2.\n                left: [] -> cost=3.\n            i=1:\n                right: a[2:]=[1]\n                    t=0, d = (0//1)+1=1 -> cost=1, t=1.\n                left: a[:1]=[1] -> \n                    for k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, cost=1+1=2.\n            i=2:\n                right: []\n                left: a[:2]=[1,1] -> reversed: [1,1]\n                    for the first: k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, t=1.\n                    for the second: k=1: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2, cost=1+2=3.\n            then c = min(3,2,3)=2.\n\n            But the moves: \n                One solution: \n                    b0 = -1 (1 move)\n                    b1 = 0 (0 moves)\n                    b2 = 1 (1 move)\n                total=2.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        Therefore, for the right part, we can do:\n\n            t = 0   # the initial value for b[i] is 0.\n            for k in a[i+1:]:\n                # d = smallest integer such that d * k > t\n                # d = floor(t / k) + 1   -> this works for nonnegative t? \n                # But what if t is negative? \n                # Example: t = -5, k=2: floor(-5/2) = -3 (in Python), then d = -3+1 = -2.\n                # Then we would have p += -2 -> which is negative, and then we set t = -4.\n                # But the moves for that element is |d|=2, not -2.\n\n            So we should use p += abs(d), but the code does not.\n\n        However, in the left part, they use p += d and d is positive. \n        In the right part, if we use floor(t/k)+1, then d might be negative.\n\n        Therefore, we should use the absolute value of d for the right part? \n\n        But the code structure: \n            for the right part, we are not given any code, we have to fill the TODO.\n\n        We can do: \n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += abs(d)\n            t = d * k\n\n        But wait, the left part does not use absolute value? and it is for the left part which is always positive? \n\n        Example with negative in the right part: \n            a = [2, 1] \n            Consider i=0: \n                right part: a[1:]=[1]\n                t=0.\n                d = (0//1)+1 = 1 -> positive.\n                p=1, t=1.\n            then left part: [] -> total p=1.\n\n            Consider i=1: \n                right part: []\n                left part: a[:1]=[2] -> \n                    d = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, then t=2, p=1.\n            then answer=min(1,1)=1.\n\n            But what if we do for the entire array: \n                We can set:\n                    b0 = -2 (cost 1: one subtraction)\n                    b1 = 0 (cost 0) -> then -2<0 -> valid.\n                -> cost=1.\n\n            Or \n                b0=0 (cost0), b1=1 (cost1) -> cost=1.\n\n            So it's 1.\n\n        Example with negative in the right part: \n            a = [1, 2] \n            i=0: \n                right part: a[1:]=[2]\n                t=0.\n                d = (0//2)+1 = 0+1 = 1.\n                p=1, t=2.\n                left part: [] -> p=1.\n            i=1: \n                right part: []\n                left part: a[:1]=[1] -> \n                    d = ceil((0+1)/1)=1, p=1, t=1.\n            then answer=1.\n\n            Moves: \n                b0 = -1 (cost1), b1=0 (cost0) -> cost1.\n                or b0=0, b1=2 (cost1) -> cost1.\n\n        Example with negative needed in the right part: \n            a = [1, 1] with i=0: \n                right part: [1]\n                t=0.\n                d = (0//1)+1 = 1.\n                p=1.\n                then left part: [] -> p=1.\n            i=1: \n                right part: []\n                left part: [1] -> p=1.\n            then answer=1.\n\n        But consider a = [1, 2] and we are at i=0: \n            b0=0.\n            then for b1: we require >0. \n            d = (0//2)+1 = 1 -> then b1=2, cost=1.\n\n        Consider a different setting for i=0: \n            b0=0.\n            b1 = -2 (by doing one subtraction) -> cost=1, and then 0>-2 -> but we require b0 < b1: 0 < -2 is false.\n\n        So we cannot use negative for b1 if b0=0.\n\n        Therefore, in the right part, we only need positive multiples.\n\n        Why would d be negative? \n            d = (t // k) + 1.\n            t is initially 0, then becomes positive (because d is positive and then t = d*k>0), then the next d will be positive.\n\n        So in the right part, t is nonnegative and increasing. \n        Therefore, d will always be positive.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += d\n            t = d * k\n\n        But note: in Python, for nonnegative t, floor division is the same as mathematical floor.\n\n        However, if t is negative? \n            How can t be negative in the right part? \n            We start with t=0 (nonnegative). Then we set t = d * k, and d is positive, so t is positive. \n            Then the next t is positive.\n\n        Therefore, in the right part, t is always >=0.\n\n        So we can safely use:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += d\n            t = d * k\n\n        Example: \n            a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n            i=0: \n                right part: [2,3,4]\n                t0=0.\n                for k=2: d = (0//2)+1 = 0+1=1, p=1, t=2.\n                for k=3: d = (2//3)+1 = 0+1=1, p=2, t=3.\n                for k=4: d = (3//4)+1 = 0+1=1, p=3, t=4.\n                then left part: [] -> p=3.\n\n            i=1: \n                right part: [3,4]\n                t0=0.\n                for k=3: d= (0//3)+1=1, p=1, t=3.\n                for k=4: d= (3//4)+1=0+1=1, p=2, t=4.\n                left part: [1] -> \n                    for k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, p=3, t=1.\n                p=3.\n\n            i=2: \n                right part: [4]\n                t0=0.\n                d=(0//4)+1=1, p=1, t=4.\n                left part: [1,2] -> \n                    for k=2: d=ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, then t=2, p=1+1=2.\n                    for k=1: d=ceil((2+1)/1)=ceil(3)=3, p=2+3=5.\n                p=5.\n\n            i=3: \n                right part: []\n                left part: [1,2,3] -> \n                    for k=3: d=ceil((0+1)/3)=ceil(1/3)=1, t=3, p=1.\n                    for k=2: d=ceil((3+1)/2)=ceil(4/2)=2, t=4, p=3.\n                    for k=1: d=ceil((4+1)/1)=5, p=8.\n                p=8.\n\n            then c = min(3,3,5,8)=3.\n\n        What is the optimal for [1,2,3,4]? \n            One solution: \n                b0 = -1 (1 move)\n                b1 = 0 (0 moves)  -> then -1<0.\n                b2 = 3 (1 move)   -> then 0<3.\n                b3 = 4 (1 move)   -> then 3<4.\n                total moves=1+0+1+1=3.\n\n            So the answer is 3.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO for program2.py is:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += d\n            t = d * k\n\n        But note: the // operator in Python for nonnegative t is floor division, which is what we want.\n\n        However, what if t is divisible by k? \n            Example: t=2, k=2: \n                d = (2//2)+1 = 1+1=2.\n                then t = 2*2=4.\n            But we could have done d=1: then b=2, and 2>2 is false, so we need d=2.\n\n        So it is correct.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += d\n            t = d * k\n\n        But note: the variable 't' is used in the next iteration, and we are in the loop for the right part.\n\n        We must update t and p.\n\n        We write:\n\n            d = (t // k) + 1\n            p += d\n            t = d * k\n\n        However, the code after the TODO has:\n\n            t = 0\n            for k in reversed(a[:i]): ...\n\n        This resets t to 0 for the left part. So we can use the same variable t for the right part.\n\n        Therefore, we complete program2.py as above.\n\nSummary:\n\n  program1: \n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  program2:\n        d = (t // k) + 1\n        p += d\n        t = d * k\n\n But note: the code for program2 has a line after the TODO: \n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]): ...\n\n  This is not part of the TODO. We are only to fill the TODO block.\n\n  The TODO block is in the for loop: for k in a[i+1:]: \n\n  We must not change the reset of t for the left part.\n\n  We write the three lines for the right part.\n\n  However, the TODO is only one line? The given code has:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We need to fill the block for the for loop. We write:\n\n        d = (t // k) + 1\n        p += d\n        t = d * k\n\n  But note: we are in a loop over k, and we are using t and updating t.\n\n  We must ensure we do these three lines for each k.\n\n  Therefore, we indent them inside the for loop.\n\n  But the TODO is in the middle of the for loop? We write the three lines.\n\n  However, the code after the TODO is:\n\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]): ...\n\n  This is after the for loop of the right part.\n\n  So we only need to fill the body of the for loop for the right part.\n\n  We write:\n\n        d = (t // k) + 1\n        p += d\n        t = d * k\n\n  But note: we are using integer arithmetic.\n\n  We output in the required JSON format.\n\n  Note: the program1 code has a comment in the TODO line: \"# TODO: Your code here\", we replace that with our code.\n\n  But the program1 code has:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the entire line with:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  But note: the next conditions are:\n\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n  So we must not break the structure.\n\n  We write exactly:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n  And for program2, we write in the TODO block for the for loop:\n\n        d = (t // k) + 1\n        p += d\n        t = d * k\n\n  But note: the variable names: we use k (which is the element in a[i+1:]) and t (which is initialized to 0 before the loop).\n\n  We output the JSON.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output in the format: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  We must not output the entire program, only the missing parts.\n\n  For program1, the missing part is the block for the condition \"if s1 < s2:\". \n  For program2, the missing part is the body of the for loop for the right part.\n\n  But note: the program1 code has a comment at the TODO. We remove the comment and put our code.\n\n  We write the code as a string.\n\n  We must be careful with newlines and indentation.\n\n  For program1:\n\n        We replace the line:\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        with:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But note: the next condition is \"if s2 < s1: ...\", so we must not break the structure.\n\n        The current code after the TODO is:\n\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        We want to keep that.\n\n        So we write the block exactly as above.\n\n  For program2:\n\n        We replace the TODO"
