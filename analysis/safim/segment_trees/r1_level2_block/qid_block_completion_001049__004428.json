However, note: the distinct elements per test case: worst-case one test case with n=100000, then distinct elements can be 100000. Then we do 100000 iterations per test case? But the total n is 100000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=100000. Then we do 100000 iterations. That is acceptable. But wait: the formula for each element: we do ceil(n/c).

Operation1: clone -> A0, A1 Then we can swap between A0 and A1: \n            Operation2: swap (A0[1] and A1[0]) -> A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] (3 zeros) and A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] (1 zero) -> but wait, we only have 2 zeros in A0 originally? Actually, A0: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> after swapping A0[1] (which is 1) with A1[0] (which is 0): \n                A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: at indices0,1,5 -> 3 zeros. A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: only at index5 -> 1 zero. Operation3: clone A0 -> A0, A1, A2 (A2 is [0,0,3,3,7,0]) Now we have 3 arrays: \n            A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> 3 zeros\n            A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> 1 zero\n            A2: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> 3 zeros\n\n        Total zeros: 3+1+3 = 7? But we only have 6 zeros? Actually, we started with 2 arrays * 2 zeros = 4 zeros, then we cloned A0 (which has 3 zeros) -> so total zeros = 4 + 3 = 7? That's impossible.",

How does this code work? It uses:\n            now = max_num (the maximum frequency)\n            ans = 0\n            copy = 0\n            while now < n:\n                if copy > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy -= 1\n                    now += 1\n                else:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy = now\n\n        What does this do? Example: n=6, max_num=2.\n            now=2, copy=0 -> then else: ans=1, copy=2.\n            now=2, copy=2 -> then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: \n                    ans=2, copy=1, now=3\n                if copy>0: \n                    ans=3, copy=0, now=4\n                now=4<6 -> else: ans=4, copy=4\n                then while now<6: \n                    if copy>0: \n                        ans=5, copy=3, now=5\n                    if copy>0:\n                        ans=6, copy=2, now=6 -> break. So it outputs 6.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=3.\n            now=3, copy=0 -> else: ans=1, copy=3. then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: ans=2, copy=2, now=4\n                if copy>0: ans=3, copy=1, now=5 if copy>0: ans=4, copy=0, now=6 -> break. Output 4.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=5.\n            now=5, copy=0 -> else: ans=1, copy=5. then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: ans=2, copy=4, now=6 -> break. Output 2.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=6: skip the while -> 0. This matches our formula: For max_num=2: 6\n            For max_num=3: 4\n            For max_num=5: 2\n\n        How does the while loop work?",

Actually, the while loop uses all available swaps from a clone only if we haven't reached n. \n\n                The process:\n\n                    Let k=0, now0 = max_num, copy0=0.

The total operations = k (clones) + (d1+d2+...) (swaps) = k + (n - max_num)   because the total increase in now is n - max_num. How many clones? After the first clone: we have now = max_num and then we do d1 swaps -> now becomes max_num + d1, and d1 = min(max_num, n - max_num). After the second clone: we have now = max_num + d1, then we do d2 = min(now, n - now) = min(max_num+d1, n - (max_num+d1)). But note: we can prove by induction that after the i-th clone, the value of now is at least max_num * 2^(i-1)",

Actually, the number of clones is the minimal i such that (2^i)*k0 >= n. But our formula uses: ceil(n/k0) - 1. How do they relate? Let k = ceil(n/k0). Then we need to have (2^i) >= k, so i = ceil(log2(k)). Then total_ops = ceil(log2(ceil(n/k0))) + (n - k0) But our formula is: ceil(n/k0)-1 + (n-k0) = (k-1) + (n-k0) Are these equal?\n\n                                Example: n=6, k0=2: k = ceil(6/2)=3 -> then our formula: 3-1+4=6.\n                                    ceil(log2(3)) = 2 -> 2+4=6 -> same. Example: n=6, k0=3: \n                                    k=ceil(6/3)=2 -> our formula: 2-1+3=4. ceil(log2(2))=1 -> 1+3=4 -> same. Example: n=6, k0=5: k=ceil(6/5)=2 -> our formula: 2-1+1=2. ceil(log2(2))=1 -> 1+1=2 -> same. Example: n=100, k0=10: \n                                    k=ceil(100/10)=10 -> our formula: 10-1+90=99. The while loop: \n                                        i: \n                                            i=0: now=10 -> need clone? i=1: clone -> copy=10, then we do 10 swaps: now=20, copy=0 -> 10 operations so far (1 clone + 10 swaps)\n                                            i=2: clone -> copy=20, then we do 20 swaps: now=40, copy=0 -> 1+10+1+20 = 32 operations so far\n                                            i=3: clone -> copy=40, then we do 40 swaps: now=80, copy=0 -> 1+10+1+20+1+40 = 73\n                                            i=4: clone -> copy=80, then we do 20 swaps (because we only need 20 more) -> now=100 -> total operations = 73+1+20 = 94. But our formula: 10-1+90=99, and the log2 formula: ceil(log2(10))=4 -> 4+90=94. They are not the same!",

However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the distinct elements per test case might be large. But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the worst-case distinct elements per test case is 10^5 (if one test case with n=10^5 and all distinct). Then we do 10^5 iterations per test case? But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so there is only one test case? \n\n        t (number of test cases) is at least 1, and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So worst-case: one test case with n=10^5. Then we do 10^5 iterations -> acceptable. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, meaning the sum of the lengths of the arrays over test cases <= 10^5.

But note: the formula for ceil(n/c) for integers: \n            ceil(6/2)=3 -> (6+2-1)//2 = (7)//2=3 -> then k=3-1=2. However, what if n=5, c_max=2: \n            ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> k=3-1=2, total_ops=2+(5-2)=5. Using our formula: (5+2-1)//2 - 1 = (6)//2 -1 = 3-1=2 -> 2+3=5. Therefore, we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip()) arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                freq = defaultdict(int)\n                for num in arr:\n                    freq[num] += 1\n                c_max = max(freq.values()) if c_max == n:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    k = (n + c_max - 1) // c_max - 1\n                    total_ops = k + (n - c_max)\n                    print(total_ops)\n\n   This is more efficient: we only do one computation per test case. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so even if we iterate over distinct elements it would be acceptable. However, this is faster. However, the example in the problem: \n        First test case: already constant -> 0. Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> c_max = 2 (for 0 and 3) -> \n            k = (6+2-1)//2 - 1 = (7//2)-1 = 3-1=2, total_ops=2+4=6. So we output 6. Therefore, the code for program2 is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip()) arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n            for num in arr:\n                freq[num] += 1\n            cmax = max(freq.values())\n            if cmax == n:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                k = (n + cmax - 1) // cmax - 1\n                print(k + (n - cmax)) However, note: the problem says the input has multiple test cases and the total n over test cases <= 10^5. But note: the array for each test case: we are reading n and then n integers. The total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe. But the example code provided for program2 has:\n\n        N=int(input())\n        for _ in range(N):\n            n = int(input()) list_num = input().split(' ')\n            d = dict()\n            for num in list_num:\n                if num in d:\n                    d[num] = d[num] + 1\n                else:\n                    d[num] = 1   # This is the missing line. max_num = max(d.values())\n\n            now = max_num\n            ans = 0\n            copy = 0\n            while now < n:\n                if copy > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy -= 1\n                    now += 1\n                else:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy = now\n\n            print (ans)",

Why? Because if we choose an element with frequency c0 (which is the maximum) and then choose an element with frequency c1 (c1<=c0), then F(c1)>=F(c0) because F is decreasing.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to iterate over all distinct elements.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. The total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n The idea:\n We want to make at least one copy of the array that has all elements equal.\n We can do two operations:\n   1. Clone an existing array (so we get one more copy).\n   2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n Note: We start with one array.\n\n How to think:\n We are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can collect all the same element (say x) from all the arrays and put them into one array.\n But note: we can create clones to have more copies of the array, and then swap to bring the same element together.\n\n Let the target element be x. Let the frequency of x in the entire set of arrays be F (but note: initially we have one array, and then we clone, so we can have multiple arrays and we can swap from any array to any array).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily. The key is that we can only clone the entire array at a time, and then swap arbitrarily.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We start with one array. We can clone it k times, so we have k+1 arrays.\n 2. Then we can swap arbitrarily. We want one array to have all x.\n\n How many x's do we have? Initially, we have count[x] in the first array. Then when we clone, we get more copies of the array? \n But note: when we clone, we get an identical array. So after k clones, we have k+1 arrays, each initially having the same elements as the original.\n\n Then we can swap arbitrarily. We can take all the x's from all the arrays and put them into one array.\n\n How many x's do we have in total? (k+1) * (count[x])? \n Actually, no: because we are swapping, we can only use the x's that are present in the entire set. Initially, we have one array with count[x] = c (say). \n Then when we clone, we get k more arrays, each with the same c x's? But note: the problem does not say we can change the arrays arbitrarily without cost? \n\n However, the operations are:\n   - Clone: we get a new copy of one existing array (so the new array is identical to the one we cloned).\n   - Swap: we can swap two elements from any two arrays (or the same array) at any positions.\n\n So after cloning, we have multiple arrays. Then we can swap arbitrarily. Therefore, the entire set of elements is fixed: the multiset of all arrays is (k+1) copies of the original array.\n\n Therefore, the total number of x's is (k+1) * c, where c is the frequency of x in the original array.\n\n Now, we want one array to have n copies of x. Therefore, we require:\n   (k+1) * c >= n   =>   k >= ceil(n / c) - 1.\n\n But note: we can also swap non-x elements out? Actually, we can. However, we have to account for the operations.\n\n However, the problem asks for the minimal number of operations.\n\n Operations:\n   - Each clone operation counts as one operation.\n   - Each swap operation counts as one operation.\n\n How do we do the swaps?\n   We start with k+1 arrays. We want to form one array of all x. We can do:\n\n   Step 1: We have k+1 arrays. We can take the x's from all the arrays and put them into one array. How many swaps are needed?\n\n   Note: We can swap two elements at a time. We can also think: we need to bring n x's into the target array. But initially, the target array already has c x's. So we need to bring n - c x's from the other arrays. And for each x we bring, we can swap one element from the target array (which is not x) to the array we took the x from.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. Actually, we can also swap between non-target arrays. The minimal number of swaps to collect all x's in one array is: the total number of x's that are not in the target array? But we can also swap from multiple arrays.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   We have k+1 arrays. The target array initially has c x's. The other k arrays have c x's each? Actually, no: the target array is one of the k+1, so the other k arrays have c x's each? Actually, no: the target array is one of the k+1, so the other k arrays have c x's each? \n\n   But note: we can choose which array to make the target. Actually, we can choose any array to be the target. So we can choose the array that already has the most x's? However, we are going to use the element x that has the highest frequency? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify which element we are going to use. We can choose any element. So we choose the element x that has the highest frequency in the original array (because that minimizes the operations).\n\n   Let c = max frequency of any element in the original array.\n\n   Then total x's = (k+1)*c.\n\n   We need to form one array with n x's. Therefore, we require (k+1)*c >= n.\n\n   How many swaps? \n\n   We have to move x's from the other arrays to the target array. The target array initially has c x's. We need n - c more x's. But note: we can also get x's from the target array? Actually, the target array already has c x's. We don't need to move them. We need to bring n - c x's from the other arrays.\n\n   However, when we bring an x from another array, we have to swap it with a non-x in the target array? But note: we can also swap two elements that are both not in the target array? Actually, we can do any swaps. The minimal number of swaps to collect the x's in the target array is exactly the number of x's that are not in the target array? \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   We have k+1 arrays. The target array has c x's. The other k arrays have k*c x's. But we only need n - c x's. So we take n - c x's from the other arrays. How many swaps? Each swap can bring one x to the target array and at the same time remove one non-x from the target array? \n\n   However, note: we can also swap an x from the target array with a non-x in the target array? That doesn't help. Actually, we need to bring an x from a non-target array to the target array. To do that, we can swap an x from a non-target array with a non-x in the target array. That swap will increase the count of x in the target array by 1. So we need n - c swaps.\n\n   But wait: what if we have an x in the target array that we swap with an x in a non-target array? That doesn't help. So we only swap when the non-target array has an x and the target array has a non-x.\n\n   Therefore, the number of swaps required is (n - c).\n\n   However, note: we might have more than n - c x's available? But we only need n - c.\n\n   Therefore, total operations = (number of clone operations) + (number of swap operations) = k + (n - c).\n\n   And we have the constraint: (k+1)*c >= n  => k >= ceil(n/c) - 1.\n\n   We want to minimize: k + (n - c) = ceil(n/c) - 1 + n - c.\n\n   But note: we can choose k to be the minimal integer such that (k+1)*c >= n, i.e., k = ceil(n/c) - 1.\n\n   Therefore, total operations = (ceil(n/c) - 1) + (n - c).\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \n        Example 1: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, and the element 0 has frequency 2 (c=2). \n        Then k_min = ceil(6/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n        Then total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 6. -> matches the example.\n\n   But what about the example: [1,1]? \n        n=2, c=2 -> k_min = ceil(2/2)-1 = 1-1=0, then operations = 0 + (2-2)=0 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: [1,2] (with two distinct). \n        We choose the element 1 (c=1) or 2 (c=1). \n        Then k_min = ceil(2/1)-1 = 2-1=1, operations = 1 + (2-1)=2.\n\n        How? \n          Start: [1,2]\n          Operation 1: clone -> [1,2] and [1,2]\n          Operation 2: swap the 2 in the first array with the 1 in the second array -> [1,1] and [2,2]. \n          So we have one array [1,1] (or [2,2]) and we did 2 operations.\n\n   But wait: what if we choose element 1? Then we want one array of [1,1]. \n        Initially: [1,2] and [1,2]. \n        We can swap the 2 in the first array with the 1 in the second array: that gives [1,1] and [2,2]. So 2 operations.\n\n   However, note: we could also do:\n        Operation 1: swap the 1 and 2 in the first array? Then we get [2,1] and then clone? But that doesn't help.\n\n   So the formula: for the chosen element x with frequency c, the total operations is: (ceil(n/c) - 1) + (n - c).\n\n   But note: we can choose any element. So we choose the element x that minimizes: (ceil(n/c) - 1) + (n - c).\n\n   However, note: the example in the problem: \n        [0, -2, 3, -4, 0] -> the example output is 2? \n        Actually, the example in the problem is the first program's example? \n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"For each test case output a single integer \u2014 the minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal.\"\n\n   However, the example in the note of the first program is different.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \n        \"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\"\n\n   Then they do swaps and then another clone and then more swaps. They did 6 operations.\n\n   So for the array [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6) and the element 0 (c=2) we get 6 operations.\n\n   But what if we choose a different element? \n        For element 3: c=2 -> operations = ceil(6/2)-1 + (6-2) = 2 + 4 = 6.\n        For element 1: c=1 -> ceil(6/1)-1 + (6-1) = 5 + 5 = 10.\n        For element 7: c=1 -> 10.\n\n   So the minimal is 6.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n        Step 1: Count the frequency of each element. Let c_max = max frequency.\n        Step 2: For each distinct element with frequency c, we can compute:\n                operations(c) = (ceil(n/c) - 1) + (n - c)\n        Step 3: Answer = min_{x in distinct elements} operations(c)\n\n   However, note: we are guaranteed that the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the array elements can be as large as 10^9, but we are iterating over distinct elements per test case. The total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the total distinct elements over test cases is <= 10^5.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we can do:\n\n        t = number of test cases (<=10000) but the total n<=100000, so t can be up to 10000 but the sum of n is 100000, so the maximum n per test case might be large? Actually, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we can iterate over the distinct elements for each test case.\n\n   However, note: the distinct elements per test case: worst-case one test case with n=100000, then distinct elements can be 100000. Then we do 100000 iterations per test case? But the total n is 100000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=100000. Then we do 100000 iterations. That is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the formula for each element: we do ceil(n/c). How to compute ceil(n/c)? \n        ceil(n/c) = (n + c - 1) // c   [if n and c are positive]\n\n   However, note: c is the frequency, so c>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        ans = a big number\n        for each distinct element, let c = frequency\n            k = (n + c - 1) // c   # this is ceil(n/c)\n            total_ops = (k - 1) + (n - c)\n            if total_ops < ans: ans = total_ops\n\n   But note: we can also consider that we don't need to do any operation if the array is already all equal? \n        If the array is already all equal (c = n), then:\n            k = ceil(n/n)=ceil(1)=1 -> k-1 = 0, and n-c=0 -> total_ops=0.\n\n   So that works.\n\n   However, let me test with the example [0, -2, 3, -4, 0] (from the first program's example output) but note: the example in the problem for program2 is different.\n\n   The problem for program2 has an example: \n        \"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0\"\n\n        Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> 6 operations.\n\n   But the example in the note of program1: \n        Test case 1: [1,2,-3] -> output 1? \n        But for program2, we are not given that example.\n\n   Actually, the problem for program2 is independent.\n\n   However, the example in the problem for program2: \n        \"In the first test case\" -> already equal -> 0.\n        \"In the second test case\" -> [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> 6 operations.\n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"For each test case output a single integer\"\n\n   Therefore, we output the minimal total operations.\n\n   However, note: the example in the problem for program2 also says:\n        \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]\"\n\n        Then they do one more clone and then two more swaps -> total 6 operations.\n\n   So our formula for [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6) and element 0 (c=2) gives 6.\n\n   But what if we choose element 3? \n        c=2 -> same: 6.\n\n   So the minimal is 6.\n\n   However, wait: the example also says: \n        \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]\"\n\n        How did they get that? \n          They started with two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n          Then they swapped two zeros from the second array with two non-zeros in the first array? \n          Specifically, they swapped the 1 at index1 of the first array with a 0 from the second array? and the 3 at index2 of the first array with a 0 from the second array? \n          Then the first array becomes [0,0,0,3,7,0] and the second becomes [1,1,3,3,7,3]? \n          But wait: the second array: originally [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> if we swap the 0 at index0 with the 1 at index1 of the first array, then the second array becomes [1, (now the first array's 1 becomes 0) ...] -> actually, we have to swap two elements: \n             swap the first array's element at index1 (which is 1) with the second array's element at index0 (which is 0): \n                 first array: [0,0,3,3,7,0] \n                 second array: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> then swap the first array's element at index2 (3) with the second array's element at index5 (0): \n                 first array: [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n                 second array: [1,1,3,3,7,3] \n          That took 2 swaps. Then they did one clone (operation 3) and then two more swaps? \n\n        Total operations: \n          Operation1: clone -> 1 operation (now two arrays)\n          Operation2: swap (index1 of first and index0 of second) -> 2\n          Operation3: swap (index2 of first and index5 of second) -> 3\n          Operation4: clone the first array -> 4\n          Operation5: swap (index3 of first and index0 of the new clone? ...) -> 5\n          Operation6: swap (index4 of first and index1 of the new clone? ...) -> 6\n\n        So they did 6 operations.\n\n   Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of operations\". Is there a way to do less than 6? \n\n   We have to form an array of 6 zeros. We start with two arrays: each has 2 zeros. So total zeros = 4. Then we clone one array: now we have 3 arrays, total zeros=6. Then we can swap to put all zeros in one array? \n\n        We have 3 arrays: A, B, C (each originally [0,1,3,3,7,0]).\n        We want to form one array with 6 zeros. We can do:\n\n        Step 1: swap a non-zero in A with a zero in B: then A has 3 zeros, B has 1 zero. (1 swap)\n        Step 2: swap a non-zero in A with a zero in C: then A has 4 zeros, C has 1 zero. (2 swaps)\n        Step 3: swap a non-zero in A with a zero in B: then A has 5 zeros, B has 0 zeros. (3 swaps)\n        Step 4: swap a non-zero in A with a zero in C: then A has 6 zeros, C has 0 zeros. (4 swaps)\n\n        Total swaps = 4, and we did 1 clone (so total operations = 1+4=5). \n\n        But wait: we started with one array, then we cloned once (operation1) to get two arrays. Then we cloned again (operation2) to get three arrays. Then we did 4 swaps (operations 3,4,5,6) -> total 6? \n\n        Actually, we can only clone one array at a time. So to get three arrays, we need two clone operations: \n            Start: A0 (one array)\n            Operation1: clone A0 -> A0, A1\n            Operation2: clone A0 -> A0, A1, A2\n\n        Then we do 4 swaps -> total 6 operations.\n\n        But what if we do swaps in the middle? \n\n        Operation1: clone -> A0, A1\n        Then we can swap between A0 and A1: \n            Operation2: swap (A0[1] and A1[0]) -> A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] (3 zeros) and A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] (1 zero) -> but wait, we only have 2 zeros in A0 originally? \n            Actually, A0: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> after swapping A0[1] (which is 1) with A1[0] (which is 0): \n                A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: at indices0,1,5 -> 3 zeros.\n                A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: only at index5 -> 1 zero.\n\n        Operation3: clone A0 -> A0, A1, A2 (A2 is [0,0,3,3,7,0])\n        Now we have 3 arrays: \n            A0: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> 3 zeros\n            A1: [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> 1 zero\n            A2: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> 3 zeros\n\n        Total zeros: 3+1+3 = 7? But we only have 6 zeros? Actually, we started with 2 arrays * 2 zeros = 4 zeros, then we cloned A0 (which has 3 zeros) -> so total zeros = 4 + 3 = 7? That's impossible.\n\n        Actually, when we swap, we don't create new zeros. The total zeros is fixed: 4 (from the two initial arrays) and then we clone an array that has 3 zeros? But that array was formed from the initial zeros? \n\n        The total zeros in the entire system is always 4 (because we started with two arrays, each having 2 zeros). \n\n        So after the swap: \n            A0: 3 zeros -> but that means we have taken one zero from A1? So A1 now has 1 zero. Total zeros = 3+1 = 4.\n\n        Then when we clone A0, we get a new array that is a copy of A0, which has 3 zeros. But that means we now have 3+1+3 = 7 zeros? That is creating zeros? \n\n        This is the key: when we clone, we are duplicating the entire array. So the total zeros become doubled? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \n            \"Choose any array and clone it. After that there is one more copy of the chosen array.\"\n\n        So the entire multiset of elements is duplicated for that array. \n\n        Therefore, the total zeros become: \n            Initially: one array -> 2 zeros.\n            After first clone: two arrays -> 4 zeros.\n            After second clone: three arrays -> 6 zeros.\n\n        So we have 6 zeros. \n\n        Then we can do:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> 1 op, zeros=4.\n            Operation2: clone -> 2 ops, zeros=6.\n            Then we need to collect 6 zeros in one array. The target array (say A0) initially has 2 zeros. We need 4 more. \n            We can do 4 swaps: each swap brings one zero from another array to A0 and sends a non-zero from A0 to the other array.\n\n            Total operations: 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        But note: we can also do swaps in the middle? \n\n        Operation1: clone -> zeros=4 (two arrays: A0 and A1, each 2 zeros)\n        Then we can swap between A0 and A1: \n            Operation2: swap a non-zero in A0 with a zero in A1 -> then A0 has 3 zeros, A1 has 1 zero. Now we have 4 zeros total.\n        Operation3: clone A0 -> now we have three arrays: A0 (3 zeros), A1 (1 zero), A2 (3 zeros) -> total zeros = 3+1+3 = 7? But we only have 4 zeros? \n\n        This is the confusion: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So if we clone A0 (which at the moment of cloning has 3 zeros), then we get a new array that is identical to A0 at that moment. So the total zeros become 3 (from A0) + 1 (from A1) + 3 (from A2) = 7. But we started with 4 zeros? \n\n        This implies that the entire multiset of elements is not fixed? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not state that the elements are conserved over the entire system? \n\n        But note: the swap operation: \"Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions.\" -> that conserves the total multiset. \n\n        However, the clone operation: we are creating a new copy of the array. So we are duplicating the entire array. Therefore, the total multiset is multiplied? \n\n        This is a critical point.\n\n        The problem says: \"After that there is one more copy of the chosen array.\" -> meaning we duplicate the entire array. So the total number of elements becomes (number of arrays) * n.\n\n        And the total zeros becomes (number of arrays) * (original zeros in the array we cloned) ??? \n\n        But note: we can clone any existing array. And the existing array might have been modified by swaps? \n\n        Example: \n          Start: A0 = [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: 2.\n          Operation1: clone A0 -> A1 = [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> now total zeros: 4.\n          Operation2: swap A0[1] and A1[0]: \n                A0 = [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: 3\n                A1 = [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: 1\n          Operation3: clone A0 -> A2 = [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> zeros: 3 in A2 -> total zeros: 3+1+3 = 7.\n\n        So we have created 3 extra zeros? \n\n        This is not conservation of zeros? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not state that the elements are conserved. It says we can clone an array: that means we are creating a new array that is a copy of the current state of the chosen array. \n\n        Therefore, the total multiset of elements is not fixed: we are creating new elements? \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the source of the new elements. It just says \"clone\". \n\n        However, the example output says 6 operations. And the example does 6 operations. \n\n        And the problem says: \"minimal number of operations\".\n\n        Therefore, we must assume that when we clone, we duplicate the entire array at its current state. This means the total elements are not conserved. \n\n        So the total zeros we have is the sum of the zeros in all arrays. \n\n        How do we compute the total zeros? \n          Initially: one array, zeros = c (the frequency in the original array).\n          After k clones: we have k+1 arrays. But note: we can clone any array at any time, and the arrays might have been modified by swaps. \n\n        However, observe: \n          When we swap, we are just rearranging the elements. The total zeros in the entire system remains the same. \n\n          But when we clone, we duplicate an entire array. So if at the moment of cloning, the array we clone has x zeros, then we add x zeros to the system.\n\n        Therefore, the total zeros after k clones (and any sequence of swaps) is: \n            initial_zeros + (zeros_added_by_clones)\n\n        How many zeros are added by a clone? It equals the number of zeros in the array we clone at the moment we clone it.\n\n        We are free to choose the order of operations and which array to clone.\n\n        Therefore, we can plan:\n\n          We want to maximize the growth of zeros? \n\n          Actually, we want to minimize the total operations. \n\n          We have two types of operations: clone and swap.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Operation 0: we have one array A0 with c0 = c (the original frequency).\n\n            We can do a sequence of clones and swaps.\n\n          How to minimize? \n\n          Note: we can postpone swaps arbitrarily. \n\n          Consider: \n            We can first do k clone operations without any swap. Then we have k+1 arrays, each with c zeros. Total zeros = (k+1)*c.\n\n            Then we can do swaps to collect n zeros in one array. How many swaps? \n                We need n zeros in one array. The target array initially has c zeros. We need n - c more zeros. \n                But we can take zeros from the other arrays. The other arrays have k*c zeros. \n                However, we can only take min(n-c, k*c) zeros? Actually, we can take as many as we want as long as we have them. \n\n                But note: we need exactly n-c zeros. And we have k*c zeros in the other arrays. So we require k*c >= n-c -> k >= ceil((n-c)/c) = ceil(n/c)-1? \n\n                Actually, we require (k+1)*c >= n -> k >= ceil(n/c)-1.\n\n            Then the number of swaps is n-c (because we need to bring n-c zeros to the target array, and each swap brings one zero from a non-target array to the target array and sends a non-zero from the target array to the non-target array).\n\n            Total operations = k (clones) + (n-c) (swaps) = ceil(n/c)-1 + (n-c).\n\n          But is this the minimal? \n\n          What if we do swaps before cloning? \n\n          Example: \n            We start with one array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (c=2). \n            Operation1: swap two elements to get one more zero in the array? \n                But we only have 2 zeros. We cannot create a new zero. \n            So we cannot increase the zeros in the array by swapping. \n\n          Therefore, the only way to get more zeros is by cloning. \n\n          And after cloning, we have more arrays and hence more zeros. \n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations is indeed: \n                min_{x} [ ceil(n/c_x) - 1 + (n - c_x) ]\n\n          where c_x is the frequency of x in the original array.\n\n   However, note: we can choose which element to make the target. So we minimize over x.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n            for num in arr:\n                freq[num] += 1\n\n            if len(freq) == 1:\n                print(0)\n                continue\n\n            max_freq = max(freq.values())\n            # But we are going to consider every distinct element? \n            # However, note: if we choose an element that is not the most frequent, then c is smaller and the operations might be larger? \n            # But we want the minimal operations over all elements.\n\n            # Since the total distinct elements in the test case is at most n, and the total n over test cases <= 10^5, we can iterate over the distinct elements.\n\n            ans = 10**15\n            for c in freq.values():\n                # k = ceil(n/c) - 1\n                k = (n + c - 1) // c - 1   # because ceil(n/c) = (n+c-1)//c for integers\n                total_ops = k + (n - c)\n                if total_ops < ans:\n                    ans = total_ops\n\n            print(ans)\n\n   But wait: what if n=1? \n        Then c must be 1.\n        k = (1+1-1)//1 - 1 = (1)//1 - 1 = 1-1=0.\n        total_ops = 0 + (1-1)=0 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: the formula for k: \n        k = ceil(n/c) - 1 = ceil(1/1)-1 = 1-1=0.\n\n   But what if n=3, c=2?\n        k = ceil(3/2)-1 = ceil(1.5)-1 = 2-1=1.\n        total_ops = 1 + (3-2)=2.\n\n        How? \n          Start: [a,b,c] (with two a's? Actually, the array has two a's? But the array of length 3: [a, a, b] for example? \n          We choose the element 'a' (c=2).\n          We need to form an array of three a's. \n          Operation1: clone the array -> we have two arrays: [a,a,b] and [a,a,b] -> total a's = 4.\n          Then we need to bring one a from the second array to the first array? \n             Swap the 'b' in the first array with an 'a' in the second array: \n                 first array: [a,a,a] -> done.\n                 second array: [b,a,b] \n          Operations: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2.\n\n        So 2 operations.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the distinct elements per test case might be large. But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the worst-case distinct elements per test case is 10^5 (if one test case with n=10^5 and all distinct). Then we do 10^5 iterations per test case? But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so there is only one test case? \n\n        t (number of test cases) is at least 1, and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n        So worst-case: one test case with n=10^5. Then we do 10^5 iterations -> acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, meaning the sum of the lengths of the arrays over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n            for num in arr:\n                freq[num] += 1\n\n            # If the array is already constant, then we output 0.\n            if max(freq.values()) == n:\n                print(0)\n                continue\n\n            ans = 10**18\n            # We iterate over the distinct elements: we have the frequencies in freq.values()\n            for c in freq.values():\n                # We don't need to consider if c is 0? but it won't be.\n                k = (n + c - 1) // c   # ceil(n/c)\n                k = k - 1   # because we start with 1 array, then we do k clones to get k+1 arrays\n                total_ops = k + (n - c)\n                if total_ops < ans:\n                    ans = total_ops\n\n            print(ans)\n\n   However, note: we can also avoid iterating over all distinct elements by noting that the minimal operations is achieved when c is as large as possible? \n\n        Let F(c) = ceil(n/c) - 1 + (n - c)\n\n        We want to minimize F(c) for c in the set of frequencies.\n\n        But note: the set of frequencies is the frequencies that appear. However, we can also note that the maximum frequency c_max might be the best? \n\n        Let's test: \n            n=6, c=2: F(2)=ceil(6/2)-1 + (6-2)=3-1+4=6.\n            c=3: if there is an element with frequency 3? \n                F(3)=ceil(6/3)-1 + (6-3)=2-1+3=4 -> which is less than 6.\n\n        So we should use the element with the largest frequency? \n\n        But wait: what if we have two elements: one with frequency 2 and one with frequency 3? \n            Then we choose the one with frequency 3 -> 4 operations.\n\n        How? \n            Start: one array: [a,a,a,b,b,b]? Actually, no: the array has 3 a's and 3 b's? \n            But the element we choose is a (c=3). \n            Then k = ceil(6/3)-1 = 2-1=1.\n            Then we do one clone: two arrays, total a's = 3*2=6.\n            Then we need to form an array of 6 a's? But we only have 3 a's per array? \n            Actually, we have two arrays: \n                A0: [a,a,a,b,b,b] \n                A1: [a,a,a,b,b,b]\n            We want to make one array of all a's. We need 6 a's in one array. \n            The target array (say A0) has 3 a's. We need 3 more a's. \n            We can take 3 a's from A1. \n            How? \n                Swap the three b's in A0 with the three a's in A1. \n                Then A0 becomes [a,a,a,a,a,a] and A1 becomes [b,b,b,b,b,b]. \n            This takes 3 swaps.\n\n            Total operations: 1 (clone) + 3 (swaps) = 4.\n\n        So the formula: F(3)=1+3=4.\n\n        But note: if we choose the element b (also frequency 3) we get the same.\n\n        Now, what if we choose an element with frequency 1? \n            F(1)=ceil(6/1)-1 + (6-1)=6-1+5=10.\n\n        So the minimal is 4.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply use the maximum frequency? \n\n        Why? Because F(c) is minimized when c is as large as possible? \n\n        Let's check the function F(c) = ceil(n/c) - 1 + (n - c) for c in [1, n].\n\n        We can write: \n            F(c) = ceil(n/c) - c - 1 + n\n\n        The term (n-1) is fixed. Then we have: ceil(n/c) - c.\n\n        We want to minimize ceil(n/c) - c.\n\n        Consider: \n            For a fixed n, as c increases, ceil(n/c) decreases and -c decreases (becomes more negative). So overall, F(c) is decreasing as c increases? \n\n        Example: n=6\n            c=1: ceil(6/1)=6 -> F(1)=6-1-1+6 = 10? \n                Actually: F(1)=ceil(6/1)-1 + (6-1)=5+5=10.\n            c=2: 3-1+4=6\n            c=3: 2-1+3=4\n            c=4: ceil(6/4)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> 2-1+2=3? \n            c=5: ceil(6/5)=2 -> 2-1+1=2\n            c=6: ceil(6/6)=1 -> 1-1+0=0.\n\n        But note: we cannot have c>n? and c is at most n.\n\n        And if c=6, then the array is constant -> we output 0.\n\n        But note: we skip if the array is constant (c=n) then we output 0.\n\n        Now, if we have an element with frequency 5? \n            Then F(5)=ceil(6/5)-1 + (6-5)=ceil(1.2)=2 -> 2-1+1=2.\n\n        How? \n            Start: one array: [a,a,a,a,a,b] (if the element is a, c=5)\n            k = ceil(6/5)-1 = 2-1=1 -> one clone: two arrays.\n            Total a's: 5*2=10.\n            We need 6 a's in the target array. The target array initially has 5 a's. We need 1 more a.\n            Swap: take one a from the second array and swap with the b in the target array -> 1 swap.\n            Total: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2.\n\n        So the minimal operations for n=6 is 0 (if constant) or 2 (if there is an element with frequency 5) or 4 (if there is an element with frequency 3) or 6 (if we choose an element with frequency 2) or 10 (if we choose an element with frequency 1).\n\n        Therefore, we must choose the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n        But note: the maximum frequency might be 5, then we get 2 operations. If the maximum frequency is 3, we get 4 operations. \n\n        So we want the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n        Actually, we want the element that minimizes F(c). And since F(c) is decreasing in c? \n\n        Let me check: \n            c=1: 10\n            c=2: 6\n            c=3: 4\n            c=4: 3? -> but wait: \n                F(4)=ceil(6/4)-1 + (6-4)=ceil(1.5)-1+2 = 2-1+2=3.\n            c=5: 2\n            c=6: 0\n\n        So F(c) is decreasing as c increases. Therefore, the minimal F(c) for a fixed set of frequencies is achieved when c is the maximum frequency.\n\n        Why? Because if we choose an element with frequency c0 (which is the maximum) and then choose an element with frequency c1 (c1<=c0), then F(c1)>=F(c0) because F is decreasing.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to iterate over all distinct elements. We can just use the maximum frequency.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            c_max = max(freq.values())\n            if c_max == n:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                k = (n + c_max - 1) // c_max - 1\n                total_ops = k + (n - c_max)\n                print(total_ops)\n\n        Let me test with n=6, c_max=5: \n            k = (6+5-1)//5 - 1 = (10)//5 - 1 = 2-1=1.\n            total_ops = 1 + (6-5)=2 -> correct.\n\n        n=6, c_max=3: \n            k = (6+3-1)//3 - 1 = (8)//3 - 1 = 2 (since 8//3=2 in integer division) - 1 = 1.\n            total_ops = 1 + (6-3)=4 -> correct.\n\n        n=6, c_max=2: \n            k = (6+2-1)//2 - 1 = (7)//2 - 1 = 3 (since 7//2=3) - 1 = 2 -> total_ops=2+4=6 -> but wait, we computed above for c=2: k=ceil(6/2)-1=3-1=2, then 2+4=6 -> correct.\n\n        But note: the formula for ceil(n/c) for integers: \n            ceil(6/2)=3 -> (6+2-1)//2 = (7)//2=3 -> then k=3-1=2.\n\n        However, what if n=5, c_max=2: \n            ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> k=3-1=2, total_ops=2+(5-2)=5.\n            Using our formula: (5+2-1)//2 - 1 = (6)//2 -1 = 3-1=2 -> 2+3=5.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                freq = defaultdict(int)\n                for num in arr:\n                    freq[num] += 1\n                c_max = max(freq.values())\n                if c_max == n:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    k = (n + c_max - 1) // c_max - 1\n                    total_ops = k + (n - c_max)\n                    print(total_ops)\n\n   This is more efficient: we only do one computation per test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so even if we iterate over distinct elements it would be acceptable. However, this is faster.\n\n   However, the example in the problem: \n        First test case: already constant -> 0.\n        Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> c_max = 2 (for 0 and 3) -> \n            k = (6+2-1)//2 - 1 = (7//2)-1 = 3-1=2, total_ops=2+4=6.\n\n   So we output 6.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2 is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n            for num in arr:\n                freq[num] += 1\n            cmax = max(freq.values())\n            if cmax == n:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                k = (n + cmax - 1) // cmax - 1\n                print(k + (n - cmax))\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input has multiple test cases and the total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n   But note: the array for each test case: we are reading n and then n integers. The total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n   But the example code provided for program2 has:\n\n        N=int(input())\n        for _ in range(N):\n            n = int(input())\n            list_num = input().split(' ')\n            d = dict()\n            for num in list_num:\n                if num in d:\n                    d[num] = d[num] + 1\n                else:\n                    d[num] = 1   # This is the missing line.\n\n            max_num = max(d.values())\n\n            now = max_num\n            ans = 0\n            copy = 0\n            while now < n:\n                if copy > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy -= 1\n                    now += 1\n                else:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy = now\n\n            print (ans)\n\n   This code does something different? \n\n   How does this code work?\n\n        It uses:\n            now = max_num (the maximum frequency)\n            ans = 0\n            copy = 0\n            while now < n:\n                if copy > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy -= 1\n                    now += 1\n                else:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy = now\n\n        What does this do?\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=2.\n            now=2, copy=0 -> then else: ans=1, copy=2.\n            now=2, copy=2 -> then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: \n                    ans=2, copy=1, now=3\n                if copy>0: \n                    ans=3, copy=0, now=4\n                now=4<6 -> else: ans=4, copy=4\n                then while now<6: \n                    if copy>0: \n                        ans=5, copy=3, now=5\n                    if copy>0:\n                        ans=6, copy=2, now=6 -> break.\n\n            So it outputs 6.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=3.\n            now=3, copy=0 -> else: ans=1, copy=3.\n            then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: ans=2, copy=2, now=4\n                if copy>0: ans=3, copy=1, now=5\n                if copy>0: ans=4, copy=0, now=6 -> break.\n\n            Output 4.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=5.\n            now=5, copy=0 -> else: ans=1, copy=5.\n            then while now<6: \n                if copy>0: ans=2, copy=4, now=6 -> break.\n\n            Output 2.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=6: skip the while -> 0.\n\n        This matches our formula: \n            For max_num=2: 6\n            For max_num=3: 4\n            For max_num=5: 2\n\n        How does the while loop work?\n\n            We have:\n                now: the current number of the target element we have in the target array? \n                copy: the number of arrays that we have that we can use to clone? \n\n            The idea:\n                We start with one array (the original) that has 'max_num' copies of the target element.\n\n                We want to get to n copies in the target array.\n\n                Operation types:\n                    If we have a clone available (copy>0), then we can use one clone operation to create a new array? But wait, the code doesn't do that.\n\n                Actually, the code does:\n\n                    else branch: \n                        ans += 1   -> this is a clone operation? \n                        copy = now   -> now is the current number of the target element in the target array? \n\n                    Then the if branch:\n                        ans += 1   -> this is a swap operation? \n                        copy -= 1\n                        now += 1\n\n                How to interpret?\n\n                The variable 'copy' might represent the number of arrays that we have that are available to take the target element from? \n\n                But note: \n                    In the else branch: we do one operation (which is a clone) and then we set copy = now. \n                    This now is the current count of the target element in the target array? \n\n                After cloning, we have two arrays: the target array and the clone. The clone has 'now' copies of the target element? \n\n                Then the if branch: we do an operation (swap) that moves one target element from the clone to the target array? \n                    Then we use one clone (so copy decreases by 1) and the target array gains one target element (now increases by 1).\n\n                But note: we can do multiple swaps from the same clone? \n\n                Therefore, the while loop: \n                    We are going to increase 'now' until it becomes n.\n\n                    Each time we can do:\n                        If we have a clone that has some target elements (represented by 'copy'>0), then we can do a swap: \n                            which moves one target element from a clone to the target array. This takes one operation. \n                            Then we use one available clone (so copy decreases by 1) and now increases by 1.\n\n                    If we don't have any available clone (copy==0), then we do a clone operation: \n                        We clone the target array. This gives us a new array that has 'now' target elements. \n                        So we set copy = now (meaning we have 'now' available swaps from this new clone? because we can take up to 'now' target elements from it? but note: we can only take the target elements that are in the clone, and the clone has 'now' target elements? and we can take all of them one by one? so we have 'now' available swaps from this clone).\n\n                Therefore, the total operations is the number of clone operations (each time we enter the else branch) and the number of swap operations (each time we enter the if branch).\n\n                And the process: \n                    We start with now = max_num, copy=0, ans=0.\n\n                    Step: \n                        We need to get to n. \n                        We do a clone: ans=1, copy = now (which is max_num).\n                        Then we can do up to max_num swaps: each swap gives one more target element to the target array.\n\n                    So after the first clone and then k swaps, we have:\n                        now = max_num + k\n                        copy = max_num - k   (if we do k swaps)\n\n                    Then if now < n, we might need to do another clone: \n                        Then we set copy = now (so we have now = max_num+k, and we set copy = max_num+k) and then we can do more swaps.\n\n                This matches the simulation above.\n\n                Why is this equivalent to our formula?\n\n                    Our formula: \n                        total_ops = (ceil(n/max_num)-1) + (n - max_num)\n\n                    But the while loop:\n\n                        It does: \n                            clone_count = number of times we did the else branch.\n                            swap_count = number of times we did the if branch.\n\n                        And swap_count = n - max_num   (because we start with max_num and we need n, so we need n-max_num swaps).\n\n                        And clone_count = ? \n\n                        How many clones? \n                            The first clone: we get max_num available swaps.\n                            Then we use them: so we get max_num more in the target array -> now becomes max_num + max_num = 2*max_num.\n\n                            Then if 2*max_num < n, we do a second clone: we get 2*max_num available swaps, then we use them -> now becomes 2*max_num + 2*max_num = 4*max_num? \n\n                        Actually, the process:\n\n                            Let k0 = max_num.\n                            Step1: clone -> copy = k0, now = k0, clone_count=1.\n                            Then we use k0 swaps: now = k0 + k0 = 2*k0, copy=0, swap_count=k0.\n\n                            Step2: if 2*k0 < n: \n                                clone -> copy = 2*k0, now=2*k0, clone_count=2.\n                                Then we use min(2*k0, n-2*k0) swaps: \n                                    now = 2*k0 + min(2*k0, n-2*k0) = min(4*k0, n)\n                                    swap_count = k0 + min(2*k0, n-2*k0)\n\n                            Step3: if now < n: \n                                clone -> copy = now, now=now, clone_count=3.\n                                then we use min(now, n-now) swaps: \n                                    now = now + min(now, n-now) = min(2*now, n)\n                                    swap_count = k0 + min(2*k0, n-2*k0) + min(4*k0, n-4*k0) ... \n\n                        This is a greedy: at each clone, we get a number of available swaps equal to the current count in the target array. Then we use all available swaps (if we need more) or just the needed swaps.\n\n                        How many clones? \n\n                            We start with k0 = max_num.\n\n                            After the first clone and using k0 swaps: now = 2*k0.\n                            After the second clone and using 2*k0 swaps: now = 4*k0.\n                            After the third clone and using 4*k0 swaps: now = 8*k0.\n\n                            So after i clones, we have now = (2^i)*k0.\n\n                            We stop when (2^i)*k0 >= n.\n\n                            How many clones? i such that (2^(i-1))*k0 < n <= (2^i)*k0.\n\n                            Then the number of clones = i.\n\n                            And the number of swaps = n - k0? \n\n                            But note: the swaps: \n                                In the first clone: we did k0 swaps -> now = 2*k0.\n                                In the second clone: we did 2*k0 swaps -> now = 4*k0.\n                                ...\n                                In the last clone: we did min( (2^(i-1))*k0, n - (2^(i-1))*k0 ) swaps? \n\n                            Actually, the total swaps is the total number of times we did the if branch, which is n - k0? \n\n                            Why? Because we start with k0 and we need n, so we need n-k0 swaps.\n\n                            And the total operations = clones + swaps = i + (n - k0).\n\n                            But note: i = ceil(log2(n/k0))? \n\n                            But our formula: ceil(n/k0) - 1 + (n - k0)\n\n                            Are these equal?\n\n                            Example: n=6, k0=2: \n                                i: we need 2^1 * 2 = 4 < 6, 2^2 * 2 = 8>=6 -> i=2.\n                                total_ops = 2 + (6-2)=6.\n\n                            But ceil(6/2)=3, then 3-1+4=6 -> same.\n\n                            Example: n=6, k0=3: \n                                i: 2^0*3=3<6 -> need at least one clone? \n                                    After one clone: we get 3 available swaps -> we do 3 swaps: now=3+3=6 -> so i=1.\n                                total_ops = 1+ (6-3)=4.\n                                ceil(6/3)=2 -> 2-1+3=4 -> same.\n\n                            Example: n=6, k0=5: \n                                i: 2^0*5=5<6 -> one clone: then we do 1 swap (because we only need 1) -> now=6, so i=1, swaps=1 -> total_ops=1+1=2.\n                                But our formula: ceil(6/5)=ceil(1.2)=2 -> 2-1+1=2 -> same.\n\n                            How is i related to ceil(n/k0)? \n\n                                We have: \n                                    i = minimal integer such that (2^i)*k0 >= n.\n\n                                    => 2^i >= ceil(n/k0)   -> i = ceil(log2(ceil(n/k0)))\n\n                                But note: ceil(n/k0) might not be a power of two.\n\n                            Actually, the number of clones is the minimal i such that (2^i)*k0 >= n.\n\n                            But our formula uses: ceil(n/k0) - 1.\n\n                            How do they relate?\n\n                                Let k = ceil(n/k0). Then we need to have (2^i) >= k, so i = ceil(log2(k)).\n\n                                Then total_ops = ceil(log2(ceil(n/k0))) + (n - k0)\n\n                            But our formula is: ceil(n/k0)-1 + (n-k0) = (k-1) + (n-k0)\n\n                            Are these equal?\n\n                                Example: n=6, k0=2: \n                                    k = ceil(6/2)=3 -> then our formula: 3-1+4=6.\n                                    ceil(log2(3)) = 2 -> 2+4=6 -> same.\n\n                                Example: n=6, k0=3: \n                                    k=ceil(6/3)=2 -> our formula: 2-1+3=4.\n                                    ceil(log2(2))=1 -> 1+3=4 -> same.\n\n                                Example: n=6, k0=5: \n                                    k=ceil(6/5)=2 -> our formula: 2-1+1=2.\n                                    ceil(log2(2))=1 -> 1+1=2 -> same.\n\n                                Example: n=100, k0=10: \n                                    k=ceil(100/10)=10 -> our formula: 10-1+90=99.\n                                    The while loop: \n                                        i: \n                                            i=0: now=10 -> need clone? \n                                            i=1: clone -> copy=10, then we do 10 swaps: now=20, copy=0 -> 10 operations so far (1 clone + 10 swaps)\n                                            i=2: clone -> copy=20, then we do 20 swaps: now=40, copy=0 -> 1+10+1+20 = 32 operations so far\n                                            i=3: clone -> copy=40, then we do 40 swaps: now=80, copy=0 -> 1+10+1+20+1+40 = 73\n                                            i=4: clone -> copy=80, then we do 20 swaps (because we only need 20 more) -> now=100 -> total operations = 73+1+20 = 94.\n                                    But our formula: 10-1+90=99, and the log2 formula: ceil(log2(10))=4 -> 4+90=94.\n\n                                They are not the same! \n\n        Therefore, the provided code for program2 uses a different (and more efficient) strategy? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            now = max_num\n            ans = 0\n            copy = 0\n            while now < n:\n                if copy > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy -= 1\n                    now += 1\n                else:\n                    ans += 1\n                    copy = now\n\n        This matches the simulation above for n=100, k0=10: \n            now=10, copy=0 -> else: ans=1, copy=10.\n            now=10, copy=10 -> while now<n: \n                if copy>0: \n                    do 10 times: \n                        ans=2,3,...,11; copy=9,8,...,0; now=11,12,...,20.\n            now=20, copy=0 -> else: ans=12, copy=20.\n            then do 20 swaps: \n                ans=13,...,32; copy=19,...,0; now=21,...,40.\n            now=40, copy=0 -> else: ans=33, copy=40.\n            then do 20 swaps (because we only need 60 more? but we need 100-40=60, but we have 40 available swaps, but we only need 60? Actually, we need 60, but we can only do 40 swaps? \n                Actually, we do min(copy, n-now) swaps? \n                But the code does: \n                    while now<n and copy>0: \n                        we do one swap: now++ and copy--.\n\n                So we do 60 swaps? But we only have 40 available? \n\n            Actually, we have copy=40, and we need 60 more -> we do 40 swaps: \n                now becomes 40+40=80, copy=0 -> ans=33+40=73.\n            then now=80, copy=0 -> else: ans=74, copy=80.\n            then we do 20 swaps: now=100, copy=60 -> ans=74+20=94.\n\n        So the code does 94 operations.\n\n        But our formula: \n            k = ceil(n/max_num)-1 = ceil(100/10)-1=10-1=9.\n            total_ops = 9 + (100-10)=99.\n\n        Why the discrepancy?\n\n        The problem: the two strategies are different.\n\n        Our strategy: \n            We do k = ceil(n/max_num)-1 clones first, then we do n - max_num swaps.\n\n            After k clones, we have k+1 arrays. The total number of the target element is (k+1)*max_num.\n            Then we do n - max_num swaps: each swap moves one target element from a non-target array to the target array.\n\n            Total operations = k + (n - max_num) = 9+90=99.\n\n        The while loop strategy: \n            It does 94 operations.\n\n        Which one is minimal? \n\n        The problem says: minimal number of operations.\n\n        The while loop strategy is more efficient: 94 < 99.\n\n        How is the while loop strategy different?\n\n            The while loop strategy interleaves clones and swaps. \n\n            Specifically, it uses the clones as soon as they are created to start swapping, which in turn increases the number of available swaps for the next clone.\n\n            Our strategy does all clones first and then all swaps.\n\n        Therefore, the while loop strategy is better.\n\n        How to compute the minimal operations? \n\n            The while loop strategy: \n                We start with one array: now = max_num (the target array has max_num of the target element).\n                We need to get to n.\n\n                We can do:\n                    Operation 1: clone -> we get a new array that is a copy of the current target array (which has now = max_num). Then we set copy = now (meaning we have max_num available swaps from this clone).\n                    Then we can do up to max_num swaps: each swap moves one target element from the clone to the target array. This increases the target array by one and decreases the available swaps by one.\n\n                After we use all the available swaps, we have:\n                    now = max_num + max_num = 2 * max_num\n                    copy = 0\n\n                Then we do:\n                    Operation (max_num+1): clone again -> we get a new array that is a copy of the target array (which now has 2*max_num). Then we set copy = 2*max_num.\n\n                Then we can do up to 2*max_num swaps: each swap moves one target element from the new clone to the target array. \n\n                So after k clones and s swaps, we have:\n                    now = max_num * (2^k)   [if we use all available swaps from each clone] \n                    but we might not use all if we reach n.\n\n                The number of operations: \n                    clones: k\n                    swaps: s = n - max_num   (because we start with max_num and we need n)\n\n                But the number of clones k is the minimal integer such that: \n                    max_num * (2^k) >= n   -> k = ceil(log2(n/max_num))\n\n                Then total operations = k + (n - max_num)\n\n                Example: n=100, max_num=10: \n                    k = ceil(log2(100/10)) = ceil(log2(10)) = 4.\n                    total_ops = 4 + 90 = 94 -> matches.\n\n                Example: n=6, max_num=2: \n                    k = ceil(log2(6/2)) = ceil(log2(3)) = 2.\n                    total_ops = 2+4=6 -> matches.\n\n                Example: n=6, max_num=3: \n                    k = ceil(log2(6/3)) = ceil(log2(2)) = 1.\n                    total_ops = 1+3=4 -> matches.\n\n                Example: n=6, max_num=5: \n                    k = ceil(log2(6/5)) = ceil(log2(1.2)) = 1.\n                    total_ops = 1+1=2 -> matches.\n\n                Example: n=6, max_num=6: \n                    k=0, total_ops=0.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal operations = ceil(log2(ceil(n/max_num))) + (n - max_num)   ??? \n\n            But note: we don't need to take the ceiling of n/max_num? because we are taking log2 of a real number.\n\n            Actually: \n                k = ceil( log2(n/max_num) )   -> but note: if n/max_num is not a power of two, we need to round up.\n\n            However, the condition in the while loop: \n                We stop when now>=n.\n\n                The number of clones is the number of times we did the else branch. \n\n                The while loop does:\n\n                    clones = 0\n                    while now < n:\n                        if copy>0:\n                            # do a swap: now++ and copy--\n                        else:\n                            # do a clone: copy = now, and clones++\n\n                How many clones? \n                    Let k be the number of clones. Then the available swaps after the i-th clone is now_i (the current now at the time of cloning).\n\n                The total now after the process is: \n                    now_final = max_num + (available swaps from clone1) + (available swaps from clone2) + ... \n\n                But note: the available swaps from clone i is now_i, and now_i is the value of now at the time of the i-th clone.\n\n                And the value of now at the time of the i-th clone is: \n                    now_0 = max_num\n                    after the first clone: copy = now_0 = max_num.\n                    then we do some swaps: but we might not use all? \n\n                Actually, the while loop uses all available swaps from a clone only if we haven't reached n. \n\n                The process:\n\n                    Let k=0, now0 = max_num, copy0=0.\n                    Step 1: we do a clone: k=1, copy = now0 = max_num, now = now0 = max_num.\n                    Then we do d1 = min(copy, n - now) swaps: \n                        now1 = now0 + d1\n                        copy1 = copy0 + now0 - d1? -> no, we do: \n                            copy decreases by d1, now increases by d1.\n\n                    Then if now1 < n, we do a clone: k=2, copy = now1, now = now1.\n                    Then we do d2 = min(copy, n - now) swaps: \n                        now2 = now1 + d2\n                        copy = copy - d2 = now1 - d2.\n\n                We stop when now>=n.\n\n                The total operations = k (clones) + (d1+d2+...) (swaps) = k + (n - max_num)   because the total increase in now is n - max_num.\n\n                How many clones? \n                    After the first clone: we have now = max_num and then we do d1 swaps -> now becomes max_num + d1, and d1 = min(max_num, n - max_num).\n                    After the second clone: we have now = max_num + d1, then we do d2 = min(now, n - now) = min(max_num+d1, n - (max_num+d1)).\n\n                But note: we can prove by induction that after the i-th clone, the value of now is at least max_num * 2^(i-1) (if we use all available swaps) but if we don't use all, then we stop early.\n\n                The minimal number of clones is the smallest k such that:\n\n                    max_num * (2^k) >= n\n\n                Why? \n                    After the first clone and using all swaps: now = 2*max_num.\n                    After the second clone and using all swaps: now = 2 * (2*max_num) = 4*max_num.\n                    ...\n\n                Therefore, k = ceil( log2(n/max_num) )   [if n>max_num, and if n==max_num, k=0].\n\n                But note: if n/max_num is not an integer power of two, then we might not need to use all swaps in the last clone.\n\n                However, the number of clones is the smallest integer k such that 2^k * max_num >= n.\n\n                Then total operations = k + (n - max_num).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal operations is: \n            if max_num == n: 0\n            else:\n                k = ceil( log2(n / max_num) )   -> but note: we need an integer k such that 2^k * max_num >= n.\n                total_ops = k + (n - max_num)\n\n        How to compute k? \n            k = 0\n            current = 1  # representing 2^0 = 1\n            # we need the smallest k such that current * max_num >= n\n            # but note: k=0: current=1 -> 1*max_num>=n? if max_num>=n then k=0, but we already handled max_num==n so k=0.\n            # if max_num < n, then we start with k=0 and current=1, then we do:\n            #   while current * max_num < n:\n            #       k += 1\n            #       current *= 2\n\n            But note: k is the exponent.\n\n        However, we can compute k by:\n\n            k = 0\n            temp = 1\n            while temp * max_num < n:\n                k += 1\n                temp *= 2\n\n            total_ops = k + (n - max_num)\n\n        Example: n=100, max_num=10: \n            k=0: temp=1 -> 10<100 -> k=1, temp=2 -> 20<100 -> k=2, temp=4 -> 40<100 -> k=3, temp=8 -> 80<100 -> k=4, temp=16 -> 160>=100 -> stop. k=4, total_ops=4+90=94.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=2: \n            k=0: 2<6 -> k=1, temp=2 -> 4<6 -> k=2, temp=4 -> 8>=6 -> k=2, total_ops=2+4=6.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=3: \n            k=0: 3<6 -> k=1, temp=2 -> 6>=6 -> stop. k=1, total_ops=1+3=4.\n\n        Example: n=6, max_num=5: \n            k=0: 5<6 -> k=1, temp=2 -> 10>=6 -> stop. k=1, total_ops=1+1=2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the provided code in program2 does a while loop that simulates this.

It is a dictionary.\n\n        The problem: \n            We are doing a dynamic programming:\n\n                dp[0] = 0.\n                For i from 1 to n:\n                    dp[i] = max( ... , ... , dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) )\n\n                Then we update the Fenwick trees and then update dmx.\n\n        What should we do in the TODO? \n\n            We should update dmx for the key pref[i] with the value dp[i].\n\n            Why? \n\n            The recurrence:\n\n                dp[i] = max( \n                    i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), \n                    nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, \n                    dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)\n                )\n\n            And then we update the Fenwick trees with (dp[i]-i) and (dp[i]+i) at positions determined by the sorted order of the prefix sums.\n\n            And then we update dmx: if the current dp[i] is greater than the current value for dmx[pref[i]], then we update dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i].\n\n            So the missing line is: \n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing code is: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        However, note: the TODO is inside an if block: \n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # then update\n\n        So we do: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        But what if there is already a value? We update it only if we have a larger value.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1 is: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n        But note: the code after the TODO is not shown. We must only output the missing line.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We have two programs. \n\n        For program1, the missing line is: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        For program2, the missing line is: \n            d[num] = 1\n\n        But note: in program2, the provided code has:\n\n            for num in list_num:\n                if num in d:\n                    d[num] = d[num] + 1\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We fill the else branch with: d[num] = 1\n\n        Therefore, the output should be:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n                \"program2\": \"d[num] = 1\"\n            }\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the format is JSON.\n\n        But note: the missing code for program1 is a single line, and for program2 is a single line.\n\n        However, in program1, the line is inside a for loop and an if block. But we are only outputting the line that is missing.\n\n        But what if there are multiple missing lines? In this case, only one per program.\n\n        Let me write the JSON:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"d[num] = 1\"}\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only missing one line in each.\n\n        But in program2, the missing line is in the else branch. We output the line that should be in the else branch.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: in program1, the line is: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        But the code has:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the line.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n                \"program2\": \"d[num] = 1\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the exact line of code.\n\n        However, in program1, the line is indented. But the JSON string should contain the string exactly as the line of code.\n\n        We write the string without extra spaces.\n\n        But the code in program1 has 8 spaces of indentation for the inner for loop and then 12 spaces for the if block? \n\n        We don't know the exact indentation. But the problem says \"the missing lines\", so we output the line as it would appear in the code.\n\n        In the context:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                ... \n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    [missing line]\n\n        The missing line should be indented by 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. However, the provided code in the problem for program1 has:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n                pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n                nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at the same indentation as the other lines in the for loop. So the missing line should be at the same indentation as the TODO comment, which is 8 or 12? \n\n        In the provided code, the for loop body is indented by 4 more than the for loop. Then the if block is indented by 4 more. So the missing line should be indented by 8 more than the outer.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the line without any extra indentation? \n\n        But the problem says \"so that ... runs correctly\". We must output the line with the correct indentation.\n\n        How many spaces? The line above the TODO is:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n\n        and it is at the same level as the other lines in the for loop. The TODO is a comment at the same indentation level as the if condition.\n\n        The missing line should be at the same indentation level as the TODO, and one more level than the if.\n\n        In Python, we typically use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        The structure:\n\n            for i in ...:   # indentation level 0\n                ...          # level 1 (4 spaces)\n                ...          # level 1\n                if ...:      # level 1\n                    ...      # level 2 (8 spaces)\n\n        So the missing line should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the provided code in the problem uses spaces (not tabs) and the same style.\n\n        We'll output the line with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might not care about the exact indentation as long as it is valid Python. But to be safe, we output the same as the surrounding.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the example of the TODO is given as a comment. We output the line that replaces the TODO.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n        for program1? \n\n        But note: the TODO is at 8 spaces, so the code should be at 8 spaces.\n\n        Similarly, in program2, the missing line is in the else branch. The structure:\n\n            for num in list_num:\n                if num in d:\n                    ... \n                else:\n                    ...   # missing line\n\n        The else branch should be indented by 4 more spaces than the for loop. The for loop is at 4 spaces (if the function is at 0, then for is at 4, and the body at 8, and the if-else at 8, and the branches at 12).\n\n        But the provided code in program2:\n\n            for num in list_num:\n                if num in d:\n                    d[num] = d[num] + 1\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We output: \"            d[num] = 1\"   (12 spaces)\n\n        But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the line that goes in the else branch.\n\n        However, to be safe, we output the line without any extra spaces? \n\n        But then it would be a syntax error.\n\n        We must output the line with the correct indentation.\n\n        How to know? The problem does not specify. But the provided code in the problem has the indentation.\n\n        Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is a line, we output the line as it would appear in the program.\n\n        For program1: \n            The line: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n        For program2: \n            The line: \"            d[num] = 1\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code in the problem uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n        The code:\n\n            N=int(input())\n            for _ in range(N):\n                n = int(input())\n                list_num = input().split(' ')\n                d = dict()\n                for num in list_num:\n                    if num in d:\n                        d[num] = d[num] + 1\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The for-loop over N: 4 spaces for the body.\n        The for-loop over list_num: 8 spaces for the body.\n        The if"
