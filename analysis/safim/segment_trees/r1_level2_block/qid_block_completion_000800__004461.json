But if p1>p2, there are no more candies? so we break. So the code for program1.py missing block is:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n But note: the variable name is `l` (list) and we are using `l[p1]`. But what if p1 is out of bounds? we check p1<=p2, and p2 is at least p1? and p1 is in the range [0, n-1]? because initially p1=0, and we increment until p1<=p2 and p2 starts at n-1. So it's safe. Now for program2.py: The problem: for a given n, find four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). The provided code:\n\n   for _ in range(int(input())):\n        a=int(input()) if a%4==0:\n            print(a//4,a//4,a//4,a//4)\n        else:\n            if a%2==1:\n                a1=(a-1)\n                if a1%3==0:\n                    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    print(a1//4,a1//2,a1//4,1)\n\n            else:\n                a1=a-2\n                print(a1//2-1,a1//2+1,1,1) We need to fill in the TODO. The examples:\n\n   n=4: 1,1,1,1 -> handled by a%4==0.\n   n=7: 2,2,2,1 -> handled by the else: a%2==1 -> a1=6, then 6%3==0 -> so 2,2,2,1.\n   n=8: 2,2,2,2 -> handled by a%4==0? 8%4==0 -> 2,2,2,2.\n   n=9: 2,4,2,1 -> how? a1 = 9-1 = 8 -> then 8%4==0 -> so we print 8//4=2, 8//2=4, 8//4=2, 1 -> 2,4,2,1 -> matches. n=10: 3,5,1,1 -> \n        a%4=10%4=2 -> not 0 -> then a%2=0 -> so we go to the else: \n            a1=10-2=8 -> then print 8//2-1=3, 8//2+1=5, 1,1 -> 3,5,1,1 -> matches. But what about n=5? \n        a=5: a%2=1 -> a1=4. then 4%3 ! =0 -> then we go to the TODO block? and then the next condition: 4%4==0 -> but we skip because we are in the elif? Actually, the structure:\n\n            if a1%3==0: ... \n            elif a1%4!=0: ... # TODO\n            elif a1%4==0: ... So for a1=4: \n            4%3 ! =0 -> so we enter the TODO block. We need to find four positive integers for n=5: a+b+c+d=5, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). Possibilities: \n          We can try: \n            a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2 -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal.\n            a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> equal. So 1,2,1,1 -> sum=5. How to generate this? The provided code for the TODO block: we are in the case where a is odd (so n is odd) and a1 = n-1 is divisible by 4? not necessarily?",

But for a1%4 ! =0 and a1%3 ! =0, we are in the TODO. How about we try to set d=1? then we have a+b+c = 10, and we want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,1)=c. So we need gcd(a,b)=c. We can set a and b such that gcd(a,b)=c, and a+b+c=10? and then d=1. We can try: \n          Let c=1: then gcd(a,b)=1, and a+b=9. We can choose a=2, b=7 -> gcd(2,7)=1 -> works. So 2,7,1,1 -> sum=11. How about c=2: then gcd(a,b)=2, and a+b=8. We can choose a=2, b=6 -> gcd(2,6)=2 -> works. So 2,6,2,1 -> sum=11. How about c=3: then gcd(a,b)=3, and a+b=7. We can choose a=3, b=4 -> gcd(3,4)=1 -> not 3. a=3, b=3 -> gcd=3 -> works: 3,3,3,1 -> sum=10? then d=1 -> total=10? but we need 11? Actually, a+b+c = 3+3+3 = 9, then d=1 -> 10, but we need 10? but n=11 -> a+b+c+d=11 -> so a+b+c=10. So for c=3: a+b=7, and gcd(a,b)=3. We can choose a=3, b=4 -> gcd=1 -> no. a=6, b=1 -> gcd=1 -> no. \n          a=3, b=3 -> gcd=3 -> but 3+3=6, then c=3 -> 6+3=9, then d=1 -> 10, but we need 10? but 10+1=11? -> 3+3+3+1=10? -> no, 10. We need a+b+c=10. So for c=3: a+b=7. We need two numbers that sum to 7 and have gcd=3. The numbers must be multiples of 3? 3 and 4 -> 4 is not multiple. 6 and 1 -> 1 not multiple. 3 and 3 -> 3+3=6, not 7. So no.\n\n        c=4: then gcd(a,b)=4, a+b=6. We can choose a=2, b=4 -> gcd=2 -> no. a=4, b=2 -> same. a=4, b=4 -> 4+4=8>6. \n          a=4, b=2 -> not gcd=4. \n          a=4, b=0 -> not positive.\n\n        c=5: then gcd(a,b)=5, a+b=5. We can choose a=5, b=0 -> not positive. a=2, b=3 -> gcd=1. So the easiest: c=1: then we can choose any a and b that are coprime and sum to 9. We can choose a=1, b=8 -> gcd(1,8)=1 -> works: 1,8,1,1 -> sum=11. But note: the problem says positive integers, so 1 is allowed. But the problem: we have a1=10, and we are in the TODO block. We want to output (a,b,c,d) = (1,8,1,1) or (2,7,1,1) or (3,6,2,1) etc.\n\n        How to choose? We can do: c = 1\n          d = 1\n          then we need a+b = 9, and gcd(a,b)=1 (because lcm(1,1)=1). We can choose a=1, b=8 -> gcd(1,8)=1 -> works. But the problem: the example n=10: we did not use this method? we used the even branch. So for the TODO block: \n          We can set d=1, and then we have a+b+c = a1 = n-1. Then we set c=1, then we need a+b = a1-1, and gcd(a,b)=1. We can set a=1, b = a1-2. Then gcd(1, a1-2)=1. So the solution: (1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n          Example: n=11: a1=10 -> then (1, 10-2=8, 1, 1) -> 1+8+1+1=11, and gcd(1,8)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But what if a1-2 is 0? but a1 = n-1, and n>=4 -> a1>=3 -> a1-2>=1. So we can do: \n          print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1, a1-2, 1, 1 are all positive. However, we must check: for n=5: a1=4 -> then we would print (1, 4-2=2, 1, 1) -> 1+2+1+1=5 -> and gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But wait: for n=5, we are in the TODO block? Actually, for n=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 !=0 -> then 4%4==0 -> so we skip the TODO and go to the next elif? So the TODO block is only for a1 not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4? \n\n        Example: n=13: a1=12 -> 12%3==0 -> so we skip the TODO.\n\n        n=14: a1=13 -> 13%3=1 -> not 0, 13%4=1 -> not 0 -> so we enter the TODO. Then we output: 1, 13-2=11, 1, 1 -> 1+11+1+1=14 -> works. But what if we want a solution that doesn't use 1 for a and c?",

And a1-2 is even? so we are printing (1, even, 1, 1) -> that's fine. But what if a1-2 is 0? but a1>=3 (because n>=4, so a1>=3) -> a1-2>=1. So it's safe. However, we must check: n=5: we don't enter this block? because a1=4 -> 4%4==0 -> so we go to the next elif and print (1,2,1,1) by the next block? But we are in the TODO block only when a1%4 ! =0? so for n=5 we skip. So the TODO block is for odd n such that a1 (which is n-1) is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4? \n\n        Example: n=7: a1=6 -> 6%3==0 -> skip. n=9: a1=8 -> 8%4==0 -> skip. n=11: a1=10 -> 10%3=1, 10%4=2 -> so we enter.",

But the problem says we want the maximum total number of candies when the sums are equal.\n           if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n           if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n       print(l2[-1])\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total\"\n\n We are to fill in the missing part.\n\n Approach:\n We are using two pointers: p1 (for Alice, starting at 0) and p2 (for Bob, starting at n-1).\n We have two sums: s1 (Alice's current sum) and s2 (Bob's current sum).\n We want to record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever s1 == s2.\n\n But note: the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2) -> this is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. \n However, we are going to update p1 and p2 until they cross. We want to consider every time the sums are equal.\n\n We are storing the total number of candies in a list l2? Then at the end we print the last element? \n But note: we want the maximum total number of candies when the sums are equal. However, we are traversing from both ends and we are going to have multiple times when s1==s2. We want the maximum total candies? But note: as we move, the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers independently. However, we are trying to extend the eating. But note: we are not necessarily increasing the total candies? Actually, when we have s1==s2, we record the current total candies (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)). Then we continue because we might get a larger total? But note: we are moving the pointers until we cover the entire array. However, the condition for the while loop is a bit odd.\n\n Actually, the typical solution for this problem is:\n\n   ans = 0\n   s1, s2 = 0, 0\n   left = 0\n   right = n-1\n   while left <= right:\n        if s1 < s2:\n            s1 += w[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            s2 += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if s1 == s2:\n            ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the next index for Alice, so she has eaten [0, left-1] -> left candies. Bob has eaten [right+1, n-1] -> n-1 - right candies.\n\n   Then we output ans.\n\n But note: the above typical solution records the last time when s1==s2? Actually, we want the maximum total candies? However, as we traverse, the total candies eaten (left + (n-1-right)) is increasing? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers and the total candies is increasing until the pointers cross? But note: we are adding one candy at a time. So the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is left + (n-1-right). Initially, left=0, right=n-1 -> total=0. Then we add one candy to either side -> total becomes 1. Then 2, ... until we have left and right meeting. But note: when we have s1==s2, we record the total at that moment. And we want the maximum total? Actually, the problem says \"maximum number of candies\", so we want the maximum total candies for which the condition holds.\n\n However, note: the typical solution records every time the sums are equal and then takes the maximum? But in the above, we are updating ans every time we get an equal sum. And we traverse until the pointers cross. Then we output the last recorded ans? Actually, we want the maximum total candies? But note: as we traverse, the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies is left + (n-1-right). And left is increasing and right is decreasing, so the total is increasing? Actually, no: because we are adding to the side that has the smaller sum. The total candies is increasing by one each step. So the last time we get an equal sum might not be the maximum total? Actually, the total candies is increasing: we start at 0 and then 1, 2, ... until n. So the last time we get an equal sum is the maximum total? But that is not necessarily true: because we might have an equal sum at total=10 and then at total=12, but then we might not get again? Actually, we are traversing until the pointers cross. The total candies eaten at the end is n. But we don't necessarily have s1==s2 at the end.\n\n However, note: we are updating ans every time we get an equal sum. And we want the maximum total? Actually, the total candies at the moment of equality is increasing? Since we are adding one candy at a time, the total candies is increasing. Therefore, the last time we get an equal sum would be the maximum total? But that is not true: because we might have an equal sum at total=10, then we add to the left and break the equality, then we add to the right and get an equal sum at total=12? Actually, no: because we are always adding to the side that is smaller. So the total candies is increasing. And we are updating ans every time we get an equal sum. Then the last time we get an equal sum is the maximum total? Actually, no: because after we get an equal sum, we break the equality by adding one candy to one side, and then we might get another equal sum later? But note: we are only adding one candy at a time. The total candies is increasing. So the last time we get an equal sum is the maximum total? But that is not necessarily the maximum total? Actually, we want the maximum total for which the condition holds. And we are traversing the entire array. So we can record the maximum total we see when s1==s2.\n\n However, the provided code has a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. That would be the last time we had an equal sum. But is that the maximum? Since the total candies is increasing, the last time we have an equal sum is the one with the largest total candies? Actually, yes: because we are going from 0 to n. So the last time we have an equal sum is the one with the highest total candies.\n\n But note: the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2). Let me check: \n   Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1<=n-1 -> true.\n   Then we do: if s1==s2 (which is 0==0) -> then we do ... (we need to record the total candies: which is p1 (which is 0) for Alice and n-1-p2 (which is 0) for Bob -> total=0). But we don't want 0? because they must eat at least one candy? But note: the problem says they can eat any number (including zero? but the note says non-zero? Actually, the note says \"non-zero\" in the example: \"the answer is 2\". So we don't want 0. \n\n How about we record the total candies only when s1==s2 and s1>0? But note: the problem says they want to be fair and eat the same total weight. The weight must be positive? because each candy has weight at least 1. So if s1==s2 and s1>0, then we record.\n\n However, the problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and the example: for n=3, [1,2,1] -> answer=2. So we start:\n\n   Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> we record 0? but we don't want that. Then we add to the left: s1=1, p1=1 -> total=1 (Alice:1, Bob:0) -> not equal. Then we compare: s1=1, s2=0 -> so we add to the right? no, because s1>s2? Actually, the code says: if s1 < s2: ... else: ... but note the next condition is for s2 < s1. So we do: s2 += l[p2] -> s2=1, p2=1 -> total=2 (Alice:1, Bob:1) -> then we check: s1==s2? yes. Then we record 2. Then we break the condition? because p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true. Then we check s1==s2 -> we record again? Then we do: now we have to add? because we are in the loop. Then we check: s1==s2 -> we record again? Then we do: now we have s1=1, s2=1 -> then we do the next condition: s1 < s2? no. Then s2 < s1? no. Then we break? Actually, we don't break. We are stuck? \n\n So the condition in the while loop must be: while p1 <= p2. But the provided condition is (p1-1<=p2). That condition is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. So when p1=1 and p2=1, we have 0<=1 -> true. Then we do the if s1==s2: record. Then we don't update s1 or s2? because s1==s2, and then we check s1 < s2? no, then s2 < s1? no. Then we break the loop? Actually, we don't break. We are stuck in an infinite loop.\n\n Therefore, we must change the condition? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are not allowed to change the existing code? But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We can only fill in the missing part? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the condition (p1-1<=p2) is intended to be while we have candies to eat? But the condition in the provided code is fixed. We must work with it.\n\n How about we break when we don't update? But that would be changing the code.\n\n Alternatively, we can see that the condition (p1-1<=p2) is the same as p1 <= p2+1. This condition is true even when p1==p2+2? Actually, no: if p1 = p2+2, then p1-1 = p2+1 > p2 -> false. So the loop runs as long as p1 <= p2+1. That means when p1==p2+2, we break. But we want to process until p1<=p2? Actually, we are going to update p1 and p2: we start at 0 and n-1. We add to the left: p1 becomes 1, then we add to the right: p2 becomes n-2. Then we might have p1 and p2 such that p1<=p2. Then we break when p1 becomes p2+2? That might be acceptable.\n\n But note: when we have an odd number of candies, we might end with p1 = p2+1? Then the condition p1-1<=p2 -> p1-1 = p2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we update? But we have no candy left? Actually, we have p1 and p2: we have already processed the candies? \n\n Actually, the condition is set so that we can process even when the two pointers cross? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        # record the total candies: which is p1 (number of candies Alice has eaten: from 0 to p1-1) and (n-1 - p2) (number of candies Bob has eaten: from p2+1 to n-1). So total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n\n Then we must break the loop when we have no more candies? But the condition is p1-1<=p2. After we record, we then check the next conditions? \n\n But note: after we record, we then check if s1 < s2? and if s2 < s1? and update accordingly. But if we are at the state where we have no more candies? then we break? because the condition will fail next time.\n\n However, the problem says: the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do at most 200000 steps per test case? Actually, no: the condition says the sum of n over test cases <=200000. So we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test case.\n\n But the issue: when s1==s2 and we have no more candies? Then we break? Actually, we break when the condition (p1-1<=p2) fails. \n\n How about we break when we have updated and then the condition fails? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that we are going to update until we break the condition. And we record every time we have an equal sum.\n\n Then we output the last recorded value? which is l2[-1]. But note: we might have multiple equal sums. And the last one is the one with the highest total? because the total is increasing? \n\n However, the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). And as we add candies, p1 increases or p2 decreases, so the total increases by one each step. Therefore, the last time we have an equal sum is the one with the highest total.\n\n But what if we have an equal sum at the very end? Then we record it. Then we break the condition? \n\n However, the condition: after we record, we then update? But if we have no more candies? then we break. \n\n But note: the condition (p1-1<=p2) must be true to enter the loop. After we update, we break the condition? \n\n Example: [1,2,1] (n=3)\n   Initially: p1=0, p2=2 -> condition: -1<=2 -> true.\n      s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total = 0 + (3-1-2)=0 -> l2=[0]\n      Then we check: s1==s2 -> we do nothing? then we check s1<s2? no. Then s2<s1? no. Then we break the loop? no, we just finish the iteration and then check the condition again? \n      Then we come back to the condition: p1=0, p2=2 -> condition true again? Then we are stuck? \n\n Actually, we must update the sums? The provided code has two ifs (not elif) so we do:\n\n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ... \n\n But if both are false (s1==s2) then we do nothing? and we are stuck.\n\n Therefore, we must update in the s1==s2 case? But the problem doesn't specify which one to update? Actually, we can update either? because we want to break the tie? \n\n How about we update the left one? or the right one? But note: the problem says they can eat any number from the left (in a row) and any from the right. But we are simulating one candy at a time? \n\n Actually, the typical solution updates the side that has the smaller sum. But when they are equal, we can update either? \n\n So we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        # record the total\n        # then we update one side? for example, we update the left? \n        # but note: we are going to update in the next if? because after we record, we check if s1 < s2? which is false, then if s2 < s1? false? so we break? \n\n We are stuck. Therefore, we must break the tie? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        # then we update the left? so that we break the tie? \n        if p1 <= p2:   # if there is at least one candy left? \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break   # but we cannot break in the middle? because the condition is at the top.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the condition (p1-1<=p2) is true, so we can update the left? but we are not forced? \n\n But the problem says: we can only fill in the missing part? \n\n Alternatively, we can change the condition to update when s1==s2? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        # then we update the left? because we want to break the tie? \n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n But then we skip the next conditions? because we are updating? and then we break the tie? \n\n But note: the next two ifs are independent. So if we update the left, then s1 becomes greater than s2? Then the next if (s1 < s2) is false, but then we check if s2 < s1? which is true? then we update the right? \n\n That would be updating both? \n\n Example: [1,2,1] at the beginning: \n   s1=0, s2=0 -> we record 0, then we update the left: s1=1, p1=1.\n   Then we check: s1 (1) < s2 (0)? false. Then we check s2 (0) < s1 (1)? true -> then we update the right: s2=1, p2=1.\n   Then we break the condition? because p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true. Then we check s1==s2? 1==1 -> record: total = 1 (from Alice) + (n-1-1)= (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2. Then we update the left: s1 = 1+ l[1] = 1+2=3, p1=2. Then we break the condition? because p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: 2-1=1<=1 -> true. Then we check: s1=3, s2=1 -> then we update the right? but p2 is 1, so we update the right? but we have no more right? because p2 is 1, and we update the right: we would do p2=0? then s2=1+l[1]? but wait, the array is [1,2,1]. l[1] is 2? but we already took the rightmost? Actually, we have an array: index0:1, index1:2, index2:1. \n   We have:\n        p1=0 -> then we took index0 -> then p1=1.\n        p2=2 -> then we took index2 -> then p2=1.\n        Then we update: we take index1 for Alice? then p1=2 -> then we take index1 for Bob? but that candy is already taken by Alice? \n\n This is a problem: we cannot take the same candy twice.\n\n Therefore, we must not update the left and then the right without checking the pointers? \n\n Actually, after we update the left, we have p1=1 and p2=2? Then we update the right: we take p2=2? then we set p2=1? Then we have p1=1 and p2=1: then we update the left: we take l[1] (which is the middle) and then p1=2. Then we update the right: we take l[1] again? but that is the same candy? \n\n So we must not update the left and then the right without checking the pointers? \n\n How about we break the tie by updating the left? and then we don't update the right? because we break the tie and then the next condition will update the right? \n\n Actually, we are in the same iteration: we update the left (so we break the tie) and then we check the next ifs? and then we update the right? in the same iteration? \n\n That would be two candies in one iteration? \n\n But the condition (p1-1<=p2) must hold at the beginning of the iteration. After updating the left, we have p1=1, p2=2 -> then we check the next if: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we update the right? but wait, we already updated the left? and then we update the right? in the same iteration? \n\n That would be acceptable? because we are processing two candies? \n\n But the problem: we are allowed to take any number? but we are simulating one by one? \n\n However, the problem says: we are to maximize the total number of candies. And we are only allowed to take contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right? Actually, no: Alice can take any contiguous from the left? but we are taking one by one? \n\n Actually, the typical solution is to take one by one? and it works? \n\n But in this case, we are taking two in one iteration? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        # then we update the left? but we must check if there is a candy at the left? \n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        # and then we break? and let the next condition update the right? \n\n But then the next condition: if s1 < s2? or if s2 < s1? will update the right? \n\n Example: [1,2,1] at the beginning:\n   s1=0, s2=0 -> we record 0, then we update the left: s1=1, p1=1.\n   Then we break the iteration? and then the next iteration: condition: p1=1, p2=2 -> condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> then we check: s1==s2? no. Then we check s1 < s2? no. Then we check s2 < s1? yes -> update the right: s2=1, p2=1.\n        Then we break the iteration? then next iteration: condition: p1=1, p2=1 -> 0<=1 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total=1 (from Alice) + (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2.\n        Then we update the left: if p1<=p2 -> true, so s1=1+l[1]=3, p1=2.\n        Then we break the iteration? then next iteration: condition: p1=2, p2=1 -> 1<=1 -> true.\n        Then we check: s1=3, s2=1 -> then we update the right? but p2=1 -> we update the right: s2=1+l[1]=3, p2=0 -> but wait, the candy at index1 is already taken by Alice? \n\n So we are taking the same candy twice.\n\n Therefore, we must not update the left if we are going to update the right? \n\n How about we break the tie by updating the left only? and then we don't update the right in the same iteration? \n\n But the code has two independent ifs. So after we update the left, we then check the next if: s1 (1) < s2 (0)? false. Then we check s2 (0) < s1 (1)? true -> then we update the right. \n\n How to avoid that? \n\n We can break the tie by updating the left and then break out of the current iteration? but we are in a while loop. We can use a continue? \n\n But we are not allowed to change the existing code? only fill in the missing part? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that after we update the left, we have broken the tie? and then we don't want to update the right in the same iteration? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        # update the left to break the tie, but then we break the iteration? \n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n        continue   # skip the next two ifs? \n\n But the problem says: we can only fill in the missing part? and we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n Alternatively, we can use an else: \n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n    else:\n        if s1 < s2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        if s2 < s1:\n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n But note: the existing code has two independent ifs. We are replacing the two ifs with an else? That would be changing the existing code? \n\n We are only allowed to fill in the missing part? \n\n The missing part is only the block under \"if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n So we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        # then we break the tie by updating the left? but we must check that p1 <= p2? \n        # but note: the condition (p1-1<=p2) is true, so p1 <= p2+1. \n        # if p1 <= p2: we can take the left candy? \n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            # if there is no candy on the left, then we break? but we are in the loop and the condition will break next time?\n            # we do nothing? then we break the loop? but we are stuck? \n            # Actually, we must break the tie? but if there is no candy? then we break the loop? \n            # But the condition (p1-1<=p2) is true, so if p1>p2, then p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1 -> so p1==p2+1 -> then we break the tie by updating the left? but we cannot because p1 is out of bounds? \n            # So we break the tie by updating the right? but we don't have a candy on the right? \n            # Actually, if p1>p2, then we have already taken all candies? \n            # So we break the tie by doing nothing? and then we break the loop? \n            # But then we are stuck? \n            # How about we break the loop? \n            break\n\n But we are not allowed to break? because the problem says we cannot change the existing code? \n\n Alternatively, we can update the left if available, and if not, update the right? but then we might update twice? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            # update the left\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        # and then we do nothing else? and then the next two ifs will run? \n        # But if we updated the left, then s1>s2? then the next if (s1 < s2) is false, and then the next if (s2 < s1) is true? then we update the right? \n        # That would be updating two candies? \n\n But we don't want to update two candies in one iteration? \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        # update the left if available, and then break the iteration? by using a continue? \n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue   # skip the next two ifs? \n        else:\n            # if no left, then update the right? \n            if p2 >= p1:   # but p1>p2, so this is false? \n                pass\n            # then we break? \n            # or we can break the loop? \n            # But we are not allowed to break? \n            # How about we do nothing? then we are stuck? \n            # But the condition will fail next time? \n            pass\n\n But then we have the next two ifs? \n\n We are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n After careful thought, the intended solution is to record the total when s1==s2, and then update one of the pointers to break the tie? and then let the next conditions update the other pointer if necessary? but that might update two candies in one iteration? \n\n But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is 200000, so we can do at most 200000 iterations? and updating two candies in one iteration might be acceptable? \n\n However, we must ensure we don't take the same candy twice. \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        # update the left if there is any candy on the left that hasn't been taken and also the right hasn't taken the same candy? \n        # But we have pointers: p1 and p2. We are going to update the left: take candy at p1, then p1 increases. Then in the same iteration, we then update the right: take candy at p2? but that candy is not the same as the one we just took? because p1 and p2 are distinct until we have taken the last candy? \n\n Example: [1,2,1] at the beginning: \n   p1=0, p2=2: we record 0, then we update the left: p1 becomes 1, then we update the right: p2 becomes 1. Then we have taken two candies: index0 and index2. Then in the next iteration, we have p1=1, p2=1: we record 2, then we update the left: take index1 -> p1=2, then we update the right: take index1? but p2=1, so we take l[1]? but that is the same as the candy at index1? \n\n So we are taking the middle candy twice? \n\n Therefore, we must not update both in the same iteration? \n\n How about after we update the left in the s1==s2 block, we then break the iteration? and let the next iteration handle the right? \n\n We can use 'continue' to skip the next two ifs? \n\n But the problem says: we can only fill in the missing block? and we are allowed to write any code there? \n\n So we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue   # skip the next two ifs in this iteration\n        else:\n            # if there is no left candy, then we break the tie by updating the right? \n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n            continue\n\n But then we skip the next two ifs? \n\n But the existing code has two ifs after the missing block. We want to skip them? \n\n However, the continue will skip the rest of the loop body and go to the next iteration.\n\n This is acceptable? \n\n Let's test with [1,2,1]:\n   Iteration1: p1=0, p2=2, s1=0, s2=0.\n        s1==s2 -> record 0, then update left: s1=1, p1=1, then continue.\n   Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2, condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n        then check s1 < s2? no.\n        then check s2 < s1? yes -> update right: s2=1, p2=1.\n   Iteration3: p1=1, p2=1, condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record 2 (because p1=1 -> Alice has eaten 1 candy, and Bob has eaten 1 candy: total=2).\n        then update left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2, then continue.\n   Iteration4: p1=2, p2=1, condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n        s1=3, s2=1 -> not equal.\n        then s1 < s2? no.\n        then s2 < s1? yes -> update right: but p2=1, so we take l[1]? -> s2=1+2=3, p2=0.\n        Then next iteration: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n        Then we print l2[-1] = 2.\n\n That matches.\n\n But what if we have [1,1]?\n   Iteration1: p1=0, p2=1, s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then update left: s1=1, p1=1, continue.\n   Iteration2: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n        then update right: s2=1, p2=0.\n   Iteration3: p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true? 0-1<=0 -> -1<=0 true.\n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total = 1 (Alice: [0]) + (n-1-0) = 2-1-0=1 -> total=2? \n        Actually, Alice has eaten 1 candy (index0), Bob has eaten 1 candy (index1) -> total=2.\n        Then we update: we try to update left? but p1=1 is at the end? so we do the else: update right? but p2=0 -> we take l[0]? but that is the same as Alice's candy? \n        Actually, we have an array of two: [1,1]. \n        p1=1: so we try to take l[1]? but that is the second candy? which is already taken by Bob? \n\n How do we avoid that? \n\n In the s1==s2 block, we check if p1<=p2? \n   In iteration3: p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2 -> so we do the else: update the right? \n        s2 += l[p2] = l[0] = 1 -> s2=1+1=2, p2 becomes -1? \n        Then we continue.\n\n Then next iteration: condition: p1=1, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break.\n\n Then we print l2[-1] = 2.\n\n But the total candies eaten when we recorded was 2? and that is correct.\n\n However, we are updating the right even though the candy at p2=0 has already been taken by Alice? \n\n How did we get p2=0? In iteration2, we updated the right: we did p2=1 -> then we took the candy at index1? and then p2 becomes 0? meaning the next candy on the right is at index0? but that candy was already taken by Alice? \n\n This is a problem: we are using pointers that move inward. We should only take candies that are between p1 and p2 (inclusive) that haven't been taken? \n\n Actually, the state is:\n   Alice has taken candies [0, p1-1]\n   Bob has taken candies [p2+1, n-1]\n\n So the available candies are [p1, p2]. \n\n Therefore, in iteration3: the available candies are [1,0] -> which is empty? because 1>0. So we should not take any candy? \n\n But our condition (p1-1<=p2) is 0<=0 -> true. \n\n How about we change the condition in the s1==s2 block to only update if p1<=p2? meaning there is at least one candy available? \n\n But in iteration3, p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2, so we don't update? then we break the iteration? and then the next two ifs are skipped? \n\n Then we break the loop? \n\n But then we have recorded 2, which is correct.\n\n So the plan for the missing block in program1.py:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            # There is at least one candy available? \n            # We break the tie by taking the left candy? \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            # If there is no candy available, we break the tie by taking a candy from the right? but there is none? \n            # Actually, if p1>p2, then there is no candy left? so we break the tie by doing nothing? \n            # But we must break the loop? \n            # We can break the loop? \n            # But the condition will break next time? \n            # We do nothing? \n            continue   # skip the next two ifs? \n\n But note: if we do nothing and then continue, then we skip the next two ifs? and then we go to the next iteration? and then the condition (p1-1<=p2) might be false? then we break.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the loop? \n\n But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n How about we do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            # force break the loop? \n            # We can set p1 to a value that will break the condition? \n            p1 = p2+2   # then next time: p1-1 = p2+1 > p2 -> false.\n            break   # but break is not allowed? \n            # or we can set s1 and s2 to a state that will break the condition? \n            # But we want to break the loop? \n            # Alternatively, we can break? \n            break\n\n But the problem says: we can only fill in the missing block? \n\n However, the problem does not specify that we cannot use break? \n\n But note: the existing code has a while loop. We are allowed to break? \n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n We are only outputting the block for the if s1==s2.\n\n We decide to break the loop when there is no candy left? \n\n How about:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n But then we break the loop? and the next two ifs are skipped? and we break the loop? \n\n But the problem: after we break, we then print l2[-1]. \n\n In the [1,1] example: \n   Iteration1: p1=0, p2=1 -> s1=0, s2=0: record 0, then update left: s1=1, p1=1, then continue.\n   Iteration2: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n        then update the right: s2=1, p2=0.\n   Iteration3: p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=1: record 2, then check: p1<=p2? 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n        Then we break the loop and print 2.\n\n That works.\n\n But what if we have [1,2,3]? \n   We want: \n        Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [3] -> 3 -> not equal.\n        Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [3] -> 3 -> equal -> total=3 candies.\n\n   Steps:\n        Start: p1=0, p2=2: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then update left: s1=1, p1=1, continue.\n        Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2: s1=1, s2=0 -> update right: s2=3, p2=1.\n        Iteration3: p1=1, p2=1: condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n                s1=1, s2=3 -> update left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2.\n        Iteration4: p1=2, p2=1: condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n                s1=3, s2=3 -> record: total = 2 (Alice: [0,1]) + (n-1-1)= (3-1-1)=1 -> total=3.\n                then check: p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2 -> break.\n\n        Then output 3.\n\n   But wait, Bob has eaten only one candy (index2) and Alice has eaten two candies (index0 and index1). That matches.\n\n   However, in iteration3: after we update the left, we then break the iteration? and then in iteration4 we have s1=3, s2=3.\n\n   But in iteration3: after updating the left, we did not continue? because we did not have s1==s2? \n\n   Actually, in iteration3: we did not have s1==s2? we had s1=1, s2=3 -> then we updated the left? and then we did not break the iteration? we then checked the next if: s1=3, s2=3 -> then we would have done the s1==s2 block? but we are in the same iteration? \n\n   But the code for iteration3: \n        We are in the loop: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition true.\n        s1=1, s2=3 -> not equal? \n        then we check: s1< s2 -> true -> update left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2.\n        then we check: s2< s1? 3<3 -> false.\n        then we break the iteration? \n        Then iteration4: p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n        then we check s1==s2: 3==3 -> record and break.\n\n   So we do get the record.\n\n   But in the s1==s2 block, we break the tie by updating the left and then continue? so we skip the next two ifs? \n\n   In iteration4: we do the s1==s2 block: we record 3, then we break because p1>p2.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   But note: the continue is only needed if we update the left? to skip the next two ifs? because we have already updated. And if we break, we break the loop.\n\n   However, if we break, we break the entire while loop? and then we don't do the next test cases? \n\n   But the break only breaks the inner while loop? and then we print l2[-1] and then move to the next test case.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   But what if we don't break in the else? we could do:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            # we break the loop? \n            # But we can also set the pointers to break the condition? \n            # How about we set p1 = n+10? then the condition will break? \n            # But we can break? \n            break\n\n   We choose to break.\n\n   But note: if we break, we break the while loop and then we output the last recorded value? which is the one we just recorded? and that is the maximum? \n\n   So we break.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if there are more candies? but we break the tie and then break the loop? \n\n   But if p1>p2, there are no more candies? so we break.\n\n   So the code for program1.py missing block is:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n But note: the variable name is `l` (list) and we are using `l[p1]`. \n\n But what if p1 is out of bounds? we check p1<=p2, and p2 is at least p1? and p1 is in the range [0, n-1]? because initially p1=0, and we increment until p1<=p2 and p2 starts at n-1. So it's safe.\n\n Now for program2.py:\n\n The problem: for a given n, find four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\n The provided code:\n\n   for _ in range(int(input())):\n        a=int(input())\n        if a%4==0:\n            print(a//4,a//4,a//4,a//4)\n        else:\n            if a%2==1:\n                a1=(a-1)\n                if a1%3==0:\n                    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    print(a1//4,a1//2,a1//4,1)\n\n            else:\n                a1=a-2\n                print(a1//2-1,a1//2+1,1,1)\n\n We need to fill in the TODO.\n\n The examples:\n\n   n=4: 1,1,1,1 -> handled by a%4==0.\n   n=7: 2,2,2,1 -> handled by the else: a%2==1 -> a1=6, then 6%3==0 -> so 2,2,2,1.\n   n=8: 2,2,2,2 -> handled by a%4==0? 8%4==0 -> 2,2,2,2.\n   n=9: 2,4,2,1 -> how? \n        a1 = 9-1 = 8 -> then 8%4==0 -> so we print 8//4=2, 8//2=4, 8//4=2, 1 -> 2,4,2,1 -> matches.\n   n=10: 3,5,1,1 -> \n        a%4=10%4=2 -> not 0 -> then a%2=0 -> so we go to the else: \n            a1=10-2=8 -> then print 8//2-1=3, 8//2+1=5, 1,1 -> 3,5,1,1 -> matches.\n\n   But what about n=5? \n        a=5: a%2=1 -> a1=4.\n        then 4%3 !=0 -> then we go to the TODO block? and then the next condition: 4%4==0 -> but we skip because we are in the elif? \n\n        Actually, the structure:\n\n            if a1%3==0: ... \n            elif a1%4!=0: ...   # TODO\n            elif a1%4==0: ...\n\n        So for a1=4: \n            4%3 !=0 -> so we enter the TODO block.\n\n        We need to find four positive integers for n=5: a+b+c+d=5, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n        Possibilities: \n          We can try: \n            a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2 -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal.\n            a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> equal. \n            So 1,2,1,1 -> sum=5.\n\n        How to generate this? \n\n        The provided code for the TODO block: we are in the case where a is odd (so n is odd) and a1 = n-1 is divisible by 4? not necessarily? we are in the block where a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            if a1%3==0: ... \n            elif a1%4 !=0: ...   # TODO\n            elif a1%4==0: ...\n\n        So for n=5: a1=4 -> 4%4==0, so we skip the TODO and go to the next elif? \n\n        But wait: the condition is \"elif a1%4!=0\", so for a1=4, 4%4==0 -> false, so we skip the TODO and go to the next elif: a1%4==0 -> true -> then we print 4//4=1, 4//2=2, 4//4=1, 1 -> 1,2,1,1 -> which is the solution.\n\n        So why is there a TODO block? \n\n        The condition: \n            if a1%3==0: \n            elif a1%4!=0:   # TODO\n            elif a1%4==0: \n\n        This means the TODO block is for the case when a1 is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4? \n\n        Example: n=7: we handled by a1%3==0 -> 6%3==0 -> so we skip the TODO.\n\n        n=9: a1=8 -> 8%3 !=0 -> then 8%4==0 -> so we skip the TODO and go to the next elif.\n\n        n=11: a1=10 -> 10%3 !=0, 10%4 !=0 (because 10 mod4=2) -> so we enter the TODO.\n\n        We need to find a solution for n=11.\n\n        We need: a+b+c+d=11, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n        We can try: \n          We know that we have one 1 at the end? because we subtracted 1? but the code for the other cases: \n            when a1%3==0: we did (a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1)\n            when a1%4==0: we did (a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1)  -> note: a1//4 + a1//2 + a1//4 + 1 = a1//4*2 + a1//2 + 1 = a1//2 + a1//2 + 1? -> 2*(a1//4) + a1//2 = a1? then +1 -> a1+1 = n? so that works.\n\n          But for a1%4 !=0 and a1%3 !=0, we are in the TODO.\n\n        How about we try to set d=1? then we have a+b+c = 10, and we want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,1)=c.\n\n        So we need gcd(a,b)=c.\n\n        We can set a and b such that gcd(a,b)=c, and a+b+c=10? and then d=1.\n\n        We can try: \n          Let c=1: then gcd(a,b)=1, and a+b=9. We can choose a=2, b=7 -> gcd(2,7)=1 -> works. \n          So 2,7,1,1 -> sum=11.\n\n        How about c=2: then gcd(a,b)=2, and a+b=8. We can choose a=2, b=6 -> gcd(2,6)=2 -> works. \n          So 2,6,2,1 -> sum=11.\n\n        How about c=3: then gcd(a,b)=3, and a+b=7. We can choose a=3, b=4 -> gcd(3,4)=1 -> not 3. \n          a=3, b=3 -> gcd=3 -> works: 3,3,3,1 -> sum=10? then d=1 -> total=10? but we need 11? \n          Actually, a+b+c = 3+3+3 = 9, then d=1 -> 10, but we need 10? but n=11 -> a+b+c+d=11 -> so a+b+c=10. \n          So for c=3: a+b=7, and gcd(a,b)=3. We can choose a=3, b=4 -> gcd=1 -> no. a=6, b=1 -> gcd=1 -> no. \n          a=3, b=3 -> gcd=3 -> but 3+3=6, then c=3 -> 6+3=9, then d=1 -> 10, but we need 10? but 10+1=11? -> 3+3+3+1=10? -> no, 10. \n\n        We need a+b+c=10. So for c=3: a+b=7. We need two numbers that sum to 7 and have gcd=3. \n          The numbers must be multiples of 3? 3 and 4 -> 4 is not multiple. 6 and 1 -> 1 not multiple. 3 and 3 -> 3+3=6, not 7. \n          So no.\n\n        c=4: then gcd(a,b)=4, a+b=6. We can choose a=2, b=4 -> gcd=2 -> no. a=4, b=2 -> same. a=4, b=4 -> 4+4=8>6. \n          a=4, b=2 -> not gcd=4. \n          a=4, b=0 -> not positive.\n\n        c=5: then gcd(a,b)=5, a+b=5. We can choose a=5, b=0 -> not positive. a=2, b=3 -> gcd=1. \n\n        So the easiest: c=1: then we can choose any a and b that are coprime and sum to 9. \n          We can choose a=1, b=8 -> gcd(1,8)=1 -> works: 1,8,1,1 -> sum=11.\n          But note: the problem says positive integers, so 1 is allowed.\n\n        But the problem: we have a1=10, and we are in the TODO block. We want to output (a,b,c,d) = (1,8,1,1) or (2,7,1,1) or (3,6,2,1) etc.\n\n        How to choose? \n\n        We can do: \n          c = 1\n          d = 1\n          then we need a+b = 9, and gcd(a,b)=1 (because lcm(1,1)=1).\n\n          We can choose a=1, b=8 -> gcd(1,8)=1 -> works.\n\n        But the problem: the example n=10: we did not use this method? we used the even branch.\n\n        So for the TODO block: \n          We can set d=1, and then we have a+b+c = a1 = n-1.\n          Then we set c=1, then we need a+b = a1-1, and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          We can set a=1, b = a1-2. Then gcd(1, a1-2)=1. \n\n          So the solution: (1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n          Example: n=11: a1=10 -> then (1, 10-2=8, 1, 1) -> 1+8+1+1=11, and gcd(1,8)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        But what if a1-2 is 0? but a1 = n-1, and n>=4 -> a1>=3 -> a1-2>=1.\n\n        So we can do: \n          print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1, a1-2, 1, 1 are all positive.\n\n        However, we must check: for n=5: a1=4 -> then we would print (1, 4-2=2, 1, 1) -> 1+2+1+1=5 -> and gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        But wait: for n=5, we are in the TODO block? \n          Actually, for n=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 !=0 -> then 4%4==0 -> so we skip the TODO and go to the next elif? \n\n        So the TODO block is only for a1 not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4? \n\n        Example: n=13: a1=12 -> 12%3==0 -> so we skip the TODO.\n\n        n=14: a1=13 -> 13%3=1 -> not 0, 13%4=1 -> not 0 -> so we enter the TODO.\n\n          Then we output: 1, 13-2=11, 1, 1 -> 1+11+1+1=14 -> works.\n\n        But what if we want a solution that doesn't use 1 for a and c? \n\n        The problem says: \"If there are several possible answers you can output any of them.\"\n\n        So we can output (1, a1-2, 1, 1).\n\n        Therefore, the code for the TODO block in program2.py is:\n\n            print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n        But wait: the variable is a1 = n-1? and we are in the block for odd n? \n\n        However, note: the structure:\n\n            if a%2==1:   # n is odd\n                a1 = a-1   # so a1 is even? \n                if a1%3==0: \n                    ...\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    ...\n\n        But note: a1 is even? because n is odd -> n-1 is even. \n\n        And a1-2 is even? so we are printing (1, even, 1, 1) -> that's fine.\n\n        But what if a1-2 is 0? but a1>=3 (because n>=4, so a1>=3) -> a1-2>=1.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        However, we must check: n=5: we don't enter this block? because a1=4 -> 4%4==0 -> so we go to the next elif and print (1,2,1,1) by the next block? \n\n        But we are in the TODO block only when a1%4 !=0? so for n=5 we skip.\n\n        So the TODO block is for odd n such that a1 (which is n-1) is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4? \n\n        Example: n=7: a1=6 -> 6%3==0 -> skip.\n        n=9: a1=8 -> 8%4==0 -> skip.\n        n=11: a1=10 -> 10%3=1, 10%4=2 -> so we enter.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n And the output format: json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n We must output the exact code for the two missing blocks.\n\n However, note: the program1.py has two missing blocks? Actually, only one: the block under \"if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n And program2.py has one missing block: the TODO.\n\n But note: the program2.py has an if-elif-elif chain, and we are to fill the elif a1%4!=0 block.\n\n So we write:\n\n   program1: \n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   program2:\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n But we must output in JSON.\n\n However, note: the code might have newlines? \n\n We output:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n            continue\\n        else:\\n            break\", \"program2\": \"        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"}\n\n But we must be cautious: the indentation must match the existing code.\n\n In program1.py, the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop? and the if s1==s2 is indented by 8, then the missing block should be indented by 12? \n\n But the existing code in the if s1==s2: has a comment \"# TODO: ...\", so we replace that with the block, and we must keep the same indentation.\n\n The existing code in program1.py:\n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):\n            if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n            if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n We are replacing the line with the TODO with the block.\n\n We write:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    break\n\n But note: the existing code has two ifs after. We are adding a continue to skip them? \n\n However, the problem says: we are to fill in the missing block. So we only output the block that replaces the TODO line.\n\n We output the block as:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n But we must indent it by 12? because the while loop is at 8, and the if is at 12? \n\n Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):\n            if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n            if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n We are replacing the first if line with the block. So we write:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                ... block ...\n\n But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing block? and the existing code has the if condition and then a comment. We replace that entire line with the block? \n\n Actually, the TODO is in the same line as the if. So we replace:\n\n            if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n with:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    break\n\n But then the next two ifs are still there? and we have an if block that might continue and skip them? \n\n That matches.\n\n But note: the existing code has two ifs that are at the same indentation as the if s1==s2. So we are replacing one line with a block.\n\n Therefore, the code for program1 is:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n\n But we must be careful: the existing code has the condition (p1-1<=p2) and then the if s1==s2. We are replacing the if s1==s2: ... (which was one line) with a block.\n\n However, the existing code for the if s1==s2 was only one line? and we are replacing it with a block? \n\n But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n So we output the block as a string.\n\n Similarly, for program2, we replace:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n with:\n\n            print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n But note: the existing code has:\n\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace the comment with the print statement.\n\n So the code for program2 is:\n\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n But we must indent it properly? the existing block is indented by 12? \n\n We output the string exactly as it should appear in the program.\n\n Therefore, the final answer:\n\n   program1: \n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n\n   program2:\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n But note: in program1, we are using the variable `l2` which is defined as an empty list at the beginning of the test case. And we are appending the total. Then at the end we print l2[-1]. \n\n And in program2, we are printing the four numbers.\n\n Now, we output in JSON.\n\n However, we must escape the newlines and quotes? \n\n But the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown.\n\n We can output:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"        if s1 == s2:\\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n            if p1 <= p2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n                continue\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n     \"program2\": \"        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n   }\n\n But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n However, note: in program1, the existing line that we are replacing is:\n\n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n We are replacing it with:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            ... (with the block)\n\n So we must include the \"if s1 == s2:\" line? \n\n But the TODO is on that line. \n\n How about we only output the block that is the body? \n\n The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n Since the existing code has the condition, we only need to provide the body? \n\n But the TODO is in the condition line. \n\n We decide: for program1, we replace the entire line that has the TODO with the block that starts with the condition and then the body? \n\n But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is in the condition. \n\n Alternatively, we can output:\n\n   program1: the block that goes in the body of the if? \n\n   But the existing code has:\n\n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   and then two other ifs. We want to replace the TODO with a block that is the body of the if? \n\n   So we output:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   and then the next two ifs remain.\n\n   But note: the body must be indented. \n\n   So the code for program1 is:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   This is a block of 5 lines, and we replace the TODO line with this block? \n\n   But then the condition \"if s1 == s2:\" is still there? and then we put this block as the body? \n\n   Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We remove the comment and put the block? \n\n   How? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But then the next two ifs are at the same level as the outer if? \n\n   That is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program1 the string:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But wait, we are replacing one line with 7 lines? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output only the body? \n\n   The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n   We decide to output the body (the block that is the replacement for the TODO) without the condition? \n\n   But the condition is already there. \n\n   The problem says: \"the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in\". \n\n   We are to fill in the block for the if s1==s2. \n\n   So we output the body of the if? \n\n   How about:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   This is 5 lines, and we put it as the body of the if.\n\n   Then the code becomes:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n\n   And then the next two ifs.\n\n   So we output for program1 the string:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   And for program2, we output:\n\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n   But note: in program2, the TODO is in a block that is already an elif, so we only need to output the body? \n\n   So we output the string for the body.\n\n   Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n            continue\\n        else:\\n            break\",\n     \"program2\": \"        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n   }\n\n But note: the program1 block must be indented? the existing if s1==s2 is at 8 spaces? then the body should be 12 spaces? \n\n We output the body with 8+4=12 spaces? \n\n In the string, we have:\n\n        \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n            continue\\n        else:\\n            break\"\n\n But the existing code for the if s1==s2 is at 8 spaces, and we are replacing the TODO with a block that is at 12 spaces? \n\n How many spaces are in the provided program1.py? \n\n   The while loop: 4 spaces? or 8? \n\n   The code:\n\n        I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n        for _ in range(I()[0]):\n            n=I()[0]\n            l=I()\n            l2=[]\n            s1,s2=0,0\n            p1,p2=0,n-1\n            while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition seems off. We want to traverse while p1 <= p2? But note: we are going to update p1 and p2 inside.\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n            print(l2[-1])\n\n   The while loop and the ifs are indented by 12 spaces? (because the for loop is 8, then the while is 12, then the ifs are 16? \n\n   Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n   Let me count:\n\n        for _ in ...:  -> level1: 4 spaces\n            n=I()[0]   -> 8 spaces\n            l=I()       -> 8\n            l2=[]       -> 8\n            s1,s2=0,0   -> 8\n            p1,p2=0,n-1 -> 8\n            while ...:   -> 8 spaces? \n                if ...   -> 12 spaces\n                if ...   -> 12\n                if ...   -> 12\n\n   So the while and the ifs are at 8 and 12? \n\n   The TODO line is at 12 spaces. We are replacing that line with a block that should be at 12 spaces for the outer if body? \n\n   But the body of the if s1==s2 should be at 16 spaces? \n\n   However, in our string for program1, we have:\n\n        \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n            continue\\n        else:\\n            break\"\n\n   The first line: 8 spaces? then the next if: 8 spaces? \n\n   But we want:\n\n        12 spaces: l2.append(...)\n        12 spaces: if p1<=p2:\n        16 spaces:    s1 += ...\n        16 spaces:    ...\n        12 spaces: else:\n        16 spaces:    break\n\n   How many spaces? \n\n   The existing code has 12 spaces for the if s1==s2 line. We are replacing that with:\n\n            if s1 == s2:   # this line is already there? but we are replacing the entire line? \n\n   We are not. We are only replacing the body? \n\n   The problem is ambiguous.\n\n   We decide: we are to fill in the missing block that goes in the TODO. The TODO is in the line:\n\n        12 spaces: if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace that line with:\n\n        12 spaces: if s1 == s2:\n        16 spaces:    l2.append(...)\n        16 spaces:    if p1 <= p2:\n        20 spaces:        ...\n        16 spaces:    else:\n        20 spaces:        ...\n\n   But the problem says: we are to output the missing code. \n\n   We output the block that is the body of the if s1==s2? \n\n   So we output:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   and we assume that the existing condition \"if s1 == s2:\" is kept, and then we put this block as the body (indented by 16 spaces).\n\n   But the next two ifs are at 12 spaces? so they are after the body? \n\n   Therefore, we output the string as:\n\n        \"        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n            continue\\n        else:\\n            break\"\n\n   with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n   But the existing code has 12 spaces for the if, so the body should be 16 spaces? \n\n   We need to output:\n\n        for the first line: 16 spaces: \"                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\"\n        then 16 spaces: \"                if p1 <= p2:\"\n        then 20 spaces: \"                    s1 += l[p1]\"\n        etc.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the exact indentation? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is to be inserted at the TODO.\n\n   We output the code as if it is at the same indentation level as the body of the while loop? \n\n   But the while loop body is at 12 spaces? and the if s1==s2 is at 12 spaces? and we are replacing the TODO with a block that is the body of the if, so it should be 16 spaces.\n\n   How many spaces are in the string? \n\n   We output the string with the exact indentation that should be in the program.\n\n   For program1, the block should be:\n\n        (12 spaces)if s1 == s2:\n        (16 spaces)    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        (16 spaces)    if p1 <= p2:\n        (20 spaces)        s1 += l[p1]\n        (20 spaces)        p1 += 1\n        (20 spaces)        continue\n        (16 spaces)    else:\n        (20 spaces)        break\n\n   But we are not outputting the condition? only the body? \n\n   We are only outputting the body? then the body should be:\n\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\n   and we will put it at 16 spaces.\n\n   So the string for program1 should have:\n\n        Line1: 16 spaces + \"l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\"\n        Line2: 16 spaces + \"if p1 <= p2:\"\n        Line3: 20 spaces + \"s1 += l[p1]\"\n        Line4: 20 spaces + \"p1 += 1\"\n        Line5: 20 spaces + \"continue\"\n        Line6: 16 spaces + \"else:\"\n        Line7: 20 spaces + \"break\"\n\n   But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we are not worried about performance? \n\n   We output the string with the exact spaces.\n\n   How many spaces per level? 4.\n\n   So:\n\n        Line1: 16 spaces: 4*4 = 16 -> \"                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\"\n        Line2: 16 spaces: \"                if p1 <= p2:\"\n        Line3: 20 spaces: \"                    s1 += l[p1]\"\n        Line4: \"                    p1 += 1\"\n        Line5: \"                    continue\"\n        Line6: \"                else:\"\n        Line7: \"                    break\"\n\n   But wait, the else should be at the same level as the if? so 16 spaces.\n\n   So the string for program1:\n\n        \"                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n                if p1 <= p2:\\n                    s1 += l[p1]\\n                    p1 += 1\\n                    continue\\n                else:\\n                    break\"\n\n   Similarly, for program2, the TODO is in:\n\n        (8 spaces)if a%2==1:\n        (12 spaces)    a1=(a-1)\n        (12 spaces)    if a1%3==0:\n        (16 spaces)        ...\n        (12 spaces)    elif a1%4!=0:\n        (16 spaces)        # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO line with:\n\n        (16 spaces)        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\n   So the string for program2: \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n\n   But wait, the existing code has 16 spaces for the body of the elif? \n\n   We output: \"        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\" with 16 spaces? \n\n   But the existing code has 8 spaces for the for loop, 12 for the if, 16 for the elif body.\n\n   So we output for program2: 16 spaces + the print statement? \n\n   But the string should be: \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\" -> 16 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem says: we are to output the missing code, and the missing code is the body of the elif.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n                if p1 <= p2:\\n                    s1 += l[p1]\\n                    p1 += 1\\n                    continue\\n                else:\\n                    break\",\n     \"program2\": \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n   }\n\n But note: the program1 string has 7 lines? and program2 has 1 line.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n We output the JSON.\n\n But the JSON string must be escaped? \n\n We are in a text response, so we output the JSON as a string.\n\n Alternatively, we can output without newlines? but the problem does not specify.\n\n We output the JSON with the newlines as \\n.\n\n But the example output format is a JSON string.\n\n Let me write the JSON:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n                if p1 <= p2:\\n                    s1 += l[p1]\\n                    p1 += 1\\n                    continue\\n                else:\\n                    break\", \"program2\": \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"}\n\n But this is a long string.\n\n We'll output that.\n\n However, note: in program1, we have a variable `l2` that we are appending to. And at the end we print l2[-1]. This will work because we record every time we have an equal sum, and the last one is the maximum.\n\n But what if there is no equal sum? then l2 is empty? and we print l2[-1] -> error.\n\n We must ensure there is at least one element? \n\n The problem says: it is always possible to have at least the trivial solution of 0 candies? but the problem says they eat at least one candy? \n\n But the problem says: \"They want to be fair\" and \"the most number of candies\". \n\n And the note: for the first test case, the answer is 2.\n\n In the worst case, they might not be able to eat any candy? but the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (including 0) and Bob from the right (including 0). But then they eat 0+0=0, which is fair. So we always have 0.\n\n So l2 will have at least 0.\n\n Therefore, it is safe.\n\n We output the JSON."
