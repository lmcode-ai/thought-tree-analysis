Rethink the example: \n    \"After that we can obtain a copy where all elements are equal with 2 operations: \n        Operation 1: clone the array -> now we have two copies: [0,-2,3,-4] and [0,-2,3,-4]\n        Operation 2: swap the -2 in the first array with the 0 in the second array? Then we get: [0,0,3,-4] and [-2,-2,3,-4] -> but then the first array is not all equal.

Therefore, we can iterate over distinct numbers in each test case and the total distinct numbers is <= 10^5. So the code is efficient. But note: what if n=0? The problem says n>=1. Therefore, we write:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import Counter\n            cnt = Counter(a)\n            ans = 10**18\n            for f in cnt.values():\n                k = (n + f - 1) // f\n                ops = (k-1) + (n - f) if ops < ans:\n                    ans = ops\n            print(ans)\n\n    However, note: we are iterating over the distinct numbers, and for each distinct number we use the frequency f.\n\n    But wait: what if there is a very frequent number? For example, if f is large, then k=ceil(n/f) is small. But note: if f is large, then n-f is small. We can test with n=100000, f=50000: \n        k = ceil(100000/50000)=2 -> ops = 1 + (100000-50000)=50001.

So f(j,i) = \n                sign = 1 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] > 0 -> then value = (i-j)\n                sign = 0 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] == 0 -> then value = 0\n                sign = -1 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] < 0 -> then value = -(i-j) So: f(j,i) = (i-j) * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])\n\n            Then: \n                dp[i] = max_{j} { dp[j] + (i-j) * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) }\n\n            But note: we cannot iterate j from 0 to i for each i, because that would be O(n^2) and total n=500000 -> worst-case 500000^2 = 250e9, too high. We need a faster way. Rearranged:\n\n            dp[i] = max_{j} {\n                dp[j] - j * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])   +   i * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])\n            } = i * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) + (dp[j] - j * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]))\n\n        But note: sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) can be 1, 0, or -1. So we have three cases: Case 1: prefix[i] > prefix[j] -> then term = i*1 + (dp[j]-j*1) = i + (dp[j]-j) Case 2: prefix[i] == prefix[j] -> then term = i*0 + (dp[j]-j*0) = dp[j]\n            Case 3: prefix[i] < prefix[j] -> then term = i*(-1) + (dp[j]-j*(-1)) = -i + (dp[j]+j) Therefore:\n\n            dp[i] = max( \n                max_{j: prefix[j] < prefix[i]} { i + dp[j] - j },\n                max_{j: prefix[j] == prefix[i]} { dp[j] },\n                max_{j: prefix[j] > prefix[i]} { -i + dp[j] + j }\n            )\n\n        We can then use data structures to compute these maxima quickly. We note: we are iterating i from 0 to n (with dp[0]=0). We need to update and query:",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to complete two Python programs, `program1.py` and `program2.py`, such that when `program1.py` is piped into `program2.py`, the combined output is correct for the respective problem descriptions.\n\n### Solution for `program1.py`\nThe problem involves processing multiple queries to determine the maximum total value of items received for free when a customer purchases at least `x` items, with the `y` cheapest items being free. The solution involves:\n1. **Sorting and Prefix Sum Array**: The prices are sorted in descending order, and a prefix sum array is constructed to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray.\n2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the solution calculates the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the top `x` most expensive items using the prefix sum array. The result is derived by subtracting the prefix sum at `x-y` from the prefix sum at `x`.\n\n### Solution for `program2.py`\nThe problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to make an array `b` strictly increasing, where each operation can add or subtract a fixed value `a_i` to/from `b_i`. The solution involves:\n1. **Iterating Over Possible Centers**: For each element in the array, treat it as the center (set to 0) and compute the operations needed for the left and right parts.\n2. **Left Part Processing**: For elements to the left of the center, compute the largest multiple of `a_i` that is less than the next right element. The multiplier is calculated using floor division.\n3. **Right Part Processing**: For elements to the right of the center, compute the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is greater than the previous element. The multiplier is derived using integer division.\n4. **Minimizing Operations**: Track the minimum operations across all possible centers.\n\n### Code Implementation\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    x,y=Y()\\n    O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if t < 0:\\n            d = 0\\n        else:\\n            d = (t // k) + 1\\n        p += abs(d)\\n        t = d * k\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **program1.py**: The missing line reads each query, computes the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the top `x` items using the prefix sum array `s`, and appends the result to the output list.\n- **program2.py**: The missing block processes elements to the right of the current center. If the previous element is negative, the current element can be set to 0 (cost 0). Otherwise, it calculates the smallest positive multiplier such that the current element exceeds the previous element, updates the total operations, and sets the new value for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves both problems by leveraging sorting, prefix sums, and careful iteration with optimal operation selection.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are guaranteed that the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can process each test case in O(n) or O(n log n) without issues.\n\nObservation:\nWe are allowed two operations:\n  1. Clone an existing array (costs 1 operation).\n  2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same) at any positions (each swap costs 1 operation).\n\nWe want to create at least one copy that has all elements equal.\n\nNote: We start with one array.\n\nLet the target copy have all elements equal to x. We can choose x arbitrarily (it must be present in the original array? Actually, note: we can only swap existing elements. So x must be an element that appears in the original array? But note: we can swap arbitrarily between copies and we can clone. However, we cannot create new numbers. So the entire multiset of numbers we have is fixed (the original array, and then we clone, but we don't get new numbers). Therefore, the value x must be one that appears in the original array.\n\nBut note: we can also use the same element multiple times in the same array by swapping from different copies. However, we cannot create a new element. So x must be an element that is present in the original array.\n\nNow, how do we form an array of all x?\n\nWe can think: we start with the original array. We can clone and then swap. We are allowed to do as many swaps as we want (each swap is one operation). Also, we can clone as many times as we want (each clone is one operation).\n\nWe note that we can use multiple copies to gather the same element. Specifically, we can use the copies to hold the non-x elements and then take the x's from them to put into one copy.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So if we have k copies (including the original) then we have k*n positions. We can rearrange arbitrarily? However, the entire multiset of numbers is fixed: it is the original array repeated k times.\n\nTherefore, to have one copy that is all x, we must have at least n copies of x in the entire multiset? Actually, we have k copies of the original array. So the total frequency of x is k * (original frequency of x). We need at least n copies of x to fill one array. Therefore, we require:\n    k * freq(x) >= n   =>   k >= ceil(n / freq(x))\n\nBut note: we start with one copy. We need k-1 clone operations (each clone is one operation). Then we need to do swaps to rearrange. How many swaps?\n\nIn the entire multiset, we have k * n elements. We want to assign one array to be all x. We need to gather n copies of x for that array. How many x's are available? k * freq(x). We need to take n of them and put them in the target array. But note: the target array initially (if we start with one of the copies) has some x's and some non-x's. We can swap the non-x's in the target array with x's from other arrays.\n\nHow many swaps? We need to replace the non-x's in the target array. The target array initially has (n - initial_x_in_target) non-x's. For each non-x, we need to swap it with an x from another array. However, note that we might have to do multiple swaps per non-x? Actually, we can do one swap per non-x: swap a non-x in the target with an x from another array. But note: what if the other array doesn't have an x? Then we might need to swap multiple times? However, we are allowed to swap arbitrarily between any two arrays. So we can plan:\n\nWe have k copies. We are going to use one as the target. The other k-1 copies are sources. The entire multiset has k * freq(x) x's. The target array initially has, say, c0 x's. Then we need n - c0 x's to complete the target. We can take these from the other copies. But note: the other copies might also be used to hold non-x's that we remove from the target? Actually, we don't care about the other copies: we just need to get n x's in the target.\n\nHowever, we must not break the condition that we are only swapping. Each swap moves two elements: one from the target and one from another array. So we can remove a non-x from the target and put an x from another array into the target. But then we leave the other array with an extra non-x. That is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the number of swaps required is the number of non-x's in the target array that we have to replace. But note: we can choose which copy to use as the target. We would choose the one that already has the most x's? Actually, we can rearrange arbitrarily the entire multiset. The minimal number of swaps is actually independent of which copy we choose? Because we can reassign arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we need to have n x's in one array. The entire multiset has k * freq(x) x's. We can assign the n x's to the target array. The rest of the x's are distributed arbitrarily. The number of swaps needed is the number of non-x's that are currently in the target array? But we can choose the target array arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose any copy to be the target. So we can choose the copy that already has the most x's? However, we are allowed to do swaps arbitrarily. So we can also move x's from the target array to other arrays? That would be counterproductive.\n\nActually, we are free to rearrange arbitrarily. Therefore, the minimal number of swaps required is: \n    n - (the maximum number of x's we can have in the target array without any swaps) \nBut note: we can also bring x's from other arrays. However, we cannot exceed the total available x's. The target array must have n x's. The entire multiset has k * freq(x) x's. So we can only form the target if k * freq(x) >= n.\n\nBut note: we are going to use k copies. We can choose k arbitrarily (as long as k>=ceil(n/freq(x))). However, we want to minimize the total operations: \n    operations = (k-1) [for cloning] + (number of swaps)\n\nWhat is the number of swaps? \n\nWe start with one copy. Then we clone k-1 times. Then we have k copies. Now we do swaps. How many swaps? \n\nWe need to assign n x's to the target array. The entire multiset has k * freq(x) x's. We can assign n of them to the target. The rest of the arrays can be arbitrary. The minimal number of swaps is the minimal number of swaps to get n x's in the target array. \n\nBut note: we can also swap between non-target arrays arbitrarily. However, we can also use the target array to swap with any other array. \n\nWe can think: we have k copies. We are going to use one as the target. Initially, the target array has some x's (say c0). Then we need to bring n - c0 x's from other arrays. But note: we can also swap non-x's from the target array to other arrays and bring x's from other arrays. However, each swap can bring one x to the target and remove one non-x from the target. Therefore, we need exactly (n - c0) swaps? \n\nBut wait: what if we have to move an x from the target array to another array? That would be counterproductive. Actually, we don't want to do that. We only want to bring x's in. So the minimal number of swaps is n - (the initial number of x's in the target array). However, we can choose the target array arbitrarily. So we can choose the copy that has the maximum number of x's? But note: we are going to clone the original array. So all copies are initially the same? \n\nWait: the problem says we start with one array. Then we clone: when we clone, we get an identical copy. Then we can swap arbitrarily. So initially, every copy is the same as the original. Therefore, every copy has the same frequency of x: namely, the frequency of x in the original array, say f.\n\nTherefore, the target array initially has f x's. Then we need to bring n - f x's from other arrays. But note: we have k copies. The total x's available is k * f. We are going to use n of them in the target. The remaining (k-1) copies can have at most (k-1)*f x's? Actually, we can take as many as we want from the other copies? But we must leave at least 0 in each. \n\nHowever, we can take up to the entire x's from the other copies. The other copies have (k-1)*f x's. We need n - f x's. Therefore, we require that (k-1)*f >= n - f  => k*f >= n, which is the condition we already have.\n\nSo the number of swaps required is n - f (because we start with f in the target and we need to bring n-f from elsewhere). \n\nBut wait: what if we can get some x's from other copies without having to swap every non-x? Actually, we are going to swap each non-x in the target with an x from another copy. So the number of swaps is the number of non-x's in the target? The target initially has n elements, of which f are x's, so non-x's are n - f. Therefore, we need n - f swaps.\n\nTherefore, total operations = (k-1) [clones] + (n - f) [swaps] = (k-1) + (n - f).\n\nBut note: k = ceil(n / f). So we have:\n    total_ops = ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f\n\nHowever, let's test with the example: \n    Example 1: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6). We choose x=0? \n        f = frequency(0) = 2.\n        k = ceil(6/2)=3.\n        total_ops = (3-1) + (6-2) = 2 + 4 = 6. -> matches.\n\n    Example 2: [0] (n=1). Then f=1, k=ceil(1/1)=1 -> total_ops = 0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 3: [1,1] (n=2). Then f=2, k=ceil(2/2)=1 -> total_ops = 0 + (2-2)=0 -> correct.\n\n    Example 4: [1,2] (n=2). We can choose x=1? f=1 -> k=ceil(2/1)=2 -> total_ops = (2-1) + (2-1)=1+1=2.\n        Alternatively, choose x=2: f=1 -> same.\n\n        How to do: \n          Start: [1,2] \n          Clone: [1,2] and [1,2] -> 1 op.\n          Swap: swap the 2 in the first array with the 1 in the second array: then we have [1,1] and [2,2] -> 1 swap -> total 2 ops.\n\n    Example 5: [1,2,3] (n=3). Choose x=1: f=1 -> k=ceil(3/1)=3 -> total_ops = 2 + (3-1)=4.\n        How to do:\n          Start: [1,2,3]\n          Clone twice: now we have 3 copies: [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3] -> 2 ops.\n          We need to get one array to be [1,1,1]. \n          We can do:\n            Swap the 2 in the first array with the 1 in the second array: \n                [1,1,3], [2,2,3], [1,2,3] -> 1 swap.\n            Swap the 3 in the first array with the 1 in the third array:\n                [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,2,3] -> 2 swaps.\n          Total swaps: 2, so total operations: 2 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 4.\n\n    But wait: is there a better way? \n        We could do:\n          Start: [1,2,3]\n          Clone: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3] -> 1 op.\n          Swap the 2 in the first with the 1 in the second: [1,1,3] and [2,2,3] -> 1 swap.\n          Then clone the first array: [1,1,3], [1,1,3], [2,2,3] -> 2 clones (so 2 clone ops total) and 1 swap.\n          Then swap the 3 in the first array with the 1 in the third array? But the third array doesn't have a 1? \n          Alternatively, swap the 3 in the first array with the 1 in the second array? Then we get [1,1,1] and [2,2,3] and [3,1,3] -> 2 swaps.\n          Total: 2 clones and 2 swaps -> 4.\n\n    So it matches.\n\nHowever, note: we are allowed to do swaps arbitrarily between any two arrays. But we don't have to fix the target array from the beginning. We can also use the fact that we can swap multiple times. But the above formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait: what if we choose a different x? We must try all distinct x that appear? However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of operations\". So we should choose the x that minimizes the total operations.\n\nTherefore, for each distinct number x that appears in the array, let f = frequency of x in the original array.\nWe require k = ceil(n / f). Then total operations = (k-1) + (n - f).\n\nBut note: k = ceil(n/f) = (n + f - 1) // f   [integer ceiling division].\n\nSo we can do:\n    ans = a big number\n    count = frequency counts of the array\n    for each distinct x in the array:\n        f = count[x]\n        k = (n + f - 1) // f\n        candidate = (k-1) + (n - f)\n        ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\nBut note: what if n is large? The distinct numbers are at most n, and total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can iterate over distinct numbers.\n\nHowever, note: the array can have negative numbers and zeros? But we are counting frequency, so that's fine.\n\nBut wait: what if we choose an x that does not appear in the array? We argued that we cannot. So we only consider x that appear.\n\nBut note: the example: [0, -2, 3, -4] -> the example output is 2? Actually, the example in the problem says the answer for the second test case is 2? But wait, the problem says:\n\n    \"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] ... and the answer is 6 operations.\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"For each test case output a single integer \u2014 the minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal.\"\n\nIn the example, the second test case is: \n    Input: n=4, [0, -2, 3, -4] -> output 2.\n\nBut according to our formula for [0,-2,3,-4] (n=4):\n\n    Let x=0: f=1 -> k = ceil(4/1)=4 -> operations = 3 + (4-1)=6 -> too high.\n    x=-2: f=1 -> 6\n    x=3: f=1 -> 6\n    x=-4: f=1 -> 6\n\nBut the example output is 2.\n\nSo what is happening? \n\nRethink the example: \n    \"After that we can obtain a copy where all elements are equal with 2 operations: \n        Operation 1: clone the array -> now we have two copies: [0,-2,3,-4] and [0,-2,3,-4]\n        Operation 2: swap the -2 in the first array with the 0 in the second array? \n            Then we get: [0,0,3,-4] and [-2,-2,3,-4] -> but then the first array is not all equal.\n\n    Alternatively, the example says: \n        \"the optimal partition is [0, -2, 3], [-4] ...\" -> that is for program1, not program2.\n\nWait, the problem statement for program2 is different. The example in the note for program2 is:\n\n    \"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\n     In the second test case ... the answer is 6 operations.\"\n\nBut the example input for the second test case in program2 is: \n    n=6, [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> which we computed as 6.\n\nBut the problem says: \n    \"The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\nAnd the example input for the second test case in the problem statement of program2 is: \n    \"The first test case: n=1, [0] -> output 0.\n     The second test case: n=6, [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> output 6.\"\n\nBut the sample input in the problem statement for program2 also says:\n\n    \"The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10000) ...\"\n\n    Then the sample input might be:\n        t=2\n        n=1: [0]\n        n=6: [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n\n    And the output: \n        0\n        6\n\nBut the note in the problem says: \n    \"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] ... and the answer is 6 operations.\"\n\nSo why then the example in the problem statement for program2 says: \n    \"For example, the second test case: n=4, [0,-2,3,-4] -> output 2\" ?\n\nWait, I see: the problem statement for program2 has two examples? Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n    \"In the first test case ... In the second test case ...\"\n\n    and then\n\n    \"Note: In the first test case ... In the second test case ...\"\n\n    But the note says: \n        \"Note: In the first test case ... In the second test case ...\"\n\n    And the second test case in the note is: \n        \"the optimal partition is [0, -2, 3], [-4] ...\" \n\n    That note is for program1, not program2.\n\nSo the example for program2 is the one with [0,1,3,3,7,0] and answer 6.\n\nBut the problem says: \n    \"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t ...\"\n\n    and then the sample input for program2 is:\n\n        t\n        then for each test case: n and the array.\n\n    The sample input that we must run is not provided in the note. The note only provided an example for program1.\n\n    However, the problem statement for program2 says: \n        \"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\"\n\n    So the first test case: [0] -> 0.\n\n    The second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> 6.\n\n    But then why the sample input in the problem statement for program2 also includes a test case with n=4 and [0,-2,3,-4]? \n\n    Actually, the problem statement for program2 does not mention that test case. The note that mentions [0,-2,3,-4] is for program1.\n\n    Therefore, we must assume that the formula we have is correct? But then why the example [0,-2,3,-4] in program1? \n\n    This is confusing. But note: the problem says \"program1.py\" and \"program2.py\" are two separate programs.\n\n    We are now writing program2.py.\n\n    However, the sample input for program2 in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input: \n            2\n            1\n            0\n            6\n            0 1 3 3 7 0\n\n        Output:\n            0\n            6\n\n    But the problem also says: \n        \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    Then we compute the frequency of each element.\n\n    Then for each distinct element x in a:\n        f = frequency of x\n        k = ceil(n / f)\n        candidate = (k-1) + (n - f)\n        ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\n    Then output ans.\n\nBut wait: what if the array is [0,0,0]? \n    n=3, f=3 -> k = ceil(3/3)=1 -> candidate = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct.\n\n    [1,2,1,2] (n=4): \n        x=1: f=2 -> k=ceil(4/2)=2 -> candidate = 1 + (4-2)=3.\n        x=2: f=2 -> candidate=3.\n        So answer=3.\n\n    How to do?\n        Start: [1,2,1,2]\n        Clone: [1,2,1,2] and [1,2,1,2] -> 1 op.\n        We want to make one array all 1: \n            We can swap the 2's in the first array with the 1's in the second array? \n            First array: swap the 2 at index1 with the 1 at index0 of the second array: \n                first: [1,1,1,2] -> not done.\n                second: [2,2,1,2] -> then swap the last 2 in the first array with the 1 in the second array: \n                first: [1,1,1,1] -> done.\n                second: [2,2,2,2] -> also done? \n            So we did 2 swaps -> total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n    So it matches.\n\nBut wait: what if we can do better? \n    We note: we don't necessarily have to do n-f swaps? \n\n    Consider: we have two copies. We can swap two pairs at once? But each swap is one operation. So 2 swaps are two operations.\n\n    However, the formula gives 3.\n\n    But the example [0,-2,3,-4] in the problem statement for program1? That was for program1. We are now in program2.\n\n    But the problem statement for program2 says: \n        \"The input consists of multiple test cases. ... It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n    And we have an example: \n        t=1, n=4, a = [0,-2,3,-4] -> what is the answer?\n\n        According to our formula:\n            distinct numbers: \n                0: f=1 -> candidate = ceil(4/1)-1 + (4-1) = 3+3=6\n                -2: 1 -> 6\n                3: 1 -> 6\n                -4: 1 -> 6\n            so answer=6.\n\n    But the problem statement for program2 does not provide an example with n=4 and [0,-2,3,-4]? \n\n    However, the problem statement for program1 does. But we are writing program2.\n\n    But wait: the problem says: \n        \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n    And then the description for program2 is the one we are solving.\n\n    Therefore, we assume the formula.\n\n    However, the sample input in the problem statement for program2 is:\n\n        Input: \n            2\n            1\n            0\n            6\n            0 1 3 3 7 0\n\n        Output:\n            0\n            6\n\n    So we output 0 and 6.\n\n    But wait: the problem statement for program2 also says:\n\n        \"Note: In the first test case ... In the second test case ...\"\n\n        and then it describes the example with [0,1,3,3,7,0] and 6 operations.\n\n    So our formula works for the provided examples.\n\n    However, we must consider: what if we can do better by not using the same x for the entire array? \n\n    But we argued that x must be an element that appears in the array.\n\n    And we are iterating over all distinct x.\n\n    Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import Counter\n            cnt = Counter(a)\n            ans = 10**18\n            for x, f in cnt.items():\n                k = (n + f - 1) // f   # ceil(n/f)\n                ops = (k-1) + (n - f)\n                if ops < ans:\n                    ans = ops\n            print(ans)\n\n    But wait: what if there is a possibility that we don't use a single x? We argued we must use an x that is in the array.\n\n    However, note: what if we use a value that is not in the array? Then we cannot form the array because we don't have that element. So we skip.\n\n    But we are iterating only over the distinct elements in the array.\n\n    But note: the problem says the array has integers, and we are counting the frequency of each element.\n\n    However, what if the array has negative numbers? Our formula still holds.\n\n    But wait: what if n=5, f=2: then k = ceil(5/2)=3, then ops = 2 + (5-2)=5.\n\n    How to do for [1,1,2,2,3] to make an array of 1's?\n        f=2, k=3 -> we need 3 copies.\n        Start: [1,1,2,2,3] \n        Clone twice: we have 3 copies: A, B, C.\n        We want to make A all 1's. \n            A initially has 2 ones. We need 5 ones. We can take ones from B and C.\n            How many ones are available? 3 copies * 2 = 6 ones. We need 5 for A.\n            We can swap:\n                Swap the 2 at index2 of A with a 1 from B: then A becomes [1,1,1,2,3] -> one swap.\n                Swap the 2 at index3 of A with a 1 from C: then A becomes [1,1,1,1,3] -> two swaps.\n                Swap the 3 at index4 of A with a 1 from B (if B still has one? but we took one from B already) -> \n                    After the first swap: \n                        A: [1,1,1,2,3] \n                        B: [2,1,2,2,3] -> then we can take the 1 from B at index1? \n                    Then swap the 2 at index3 of A with the 1 at index1 of B: \n                        A: [1,1,1,1,3]\n                        B: [2,2,2,2,3] -> then swap the 3 at index4 of A with the 1 from ... but wait, we don't have any more ones? \n                    Actually, we have 6 ones: \n                        Initially: 3 copies * 2 = 6 ones.\n                        We put 4 ones in A: then the other two ones are in B and C? \n                    We need one more one for A. We can take from C: \n                        Swap the 3 at index4 of A with the 1 at index0 of C: \n                        A: [1,1,1,1,1] -> done.\n                        C: [3,1,2,2,3] -> becomes [3,1,2,2,3] -> but we took one 1 from C? \n                    So we did 3 swaps? \n            But our formula said 5 operations: 2 clones and 3 swaps -> 5.\n\n        But wait: we did 3 swaps? Then total operations: 2 (clones) + 3 (swaps) = 5.\n\n        However, note: we could have done:\n            After the first two swaps, we have A: [1,1,1,1,3] and we need one more 1. But we have one 1 left in C. \n            But we can also swap the 3 in A with the 1 in C: that is the third swap.\n\n        So 3 swaps.\n\n        But our formula: n-f = 5-2 = 3 swaps -> so total operations = 2 (clones) + 3 (swaps) = 5.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n    But wait: what if we can do it in fewer swaps? \n\n    Consider: we have 3 copies. We can do:\n\n        Swap A[2] (which is 2) with B[0] (which is 1): \n            A: [1,1,1,2,3] \n            B: [2,1,2,2,3] -> then we have one 1 in B left? \n        Swap A[3] (which is 2) with B[1] (which is 1): \n            A: [1,1,1,1,3]\n            B: [2,2,2,2,3] -> then we have no 1 in B? \n        Then we need one more 1. We have one 1 in C: at C[0] and C[1]? \n        Swap A[4] (which is 3) with C[0] (which is 1): \n            A: [1,1,1,1,1] -> done.\n\n        That's 3 swaps.\n\n    So it's 3.\n\n    Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5. The distinct numbers in one test case can be up to n, but the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n    But note: the distinct numbers in one test case can be up to n, and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n    Actually, the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total number of elements is 10^5. Therefore, the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n    But note: distinct numbers per test case: the distinct numbers in one test case of length n is at most n. And the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n    Actually, no: if one test case has n1, another n2, ... and n1+n2+...<=10^5, then the distinct numbers in the first test case is at most n1, the second at most n2, etc. So the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5.\n\n    Therefore, we can iterate over distinct numbers in each test case and the total distinct numbers is <= 10^5.\n\n    So the code is efficient.\n\n    But note: what if n=0? The problem says n>=1.\n\n    Therefore, we write:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import Counter\n            cnt = Counter(a)\n            ans = 10**18\n            for f in cnt.values():\n                k = (n + f - 1) // f\n                ops = (k-1) + (n - f)\n                if ops < ans:\n                    ans = ops\n            print(ans)\n\n    However, note: we are iterating over the distinct numbers, and for each distinct number we use the frequency f.\n\n    But wait: what if there is a very frequent number? For example, if f is large, then k=ceil(n/f) is small. \n\n    But note: if f is large, then n-f is small. \n\n    We can test with n=100000, f=50000: \n        k = ceil(100000/50000)=2 -> ops = 1 + (100000-50000)=50001.\n\n    But if we choose a number with f=100000: \n        k=ceil(100000/100000)=1 -> ops = 0 + (100000-100000)=0.\n\n    So we are safe.\n\n    However, note: we must consider that k must be at least 1. And if f>=n, then k=1 and ops = n-f = negative? \n\n    But if f>=n, then the entire array is x? Then we don't need any operations: 0.\n\n    But note: the array has length n. If the entire array is x, then we already have one copy that is all x. So we don't need to do anything.\n\n    And our formula: \n        k = ceil(n/f) = ceil(n/n)=1 -> ops = (1-1) + (n-n)=0.\n\n    So it works.\n\n    Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            from collections import Counter\n            cnt = Counter(a)\n            ans = 10**18\n            for f in cnt.values():\n                k = (n + f - 1) // f\n                # But note: k must be at least 1, which it is.\n                ops = (k-1) + (n - f)\n                if ops < ans:\n                    ans = ops\n            print(ans)\n\n    However, wait: what if the array has duplicate distinct numbers? We are iterating over the frequencies. That is correct.\n\n    But note: what if the array is [1,2,3]? \n        f=1 for each.\n        k = ceil(3/1)=3 -> ops = 2 + (3-1)=4 for each distinct number -> ans=4.\n\n    But we can do better? \n\n    Actually, we can choose to use two different numbers? But no, the entire array must be one number.\n\n    So 4 is the answer.\n\n    But the problem says: \n        \"minimal number of operations\"\n\n    And we are iterating over all distinct numbers and taking the minimum.\n\n    So we are good.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but note that the worst-case distinct numbers per test case can be 10^5? Then one test case would have n=10^5 and distinct numbers 10^5? \n\n    But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so there is only one test case? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". So the worst-case is one test case with n=10^5.\n\n    Then we iterate 10^5 times in that test case. That is acceptable in Python? 10^5 iterations is acceptable.\n\n    Therefore, we output the code.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". The provided code for program2.py is:\n\n        if True:\n            from collections import Counter\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We must complete the TODO part.\n\n    So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        cnt = Counter(a)\n        ans = 10**18\n        for f in cnt.values():\n            k = (n + f - 1) // f\n            ops = (k-1) + (n - f)\n            if ops < ans:\n                ans = ops\n        print(ans)\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n    And the output format is: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n    We are only given program2.py? Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n    But we are only asked for program2.py? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly.\"\n\n    And we are to output both completions? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n    But we are only given one problem at a time? Actually, the problem has two parts: program1 and program2.\n\n    We have already written the solution for program2. What about program1?\n\n    We must also complete program1.py.\n\n    But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n    And we are to output both completions.\n\n    However, we have not been given the code for program1.py? \n\n    Actually, the problem statement for program1.py is:\n\n        Description: ... (the same as above for program1)\n\n        Code: ... (the provided code for program1.py)\n\n    We have the provided code for program1.py above.\n\n    We must complete program1.py.\n\n    How to solve program1?\n\n    Program1: \n        We are given an array a of n integers. We can partition the array into contiguous non-empty subarrays. The value of a subarray is:\n            (length) if the sum > 0\n            0 if the sum == 0\n            -(length) if the sum < 0.\n\n        We want the maximum sum of values over all partitions.\n\n        Constraints: \n            t test cases (1<=t<=500000) but the total n over test cases <= 500000.\n\n        Example: \n            [1,2,-3]: \n                partition: [1,2] and [-3]: \n                    [1,2]: sum=3>0 -> value=2\n                    [-3]: sum=-3<0 -> value=-1\n                    total=1.\n\n        Another: [0,-2,3,-4] -> partition: [0,-2,3] and [-4]: \n            [0,-2,3]: sum=1>0 -> value=3\n            [-4]: sum=-4<0 -> value=-1\n            total=2.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        We note: the total n over test cases <= 500000, so we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case? But note: the total n is 500000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n        We can use dynamic programming:\n\n            Let dp[i] = maximum total value we can get for the prefix a[0:i] (i elements).\n\n            Then we consider: the last segment is from j to i-1 (so j from 0 to i). Then:\n\n                dp[i] = max_{j in [0,i]} { dp[j] + f(j, i) }\n\n            where f(j,i) = \n                if sum(a[j:i]) > 0: (i-j)\n                if sum(a[j:i]) == 0: 0\n                if sum(a[j:i]) < 0: -(i-j)\n\n            But note: the segment sum = prefix[i] - prefix[j] (if we let prefix[0]=0, prefix[i]=a0+a1+...+a{i-1}).\n\n            So f(j,i) = \n                sign = 1 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] > 0 -> then value = (i-j)\n                sign = 0 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] == 0 -> then value = 0\n                sign = -1 if prefix[i]-prefix[j] < 0 -> then value = -(i-j)\n\n            So: f(j,i) = (i-j) * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])\n\n            Then: \n                dp[i] = max_{j} { dp[j] + (i-j) * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) }\n\n            But note: we cannot iterate j from 0 to i for each i, because that would be O(n^2) and total n=500000 -> worst-case 500000^2 = 250e9, too high.\n\n        We need a faster way.\n\n        Rearranged:\n\n            dp[i] = max_{j} {\n                dp[j] - j * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])   +   i * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j])\n            }\n\n            = i * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) + (dp[j] - j * sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]))\n\n        But note: sign(prefix[i]-prefix[j]) can be 1, 0, or -1.\n\n        So we have three cases:\n\n            Case 1: prefix[i] > prefix[j] -> then term = i*1 + (dp[j]-j*1) = i + (dp[j]-j)\n            Case 2: prefix[i] == prefix[j] -> then term = i*0 + (dp[j]-j*0) = dp[j]\n            Case 3: prefix[i] < prefix[j] -> then term = i*(-1) + (dp[j]-j*(-1)) = -i + (dp[j]+j)\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            dp[i] = max( \n                max_{j: prefix[j] < prefix[i]} { i + dp[j] - j },\n                max_{j: prefix[j] == prefix[i]} { dp[j] },\n                max_{j: prefix[j] > prefix[i]} { -i + dp[j] + j }\n            )\n\n        We can then use data structures to compute these maxima quickly.\n\n        We note: we are iterating i from 0 to n (with dp[0]=0).\n\n        We need to update and query:\n\n            For a given prefix value at j, we want to store:\n\n                For j with prefix[j] = p, we store:\n                    candidate1: dp[j] - j   (for the case when we have a future i with prefix[i] > p)\n                    candidate2: dp[j]        (for the case when prefix[i] == p)\n                    candidate3: dp[j] + j    (for the case when prefix[i] < p)\n\n        Then for a given i with prefix[i] = x, we want:\n\n            candidate1 = max_{j: prefix[j] < x} (dp[j]-j)\n            candidate2 = max_{j: prefix[j] == x} (dp[j])\n            candidate3 = max_{j: prefix[j] > x} (dp[j]+j)\n\n            Then:\n                dp[i] = max( i + candidate1, candidate2, -i + candidate3 )\n\n        We can use a Fenwick tree or a segment tree for the range maximum queries? But note: the prefix sums can be as low as -10^9 * 500000 -> which is -5e14, and as high as 5e14. We cannot use a segment tree with that range.\n\n        Instead, we can compress the prefix sums.\n\n        Also note: the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of prefix values is at most 500000+1 (for each test case, the prefix array has n+1 elements). But the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of prefix values is 500000+ (number of test cases) <= 500000 + 500000? Actually, the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of prefix values is the total n+ (number of test cases) (because each test case has n+1 prefix values) -> but note: the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of prefix values is 500000 + t. And t is the number of test cases, which is at most 500000. So total prefix values <= 1000000.\n\n        However, we are processing each test case independently? The problem says: the total n over test cases <= 500000, meaning the sum of the n's for each test case is <= 500000.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Precompute the prefix array for the test case: \n                prefix[0] = 0\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.\n\n            Then we compress the array of prefix values for this test case.\n\n            Then we initialize:\n\n                We'll have three Fenwick trees (or segment trees) for the three queries: \n                    tree1: for the candidate1 (dp[j]-j) for prefix[j] in the compressed set -> we want to query max over indices with prefix[j] in [min, x-1] (for candidate1: prefix[j] < x)\n                    tree2: for candidate2 (dp[j]) for prefix[j] = x -> we can use a dictionary? or we can update at the position of the compressed prefix[j] for candidate2? Actually, we can use one Fenwick tree for each candidate? But note: we have three different functions.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use three Fenwick trees (or segment trees) that support point updates and range maximum queries? But note: we are only updating at j (which we iterate from 0 to i) and then querying.\n\n            Steps for one test case:\n\n                n = ... \n                a = ... \n                prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n                # Compress prefix[0..n]\n                comp = sorted(set(prefix))\n                comp_map = {}\n                for idx, val in enumerate(comp):\n                    comp_map[val] = idx+1   # 1-indexed\n\n                # Initialize data structures for the three candidates.\n                # We'll use three Fenwick trees for maximum? But Fenwick tree for maximum is possible? \n                # However, note: Fenwick tree for maximum is standard.\n\n                # But note: we are doing point updates and range queries? \n                # For candidate1: we want to query the maximum value of (dp[j]-j) for prefix[j] in the range [min, x-1] (which corresponds to comp_map values: [1, comp_map[x]-1]).\n                # Similarly, candidate3: [comp_map[x]+1, max]\n\n                # We can use three Fenwick trees (or one Fenwick tree that we use for different arrays) but we have three different arrays to update.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can use one Fenwick tree for candidate1, one for candidate3, and a separate array for candidate2? \n\n                # For candidate2: we only need the maximum for a given prefix value? But we are updating as we go. So we can do:\n\n                #   Let best2 = a dictionary that maps a compressed prefix value to the maximum dp[j] for j with that prefix.\n\n                # But note: we iterate j from 0 to i, so we update as we go.\n\n                # Steps:\n\n                #   dp[0] = 0.\n\n                #   Initialize:\n                #       tree1 = Fenw(m)  # m = len(comp)\n                #       tree3 = Fenw(m)\n                #       best2 = [-10**18] * (m+1)   # we'll use an array for candidate2? But we want to update and query by compressed index.\n\n                #   Then for j=0: \n                #       p0 = prefix[0] = 0 -> comp_index = comp_map[0]\n                #       update tree1 at comp_index with value = dp[0]-0 = 0\n                #       update tree3 at comp_index with value = dp[0]+0 = 0\n                #       update best2[comp_index] = max(best2[comp_index], dp[0]) = max(...,0)\n\n                #   Then for i from 1 to n:\n\n                #       x = prefix[i]\n                #       cidx = comp_map[x]\n\n                #       candidate1 = tree1.query(1, cidx-1)   # max over indices [1, cidx-1] for candidate1: dp[j]-j\n                #       candidate2 = best2[cidx]   # but note: we might have multiple j with the same prefix? we want the maximum dp[j] for that prefix? and we update as we go? \n                #               However, we are iterating j from 0 to i-1, so we have updated all j from 0 to i-1. But we haven't updated j=i? \n                #               Actually, we are at i, and we are going to use j from 0 to i-1. So we can use the current best2 for the prefix x (which includes j from 0 to i-1).\n                #       candidate3 = tree3.query(cidx+1, m)\n\n                #       dp[i] = max( i + candidate1, candidate2, -i + candidate3 )\n\n                #       Then update:\n                #           tree1.update(cidx, dp[i]-i)   # but note: we are updating at j=i? Actually, we are at j=i? \n                #           tree3.update(cidx, dp[i]+i)\n                #           best2[cidx] = max(best2[cidx], dp[i])\n\n                #   Then answer = dp[n]\n\n            However, note: we are updating the data structures with the current j=i? But we are using j from 0 to i-1 for the computation of dp[i]. Then we update with j=i.\n\n            But note: j must be <= i-1 for the computation of dp[i]. So we update the data structures after we compute dp[i].\n\n            But what about the prefix[i]? We are using j from 0 to i-1.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                dp[0] = 0\n                Initialize:\n                    tree1 = FenwTreeMax(m)   # for candidate1: dp[j]-j, for j in [0, i-1] with prefix[j] in the compressed set.\n                    tree3 = FenwTreeMax(m)   # for candidate3: dp[j]+j\n                    best2 = [-10**18] * (m+1)   # for candidate2: for each compressed index, the maximum dp[j] for j in [0, i-1] with prefix[j] = comp[comp_index-1]\n\n                # update for j=0:\n                c0 = comp_map[prefix[0]]   # prefix[0]=0\n                tree1.update(c0, 0)   # dp[0]-0 = 0\n                tree3.update(c0, 0)   # dp[0]+0 = 0\n                best2[c0] = max(best2[c0], 0)\n\n                for i in range(1, n+1):   # we are computing dp[i] for the prefix ending at i (so the array a[0:i])\n                    x = prefix[i]\n                    cidx = comp_map[x]\n\n                    cand1 = tree1.query(1, cidx-1)   # max for prefix[j] < x\n                    cand2 = best2[cidx]               # for prefix[j] == x\n                    cand3 = tree3.query(cidx+1, m)    # for prefix[j] > x\n\n                    dp[i] = max( i + cand1, cand2, -i + cand3, -10**18)   # but we must consider if cand1, cand2, cand3 are not available? \n\n                    # Then update the data structures for j=i (so that future i can use it)\n                    tree1.update(cidx, dp[i]-i)\n                    tree3.update(cidx, dp[i]+i)\n                    if dp[i] > best2[cidx]:\n                        best2[cidx] = dp[i]\n\n                print(dp[n])\n\n            But note: we must initialize the Fenwick trees with -10**18 for all positions? because we are doing max.\n\n            However, what if there is no j in a given range? Then the query should return -10**18? and then the candidate might be very negative? but that's okay.\n\n            But note: we have j=0 already updated. For i=1, we have at least j=0.\n\n            Example: [1,2,-3] -> n=3.\n\n                prefix[0]=0\n                prefix[1]=1\n                prefix[2]=3\n                prefix[3]=0\n\n                dp[0]=0.\n\n                i=1: \n                    x = prefix[1]=1 -> cidx = comp_map[1] (which we have from the set: [0,1,3] -> so comp_map: 0->1, 1->2, 3->3)\n                    cand1: tree1.query(1, cidx-1) = tree1.query(1,1) -> which is the value at comp_map[0]? we updated at comp_map[0] (which is 1) with 0. So cand1=0.\n                    cand2: best2[2] -> currently -10**18? because we haven't updated any j with prefix=1? so cand2 = -10**18.\n                    cand3: tree3.query(3,3) -> we haven't updated any j with prefix=3? so -10**18.\n\n                    dp[1] = max( 1+0, -10**18, -1 + (-10**18) ) = 1.\n\n                Then update for j=1: \n                    tree1: update comp_map[1] (which is 2) with dp[1]-1 = 0.\n                    tree3: update comp_map[1] with dp[1]+1 = 2.\n                    best2[2] = max(-10**18, 1) = 1.\n\n                i=2:\n                    x=3, cidx=3.\n                    cand1: tree1.query(1,2) -> max( tree1[1]=0, tree1[2]=0 ) = 0.\n                    cand2: best2[3] = -10**18.\n                    cand3: tree3.query(4, m) -> -10**18 (if m=3, then no query) -> -10**18.\n                    dp[2] = max(2+0, -10**18, -2+(-10**18)) = 2.\n\n                Then update for j=2: \n                    tree1: update comp_map[3] (3) with dp[2]-2=0.\n                    tree3: update comp_map[3] with dp[2]+2=4.\n                    best2[3]=2.\n\n                i=3:\n                    x=0, cidx=1.\n                    cand1: tree1.query(1,0) -> no range? so -10**18.\n                    cand2: best2[1] = 0?

We can use a Fenwick tree that supports suffix maximum? or we can build a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? \n\n                Alternatively, we can use a segment tree.\n\n            But note: the total n over test cases is 500000, and the total number of prefix values per test case is n+1, and the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of updates and queries is 500000. \n\n            We can use a segment tree for maximum that supports range queries? \n\n            However, we have two trees: one for candidate1 (which we update with dp[j]-j) and one for candidate3 (dp[j]+j). \n\n            We'll build two segment trees: one for candidate1 and one for candidate3, each of size m (the number of distinct prefix values).\n\n            The segment tree for candidate1: \n                We update at position cidx (the compressed index for prefix[j]) with value = dp[j]-j.\n\n                Then we can query the maximum in [0, cidx-1] (if we use 0-indexed) for candidate1.\n\n            Similarly, for candidate3: update at cidx with value = dp[j]+j, and query [cidx+1, m-1].\n\n            Steps for one test case:\n\n                Precomputation: \n                    prefix[0..n] = ... \n                    comp = sorted(set(prefix))\n                    m = len(comp)\n                    comp_map = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(comp)}   # 0-indexed index.\n\n                Initialize:\n                    seg1 = SegmentTree(m)   # for candidate1: stores dp[j]-j at position comp_map[prefix[j]]\n                    seg3 = SegmentTree(m)   # for candidate3: stores dp[j]+j\n                    best2 = [-10**18] * m   # for candidate2: for each compressed index, the best dp[j] for j with that prefix.\n\n                dp[0]=0\n                pos0 = comp_map[prefix[0]]   # which is comp_map[0]\n                seg1.update(pos0, 0)   # update the segment tree: set the value at pos0 to max(current, 0)\n                seg3.update(pos0, 0)\n                best2[pos0] = 0\n\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    x = prefix[i]\n                    pos = comp_map[x]\n\n                    # Query candidate1: [0, pos-1] -> maximum value in seg1 over [0, pos-1]\n                    cand1 = seg1.query(0, pos-1)   # if pos==0, then no elements -> return -10**18\n                    cand2 = best2[pos]   # if we have seen this prefix before, then we have a value, else -10**18\n                    cand3 = seg3.query(pos+1, m-1)   # [pos+1, m-1]\n\n                    dp[i] = max( i + cand1, cand2, -i + cand3 )\n\n                    # Update:\n                    #   seg1: update pos with dp[i]-i\n                    seg1.update(pos, dp[i]-i)\n                    #   seg3: update pos with dp[i]+i\n                    seg3.update(pos, dp[i]+i)\n                    if dp[i] > best2[pos]:\n                        best2[pos] = dp[i]\n\n                print(dp[n])\n\n            We must be cautious: the segment tree update is a point update that sets the value at that index to the maximum of the current value and the new value.\n\n            We'll implement a segment tree that supports:\n                __init__(n): builds a segment tree for n elements, with initial value -10**18.\n                update(i, value): set tree[i] = max(tree[i], value) and update the segment tree.\n                query(l, r): returns the maximum in [l, r].\n\n            Since the total n (number of prefix values per test case) is at most 500000+1, and the total number of test cases has total n<=500000, the total number of updates is 500000 (one per j from 0 to n, and there are total n+1 per test case, and the total n over test cases is 500000, so total updates is 500000+ (number of test cases) <= 500000+500000=1000000? but note: the total n over test cases is 500000, meaning the total length of arrays is 500000, so the total number of j's (which is the total number of prefix values) is 500000 + (number of test cases) (because each test case has n+1 prefix values) -> and the number of test cases is at most 500000, so total updates <= 500000+500000=1000000.\n\n            And the total number of queries is 500000 (one per i from 1 to n, and total n over test cases is 500000).\n\n            So we can build a segment tree for each test case? But note: the segment tree size is m (the distinct count for the test case) and the total m over test cases is the total number of distinct prefix values? but the total number of prefix values is 500000 + (number of test cases) <= 1000000, and the total number of test cases is at most 500000, so we cannot build 500000 segment trees? \n\n            Actually, the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of test cases can be up to 500000 (each test case n=1). Then we would build 500000 segment trees? and each build is O(m) and m for each test case is 1 or 2? \n\n            But worst-case: one test case with n=500000, then m=500001? Then building a segment tree for 500001 nodes: that is O(m) and we do it once per test case. The total number of test cases is at most 500000? but the total n over test cases is 500000, so the number of test cases is at most 500000? and the worst-case total m over test cases is the total number of prefix values? which is 500000 + (number of test cases) <= 1000000. But we are building a segment tree for each test case: the total cost of building segment trees is O(total_m) = 1000000? which is acceptable.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the segment tree has 4*m nodes. Total memory: 4 * (1000000) = 4e6? and we do 500000 test cases? but wait: the total number of test cases is at most 500000, but the total m (over test cases) is 1000000? but we are building one segment tree per test case. The size of the segment tree for a test case is O(m) for that test case. The total memory would be the sum of O(m) for each test case, which is 1000000? \n\n            But the total number of test cases can be 500000, and each test case has m_i distinct prefix values. The sum of m_i over test cases is the total number of distinct prefix values? but note: distinct per test case. The total number of distinct prefix values over test cases is the sum of the distinct counts per test case. And the distinct count per test case is at most n_i+1. The sum of (n_i+1) over test cases = (sum of n_i) + (number of test cases) = 500000 + t. And t <= 500000, so total 1000000.\n\n            Therefore, the total memory for segment trees is O(1000000) * 4 * 2 (because two segment trees per test case) * (number of test cases) -> but wait, we are building two segment trees per test case. And the total number of test cases is t, and the total m over test cases is 1000000, but we are building per test case: so the total memory is 4 * (m1) + 4 * (m1) + 4 * (m2) + 4 * (m2) + ... = 8 * (m1+m2+...) = 8 * 1000000 = 8e6? which is acceptable.\n\n            However, we must not build a segment tree for each test case if we do 500000 test cases? because building 500000 segment trees might be heavy? But note: the total m over test cases is 1000000, so the total number of test cases is at most 500000, but the average m per test case is 1000000/500000 = 2. So we can build a segment tree for each test case.\n\n            But worst-case: one test case with n=500000, then m=500001, then we build two segment trees of size 4*500001 = 2e6 nodes each? and we do that for one test case? that is acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we implement:\n\n                We'll write a SegmentTree class.\n\n            SegmentTree for maximum:\n\n                class SegmentTree:\n                    def __init__(self, size):\n                        self.n = size\n                        self.size = 1\n                        while self.size < self.n:\n                            self.size *= 2\n                        self.data = [-10**18] * (2 * self.size)\n\n                    def update(self, index, value):\n                        # set the element at index to max(current, value)\n                        i = index + self.size\n                        if value > self.data[i]:\n                            self.data[i] = value\n                            while i > 1:\n                                i //= 2\n                                self.data[i] = max(self.data[2*i], self.data[2*i+1])\n\n                    def query(self, l, r):\n                        # query [l, r] inclusive, 0-indexed\n                        if l > r:\n                            return -10**18\n                        l += self.size\n                        r += self.size\n                        res = -10**18\n                        while l <= r:\n                            if l % 2 == 1:\n                                res = max(res, self.data[l])\n                                l += 1\n                            if r % 2 == 0:\n                                res = max(res, self.data[r])\n                                r -= 1\n                            l //= 2\n                            r //= 2\n                        return res\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                t = number of test cases.\n\n                for each test case:\n                    n = int(input())\n                    a = list of n integers.\n\n                    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n                    for i in range(1, n+1):\n                        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n                    comp = sorted(set(prefix))\n                    m = len(comp)\n                    comp_map = {}\n                    for idx, val in enumerate(comp):\n                        comp_map[val] = idx   # 0-indexed\n\n                    # Initialize data structures:\n                    seg1 = SegmentTree(m)\n                    seg3 = SegmentTree(m)\n                    best2 = [-10**18] * m   # for each compressed index, the best dp[j] for that prefix.\n\n                    # j=0:\n                    pos0 = comp_map[prefix[0]]\n                    seg1.update(pos0, 0)   # dp[0]-0 = 0\n                    seg3.update(pos0, 0)   # dp[0]+0 = 0\n                    best2[pos0] = 0\n\n                    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n                    dp[0] = 0\n\n                    for i in range(1, n+1):\n                        pos = comp_map[prefix[i]]\n                        cand1 = seg1.query(0, pos-1)\n                        cand2 = best2[pos]\n                        cand3 = seg3.query(pos+1, m-1)\n\n                        dp[i] = max( i + cand1, cand2, -i + cand3 )\n\n                        # Update data structures:\n                        seg1.update(pos, dp[i]-i)\n                        seg3.update(pos, dp[i]+i)\n                        if dp[i] > best2[pos]:\n                            best2[pos] = dp[i]\n\n                    print(dp[n])\n\n            But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we are doing a loop of n+1 per test case, and the total n is 500000, so the total i from 1 to n over test cases is 500000.\n\n            However, note: the segment tree update and query are O(log m), and m<=n+1, so total time O(500000 * log(500000)) which is about 500000 * 19 = 9.5e6, acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, but the total n is the sum of the lengths of the arrays? and we are iterating for each prefix index (0..n) per test case. The total number of prefix indices over test cases is the total n (over test cases) + t (because each test case has n+1 prefix indices). And the total n (over test cases) is 500000, and t (number of test cases) is at most 500000, so total 1000000. So the total operations (update and query) is 1000000 * log(m) per test case? but note: the segment tree is built per test case, and the m for a test case is the distinct count of prefix values for that test case. The worst-case distinct count per test case is n+1, and the total n over test cases is 500000, so the worst-case for one test case is 500000, then log2(500000) is about 19. So total operations: 1000000 * 19 = 19e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n        However, we must be cautious: we are building two segment trees per test case. The total memory might be 2 * 4 * (m) per test case. The total m over test cases is 1000000, so total memory 8 * 1000000 = 8e6? which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the total number of test cases can be 500000, and we are building two segment trees per test case. The memory per segment tree is O(m) (with m the distinct count for that test case). The total memory is the sum over test cases of 8 * m_i (because 4 * m_i for each segment tree, and two trees) = 8 * (sum of m_i) = 8 * 1000000 = 8e6? \n\n        Actually, the distinct count per test case: the distinct count for a test case is the number of distinct prefix sums in that test case. The sum of distinct counts over test cases is not the same as the total number of prefix values? The total number of prefix values is the sum of (n_i+1) over test cases = 500000 + t. But the distinct count per test case is at most n_i+1, and the sum of distinct counts over test cases is at most 500000 + t (if there were no duplicates) but could be less. However, worst-case we assume the distinct count per test case is n_i+1, and the sum of distinct counts is 500000 + t <= 1000000.\n\n        Therefore, we can do.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, but the total t (number of test cases) is the first integer. The constraint says t up to 500000, but the sum of n over test cases is 500000. So the worst-case t can be 500000, and each n_i=1. Then the total distinct counts: for each test case, distinct count = 2 (prefix[0] and prefix[1]). So total distinct counts = 2 * 500000 = 1000000.\n\n        So the total memory is 8 * 1000000 = 8e6 integers? which is about 64 MB? acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code for program1.py.\n\n        However, note: the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n            from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque\n            import bisect\n            from sys import stdin, stdout\n            from itertools import repeat\n            import math\n\n            MOD = 998244353\n            input = stdin.readline\n            finp = [int(x) for x in stdin.buffer.read().split()]\n\n            def inp(force_list=False):\n                re = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if len(re) == 1 and not force_list:\n                    return re[0]\n                return re\n\n            def inst():\n                return input().strip()\n\n            def gcd(x, y):\n               while(y):\n                   x, y = y, x % y\n               return x\n\n            def qmod(a, b, mod=MOD):\n                res = 1\n                while b:\n                    if b&1:\n                        res = (res*a)%mod\n                    b >>= 1\n                    a = (a*a)%mod\n                return res\n\n            def inv(a):\n                return qmod(a, MOD-2)\n\n            INF = 1<<30\n\n            class Seg(object):\n                def __init__(self, n):\n                    self._da = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n                    self._op = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n\n                def update(self, p):\n                    self._op[p] = max(self._op[p*2], self._op[p*2+1])\n\n                def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r):\n                    if l==r-1:\n                        self._da[p] = self._op[p] = x\n                        return\n                    mid = (l+r)//2\n                    if pos < mid:\n                        self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n                    else:\n                        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n                    self.update(p)\n\n                def query(self, x, y, p, l, r):\n                    if x <= l and r <= y:\n                        return self._op[p]\n                    if x >= r or y<=l:\n                        return -INF\n                    mid = (l+r)//2\n                    return max(self.query(x, y, p*2, l, mid), self.query(x, y, p*2+1, mid, r))\n\n            ... and then my_main() that reads finp and then does:\n\n                kase = finp[0]; ii=1\n                pans = []\n                for skase in range(kase):\n                    n = finp[ii]; ii+=1\n                    da = finp[ii:ii+n]; ii+=n\n                    ... and then we are to compute the answer.\n\n            We are to complete the code in my_main().\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                We'll use the algorithm above.\n\n            But note: the provided code has a segment tree class \"Seg\" that is a recursive segment tree. We can use that? \n\n            The provided Seg tree:\n\n                __init__(n): builds a tree for n elements? but the tree has 5*n nodes? and it uses a recursive method for modify and query.\n\n            We can use it for our candidate1 and candidate3? \n\n            How to use:\n\n                We have m distinct prefix values. We build:\n\n                    seg1 = Seg(m)   # for candidate1: dp[j]-j at position j (compressed index)\n                    seg3 = Seg(m)   # for candidate3: dp[j]+j\n\n                The Seg class has:\n                    modify(pos, x, p=1, l=0, r=n)   # but the tree is built for [0, n-1]? \n\n                We note: the tree is built for an array of size n (the parameter in __init__). We pass m to __init__.\n\n                Then:\n                    seg1.modify(pos, value)   # but the modify function has many parameters? \n\n                The provided modify is:\n\n                    def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r)\n\n                We can wrap it:\n\n                    def my_modify(seg, pos, x):\n                        seg.modify(pos, x, 1, 0, m)   # because the tree is built for [0, m-1]? \n\n                But the tree is built for an array of size n (passed to __init__), and then the tree covers [0, n) ? \n\n                The code: \n                    if l==r-1: ... \n                    mid = (l+r)//2\n                    if pos < mid: ... \n\n                It seems to be built for [l, r) (left-inclusive, right-exclusive). \n\n                We build with n = m, then the tree covers [0, m). \n\n                Then we can do:\n\n                    seg1 = Seg(m)\n                    # To update at position pos (0-indexed) with value x: \n                    seg1.modify(pos, x, 1, 0, m)\n\n                But note: the initial tree has all values -INF (which is -1<<30). \n\n                Similarly, query [l, r] (inclusive) in the array? \n\n                The query function: \n                    seg1.query(l, r, 1, 0, m)   # but note: the query is for [x,y] in the array? and the tree covers [l, r) in the function? \n\n                The query function: \n                    if x<=l and r<=y: ... \n                    if x>=r or y<=l: ... \n\n                It seems to be for [l, r) as well. \n\n                We want to query [ql, qr] (inclusive) in the array of size m? then we should call:\n\n                    seg1.query(ql, qr+1, 1, 0, m)   # because the tree covers [0, m), and we want [ql, qr] which is [ql, qr+1) in half-open.\n\n                But note: the query function in the provided code uses inclusive on the left and exclusive on the right? \n\n                Actually, the condition: \n                    if x<=l and r<=y:   # then the segment [l, r) is contained in [x,y) -> so the query [x,y) is half-open.\n\n                So we should use half-open intervals: [x, y) in the array.\n\n                Therefore, to query [l, r] (inclusive) in the array, we do [l, r+1).\n\n                But note: the array indices are 0-indexed and we have m elements: indices 0 to m-1.\n\n                So for candidate1: we want [0, pos-1] (inclusive) -> that is [0, pos) in half-open -> so we can call:\n\n                    seg1.query(0, pos, 1, 0, m)   # because [0, pos) covers indices 0 to pos-1.\n\n                For candidate3: [pos+1, m-1] (inclusive) -> [pos+1, m) in half-open.\n\n            Therefore, we do:\n\n                # For candidate1: \n                    cand1 = seg1.query(0, pos, 1, 0, m)   # [0, pos) -> indices 0 to pos-1.\n\n                # For candidate3:\n                    cand3 = seg3.query(pos+1, m, 1, 0, m)   # [pos+1, m) -> indices pos+1 to m-1.\n\n            But note: if there are no elements in the range, the query returns -INF.\n\n            Then we compute dp[i] = max( i + cand1, cand2, -i + cand3, -10**18) but we have -INF defined as -1<<30 (which is about -2e9). But the values of dp[i] can be as large as n (which is 500000) times something? but worst-case: if we have a segment of length 500000 and positive, then value=500000, and we might have up to 500000 such segments? but the entire array is partitioned, so the total value is at most 500000*500000? which is 2.5e11, so we need to use -10**18? \n\n            We'll use the provided INF = 1<<30, which is 2^30 ~ 1e9, which might be too small? \n\n            We'll change: \n                INF = 10**18   # but the problem says a_i in [-10^9, 10^9] and n<=500000, so the maximum absolute value of dp[i] might be 500000*500000 = 2.5e11? so 10**18 is safe.\n\n            But the provided code already has INF = 1<<30. We can change it to 10**18? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are only to output the missing code? \n\n            We are to complete the code in my_main(). We are allowed to change the global space? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the code that is missing in the given program1.py.\n\n            The given program1.py has:\n\n                ... (the provided code)\n\n                INF = 1<<30\n\n                ... (the Seg class)\n\n                def my_main():\n                    ... (and then we are to complete my_main)\n\n            We can change INF? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are not to change existing lines? \n\n            We'll leave INF as 1<<30? but 1<<30 is about 1e9, and our dp[i] might be as large as 2.5e11? so we need to use a larger value.\n\n            We'll change INF to -10**18? but the provided INF is 1<<30 (a positive number). The segment tree uses -INF for initialization? \n\n            In the Seg class: \n                __init__: self._da = [-INF] * (n*5)   -> so if INF=1<<30, then -INF = -2**30, which is about -1e9, which is too high (not negative enough) for our dp[i] which can be as low as -2.5e11.\n\n            Therefore, we must change INF.\n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the entire my_main function? or only the missing part? \n\n            The provided my_main function is:\n\n                def my_main():\n                    # print(500000)\n                    # for i in range(500000):\n                    #     print(1)\n                    #     print(-1000000000)\n                    ii = 0 \n                    kase = finp[ii];ii+=1\n                    pans = []\n                    for skase in range(kase):\n                        # print(\"Case #%d: \" % (skase+1), end='')\n                        n = finp[ii];ii+=1\n                        da = finp[ii:ii+n];ii+=n\n                        pref = [0]\n                        for i in da:\n                            pref.append(pref[-1] + i)\n                        spos, sneg = sorted([(pref[i], -i) for i, v in enumerate(pref)]), sorted([(pref[i], i) for i, v in enumerate(pref)])\n                        ordpos, ordneg = [0] * (n+1), [0] * (n+1)\n                        pfen, nfen = Fenwick(n), Fenwick(n)\n                        dmx = {}\n                        for i in range(n+1):\n                            ordpos[-spos[i][-1]] = i\n                            ordneg[sneg[i][-1]] = i\n                        dp = [0] * (n+1)\n                        dmx[0] = 0\n                        pfen.modify(ordpos[0], 0)\n                        nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[0], 0)\n                        for i in range(1, n+1):\n                            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n                            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n                            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n                            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                        pans.append(str(dp[n]))\n                    print('\\n'.join(pans))\n\n            We see that the provided code already has an approach? \n\n            It uses:\n\n                spos = sorted([ (pref[i], -i) for i in range(n+1) ])   # sorts by pref[i"
