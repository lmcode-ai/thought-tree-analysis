But note that the candy at `a` is now eaten by Alice, and the candy at `b` is still with Bob? Actually, the indices: \n  - `a` is the last index that Alice has eaten (so initially she hasn't eaten any, so a=-1).

So for n=1, we can do either:\n  Option 1: swap indices 1 and 2 -> [1,2]\n  Option 2: swap indices 2 and 3 -> [2,3]\n\nBut the provided code for n>1 uses a pattern: \n  i starts at 2 (which is the second character of the first \"BAN\", because the first \"BAN\" has indices 1,2,3) and j starts at 3*n (which for n=1 is 3, the last character). Then for n>1, it moves i by 3 (so next BAN's second character) and j by -3 (so the previous BAN's last character). So for n=1, we can use the same pattern: swap the second character of the first BAN (which is index2) with the last character of the last BAN (which is index3). But note: the problem says that the minimum number of operations for n=1 is 1. And we can do one swap. Therefore, we can handle n=1 in the same way as the general case? Actually, the provided code for n>1 would work for n=1? For n=1: \n      i = 2, j = 3 -> 2<3 -> true, so we do one swap: [2,3] and then i becomes 5, j becomes 0 -> break. But wait, the code for n>1 is written in the function `ban(n)` and we have an if for n==1? So we must complete the if for n==1. We can do:\n  if n == 1:\n      x = 1\n      lt = [[1, 2]]   # or [[2,3]]? But the example in the note uses [1,2].",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code in the function `solve` for the case when `suma < sumb`.\nThe idea is to use two pointers: one starting from the left (Alice) and one from the right (Bob). We maintain two running sums: `suma` for Alice and `sumb` for Bob.\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (which is `cur` in the code) such that the total weights are equal.\n\nThe current code has a while loop that continues until the pointers meet or cross.\nIn the condition `suma < sumb`, we should move Alice's pointer to the right to increase her sum.\n\nThe code for the condition `suma < sumb` is missing. We should do:\n  a += 1\n  suma += arr[a]\n  cur += 1\n\nBut note: the initial state has a = -1 and b = n. So when we do `a += 1` we get a=0, then add arr[0] to suma.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious because the condition `a>=b` might break the loop. Also, note that in the else block (when sums are equal) we record the current total candies eaten (as a candidate for the answer) and then move both pointers and update the sums.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the maximum number of candies such that the two sums are equal. We are to output the total number of candies (which is the count).\n\nWe must also note that the variable `ans` is updated only when the sums are equal. And when the loop breaks, we print `ans`.\n\nSo the missing code for `suma < sumb` is:\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut wait: what if `a` becomes equal to `b`? Then we break. Also, we must avoid accessing out of bounds? The problem states that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, and the array has n elements. The pointer `a` starts at -1 and increases until it reaches `b` (which starts at n and decreases). Since we break when `a>=b`, we are safe.\n\nHowever, note that in the else block we do:\n    a += 1\n    b -= 1\n    ... and then update the sums and cur by 2.\n\nBut in the condition `suma < sumb`, we are only moving `a` and increasing `cur` by 1.\n\nSimilarly, for `suma > sumb` we move `b` and increase `cur` by 1.\n\nSo the missing block for `suma < sumb` is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: the initial state has a=-1, so the first time we do `a += 1` we get a=0, which is valid.\n\nHowever, we must check the condition that `a` might become equal to `b`? The condition at the top of the loop is `if a>=b: break`. So after updating `a`, we break at the next iteration if `a>=b`.\n\nBut what if after updating `a`, we have `a == b-1`? Then we break next time. But note that the candy at `a` is now eaten by Alice, and the candy at `b` is still with Bob? Actually, the indices: \n  - `a` is the last index that Alice has eaten (so initially she hasn't eaten any, so a=-1). After she eats the first candy, a=0.\n  - `b` is the next candy that Bob hasn't eaten? Actually, the code for Bob: initially b=n, then we do `b -= 1` and then `sumb += arr[b]` meaning that Bob eats the candy at index b-1 (because we decrement b first). So the candy indices that Bob has eaten are from b to n-1.\n\nSo the condition `a>=b` means that the pointers have met or crossed, meaning that there are no more candies to eat.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for the `elif suma < sumb` block is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the maximum number of candies such that the two sums are equal. We update `ans` only when the sums are equal. And when the loop breaks, we print `ans`.\n\nHowever, there is a nuance: what if the loop breaks without having updated `ans` in the last step? But note that we update `ans` every time the sums are equal. And we break only when the pointers cross. So the last time the sums were equal is recorded.\n\nBut what if the entire array is processed and we never have equality? Then `ans` remains 0? That is acceptable because if they cannot have the same total weight, then the answer is 0 (as in the third test case).\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the block for `suma < sumb`.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are to complete the function `ban(n)` for the case when n==1.\n\nThe problem: We have a string \"BAN\" repeated n times. We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (each swap swaps two indices) so that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\nThe provided code for n>1 uses a strategy: \n  x = 0\n  lt = []\n  i = 2\n  j = 3 * n\n  while i < j:\n      lt.append([i, j])\n      x += 1\n      i += 3\n      j -= 3\n\nThis means for n=2: \n  i starts at 2, j at 6 -> swap indices 2 and 6? But note: the string is 0-indexed? The problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\nThe example for n=1: \n  We can swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) to get \"ABN\".\n\nSo for n=1, we need 1 swap: swap index1 and index2.\n\nThe code for n=1 is missing. We should return the same structure as for n>1: [x, lt] where x is the number of swaps and lt is a list of swaps (each swap is a list of two indices).\n\nSo for n=1:\n  x = 1\n  lt = [[1, 2]]   # because we swap the first and second character (1-indexed)\n\nBut note: the example in the note says: swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2 -> so indices 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, the code for n>1 uses:\n  i = 2, j = 3*n -> for n=1: i=2, j=3 -> but then 2<3 -> so it would do a swap at indices 2 and 3? That would be swapping the second and third character: \"BAN\" becomes \"BNA\", which is not the example.\n\nBut the example for n=2: \n  s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> they swap index2 and index6 (1-indexed). \n  The string: \n      index1: 'B'\n      index2: 'A'\n      index3: 'N'\n      index4: 'B'\n      index5: 'A'\n      index6: 'N'\n  Swapping index2 and index6: \n      index2 becomes 'N', index6 becomes 'A'\n      So the string becomes: B (index1), then N (index2), then N (index3? but wait, index3 is still 'N'), then B (index4), then A (index5), then A (index6)? \n      Actually: \n        Original: [0]='B', [1]='A', [2]='N', [3]='B', [4]='A', [5]='N'\n        Swap index1 (which is the second character, so index1 in 0-indexed is 1) and index5 (0-indexed index 5): \n          becomes: \n            index0: 'B'\n            index1: 'N' (from the last character of the second BAN)\n            index2: 'N'\n            index3: 'B'\n            index4: 'A'\n            index5: 'A'\n        So the string is \"BNNBAA\", which matches the example.\n\nBut for n=1, the provided n>1 code would not run because the while loop condition is i<j, and for n=1: i=2, j=3 -> 2<3 -> true, so it would do one swap: [2,3] (1-indexed). Then i becomes 5 and j becomes 0? Actually, i+=3 -> 5, j-=3 -> 0 -> then 5<0 is false, so it breaks.\n\nBut for n=1, the string has length 3. The swap of indices 2 and 3 (1-indexed) would swap the second and third characters: \n  Original: \"BAN\" -> swap index2 and index3: becomes \"BNA\". \n  Now, is \"BAN\" a subsequence? \n    We can try: \n        B at index1, then A? but the next A is at index5? Actually, in \"BNA\": \n          We have B at index1, then N at index2, then A at index3. \n        To form \"BAN\": we need B, then A, then N. \n        We have B at index1, then we can take A at index3? Then we skip the N at index2? Then we have B and then A, but then we need an N after A? There is no N after A. \n        Alternatively, we can take B at index1 and then A at index3 and then we don't have an N after? So it fails. \n        Also, we can try: B at index1, then skip N at index2, then A at index3, then we need an N after? There is none. \n        So \"BAN\" is not a subsequence.\n\nSo swapping indices 2 and 3 for n=1 also works.\n\nBut the example in the note did a swap of indices 1 and 2. So both are valid.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output any sequence of swaps that achieves the goal with the minimum number of swaps.\n\nSo for n=1, we can do either:\n  Option 1: swap indices 1 and 2 -> [1,2]\n  Option 2: swap indices 2 and 3 -> [2,3]\n\nBut the provided code for n>1 uses a pattern: \n  i starts at 2 (which is the second character of the first \"BAN\", because the first \"BAN\" has indices 1,2,3) and j starts at 3*n (which for n=1 is 3, the last character). Then for n>1, it moves i by 3 (so next BAN's second character) and j by -3 (so the previous BAN's last character).\n\nSo for n=1, we can use the same pattern: swap the second character of the first BAN (which is index2) with the last character of the last BAN (which is index3). \n\nBut note: the problem says that the minimum number of operations for n=1 is 1. And we can do one swap.\n\nTherefore, we can handle n=1 in the same way as the general case? Actually, the provided code for n>1 would work for n=1? \n  For n=1: \n      i = 2, j = 3 -> 2<3 -> true, so we do one swap: [2,3] and then i becomes 5, j becomes 0 -> break.\n\nBut wait, the code for n>1 is written in the function `ban(n)` and we have an if for n==1? So we must complete the if for n==1.\n\nWe can do:\n  if n == 1:\n      x = 1\n      lt = [[1, 2]]   # or [[2,3]]? \n\nBut the example in the note uses [1,2]. However, the problem does not require a specific solution, any solution is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"output one such shortest sequence\". So we can choose.\n\nHowever, the provided code for n>1 uses [2,3] for n=1? Actually, no: the code for n>1 is not run for n=1 because we have an if n==1. So we can choose either.\n\nBut to be consistent with the example in the note, let's output [1,2] for n=1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same pattern as the general code? The general code for n>=1? Actually, the problem says that the total operations for n=1 is 1. And the pattern for n>1: \n  We are swapping the second character of a BAN (which is at position 2, 5, 8, ...) with the last character of a BAN from the end (which is at position 3n, 3n-3, ...). For n=1, the second character is at position 2 and the last character is at position 3. So we swap [2,3] (1-indexed).\n\nBut the example in the note swapped [1,2] (1-indexed). \n\nThe problem does not specify which swap to do. So we can do either.\n\nBut note: the example output for n=1 in the note says:\n  1\n  1 2\n\nSo we should output 1 and then 1 2.\n\nTherefore, for n=1, we return:\n  x = 1\n  lt = [[1,2]]\n\nBut wait: the indices in the example are 1-indexed. The problem says: output two integers i_k, j_k (1-indexed).\n\nSo the swap for n=1: swap the first and second character: indices 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the code for n=1 is:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nBut note: the general code for n>1 is:\n\n    x = 0\n    lt = []\n    i = 2\n    j = 3 * n\n    while i < j:\n        lt.append([i, j])\n        x += 1\n        i += 3\n        j -= 3\n\n    return [x, lt]\n\nThis works for n>=2. For n=1, we have a separate block.\n\nBut what about n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't need to handle n=0.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py in the if n==1 block is:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nHowever, note that the example for n=1 in the note uses [1,2] and the example for n=2 uses [2,6] (which is the same as the general code: for n=2, i=2, j=6 -> [2,6]). So we are consistent.\n\nBut wait: the general code for n=2: \n  i=2, j=6 -> swap [2,6] -> then i becomes 5, j becomes 3 -> then 5<3 is false -> break. So one swap.\n\nBut the example for n=2 says one swap. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the block for `suma < sumb` and for program2.py is the block for `n==1`.\n\nNow, output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: The output must be a JSON string with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". The value for each is the string of the missing code.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the block for the condition `suma < sumb`. We must output exactly the code that goes in that TODO.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the block for `n==1`.\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py is:\n\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nBut we must indent it properly. The current code has 8 spaces for the condition, so we will use 12 spaces for the block.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the code is:\n\n\tif n == 1:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with:\n\n\t\tx = 1\n\t\tlt = [[1, 2]]\n\t\treturn [x, lt]\n\nBut note: the function `ban(n)` must return the same structure as the general case: a list [x, lt] where x is the number of swaps and lt is the list of swaps.\n\nNow, write the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"\t\tx = 1\\n\t\tlt = [[1, 2]]\\n\t\treturn [x, lt]\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code uses tabs for indentation? The provided code for program2.py uses a tab (or 4 spaces? the problem shows 4 spaces). Actually, the provided code for program2.py uses 4 spaces per level. The if block is indented by 4, and the TODO is indented by 8. But in the example, the TODO is written with a tab? Actually, the problem shows:\n\n\tif n == 1:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe'll use 4 spaces for each level? Actually, the problem uses 4 spaces for the first indent and 8 for the second. But in the provided code for program2.py, the if block has two levels: the function and the if. The function body is indented by 4, and the if block by 8.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code should be:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nBut the problem shows the TODO with a tab? Actually, the problem uses 8 spaces (two indents) for the TODO. So we'll use 8 spaces for each line of the block.\n\nBut wait: the provided code for program2.py uses:\n\ndef ban(n):\n\tif n == 1:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe indentation: \n  The function body is indented by 4 spaces? Actually, the problem uses 4 spaces for the function body. Then the if block is indented by 4 more? So 8 in total.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py should be:\n\n\t\tx = 1\n\t\tlt = [[1, 2]]\n\t\treturn [x, lt]\n\nBut the problem uses tabs? Actually, the problem uses spaces. We'll use 8 spaces for each line of the block.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same number of spaces as the TODO. The TODO is at 8 spaces. So we write:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nBut note: the program1.py code uses 8 spaces for the condition and 12 for the inner block? Actually, the condition is at 8, and the inner block is at 12. But the TODO is at 12? Actually, the condition is:\n\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe condition is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12. So the code we write for program1.py must be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\nwith 12 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nwith 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the function body is indented by 4, and the if block by 8. So the code inside the if block should be at 12? But the TODO is at 8? \n\nWait, the provided program2.py code:\n\ndef ban(n):\n\tif n == 1:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nThe function body is indented by 4? Actually, the problem shows:\n\ndef ban(n):\n\tif n == 1:\n\t\t# TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is 4 spaces for the function body and 8 for the if block? Actually, the first line of the function is at 4, the if at 4, and the TODO at 8? \n\nBut the problem uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\nSo for the if block, we need to indent the code by 8 spaces (two levels). \n\nTherefore, the code for the if block in program2.py is:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nwith each line starting with 8 spaces? \n\nBut wait, the TODO is at 8 spaces? So we write:\n\n        x = 1\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\n        return [x, lt]\n\nBut note: the return statement must be at the same level as the assignment to x and lt.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might use tabs. But the problem says to output the code as in the problem. We'll use spaces.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"        x = 1\\n        lt = [[1, 2]]\\n        return [x, lt]\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the condition block for `suma>sumb` is:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nIt is written without spaces around operators? Actually, the problem writes:\n\n        b-=1\n        sumb+=arr[b]\n        cur+=1\n\nSo we write similarly.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, we write without spaces in the list? Actually, the problem writes: `lt.append([i, j])` without spaces.\n\nSo we write `lt = [[1,2]]` without spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem output for the swaps in the example for n=2: \"2 6\", so with a space. But that is when printing. The list element is [2,6] and then we print with `print(*i)`.\n\nSo the representation in the code is without spaces: [1,2].\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
