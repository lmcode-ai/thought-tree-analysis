Example 3: \"BRB\" -> ['BRB'] -> \n                length>=2 -> ok.\n                contains both 'R' and 'B' -> ok.\n\n            Example 4: \"B\" -> ['B'] -> length=1 -> error. Example 5: \"R\" -> \n                ['R'] -> error. Example 6: \"WB\" -> \n                split: ['', 'B'] -> \n                segment 'B' -> length=1 -> error.

Example 8: \"W\" -> \n                split: ['',''] -> no non-empty segment -> ok.\n\n            Example 9: \"WW\" -> ok. Example 10: \"RRR\" -> \n                split: ['RRR'] -> \n                no 'B' -> error. But the sample test cases from the problem:\n\n            The first test case: \"BRB\" -> YES (as per the example) -> our method says YES.

Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          But note: the variable name in the for loop is 'i', which is the segment. So we write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg: if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          But the provided loop variable is named 'i'. So we keep it as 'i':\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5?",

They eat from opposite ends and cannot skip candies.\n\n The provided code uses two pointers, one starting at the left (i) and one at the right (j). We have two sums: lsum (for Alice) and rsum (for Bob). We move the pointers until they meet.\n\n The idea is:\n   - If lsum < rsum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the candy to Alice's sum.\n   - If rsum < lsum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the candy to Bob's sum.\n   - If they are equal, we have a candidate: the total candies eaten so far is (i+1) from the left and (n - j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n - j). We record this in best (as the maximum so far). Then we move one of the pointers (or both) to look for more possibilities? But note: we are allowed to have non-overlapping segments. However, once we have an equality, we can break the current segment and then continue? Actually, we can try to move both pointers because we cannot use the same candy again.\n\n However, note the problem: They want to be fair and eat the same total weight. We are to maximize the total number of candies.\n\n The provided code has a while loop and a TODO in the else branch (when lsum == rsum). We must update best and then how to proceed?\n\n Important: After we have an equality, we can continue by moving both pointers because we have used the current candies at i and j? Actually, we can move both: we do i+1 and j-1 and update the sums accordingly? But note: we are currently at i and j. We have lsum = rsum. Then we can try to add the next candy on the left and the next on the right to see if we can get a longer sequence.\n\n However, the current code does:\n   - Initially: i=0, j=n-1, lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n   - Then we enter the while loop (i<j).\n\n In the else branch (when lsum == rsum), we should:\n   - Update best: best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))   [because Alice has eaten from index0 to i (i+1 candies) and Bob has eaten from j to n-1 (n - j candies)]\n   - Then we move both pointers: we move i to the right and j to the left? But note: we must update the sums. We can do:\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]   # but we must check if i is still less than j? Actually, we break the condition if i becomes >= j? So we can break after updating? But we might have a chance to get a bigger total by continuing? Actually, we can continue until the pointers meet.\n\n However, note: when we have an equality, we can break the current segment and then start a new one? But the problem does not require contiguous segments? Actually, they are contiguous: Alice eats from the left in a row, Bob from the right in a row. And they cannot overlap.\n\n But note: the problem says Alice can eat any number from the left (without skipping) and Bob from the right (without skipping). So the candies they eat are two contiguous segments: one at the beginning and one at the end.\n\n Therefore, we are doing the right thing: we are expanding from the two ends until we have an equality. And when we have an equality, we record the total candies and then we can continue by moving both pointers? Actually, we can move both because we have used the current i and j? But wait: if we move both, then we are effectively starting a new segment? However, note that we are not starting over: we are continuing the expansion. But the problem does not allow skipping. So we must have contiguous segments. The segments are fixed: Alice's segment is from 0 to i, Bob's from j to n-1. We are trying to find a pair (i, j) such that the sum from 0 to i equals the sum from j to n-1, and we want to maximize (i+1 + n - j).\n\n So after we have an equality, we can move both pointers: we do i+1 and j-1 and update the sums? But note: we are going to break the current equality? Actually, we can try to extend: we move the left pointer to the next and the right pointer to the next, and then continue the process. This is valid because we are allowed to have the two segments not necessarily adjacent? They are adjacent? Actually, they are not adjacent: the candies in the middle are not eaten. But we are free to extend the segments independently? However, the problem does not require that the segments are adjacent. We just cannot have overlapping.\n\n So after we have an equality, we can move both pointers and then continue? But note: we have to update the sums. We can do:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        # But then we must update lsum and rsum? Actually, we are going to add the next candy on the left and the next on the right? But wait: we are moving the pointers, so we break the current segments? Actually, we are extending the segments: we are going to include the next candy for Alice and the next candy for Bob? But that might break the equality? So we do:\n\n        if i < j:   # because we are going to add\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n However, what if we don't move both? Actually, we have to: because we have already achieved an equality at (i, j). We cannot use the same candy again. So we must move both to avoid using the same candy again? Actually, we are not: the current i and j are already included. We are going to move beyond them? But note: we are at i and j. We have two options: \n   Option 1: we break and then start again? But that is not what the two pointers are doing. The two pointers are expanding from the ends. \n   Option 2: we move both pointers to the next and then continue the process? This is acceptable.\n\n However, consider: we have an equality at (i, j). Then we move i to i+1 and j to j-1. Now we have new lsum = old lsum + arr[i] and new rsum = old rsum + arr[j]. Then we continue the while loop. But note: we might get a new equality at the new positions? And that would be a different partition.\n\n Example: [1,2,1,1] \n   Initially: i=0, j=3 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: total= 1 (left) + 1 (right) = 2 -> best=2.\n   Then we move: i=1, j=2 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> then we move j? j becomes 1? but wait, j is now 2, then we move j to 1? but then i=1 and j=1 -> break. \n   But wait, we have another solution: Alice takes [1,2] and Bob takes [1,1] -> total=4? but 1+2=3 and 1+1=2 -> not equal. \n   Actually, the only solution is the first one.\n\n But what about [1,1,2,1]? \n   Initially: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> best=2.\n   Then we move: i=1, j=2: lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+2=3 -> then we move i to 2: lsum=2+2=4 -> now i=2 and j=2 -> break. \n   But there is a better solution: Alice takes [1,1] (sum=2) and Bob takes [2,1] (sum=3) -> not equal. \n   Or Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [1] -> that's the one we found.\n\n However, what if we have [1,2,3,3,2,1]? \n   We can have: Alice takes [1,2,3] and Bob takes [3,2,1] -> both sum=6 -> total=6 candies.\n\n   Steps:\n     i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: total=1+1=2 -> best=2 -> then move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equality: total= (2 from left: indices0,1) and (2 from right: indices4,5) -> total=4 -> best=4 -> then move both: i=2, j=3 -> lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> total= (3 from left) + (3 from right)=6 -> best=6 -> then move both: i=3, j=2 -> break.\n\n   So we get 6.\n\n Therefore, we should do:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            break   # or let the while condition break\n\n But note: we might have i==j? then we break. Also, we must be cautious: we are updating the sums only when we move the pointers? Actually, we are updating the sums only in the if and elif branches? So in the else branch we update the pointers and then update the sums? But what if we don't have i<j? then we break without updating? That's okay.\n\n However, what if we don't break? The while condition is i<j, so if we move i and j such that i>=j, we break the loop.\n\n But note: we are updating the sums only if i<j? Actually, we are updating the sums only in the if and elif branches? And in the else branch we update the pointers and then update the sums only if i<j? Then we continue the loop? But the next iteration we check i<j? So we break if i>=j.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i==j? Then we break. But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n But wait: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i and j become adjacent? Then we can still have a chance? For example, [1,1]? \n   Initially: i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: best = 0+ (0+1) + (2-1) = 1+1=2 -> then we move: i=1, j=0 -> then i>=j -> break. Correct.\n\n However, what if we have [1,2,2,1]? \n   Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: best=2 -> then i=1, j=2 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equality: best = (1+1) + (4-2) = 2+2=4 -> then i=2, j=1 -> break. Correct.\n\n But note: we are updating the sums only when we move the pointers in the if and elif branches? In the else branch we update the pointers and then update the sums only if i<j? But what if we don't update the sums? Then in the next iteration, we have the same lsum and rsum? Actually, we have moved the pointers and then we added the new candy? So we must update the sums? \n\n However, in the else branch we are updating the pointers and then we update the sums for the new positions? That is correct.\n\n But what if we don't have i<j? Then we break? So we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n However, there is a problem: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we break? Then we are done.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j? Then we update the sums and then we continue? Then we might get another equality? That's what we want.\n\n But note: the initial code does not update the sums in the else branch? We are adding that.\n\n However, the provided code does not have the update for the else branch. We are to complete it.\n\n But wait: what if we don't get an equality? Then we break the loop without updating? Actually, the while loop condition is i<j, and we break when i>=j.\n\n However, we must consider: we might have an equality at the last step? We are updating best only in the else branch.\n\n But what if we break the loop without entering the else branch? Then we have not updated best? That's okay because we only update when we have an equality.\n\n However, we must also note: we might have an equality that we haven't recorded? Actually, we record every time we have an equality.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we break? Then we have recorded the last equality? Actually, we record the equality at the moment we have it.\n\n Therefore, the code for the else branch should be:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            # break the loop? Actually, we break the loop by the condition? \n            # But we can break early? Or we can let the while condition break? \n            # We don't break here, we just update the sums only if i<j? Then the while condition will break if i>=j.\n            # So we don't need to break here.\n\n But note: what if we move both and then i==j? Then we break the loop? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n However, what if we move both and then i<j? Then we update the sums and then the next iteration we check? That's okay.\n\n But there is a catch: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, but then we don't get an equality? Then we continue the while loop? That's correct.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we are updating the sums only in the else branch when we move both? What about the other branches? The other branches update the sums when they move one pointer? So the structure is:\n\n   while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:   # equal\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                # we break the loop? Actually, we break the loop condition? \n                # But we can break early? We don't have to, because the condition i<j will be false.\n                pass\n\n But note: after we update the pointers and the sums, we continue the loop? That's correct.\n\n However, what if we move both and then i>=j? Then we break the loop? So we don't do the next iteration? That's correct.\n\n But what if we move both and then i<j? Then we have updated the sums and then we go to the next iteration? Then we check the condition again? That's correct.\n\n However, there is a problem: we might have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, but then we don't update the sums? Actually, we do update the sums in the else branch? But wait: we update the sums only in the else branch? Actually, we update the sums in the else branch only if i<j? That's correct because we are going to use the new i and j? But note: we have already moved the pointers? Then we add the candy at the new i and j? That's correct.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then in the next iteration we have lsum==rsum again? Then we update best again? That's what we want.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, but then we have lsum != rsum? Then we go to the if or elif branch? That's okay.\n\n But note: we have already moved the pointers? Then we have lsum and rsum set to the new values? Then we compare? That's correct.\n\n However, there is a bug: when we move both pointers, we are adding the next candy? But what if we move both and then we break? Then we don't update the sums? But that's okay because we break.\n\n But what if we move both and then we have i<j, then we update the sums? Then we have the new sums? Then we continue? That's correct.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i==j? Then we break? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n But note: we are not updating the sums when i==j? That's okay because we break.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i>j? Then we break? That's okay.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, but then we break the loop? Then we have updated the sums? But we break the loop? Then we don't check again? That's okay.\n\n However, we must consider: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we break the loop? Then we have updated the sums? But we break? Then we don't get a chance to check the new sums? Actually, we break the loop? No, we break the loop only when i>=j? So if we have i<j, we continue.\n\n Therefore, the code for the else branch is:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n But note: we must not forget to update best only when we have an equality? And we are doing that.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i==j? Then we break? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have an equality again? Then we update best again? That's what we want.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, but then we have lsum < rsum? Then we move i? Then we add the next candy? Then we might get an equality again? That's okay.\n\n But note: we are updating the sums in the if and elif branches? So the structure is consistent.\n\n However, there is a problem: we are updating the sums in the else branch only when we move both? And then we continue? Then the next iteration we check the condition? That's correct.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have lsum==rsum again? Then we update best? That's correct.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have lsum==rsum? Then we update best? But note: the total candies now is (i+1) + (n - j) = (previous i+1+1) and (n - (j-1))? Actually, we have moved both pointers again? So the total candies is (i+1) [which is the new i] and (n - j) [which is the new j]? But note: we have moved the pointers: so the new i is the current i (which is the old i+1) and the new j is the old j-1. Then the total candies for Alice is (i+1) [because we are at index i, so we have eaten from 0 to i] and for Bob is (n - j) [because we have eaten from j to n-1]. So that's correct.\n\n Therefore, we can write the else branch as above.\n\n But note: we must initialize best to 0? And if we never have an equality, best remains 0? That's correct because the problem says: they want to be fair. If they cannot, then the answer is 0? But note: they can always choose to eat 0 candies? But the problem says \"non-zero\" in the example? Actually, the example says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" So 0 is acceptable.\n\n However, what if we have an equality at multiple points? We are taking the maximum? That's correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the total number of candies over all test cases is at most 200000? So the two pointers will run in O(n) per test case? But note: the sum of n over all test cases is at most 200000? So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n But note: what if we move both and then i==j? Then we break? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n However, what if we move both and then i>j? Then we break? And we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n But what if we move both and then i<j? Then we update the sums? Then we continue? That's correct.\n\n But note: we must be cautious: we are updating the sums only in the else branch? And the if and elif branches update the sums? So the entire loop is:\n\n    while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n However, there is a problem: when we are in the else branch, we update the pointers and then we update the sums? Then we continue? But what if after updating the pointers we have i>=j? Then we break? So we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i==j? Then we break? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have lsum==rsum again? Then we update best? That's what we want.\n\n But note: we are updating the sums only if i<j? So if we have i==j, we break? Then we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have lsum==rsum? Then we update best? Then we move both again? Then we update the sums again? Then we continue? That's correct.\n\n However, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have lsum==rsum? Then we update best? Then we move both again? Then we update the sums? Then we continue? That's correct.\n\n But note: we are updating best with (i+1)+(n-j) at the moment we have the equality? That's the current state: Alice has eaten from 0 to i (i+1 candies) and Bob from j to n-1 (n-j candies). Then we move the pointers? Then we update the sums? Then we look for the next equality? That's correct.\n\n However, we must note: the total candies we are counting in best is the state before we move the pointers? Actually, we update best and then we move the pointers? So the state we are recording is the current state (with the current i and j). Then we move the pointers to the next ones? That's correct.\n\n Therefore, the code for the else branch is as above.\n\n But note: we must not forget to break the loop? Actually, we don't break the loop? We break by the condition? So we don't need to break.\n\n However, what if we move both and then we have i>=j? Then the while loop condition fails? So we break? That's okay.\n\n Therefore, we write:\n\n        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n But note: what if we move both and then we have i==j? Then we break? And we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\n However, what if we move both and then we have i<j? Then we update the sums? Then we continue? That's correct.\n\n But what if we move both and then we have i==j? Then we break? But we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n But what if we move both and then we have i>j? Then we break? And we have updated best? That's okay.\n\n However, there is a corner: what if we have an equality at the very beginning? Then we update best? Then we move both? Then we break? Then we output best? That's correct.\n\n But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we have i<j, and then we have an equality again? Then we update best? Then we move both? Then we break? Then we output best? That's correct.\n\n Therefore, we complete program1.py with the above block.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n We are given a string s of length n, consisting of 'W', 'R', 'B'. We are to determine if we can form the string by starting with all 'W' and then applying the stamp (which covers two adjacent cells and colors them as BR or RB) any number of times (and the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell).\n\n The provided code:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b=0\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # TODO: Your code here\n        print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n The idea: the code splits the string by 'W'. Why? Because white cells are not stamped? Actually, white cells are the initial state. The stamp always produces at least one non-white? But note: we can stamp over the same cell multiple times? However, the key observation is that the entire string must be partitioned into contiguous segments of non-white cells? And each contiguous segment of non-white cells must be formable by the stamp.\n\n How to form a contiguous segment? The stamp always stamps two adjacent cells. And we can use the stamp multiple times on the same cell? But note: the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So a segment of length 1 (a single non-white cell) is impossible? Because the stamp always covers two cells. Therefore, any contiguous segment of non-white cells must have at least two cells? Actually, no: because we can stamp multiple times? But consider: if we have a segment of length 1, how can we form it? We cannot use the stamp partially? So we must cover two cells? Therefore, we cannot form a segment of length 1.\n\n Also, note: the stamp always produces one 'R' and one 'B'. So in a contiguous segment, the counts of R and B must be such that we can form them? Actually, we can form any pattern? But note: we can only stamp adjacent cells? And we can cover the same cell multiple times? \n\n However, the problem has been studied: we can note that the entire pattern must satisfy:\n\n   - The pattern must be partitioned by white cells? And each contiguous non-white segment must be formable.\n\n   - In a contiguous non-white segment, what are the constraints?\n\n     Observation: \n        Operation: each stamping operation adds one R and one B to two adjacent cells.\n\n        Therefore, in any contiguous segment, the number of R and the number of B must be at least one? Actually, no: we can have a segment of length 2: one R and one B? That's one stamp. But what about a segment of length 3? \n\n        Example: \n          \"BRB\": \n            Step1: stamp the first two: becomes BR? then we stamp the second and third: but wait, the second is already R? and we stamp with the third: we can do? \n            Actually, we can do:\n                WWW -> stamp the middle and the last: becomes W and then we stamp the first two: \n                Step1: stamp positions 1 and 2: becomes W, then we get W, R, B? -> then we stamp positions 0 and 1: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R? -> then we have B, R, B? -> that matches.\n\n          How about \"RRB\"? \n            We cannot? because we need to have two adjacent cells to stamp? and we start with white. \n            How would we do? \n                Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: becomes R, B, W -> then we stamp positions1 and 2: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B? -> that matches? \n                But wait: we have R, B, W -> then we stamp positions1 and 2: the second becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B? -> that matches.\n\n          But note: the stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells? and we can cover the same cell multiple times? \n\n        However, note: the operation always flips the colors? Actually, no: the stamp sets the two cells to either BR or RB. So if we stamp a cell that is already non-white, it will be overwritten.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate? But the constraints: the total length is 10^5? We cannot simulate.\n\n        Alternate approach: \n          We note that the entire segment must have an even number of non-white cells? Actually, no: because we can stamp multiple times? But each stamp covers two cells? So the total number of stamps applied to the segment must be such that the total number of non-white cells is even? Actually, no: because a cell can be stamped multiple times? \n\n        However, note: each stamping operation changes two adjacent cells. But the entire segment must be covered? Actually, we can cover the same cell multiple times? So the total number of non-white cells can be arbitrary? \n\n        But wait: the problem says the stamp must completely fit? So we cannot stamp a segment that is not entirely within the contiguous segment? \n\n        Actually, we can stamp any two adjacent cells in the entire row? But the contiguous segment is the non-white part? We can stamp overlapping? \n\n        Insight: \n          The problem is equivalent to: can we partition the contiguous segment into pairs of adjacent cells? But not necessarily: because we can stamp multiple times? \n\n        Actually, we can use dynamic programming? But the constraints: total n over test cases is 10^5? and each segment? \n\n        However, there is a known solution: \n          - The entire picture must be partitioned by white cells. Each contiguous non-white segment must be non-empty and must have at least two cells? Actually, no: we can have a segment of length 0? But we split by 'W', so we get empty strings? \n\n          How about: \n            s = \"R\" -> split by 'W' -> ['R'] -> then we have a segment of length 1 -> impossible -> so answer \"NO\".\n\n            s = \"RB\" -> split by 'W' -> ['RB'] -> then we have a segment of length 2 -> possible? yes.\n\n            s = \"RBR\" -> split by 'W' -> ['RBR'] -> segment of length 3 -> possible? \n                We can do: \n                  Step1: stamp the first two: becomes RB? -> then we have RB and the third is still white? -> then we stamp the second and third: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B? -> but we wanted R, B, R? -> not matching.\n\n                Alternatively: \n                  Step1: stamp the last two: then we have W, BR -> then we stamp the first two: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R? -> then we have B, R, R? -> not matching.\n\n                How about stamping the middle and last first? \n                  Start: WWW -> stamp positions1 and 2: becomes W, R, B -> then stamp positions0 and 1: becomes B, R, B -> not matching.\n\n                How about stamping the same pair twice? \n                  Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: becomes RB, W -> then stamp positions0 and 1 again: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R? -> then we have B, R, W -> then stamp positions1 and 2: becomes B, B, R? -> not matching.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n                  Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: becomes RB, W -> then stamp positions0 and 1 again: becomes BR, W -> then we have B, R, W -> then we stamp positions1 and 2: becomes B, B, R? -> not matching.\n\n                It seems difficult? \n\n          Known solution from Codeforces problems (this is a known problem from Codeforces Round #770 (Div. 2), problem B): \n            The solution: \n              - Split the string by 'W'\n              - For each segment (which is a contiguous non-white segment), check:\n                  - If the segment is empty, skip.\n                  - Otherwise, if the length of the segment is 1, then it's impossible -> set flag to false.\n                  - Also, if the segment has at least two, but it consists of only one color? (like all 'R' or all 'B')? then it's impossible? \n\n            Why? \n              Because each stamp must put one R and one B. Therefore, in the entire segment, we must have at least one R and one B? \n\n            Example: \n              \"RR\" -> impossible? \n                How to form \"RR\"? \n                  We start with WW. \n                  We can stamp the two: then we get either BR or RB? not RR. \n                  Then we stamp again? But if we stamp the same two again: \n                    If we had BR, then stamping again with BR: \n                      The stamp sets to either BR or RB? so if we stamp BR again, we get BR? \n                    Or if we stamp with RB, we get RB? \n                  So we cannot get RR.\n\n            Therefore, we must have at least one R and one B in the segment.\n\n          So the condition for a segment is:\n            - The segment must have at least two characters? Actually, we already said length>=2? but wait: what if the segment is of length 2? and both are the same? then we cannot form it? \n            - Therefore, we require that the segment is not of length 1 and that the segment has at least one R and one B.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is \"RBRB\" (length 4)? \n            We can form it? \n            How? \n              Step1: stamp the first two: RB?? -> then we have RB and then two W? \n              Step2: stamp the last two: then we have RB and then RB? -> then we have RBRB? \n              But wait: we have R (from first) then B (from second) then R (from third) then B (from fourth)? -> that's RBRB? \n\n          But what if the segment is \"RRBB\"? \n            We can do:\n              Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> then we have RB and then two W? \n              Step2: stamp the next two: then we have RB and then RB? -> then we have RBRB? -> not RRBB.\n\n          How about:\n              Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: RB -> then we have R, B, W, W\n              Step2: stamp positions1 and 2: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B, W\n              Step3: stamp positions2 and 3: then the third becomes R and the fourth becomes B? -> then we have R, R, R, B? -> not RRBB.\n\n          How about:\n              Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: RB -> then we have R, B, W, W\n              Step2: stamp positions0 and 1 again: then we get BR? -> then we have B, R, W, W\n              Step3: stamp positions2 and 3: then we get B, R, R, B -> that's BRRB? not RRBB.\n\n          How about:\n              Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: RB -> then we have R, B, W, W\n              Step2: stamp positions1 and 2: then we have R, R, B, W -> then stamp positions2 and 3: then we have R, R, R, B -> not RRBB.\n\n          How about:\n              Step1: stamp positions0 and 1: RB -> then we have R, B, W, W\n              Step2: stamp positions0 and 1 again: then we get BR? -> then we have B, R, W, W\n              Step3: stamp positions1 and 2: then we have B, B, R, W -> then stamp positions2 and 3: then we have B, B, B, R -> not RRBB.\n\n          It seems difficult? \n\n          Actually, known solution: \n            We note that the entire segment must have at least one R and one B? \n            But \"RRBB\" has two R and two B? so that condition holds? \n\n          Alternate known solution from Codeforces: \n            We can do: \n              - Check that in every contiguous segment (without W) the following holds:\n                  - The segment must not be of length 1.\n                  - The segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          But \"RRBB\" has at least one R and one B? so it should be possible? \n\n          How? \n            We can do:\n              Step1: stamp the entire segment from left to right multiple times? \n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy: \n            We can form the pattern if and only if the pattern does not have a run of the same color of length 1 at the beginning or the end? \n\n          But note: we can start from anywhere? \n\n          Known solution from a similar problem (from Codeforces Round #770 (Div. 2), B. Fortune Telling): \n            Actually, the problem is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1634/problem/B\n\n          But wait, the problem we are solving is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1634/problem/C? \n\n          Actually, the problem in the note is from Codeforces Round #770 (Div. 2), problem B: Fortune Telling? \n\n          Correction: the problem we are solving is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1634/problem/B? \n\n          Actually, the problem description matches: https://codeforces.com/contest/1634/problem/B\n\n          But wait, the problem we are solving is: \"A row of n cells is given, ...\" -> that is problem B of that contest: https://codeforces.com/contest/1634/problem/B\n\n          Known solution for problem B: \n            We can form the pattern if and only if:\n              - There are no isolated R or B? meaning that every run of R or B must be at least 2? \n\n          But note: the sample: \n            \"BRB\" -> possible? \n            \"RRB\" -> possible? \n            \"RRBB\" -> possible? \n\n          Actually, the known solution is: \n            - Split the string by 'W'\n            - For each segment, if the segment is not empty:\n                if len(segment)==1 -> impossible.\n                else if the segment consists of only one color (like all 'R' or all 'B') -> impossible.\n            Otherwise, possible.\n\n          Why? \n            Because if we have a segment that is all 'R', then we cannot form it: because each stamp must put one R and one B? So we must have at least one B? Similarly for all 'B'.\n\n          Therefore, for each segment we check:\n            if segment != '':\n                if len(segment)==1:\n                    b = 1   # meaning we have an error\n                else:\n                    if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment:\n                        b = 1\n\n          Then at the end, if b==0 then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n          But note: the sample test cases:\n\n            Example 1: \"BRBBW\" -> \n                Split by 'W': ['BRBB', ''] -> \n                For 'BRBB': \n                  length>=2 -> ok.\n                  contains 'R' and 'B' -> ok.\n\n            Example 2: \"RR\" -> \n                Split: ['RR'] -> \n                length>=2 -> ok.\n                but 'B' not in 'RR' -> error.\n\n            Example 3: \"BRB\" -> \n                ['BRB'] -> \n                length>=2 -> ok.\n                contains both 'R' and 'B' -> ok.\n\n            Example 4: \"B\" -> \n                ['B'] -> length=1 -> error.\n\n            Example 5: \"R\" -> \n                ['R'] -> error.\n\n            Example 6: \"WB\" -> \n                split: ['', 'B'] -> \n                segment 'B' -> length=1 -> error.\n\n            Example 7: \"RW\" -> \n                split: ['R', ''] -> \n                segment 'R' -> length=1 -> error.\n\n            Example 8: \"W\" -> \n                split: ['',''] -> no non-empty segment -> ok.\n\n            Example 9: \"WW\" -> ok.\n\n            Example 10: \"RRR\" -> \n                split: ['RRR'] -> \n                no 'B' -> error.\n\n          But the sample test cases from the problem:\n\n            The first test case: \"BRB\" -> YES (as per the example) -> our method says YES.\n\n            The second, third, and fourth test cases: \n                \"B\", \"R\", \"W\" -> \n                For \"B\": n=1 -> our method: segment ['B'] -> error -> NO -> matches.\n\n            The fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> YES -> matches.\n\n            The sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> \n                split: ['RBB'] -> \n                has 'R' and 'B' -> YES.\n\n            The seventh test case: \"W\" -> YES.\n\n          But the problem says for the fifth test case: \n                Input: \"BWB\"\n                But wait: the example says: \n                  \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W_RB \u2192 BRB\" \n                Actually, the fifth test case: \n                  n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> we already did.\n\n          The sixth test case: \n                \"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W_RB \u2192 RB_B\" \n                -> s = \"RBB\" \n                But the example output is \"RBB\" -> \n                We have: \n                  segment = \"RBB\" -> has 'R' and 'B' -> YES.\n\n          However, the example input for the sixth test case is: \"RBB\", and we output YES.\n\n          But the problem says: \n            The sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> YES.\n\n          Therefore, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n            We split the string by 'W'.

We can break the inner loop if we already set b=1? But the problem says we can output \"NO\" as soon as we find one invalid segment? However, we can break the inner loop? But the code does not break, it sets b=1 and then continues? That's okay.\n\n          However, we can break early? But the problem does not require it? and the total length is bounded? so we can do without.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5? and we are processing each segment? so worst-case we do 10^5 per test case? but the total n is 10^5? so worst-case one test case with n=10^5? then we do 10^5? which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b=1\n                elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b=1\n\n          But note: we can combine:\n\n            for seg in s.strip().split('W'):   # but the code uses s[:-1] to remove the newline? but the last character might be newline? \n            Actually, the input: \n                The first line: t\n                Then for each test case: \n                    n\n                    s (which has n characters and then a newline? so s has n+1 characters? then s[:-1] is the string without the newline.\n\n            But the code: \n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n                    # s is a string that includes the newline? so s[:-1] removes the newline.\n\n            Then we split by 'W'. \n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg != '':\n                    if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          But wait: if the segment is not empty, then:\n            if it has length 1 -> invalid.\n            if it has no 'R' or no 'B' -> invalid.\n\n          However, note: if the segment has no 'R', then 'R' not in seg -> True -> set b=1.\n          Similarly, if the segment has no 'B', then 'B' not in seg -> True -> set b=1.\n\n          But what if the segment has both? then we skip.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    b=1\n                else:\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          Or more concisely:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg and (len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                    b=1\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if seg is non-empty and (either the length is 1 or (the segment has no R or no B)) -> then invalid.\n\n          However, if the segment has no R, then we set b=1? even if the length is more than 1? that's what we want.\n\n          But wait: the condition is: \n            (len(seg)==1) OR ('R' not in seg) OR ('B' not in seg)\n\n          We want: \n            if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n            if the segment has no R -> invalid.\n            if the segment has no B -> invalid.\n\n          So the condition is: \n            if (len(seg)==1) or (not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg)):\n\n          Which is equivalent to: \n            if (len(seg)==1) or (len(set(seg))==1):   # because if it has only one color, then set(seg) has one element? but wait: if it has only 'R', then set(seg)={'R'}, if it has only 'B', then set(seg)={'B'}, if it has both, then set(seg) has two.\n\n          But we can avoid set? because the string might be long? but the total length is bounded? and the segments are contiguous? and the total n is 10^5? so it's acceptable? but the condition with 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg is O(n) per segment? and the total length of all segments is the total non-white characters? which is <= total n? so it's O(n) overall.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg != '':\n                    if len(seg)==1:\n                        b=1\n                    elif 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if the segment is non-empty and (if the length is 1 OR (if the segment has no R or no B)) -> then invalid.\n\n          Actually, we can write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                nseg = len(seg)\n                if nseg>0:\n                    if nseg==1 or (not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg)):\n                        b=1\n\n          But the condition \"not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg)\" is equivalent to \" 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg \".\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg:   # non-empty\n                    if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b = 1\n\n          However, note: if the segment is \"R\" -> then len(seg)==1 -> set b=1 -> correct.\n          if the segment is \"RR\" -> then len(seg)=2, but 'B' not in seg -> set b=1 -> correct.\n          if the segment is \"RB\" -> then len(seg)=2, and 'R' in seg and 'B' in seg -> skip -> correct.\n\n          But what if the segment is \"RBR\" -> \n            len(seg)=3, and 'R' in seg and 'B' in seg -> skip -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, we use:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg: \n                    if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if (len(seg)==1) OR ('R' not in seg) OR ('B' not in seg)\n\n          This is equivalent to: \n            if (len(seg)==1) OR (the segment is missing at least one color)\n\n          That's what we want.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          But note: the variable name in the for loop is 'i', which is the segment.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg: \n                    if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        b=1\n\n          But the provided loop variable is named 'i'. So we keep it as 'i':\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5? and we are doing this for each segment? the total length of the string is 10^5? so it's acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: the else branch code as a string.\n            program2: the inner for loop body as a string? but the TODO is in the for loop? so we output the entire for loop body? Actually, the TODO is to complete the for loop body? \n\n          But the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we must complete the for loop body? \n\n          We write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          But note: we must not break the existing code? the next line is: \n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          So we indent the body.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code? and the missing code is the body of the for loop? \n\n          But the TODO is in the for loop? so we write the body.\n\n          But note: the provided code has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We must replace the TODO with the body? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, we output the string for the else branch.\n\n          For program2.py, we output the string for the for loop body.\n\n          However, the output format is JSON: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion1\", \"program2\": \"completion2\"}\n\n          We must escape the string? but the problem does not specify, so we assume we can write the string as is.\n\n          For program1.py, the completion is:\n\n            \"        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\n        i += 1\\n        j -= 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            lsum += arr[i]\\n            rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n          But note: the code is indented? we must preserve the indentation? \n\n          The existing code in program1.py has:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with 5 lines of code? and we must indent them appropriately? \n\n          The current else branch is at the same indentation as the if and elif. The code we write should be indented one level more.\n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code? meaning the code that goes in the else branch? \n\n          We write:\n\n            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n          But we must write it as a string? and we must preserve the exact indentation? \n\n          The existing code in the else branch is indented by 8 spaces? and the if/elif are at 8 spaces? then the body of else should be 12 spaces? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation? but we assume 4 spaces per level.\n\n          The existing code:\n\n                while i < j:\n                    if lsum < rsum:\n                        i += 1\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                    elif rsum < lsum:\n                        j -= 1\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                        best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n                        i += 1\n                        j -= 1\n                        if i < j:\n                            lsum += arr[i]\n                            rsum += arr[j]\n\n          But note: the existing else: is at 12 spaces?

\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? but the problem says the program must run? so we must match.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the language is Python, we must be consistent.\n\n          We assume the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? and the else branch body is at level 2 (so 8 spaces) and the body of the else should be at level 3 (12 spaces) and the if inside the else body should be at level 4 (16 spaces)? \n\n          But the existing code in the if and elif branches are at 8 spaces? \n\n          Therefore, we write the same for the else body: 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the existing code:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n          The body of the if is at 8 spaces? \n\n          So the body of the else should be at 8 spaces? \n\n          But the else: is at 8 spaces? and the body should be indented one more? so 12 spaces? \n\n          This is inconsistent? \n\n          Actually, the code in the problem is:\n\n    while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The body of the if, elif, else are all at the same indentation? \n\n          But the body of the if is two lines: \n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n          These are indented one level more than the if? \n\n          Therefore, the else body should be indented one level more than the else: \n\n          So we write:\n\n            else:\n                ...   # 4 more spaces\n\n          Therefore, the code for the else body should be at 12 spaces? \n\n          But the existing comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n          So we write:\n\n            \"            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\n            i += 1\\n            j -= 1\\n            if i < j:\\n                lsum += arr[i]\\n                rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n          This is 12 spaces for the first three lines, and 16 for the last two? \n\n          But note: the total length of the program1.py code? we are replacing the TODO with 5 lines? \n\n          For program2.py, the completion is the body of the for loop? \n\n          We write:\n\n            \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b=1\"\n\n          But the for loop body should be indented? \n\n          The existing for loop is:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          The body should be indented one level? \n\n          We write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'): \n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          So the body is:\n\n                if i: \n                    if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b=1\n\n          We can write it as:\n\n            \"    if i:\\n        if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b=1\"\n\n          But the existing code has the for loop at 4 spaces? then the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b=0\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n        print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          The for loop body is missing? we are to put the body at 8 spaces? \n\n          So we write:\n\n            \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b=1\"\n\n          This is 8, 12, 16 spaces? \n\n          But note: we can write in one line? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\"\n\n          But that might be less clear? \n\n          We choose:\n\n            \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b=1\"\n\n          But note: the condition can be combined:\n\n            \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\"\n\n          This is two lines? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            \"        if i and (len(i) == 1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\n          But the problem does not require efficiency? \n\n          We choose the combined condition for brevity.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py:\n\n            \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\"\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if i and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)):\n\n          This is not the same as:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n\n          But they are the same? \n\n          However, the condition: \n            if i and (A or B or C)\n\n          is equivalent to: \n            if i is non-empty and (A or B or C) is true.\n\n          And we want: if the segment is non-empty and (if the segment has length 1 or if it has no R or no B) then set b=1.\n\n          So it's the same.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\"\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n          This is true if i is non-empty and at least one of the three conditions holds: \n            len(i)==1, or 'R' not in i, or 'B' not in i.\n\n          That's what we want.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\n            i += 1\\n            j -= 1\\n            if i < j:\\n                lsum += arr[i]\\n                rsum += arr[j]\"\n            program2: \"        if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b=1\"\n\n          But wait: in program1, the code we output has 12 spaces at the beginning? and the existing else: is at 8 spaces? then the body should be 12? so that's correct.\n\n          In program2, the for loop body is at 8 spaces? and the condition is at 8 spaces? but we have:\n\n            for i in ...:\n                ...   # 8 spaces\n\n          Then the condition: \n                if ...:   # 8 spaces? \n\n          But the existing for loop is at 8 spaces? (because the outer for loop is at 4 spaces? and the body of the outer for loop is at 8 spaces? and the inner for loop is at 8 spaces? then the body of the inner for loop should be 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b=0\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n        print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          The inner for loop body is missing? we are to put the body at 12 spaces? \n\n          But we wrote 8 spaces? \n\n          We must write 12 spaces? \n\n          Therefore, for program2, we write:\n\n            \"            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n                b=1\"\n\n          This is 12 spaces for the if and 16 for the b=1? \n\n          But the existing code: the inner for loop is at 8 spaces? so the body should be 12 spaces? \n\n          So we write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b=1\n\n          But the indentation: the first line of the body is 12 spaces? the second line is 16? \n\n          We write:\n\n            \"            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n                b=1\"\n\n          Therefore, the JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\n            i += 1\\n            j -= 1\\n            if i < j:\\n                lsum += arr[i]\\n                rsum += arr[j]\",\n                \"program2\": \"            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n                b=1\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program2 code: the condition is long? we can break it? but we don't have to.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write without newlines? but the problem does not specify.\n\n          We output the JSON as a string.\n\n          However, we must escape newlines? but the problem does not specify? we assume we can use literal newlines.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is multiple lines? so we use newlines.\n\n          We write the JSON string with the newlines.\n\n          But note: the JSON standard: we can use \\n in a string.\n\n          However, the problem does not require JSON, but the output format is JSON? \n\n          We output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"            best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\\n            i += 1\\n            j -= 1\\n            if i < j:\\n                lsum += arr[i]\\n                rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n                b=1\"}\n\n          But we must be cautious: the program2 code has a colon and parentheses? and we are putting it in a string? that's okay.\n\n          We output this.\n\n          However, note: the program2 code: the condition has single quotes? and the JSON string uses double quotes? so we don't need to escape.\n\n          Therefore, we output the above.\n\n          But wait: the program1 code: we have (i+1) and (n - j) -> that's correct.\n\n          And program2: we have 'R' and 'B' in single quotes? that's correct.\n\n          We are done."
