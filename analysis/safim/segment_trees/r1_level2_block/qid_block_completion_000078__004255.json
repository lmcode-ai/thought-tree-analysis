Then ans += abs(1)+abs(0)=1. Column1:\n        a1=0, x1=1 -> s0 += 0-1 = -1 -> s0=0\n        b1=0, y1=0 -> s1=0 Then no while loops, ans += 0 -> total ans=1. Then at the end: s0=0, s1=0 -> output 1.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given n, and then four lines: the current two rows and the desired two rows.\n However, note: the input has two lines for the current arrangement and two lines for the desired arrangement.\n\n But the code reads:\n   a, b, x, y = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n\n Actually, that would read 4 lines. The first two lines are the current arrangement: \n   first row: a = list of n integers\n   second row: b = list of n integers\n Then the next two lines are the desired arrangement:\n   first row: x = list of n integers\n   second row: y = list of n integers\n\n However, the problem states: \n   The first line contains n, then the next two lines are the current arrangement, then the next two lines are the desired.\n\n But note: the code above reads 4 lines. The first line of the input is actually n, so we have:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   Then we read 4 lines? Actually, the next two lines are the current, then two for desired.\n\n But the code reads 4 lines. So:\n\n   Line 1: current first row -> a\n   Line 2: current second row -> b\n   Line 3: desired first row -> x\n   Line 4: desired second row -> y\n\n However, the problem says: \n   \"Following two lines describe the current arrangement\" -> so that's two lines after the first (which is n).\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says that the puzzle has 2 rows and n columns.\n\n The idea in the code:\n\n We are iterating column by column. For each column i, we have:\n   a[i] (current top), b[i] (current bottom), x[i] (desired top), y[i] (desired bottom)\n\n We maintain two variables: s0 and s1.\n   s0: the cumulative difference in the top row from the desired top row? Actually, the code does:\n\n      s0 += a[i] - x[i]   (because: s0 += m; s0 -= p; where m is a[i] and p is x[i])\n      s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n\n But note: we are iterating column by column and accumulating the differences.\n\n However, the problem requires that we can swap adjacent cells (neighbors). How does that relate?\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We note that the entire grid has 2n cells. The total number of ones (and zeros) must be the same in the current and desired arrangement. \n But note: the problem does not require that? Actually, if the total ones are different, then it's impossible.\n\n However, the code at the end checks if s0==0 and s1==0? But note: we are accumulating per column. Actually, at the end of the loop, we have:\n\n   s0 = (sum of a) - (sum of x)\n   s1 = (sum of b) - (sum of y)\n\n But that is not the same as the entire grid? Actually, the entire grid: \n   total ones in current = sum(a) + sum(b)\n   total ones in desired = sum(x) + sum(y)\n\n So if these totals are different, we should output -1. However, the code only checks s0 and s1 at the end? But note: s0 + s1 = (sum(a)+sum(b)) - (sum(x)+sum(y)). \n So if s0+s1 != 0, then the total ones are different -> impossible.\n\n But the code checks: if s0 or s1 (non-zero) then print -1. However, note that s0 and s1 are independent? Actually, we require both to be zero.\n\n However, if the total ones are the same, then s0 + s1 = 0. But that does not imply s0=0 and s1=0? For example, if s0=1 and s1=-1, then s0+s1=0. \n But wait: the problem does not require that the top row has the same number of ones? It only requires the entire grid to have the same ones? \n\n However, the problem says: we are allowed to swap adjacent cells. This operation does not change the total number of ones in the entire grid. So if the total ones in the entire grid are different, then it's impossible. \n\n But note: the code does not check the entire grid? It checks the top row and bottom row separately? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require the top row to have the same ones as the desired top row? It only requires the entire grid to have the same ones? \n\n However, the problem says: we are rearranging the cells. The entire grid must be rearranged arbitrarily? But note: we can only swap adjacent cells. So the entire grid is connected. Therefore, any permutation of the 2n cells is possible? \n\n But wait: the grid is 2xN. The graph is connected, so any permutation is possible? Actually, the parity of the permutation might matter? However, the problem does not say anything about the labels? \n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire grid to be rearranged arbitrarily? It requires the grid to become the desired arrangement. \n\n However, the key is: the total number of ones must be the same. So if the total ones in the current grid is not the same as the desired grid, we output -1.\n\n But the code: \n   s0 = (sum of a) - (sum of x)   -> the difference in the top row? \n   s1 = (sum of b) - (sum of y)   -> the difference in the bottom row.\n\n And at the end, if s0 != 0 or s1 != 0, we output -1. \n\n However, note: the entire grid: \n   current: total = (sum(a)+sum(b))\n   desired: total = (sum(x)+sum(y))\n\n So if (sum(a)+sum(b)) != (sum(x)+sum(y)), then we output -1. But the condition in the code is: \n   if s0 or s1: then -1.\n\n But if s0 != 0 OR s1 != 0, then we output -1. However, if the entire grid total is the same, then s0+s1=0. But that does not imply s0=0 and s1=0. \n\n Example: \n   current: a = [1,0], b=[0,0] -> total ones = 1.\n   desired: x = [0,1], y=[0,0] -> total ones = 1.\n\n   Then: \n        s0 = (1+0) - (0+1) = 1-1 = 0? \n        But wait: we are accumulating per column.\n\n   How does the loop work?\n\n   Column0: \n        a0=1, x0=0 -> s0 += 1 - 0 = 1 -> s0=1\n        b0=0, y0=0 -> s1 += 0 -> s1=0\n   Then we do the while loops: \n        Condition: s0>0 and s1<0? -> no.\n        Then: s0<0 and s1>0? -> no.\n        Then ans += abs(1)+abs(0)=1.\n\n   Column1:\n        a1=0, x1=1 -> s0 += 0-1 = -1 -> s0=0\n        b1=0, y1=0 -> s1=0\n        Then no while loops, ans += 0 -> total ans=1.\n\n   Then at the end: s0=0, s1=0 -> output 1.\n\n   But the example: \n        We have to swap the top-left (1) with the top-right (0) to get [0,0] in top and then [1,0] in top? \n        Actually, we have:\n            current: \n                top: [1,0]\n                bottom: [0,0]\n            desired:\n                top: [0,1]\n                bottom: [0,0]\n\n        How to do? \n            We can swap (1,1) and (1,2): \n                becomes: top: [0,1] and bottom: [0,0] -> done in 1 move.\n\n        So the answer 1 is correct.\n\n   But note: the code does not check the entire grid total? It checks the per-row accumulation? \n\n   Actually, the condition at the end: if s0 or s1 -> then -1. In this example, after the last column, s0=0 and s1=0 -> so it's okay.\n\n   However, what if the entire grid total is the same, but the top row has a different total? \n        Example: \n            current: \n                top: [1,1] -> sum=2\n                bottom: [0,0] -> sum=0\n            desired:\n                top: [1,0] -> sum=1\n                bottom: [1,0] -> sum=1\n\n            total ones: 2 in both.\n\n            Then:\n                s0 = (1+1) - (1+0) = 2-1 = 1 -> after first column: \n                    col0: top: 1-1=0 -> s0=0? then col1: top: 1-0=1 -> s0=1 -> then at the end s0=1, s1=0 -> output -1.\n\n            But is it impossible? \n\n            We have:\n                current: \n                    top: [1,1]\n                    bottom: [0,0]\n                desired:\n                    top: [1,0]\n                    bottom: [1,0]\n\n            How to do?\n                We can swap (1,2) and (2,2): \n                    becomes: \n                        top: [1,0]\n                        bottom: [0,1] -> not the desired.\n\n                Then swap (2,1) and (2,2): \n                    becomes: \n                        top: [1,0]\n                        bottom: [1,0] -> done in 2 moves.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n   What went wrong? \n\n   The problem: the code is accumulating the differences per column and then trying to fix the differences by two while loops that only fix when one is positive and the other negative? \n\n   The algorithm:\n\n        s0 = 0, s1 = 0, ans = 0\n        for each column i:\n            s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n            s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n\n            while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                ... (we do something that increases ans by 1, and then s0 decreases by 1 and s1 increases by 1? Actually, the code for the other while loop is: \n                while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    s0 += 1\n                    s1 -= 1\n\n            Then we do: ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)   -> but wait, that would be for the entire column? \n\n        Then at the end, if s0 or s1 is not zero, we output -1? Actually, we break the loop and then check at the end.\n\n   But in the example above:\n\n        n=2\n        a = [1,1] -> current top\n        b = [0,0] -> current bottom\n        x = [1,0] -> desired top\n        y = [1,0] -> desired bottom\n\n        Column0:\n            a0=1, x0=1 -> s0 += 0 -> s0=0\n            b0=0, y0=1 -> s1 += -1 -> s1=-1\n            Then: \n                while s0>0 and s1<0: no (s0=0 not >0)\n                while s0<0 and s1>0: no (s0=0 not <0, s1=-1 not>0)\n            Then ans += abs(0)+abs(-1) = 1 -> ans=1.\n\n        Column1:\n            a1=1, x1=0 -> s0 += 1 -> s0=1\n            b1=0, y1=0 -> s1 += 0 -> s1=-1\n            Then:\n                while s0>0 and s1<0: yes -> we enter the first while loop? But the code only has one while loop for the opposite condition? \n\n        The code has:\n            while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                ... (but the code for that is missing, we have to complete it)\n\n            while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                ans += 1\n                s0 += 1\n                s1 -= 1\n\n        So we have to complete the first while loop.\n\n        The idea: \n            We have s0>0 and s1<0. This means that the top row has an excess of 1's (or a deficit of 0's) and the bottom row has a deficit of 1's (excess of 0's). \n            We can fix this by swapping a 1 from the top to the bottom? But note: we are at column i, and we can only swap adjacent cells. However, the algorithm is processing column by column and we are allowed to do swaps arbitrarily? \n\n        How does the algorithm account for swaps? \n\n        The insight: \n            We can use the fact that we can swap adjacent cells to transfer a 1 from the top row to the bottom row (or vice versa) but only if they are in adjacent columns? Actually, we can do a series of swaps to move a 1 from the top row at column i to the bottom row at column j, but that would be expensive.\n\n        However, note the problem asks for minimal steps. The above greedy per column might not be optimal? \n\n        Alternate known solution for this problem:\n\n            We note that the entire grid is a permutation of the desired grid. The minimal number of adjacent swaps is the inversion if we consider the entire grid as a linear array? But it's 2xN, so we can linearize? \n\n            However, the grid has two rows. We can consider the positions. But note: the problem is known and the solution is to use a state machine and note that the only important thing is the difference in the top row and the bottom row per column? \n\n        Known solution from similar problems (like CodeForces problems):\n\n            We define:\n                d[i] = (a[i] - x[i])   # for the top row per column\n                e[i] = (b[i] - y[i])   # for the bottom row per column\n\n            Then we maintain two variables: top_extra, bottom_extra (which are the cumulative differences in the top and bottom row from the desired, respectively).\n\n            Then we traverse from left to right. For each column i:\n                top_extra += d[i]\n                bottom_extra += e[i]\n\n                Now, if top_extra is positive and bottom_extra is negative, we can use one swap to move a 1 from top to bottom? But note: we can only swap adjacent cells. However, we can simulate moving a 1 from the top of column i to the bottom of column i? But that is not adjacent? They are vertically adjacent? \n\n            Actually, we can swap vertically adjacent cells? The problem says: neighboring if |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|=1. So vertically adjacent (same column) is allowed? \n\n            But note: the grid is 2 rows. So in the same column, the top and bottom are adjacent. So we can swap (1,i) and (2,i) without affecting the other columns? \n\n            However, the problem does not say we can only swap in the same column? We can swap horizontally as well. \n\n            But the key: we are processing column by column. We can fix the current column by swapping vertically? \n\n            However, the example: \n                Column0: \n                    top_extra = 0, bottom_extra = -1 (from the example above) -> we cannot fix by vertical swap because we don't have a 1 in the top to give to the bottom? Actually, at column0 we have:\n                        current: top=1, bottom=0 -> we have a 1 in top and 0 in bottom.\n                        desired: top=1, bottom=1 -> so we need a 1 in the bottom? \n                    But we have an extra 0 in the top? Actually, we don't have an extra 1 in the top? \n\n            How about we look at the entire grid? \n\n            The known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) is:\n\n                total = 0\n                top_extra = 0\n                bottom_extra = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    top_extra += a[i] - x[i]\n                    bottom_extra += b[i] - y[i]\n                    if top_extra > 0 and bottom_extra < 0:\n                        # we can transfer one from top to bottom\n                        # but we can only do if we have a 1 in top and 0 in bottom? \n                        # actually, we are accumulating the difference: \n                        #   top_extra>0 means we have an extra 1 in top (or deficit of 0) and bottom_extra<0 means we need a 1 in bottom (or have an extra 0)\n                        # so we can swap the top and bottom in the same column? \n                        # but note: we are at column i, and we can do a vertical swap? \n                        # However, we are processing from left to right. We can do a vertical swap at column i? \n                        # But what if the current column doesn't have a 1 in top and 0 in bottom? It might have been changed by previous swaps? \n\n                    Similarly for the other case.\n\n            Actually, we don't need to know the exact configuration. The idea is that we can use a vertical swap to transfer one unit from top to bottom (or vice versa) at the cost of one move. \n\n            Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n                ans = 0\n                top_extra = 0\n                bottom_extra = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    top_extra += a[i] - x[i]\n                    bottom_extra += b[i] - y[i]\n\n                    # If we can fix by transferring between top and bottom in the same column?\n                    if top_extra > 0 and bottom_extra < 0:\n                        # We can do a vertical swap: this will take one move and then:\n                        #   we remove one from top_extra and add one to bottom_extra? \n                        #   so: top_extra -= 1, bottom_extra += 1\n                        #   and we do ans += 1\n                        # But note: we can do min(top_extra, -bottom_extra) times? \n                        # However, we are in a loop per column. We can do one swap per column? \n                        # Actually, we can do as many as we can? But the problem: we are at column i, and we can do multiple swaps? \n                        # But the minimal moves: we can do one swap and then update the differences.\n\n                        # However, the known solution does:\n\n                        #   t = min(top_extra, -bottom_extra)\n                        #   top_extra -= t\n                        #   bottom_extra += t\n                        #   ans += t\n\n                        # Similarly for the other case.\n\n                    elif top_extra < 0 and bottom_extra > 0:\n                        # t = min(-top_extra, bottom_extra)\n                        # top_extra += t\n                        # bottom_extra -= t\n                        # ans += t\n\n                    # Then, we add the absolute values? \n                    # But note: after transferring, we might still have differences. Then we have to carry the difference to the next column? \n\n                    # How? The problem: we can also swap horizontally? \n\n                    # Actually, we can also swap horizontally to move an extra 1 to the next column? \n\n                    # The known solution: \n                    #   ans += abs(top_extra) + abs(bottom_extra)\n\n                    # But wait: why? \n\n                    # Explanation: \n                    #   The horizontal swaps: if we have an extra 1 in the top row at column i, we can swap it to column i+1? That would require one swap? \n                    #   But then we are moving the problem to the next column. \n\n                    # However, the accumulation: we are already accumulating the differences. The horizontal movement is accounted for by the accumulation? \n\n                    # But note: the absolute value of top_extra and bottom_extra at the end of the column must be carried to the next? \n\n                    # Actually, the known solution does not do that. It does:\n\n                    #   ans += abs(top_extra) + abs(bottom_extra)\n\n                    # and then sets top_extra and bottom_extra to zero? \n\n                    # But that is not what we do. We carry the differences to the next column.\n\n            However, the code we are to complete does:\n\n                for ...:\n                    s0 += ... \n                    s1 += ...\n\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                        ... (we do one swap: so we do one at a time, not min)\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                    ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n            But note: the example we had:\n\n                Column0: s0=0, s1=-1 -> then we do nothing in the while loops, then ans += 0+1 = 1 -> then we move to next column.\n\n                Column1: s0 becomes 1 (because a1=1, x1=0) and s1 remains -1? Actually, we had s1=-1 from the previous column? \n\n            How does the accumulation work? \n\n                We are accumulating the differences. The horizontal swaps are not explicitly done? \n\n            Actually, the horizontal swaps are not needed to be done explicitly because we are allowed to carry the difference to the next column? \n\n            The idea: \n                The absolute value we add at the end of the column is the cost to \"store\" the imbalance for the next column? \n\n            But why? \n\n            Consider: if we have an extra 1 in the top row at column i, we can leave it there and then in the next column we can use it? But that doesn't cost a move? \n\n            Actually, the moves are not stored. The minimal moves is the sum of the absolute values of the accumulated differences? \n\n            However, the known solution for the example we had (which is the same as the example in the problem) is 5? \n\n            The problem example: \n                n=5\n                current: \n                    top: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n                    bottom: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n                desired:\n                    top: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n                    bottom: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n            How to compute with our algorithm?\n\n                We'll compute per column:\n\n                Column0: \n                    a0=1, x0=1 -> s0 += 0 -> s0=0\n                    b0=0, y0=0 -> s1 += 0 -> s1=0\n                    then: no while, ans += 0 -> ans=0.\n\n                Column1:\n                    a1=1, x1=0 -> s0 += 1 -> s0=1\n                    b1=0, y1=1 -> s1 += -1 -> s1=-1\n                    Then: \n                         while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                             we do: ??? (we have to complete the code)\n\n                The code has two while loops: \n                    while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                         ... (we are missing this part)\n\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0: \n                         ans += 1; s0+=1; s1-=1\n\n                For the first while loop, we should do the symmetric:\n\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                         ans += 1\n                         s0 -= 1\n                         s1 += 1\n\n                Then for column1:\n                    we enter the first while: \n                         ans=1, s0=0, s1=0.\n                    then we break the while.\n                    then ans += abs(0)+abs(0)=0 -> total ans=1.\n\n                Column2:\n                    a2=1, x2=0 -> s0=1\n                    b2=0, y2=0 -> s1=0\n                    then: \n                         while: no\n                         ans += abs(1)+abs(0)=1 -> ans=2.\n\n                Column3:\n                    a3=0, x3=1 -> s0 = 1-1 = 0 -> then s0=0+(-1) = -1? \n                         Actually: s0 = (current accumulated) + (0-1) = 0 -1 = -1\n                    b3=1, y3=0 -> s1 = 0 + (1-0)=1\n                    Then: \n                         while s0<0 and s1>0: \n                             ans += 1 -> ans=3\n                             s0 += 1 -> s0=0\n                             s1 -= 1 -> s1=0\n                    then ans += 0 -> total ans=3.\n\n                Column4:\n                    a4=0, x4=0 -> s0=0\n                    b4=1, y4=1 -> s1=0\n                    ans remains 3.\n\n                Then at the end: s0=0, s1=0 -> output 3.\n\n            But the example says the answer is 5.\n\n            So what is wrong?\n\n            The known solution for the example is 5. \n\n            How do we get 5?\n\n            We must account for the fact that the horizontal swaps are also needed. \n\n            The algorithm we are using is:\n\n                s0 = 0, s1 = 0, ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n                    s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n\n                    # vertical swaps: we can fix one unit at a time if we have s0>0 and s1<0, or vice versa.\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 -= 1\n                        s1 += 1\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                    ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n            But then we get 3 for the example, but expected 5.\n\n            Why? \n\n            The absolute values at the end of the column: what do they represent? \n\n            They represent the amount of \"imbalance\" that we have to carry over to the next column? But note: we are not actually doing the horizontal swaps? \n\n            How do we account for horizontal swaps? \n\n            Consider: if we have an extra 1 in the top row at column i, we can swap it to the right (if there is a 0 in the top row at column i+1) and that would cost one swap. But then the extra 1 moves to column i+1. \n\n            The algorithm: \n                We are accumulating the differences. The absolute value we add at the end of the column is the cost to move the extra 1 (or 0) to the next column? \n\n            But note: we are not actually moving it? We are just accounting for the fact that we will have to move it eventually? \n\n            However, the minimal number of swaps to move an extra 1 from column i to column i+1 is 1? But if we have multiple, we have to move each one? \n\n            But the absolute value we add is the total extra in the top and bottom? \n\n            Why not just the absolute value of the sum? \n\n            Actually, the known solution from CodeForces for this problem (problem name: \"Puzzle From the Future\", but note: the example matches a known problem: \"Puzzle From the Future\" but the example input is different) \n\n            After research, a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces Round #696 (Div. 2), problem D) is:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                c = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                d = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                # But wait, we have two rows for current and two for desired.\n\n                s1 = s2 = 0\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s1 += a[i] - c[i]\n                    s2 += b[i] - d[i]\n                    if s1 > 0 and s2 < 0:\n                        t = min(s1, -s2)\n                        ans += t\n                        s1 -= t\n                        s2 += t\n                    elif s1 < 0 and s2 > 0:\n                        t = min(-s1, s2)\n                        ans += t\n                        s1 += t\n                        s2 -= t\n                    ans += abs(s1) + abs(s2)\n\n                if s1 != 0 or s2 != 0:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    print(ans)\n\n            But this gives 3 for the example, not 5.\n\n            Another known solution (from a similar problem) is:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                c = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                d = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                top_extra = 0\n                bottom_extra = 0\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    top_extra += a[i] - c[i]\n                    bottom_extra += b[i] - d[i]\n                    if top_extra > 0 and bottom_extra < 0:\n                        # We can transfer from top to bottom\n                        t = min(top_extra, -bottom_extra)\n                        ans += t\n                        top_extra -= t\n                        bottom_extra += t\n                    elif top_extra < 0 and bottom_extra > 0:\n                        t = min(-top_extra, bottom_extra)\n                        ans += t\n                        top_extra += t\n                        bottom_extra -= t\n                    # Then we add the absolute values?

That might be O(n) per column, worst-case O(n^2) which is 40e9 for n=200000.\n\n                So we must change to use the min version.\n\n                However, the code we are to complete is fixed: it has while loops. \n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n                The missing block is only the first while loop. We are to complete:\n\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n                And the second while loop is given as:\n\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                We should do the symmetric for the first while loop.\n\n                But note: if we do one at a time, it might be too slow.\n\n                However, the problem constraints: n, m up to 200000. The while loop might run up to 200000 iterations per column? worst-case total O(n^2) which is 40e9 in Python.\n\n                We must avoid that.\n\n                Therefore, we should not use while loops that run many times. We should use:\n\n                    if s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n                    if s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        t = min(-s0, s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 += t\n                        s1 -= t\n\n                But the code structure has while loops. The problem says: \"Complete the code\", and the code has while loops.\n\n                However, the while loops as written (one at a time) will work correctly but might be slow.\n\n                But note: the values of s0 and s1 are bounded by the total number of ones, which is at most 200000, but the while loop in one column might run up to 200000 times, and then the next column might also run 200000 times, so worst-case total 40000000, which is 40e6, which might be borderline in Pyton (0.5 seconds?).\n\n                But 40e6 iterations in Python might be 2-4 seconds, which is too slow.\n\n                Therefore, we must change to the min version.\n\n                Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the first while loop, we can do:\n\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        # But we do one step at a time.\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 -= 1\n                        s1 += 1\n\n                But then we risk TLE.\n\n                However, the problem might have intended the min version, and the while loop is a mistake. \n\n                Given the known solution uses the min version, and the problem constraints, we should use the min version.\n\n                But the code structure has while loops. We can change the while loop to if and break after one step? That would be wrong.\n\n                Or we can do:\n\n                    if s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n\n                and similarly for the other. But the code has while loops. \n\n                The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the block for the first while loop is missing. We are allowed to change the while to if? \n\n                But the second while loop is given as a while loop. \n\n                Let me read the code again:\n\n                    for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n                        s0 += m\n                        s0 -= p\n                        s1 += n\n                        s1 -= q\n                        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                            ans += 1\n                            s0 += 1\n                            s1 -= 1\n                        ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n                We have to complete the first while loop. \n\n                If we do one step at a time, we might TLE.\n\n                Therefore, we must do:\n\n                    while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        # We do one step: \n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 -= 1\n                        s1 += 1\n\n                and hope that the total number of times the while loops run is not too high.\n\n                But note: the values of s0 and s1 are the accumulated differences. The total absolute value of s0 and s1 might be large, but the number of times we can do the vertical swaps is limited by the total ones, which is O(n). And the entire loop is O(n) because the total vertical swaps is O(n) and the horizontal swaps (the abs part) is also O(n). \n\n                However, the while loop might run O(n) times per column, and there are n columns -> O(n^2).\n\n                We must avoid that.\n\n                Therefore, we change the while loop to a if with min, but then we are not using a while loop. \n\n                Given the instructions, we are to complete the code as given. \n\n                But the problem might have test cases that are worst-case.\n\n                After careful thought, the intended solution is to use the min version. \n\n                And the known solution in C++ for this problem (from a similar problem in CodeForces) uses the min version.\n\n                So I will output the min version for the first while loop, but in a while loop that runs only once? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                and then break the while loop immediately. But the while loop condition will be false after this.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    if s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n\n                and then remove the while loop? \n\n                But the code has a while loop. \n\n                However, after this if, the condition s0>0 and s1<0 will be false (because we've reduced it by the min), so the while loop will exit.\n\n                Therefore, we can do one if and break out. \n\n                But the while loop is there, so we can do:\n\n                    while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n                        break   # to exit the while loop after one min operation\n\n                This will run only once.\n\n                Or we can simply do the min without a while loop, and the while loop will exit naturally.\n\n                Since the condition will be false after the min, we can do:\n\n                    if s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n\n                and then the while loop will not fire again.\n\n                But the code has a while loop. We are allowed to change the while to if? \n\n                The problem says: \"Complete the code\", and the code has a while loop. \n\n                However, we are only to output the missing block. We can output:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                and then the while loop will run only once because after this, the condition is false.\n\n                But what if after this, we still have s0>0 and s1<0? \n                    That would happen if t==0, but t = min(s0, -s1) and if s0>0 and s1<0, then t>0, and after subtraction, either s0 becomes 0 or s1 becomes 0, so the condition will be false.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    if s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n\n                and then the while loop will exit.\n\n                But the code has a while loop. We can do:\n\n                    while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n                        break   # because we've fixed as much as we can\n\n                This is safe.\n\n                Or we can do without break by using the min version and then the condition becomes false.\n\n                So the missing block is:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                But note: the variables are integers, and this is inside the while loop. The while loop will then check the condition again. If there is still s0>0 and s1<0, it will do it again? \n\n                But after this, either s0 becomes 0 or s1 becomes 0, so the condition is false.\n\n                Therefore, it will run only once.\n\n                So we can simply do:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                inside the while loop.\n\n                But then the while loop is not needed, an if would suffice.\n\n                However, the code structure has a while loop. We can output:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                and the while loop will run only once.\n\n                Let me test with a small example:\n\n                    s0=5, s1=-3\n                    then t = min(5, 3)=3\n                    then ans +=3, s0=2, s1=0 -> condition becomes (2>0 and 0<0) -> false, so the while loop exits.\n\n                So it's safe.\n\n                Therefore, the missing block for the first while loop is:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                But note: the second while loop is:\n\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                This does one step at a time. We should also change it to the min version for efficiency.\n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the second while loop is given. We are not to change it.\n\n                However, the second while loop might be inefficient. \n\n                Given the constraints, we must change it too. \n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we only output the first while loop block.\n\n                We hope that the second while loop is not the bottleneck? \n\n                But in the worst-case, the second while loop might run many times.\n\n                For example, if s0 = -100000 and s1=100000, then the while loop will run 100000 times in one column.\n\n                And there are 200000 columns -> 200000*100000 = 20e9 iterations, which is too slow.\n\n                Therefore, we must change the second while loop to the min version.\n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the second while loop is given. \n\n                However, the problem also says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the second while loop is given and not missing. \n\n                But the entire program might be provided as a template, and we are to complete the missing block. \n\n                Since the problem does not allow us to change the given code, we must leave the second while loop as is.\n\n                This might cause TLE, but the problem might have intended the min version for both.\n\n                Given the instructions, we only output the missing block for the first while loop.\n\n                So for the first while loop, we output:\n\n                    t = min(s0, -s1)\n                    ans += t\n                    s0 -= t\n                    s1 += t\n\n                And hope that the second while loop is changed by the problem setter to the min version? \n\n                But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n                We are only to output the missing block.\n\n                Therefore, we output the block for the first while loop as above.\n\n                But note: the second while loop is given as:\n\n                    while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                This is inefficient. \n\n                However, the problem might have test cases that are not worst-case, or the intended solution is to use the min version for both, and the template has a mistake.\n\n                Given the sample in the problem (the first example) is not provided in full, we output the efficient version for the first while loop.\n\n                Summary for program1.py:\n\n                    We are to complete the first while loop in the for loop.\n\n                    We do:\n                        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                            t = min(s0, -s1)\n                            ans += t\n                            s0 -= t\n                            s1 += t\n\n                But note: the variables are s0 and s1, and we are using min(s0, -s1) because s1 is negative.\n\n                This is the missing block.\n\n                Now, what about program2.py? \n\n                The problem says: we are given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks.\n\n                But in the input, we only see one program: program1.py.\n\n                The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n                But in the input, we only see one code block for program1.py and then a separate code block for program2.py? \n\n                Actually, the input has two programs: program1.py and program2.py, and both have missing parts.\n\n                But in the user input, we see:\n\n                    # program1.py\n                    ... (code)\n\n                    # program2.py\n                    ... (code)\n\n                So we have to complete both.\n\n                We have already done program1.py.\n\n                Now for program2.py:\n\n                    The code for program2.py is:\n\n                        n = int(input())\n\n                        a, b, x, y = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n                        s0 = s1 = ans = 0\n                        for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n                            s0 += m\n                            s0 -= p\n                            s1 += n\n                            s1 -= q\n                            while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                            while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                                ans += 1\n                                s0 += 1\n                                s1 -= 1\n                            ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n                        print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)  # finally but prefix must be 0\n\n                    We have completed the TODO.\n\n                But wait, the variable names in the for loop: \n                    for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\n                    Here, n is the number of columns, but we are using n as a variable in the for loop? That will override n.\n\n                This is a mistake. We should not override n.\n\n                The initial n = int(input()), then we do:\n\n                    a = list(...)\n                    b = list(...)\n                    x = list(...)\n                    y = list(...)\n\n                Then we do:\n\n                    for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\n                This is bad because n is the length, and then we use n for the value in b.\n\n                We should change the for loop variables.\n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the for loop is not missing.\n\n                However, this will cause a bug. \n\n                We must change the for loop variables. \n\n                But the problem does not allow us to change anything else.\n\n                Given the instructions, we only output the missing block.\n\n                But the program2.py might be a different program? \n\n                The problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n                This suggests that program1.py and program2.py are two separate programs, and we are to complete both.\n\n                And the output format is: \n                    {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n                So we have to complete both.\n\n                We have completed program1.py's missing block.\n\n                For program2.py, we are given a code that has a TODO as well? \n\n                But in the input, program2.py is given as:\n\n                    n = int(input())\n\n                    a, b, x, y = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n                    s0 = s1 = ans = 0\n                    for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n                        s0 += m\n                        s0 -= p\n                        s1 += n\n                        s1 -= q\n                        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                            ans += 1\n                            s0 += 1\n                            s1 -= 1\n                        ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n                    print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)  # finally but prefix must be 0\n\n                This is the same as program1.py? \n\n                But the problem says: \"program1.py and program2.py\", so they are two different programs.\n\n                And the command is: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n                This pipes the output of program1.py to program2.py.\n\n                What is program1.py and program2.py?\n\n                The problem says: \n                    Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem: (then the description)\n\n                And then it shows program1.py and then program2.py.\n\n                But the description is for one problem. \n\n                It might be that program1.py and program2.py are two parts of the solution? \n\n                Or it might be that the first program is for one part and the second for another.\n\n                Given the complexity, and that the sample provided in the problem is not runnable, we will output the same completion for both.\n\n                But the TODO in program2.py is the same as in program1.py.\n\n                Therefore, for program2.py, we also output the same block.\n\n                However, the variable names in program2.py's for loop are also problematic: using 'n' for the value.\n\n                We must change that in program2.py? \n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we only output the block for the while loop.\n\n                So for both program1.py and program2.py, the missing block is the same.\n\n                But note: the problem might have two different programs.\n\n                Let me read the initial description: \n                    \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n                And then the description for the problem is given, and then we see two code blocks.\n\n                The first code block is labeled # program1.py, and the second is labeled # program2.py.\n\n                They are two separate programs.\n\n                The command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n                This means that program1.py will output something to stdout, and program2.py will read from stdin.\n\n                What is the role of each program?\n\n                The problem is: after each query, we must print the answer.\n\n                The input to the whole system is the same as described: \n                    first line: n and m\n                    second line: the array a (n integers)\n                    third line: the array b (n integers) for the current arrangement? \n                    then m lines of queries.\n\n                But the desired arrangement is also in the input? \n\n                The input specification: \n                    The first line: n and m.\n                    The second line: a1, a2, ... an.\n                    The third line: b1, b2, ... bn.   (this is the current arrangement, two rows)\n                    Then the next two lines: \n                         the desired first row: x1, x2, ... xn.\n                         the desired second row: y1, y2, ... yn.\n\n                And then m lines of queries.\n\n                But the problem says: there are m queries. And after each query, we update the array and then compute the answer.\n\n                How can program1.py and program2.py work in a pipe?\n\n                One possibility: \n                    program1.py reads the input and then outputs the initial array and then the queries? \n                    program2.py reads the initial array and then the queries and then outputs the answers.\n\n                But the problem says: \"after each query print the answer\"\n\n                So program1.py might output the initial state and then the queries, and program2.py might simulate the updates and compute the answers.\n\n                Given the complexity, and that the provided code for program1.py and program2.py are the same, we will complete both with the same block.\n\n                Therefore, the answer is:\n\n                    {\n                      \"program1\": \"        t = min(s0, -s1)\\n        ans += t\\n        s0 -= t\\n        s1 += t\",\n                      \"program2\": \"        t = min(s0, -s1)\\n        ans += t\\n        s0 -= t\\n        s1 += t\"\n                    }\n\n                But note: the program2.py has a variable name conflict with 'n'. We are not allowed to change that.\n\n                We hope that the input n is not used in the for loop body beyond the for loop.\n\n                In the for loop, we have:\n\n                    for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\n                This overrides n (the number of columns) with the elements of b.\n\n                This is a bug. We should change the for loop variables to, say, \n\n                    for u, v, w, z in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\n                then use u, v, w, z.\n\n                But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we cannot change that.\n\n                Therefore, we output the missing block as is.\n\n                Let's hope the rest of the code does not use n after that.\n\n                In the for loop, after the for loop, we use n again in the print? \n\n                    print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)\n\n                Here, n is the last element of b from the last column? \n\n                This is a bug.\n\n                But the problem says: we are to complete the missing block, not fix the entire program.\n\n                Given the instructions, we output only the missing block.\n\n                So the final answer is as above.\n\n                However, the problem might have intended a different program2.py.\n\n                Since the problem is complex and the sample is not clear, we output the completion for the while loop in both programs.\n\n                Note: the problem says \"program1.py\" and \"program2.py\", and we are given two code blocks, so we complete both.\n\n                But the two code blocks are identical. \n\n                Therefore, we output the same completion.\n\n                Let me write the json.\n\n                We must output:\n\n                    {\n                      \"program1\": \"        t = min(s0, -s1)\\n        ans += t\\n        s0 -= t\\n        s1 += t\",\n                      \"program2\": \"        t = min(s0, -s1)\\n        ans += t\\n        s0 -= t\\n        s1 += t\"\n                    }\n\n                But note: the code in the while loop should be indented. The current while loop in program1.py and program2.py is at the same indentation level as the for loop.\n\n                The missing block should be indented within the while loop.\n\n                In the TODO, it is already indented. We output 8 spaces for each line to match.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the exact same indentation as the second while loop in program1.py: \n\n                    while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                        ans += 1\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n\n                This has 8 spaces for the while and 12 spaces for the body.\n\n                So for the missing block, we output:\n\n                    while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                        t = min(s0, -s1)\n                        ans += t\n                        s0 -= t\n                        s1 += t\n\n                But the while loop is already there. We only need to output the body.\n\n                The TODO is inside the while loop, so we output the body with 12 spaces.\n\n                So for program1.py and program2.py, the completion is:\n\n                    \"        t = min(s0, -s1)\\n        ans += t\\n        s0 -= t\\n        s1 += t\"\n\n                (each line has 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, in the given code, the while loop is indented by 8 spaces (one level) and the body by 12 spaces (two levels). \n\n                In the second while loop, the body is:\n\n                    ans += 1\n                    s0 += 1\n                    s1 -= 1\n\n                which is indented by 12 spaces.\n\n                So we output the same.\n\n                Therefore, the final answer."
