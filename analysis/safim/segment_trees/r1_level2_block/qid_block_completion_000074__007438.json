But the example has 5, so it matches. However, in the example the white cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) -> and we had 1+1+1+2=5. But our formula: \n            x=0: a0=2 -> C(0+2,1)=2\n            x=1: a1=2 -> C(1+2,2)=C(3,2)=3\n            total=5. So it matches. Therefore, the answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1) mod (10^9+7)\n\n        But note: x from 0 to n, and a_x can be up to 200000, and x up to 200000, so x+a_x can be up to 400000.",

But the input: \n                n = 1\n                a = [2, 2]   (because a0, a1)\n\n            Then x=0: z=2 -> k=0+2=2, r=0+1=1.\n                comb = f[2] * inv(f[1]) * inv(f[1]) % m = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2.\n            x=1: z=2 -> k=1+2=3, r=1+1=2.\n                comb = f[3] * inv(f[2]) * inv(f[1]) = 6 * inv(2) * 1 = 3. d = 2+3 = 5. So it works. However, note: the example in the problem had n=1? The grid: \n                a0=2, a1=2, and for i>=2, a_i=0.\n                white cells: \n                    x=0: y=0,1\n                    x=1: y=0,1\n                so 4 cells.

Then the adjacent pairs: i0: 1,2 -> different: 1*4=4\n          i1: 2,2 -> same: 0\n          i2: 2,4 -> different: 3*2=6\n          i3: 4,5 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total_contrib = 4+0+6+4 = 14, then total_ans = 15+14=29.

This updates a[0] to 1. Then the array is still [1,2,3,4,5] -> 35. Then the second query: \"2 2\" -> update a[1] to 2 -> still [1,2,3,4,5] -> 35.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are to compute, after each update, the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\n The awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\n We note that the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be computed by:\n   total = (number of contiguous subarrays) + (number of adjacent pairs that break the block)\n\n Actually, note that for a contiguous subarray [l, r], the awesomeness is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\n\n Therefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays is:\n   total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1), the number of subarrays that include this pair and for which the break at i is present)\n\n But note: the break at i (i.e., a[i] != a[i+1]) will be counted in every subarray that includes both i and i+1. The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n - i - 1) [if we index from 0: the left end can be from 0 to i, and the right end from i+1 to n-1, so (i+1) * (n-i-1)].\n\n However, wait: the total number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\n And the total awesomeness can be expressed as:\n   total = n*(n+1)//2 + (for each i from 0 to n-2, if a[i] != a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-i-1))\n\n But note: the above formula does not hold because the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 + (# of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1]). Therefore, the total is:\n   total = (n*(n+1)//2) + (for each i from 0 to n-2, if a[i]!=a[i+1] then (number of subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1])).\n\n The number of subarrays that include [i, i+1] is (i+1) * (n-i-1) [because left end from 0 to i, right end from i+1 to n-1].\n\n However, note: the above counts the breaks. But what if we update one element? Then the breaks at adjacent positions (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) might change.\n\n Therefore, we can maintain:\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   and then for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) we add (i+1)*(n-i-1) if a[i]!=a[i+1].\n\n But note: the problem has updates. We are going to update one element at a time.\n\n We can maintain:\n   ans = base + (contribution from adjacent pairs)\n\n However, note that the base is fixed? Actually, the base is the total number of subarrays? But wait: the base is the total number of subarrays? Actually, each subarray has at least one block. Then we add the extra breaks.\n\n So: total_awesomeness = base + (sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (if a[i]!=a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-i-1)))\n\n But note: the base is the total number of subarrays? Actually, the base is the sum of 1 for each subarray, which is n*(n+1)//2.\n\n However, let's test with the example: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] (n=5)\n\n base = 15.\n\n Then adjacent pairs:\n   i=0: 1 and 2 -> different -> add (0+1)*(5-0-1) = 1*4 = 4\n   i=1: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n   i=2: 2 and 4 -> different -> add (2+1)*(5-2-1) = 3*2 = 6\n   i=3: 4 and 5 -> different -> add (3+1)*(5-3-1) = 4*1 = 4\n\n total = 15 + 4+6+4 = 29 -> which matches.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   total = n*(n+1)//2\n   for i in range(n-1):\n        if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n            total += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n But we have updates. We are going to update one element at position i.\n\n How does an update at position i affect?\n   It can affect the adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1).\n\n We need to subtract the old contributions of these two adjacent pairs (if they were different) and then add the new contributions (if they become different after update).\n\n Steps for an update at index pos (0-indexed) to new value x:\n\n   Let old = a[pos] (we are going to update a[pos] to x)\n\n   We consider the left adjacent pair: (pos-1, pos) and the right adjacent pair: (pos, pos+1).\n\n   Before update:\n      If pos-1 and pos are within [0, n-1] and a[pos-1] != a[pos], then we subtract (pos) * (n-pos-1) [because the index of the pair (pos-1, pos) is at i=pos-1 -> so (i+1)=pos, and (n-i-1)=n-pos? Actually, the formula for the pair (i, i+1) is (i+1)*(n-i-1). For the pair at index i (meaning between a[i] and a[i+1]), the contribution is (i+1)*(n-i-1). So for the left adjacent pair, the index of the pair is (pos-1) -> so we subtract ( (pos-1+1) * (n - (pos-1) - 1) ) = pos * (n-pos) [if the pair was different].\n\n      Similarly, for the pair (pos, pos+1): the index of the pair is pos, so we subtract (pos+1)*(n-pos-1) [if a[pos]!=a[pos+1]].\n\n   Then update a[pos] = x.\n\n   Then add back for the left adjacent pair: if pos-1 and pos are within [0, n-1] and a[pos-1] != a[pos] (now) then add pos*(n-pos)\n   Similarly, for the pair (pos, pos+1): if within bounds and now different, add (pos+1)*(n-pos-1)\n\n   However, note: the formula for the left adjacent pair: the pair index is (pos-1) -> so the contribution is ( (pos-1+1) * (n - (pos-1) - 1) ) = pos * (n - pos) [because n - (pos-1) - 1 = n - pos].\n\n   And for the right adjacent pair: the pair index is pos -> (pos+1)*(n-pos-1).\n\n   But note: the base (n*(n+1)//2) remains the same.\n\n   Also note: if the update is at the first element (pos=0) then there is no left adjacent pair. Similarly, if at the last element (pos=n-1) then no right adjacent pair.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We maintain:\n        total = base + contributions from all adjacent pairs.\n\n   We precompute the base: base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n   Then we initialize the contributions from adjacent pairs.\n\n   Then for each query:\n\n        Let pos = i-1 (if the input index is 1-indexed? The problem says: \"query i, x\" meaning update the i-th element -> if the array is 0-indexed, then index = i-1)\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let old_left = the pair (pos-1, pos) and old_right = (pos, pos+1)\n\n          Subtract the current contributions of these two pairs (if they are currently different and within bounds).\n\n          Update a[pos] = x.\n\n          Add the contributions of these two pairs (if they are now different and within bounds).\n\n          Then output total = base + (current total contributions from adjacent pairs)\n\n   However, note: the problem input says the array is given as a1, a2, ... an, and the query gives i (which is the index in the array, so 1-indexed). So we subtract 1.\n\n   But note: the example input: \n        n=5, m=?\n        array: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] \n        then a query: \"1 1\" -> but wait, the array is already [1,2,2,4,5]. Actually, the example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". So the initial array might be different? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" (so 0-indexed: a[0] = first integer)\n\n        Then queries: each query has i and x, meaning update the i-th element to x. The i-th element is the element at index i-1.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        pos = i-1\n\n   We must be cautious: the array is 0-indexed.\n\n   Also note: the array length is n, and we have n+1 integers? Actually, the input says: \"The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an\". \n\n   Correction: the problem says: \n        \"The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an\"\n\n   So the array has n+1 elements? But the first line says: \"two integers n and m\", and then the array has n+1 integers? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        \"In the first line you are given with two integers n and m (1<=n,m<=100000). The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an\"\n\n   So the array has length n+1? Then the total number of adjacent pairs is n (from index0 to index n-1, and index1 to index n?).\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"for all i>n, a_i=0\", and the array we are given is a0, a1, ... an.\n\n   And the grid: the cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x. Since x goes from 0 to infinity, and for x>n, a_x=0, so for x>n, the row x has no white cells.\n\n   However, in the problem of program1, the array length is n (the input says: \"the array a of length n\")? \n\n   Let me check the input specification for program1:\n\n        \"In the first line you are given with two integers n and m (1<=n,m<=100000). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n   But wait, the problem description above for program1 says: \n        \"You are given an array a of length n\"\n\n   However, the input specification says: \n        \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n   But then the example: \n        After the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5] -> which is 5 elements, so n=5.\n\n   So the array has n elements? \n\n   Correction: the problem says: \n        \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries. Each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n, ...)\"\n\n   So the array has n elements? Then the adjacent pairs are from 0 to n-2.\n\n   But the input says: \"The second line contains n integers\", so we have a[0] to a[n-1].\n\n   However, the example input: \n        n=5, then the array has 5 integers? But the example array is [1,2,2,4,5] -> 5 integers.\n\n   So the base = n*(n+1)//2? Actually, the total number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2? Yes.\n\n   But note: the array has n elements, so the adjacent pairs are from index0 to index n-2.\n\n   Therefore, the formula for the adjacent pair at index i (between a[i] and a[i+1]) is (i+1) * (n - i - 1). \n\n   However, note: \n        i from 0 to n-2: \n          left end: from 0 to i -> i+1 choices\n          right end: from i+1 to n-1 -> n-1 - (i+1) + 1 = n-i-1 choices.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   Steps for program1:\n\n        Read n, m.\n        Read the array a of n integers.\n\n        base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n        total_contrib = 0\n        # Precompute the contributions for each adjacent pair\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                total_contrib += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n        total_ans = base + total_contrib   # initial total\n\n        Then for each query:\n            i, x = map(int, input().split())\n            pos = i-1   # 0-indexed\n\n            # Remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs that involve pos: (pos-1, pos) and (pos, pos+1)\n            # But note: if pos==0, then no left; if pos==n-1, then no right.\n\n            # Left: (pos-1, pos)\n            if pos > 0:\n                # the pair index is pos-1\n                if a[pos-1] != a[pos]:\n                    # subtract the contribution: (pos) * (n-pos)   [because for pair index = pos-1: (i+1)=pos, and n-i-1 = n - (pos-1) - 1 = n-pos]\n                    total_contrib -= (pos) * (n - pos)\n\n            # Right: (pos, pos+1)\n            if pos < n-1:\n                if a[pos] != a[pos+1]:\n                    total_contrib -= (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)\n\n            # Update the array\n            a[pos] = x\n\n            # Add back the contributions for the two adjacent pairs with the new value\n            if pos > 0:\n                if a[pos-1] != a[pos]:\n                    total_contrib += (pos) * (n - pos)\n                # else: same, so no contribution\n            if pos < n-1:\n                if a[pos] != a[pos+1]:\n                    total_contrib += (pos+1) * (n-pos-1)\n\n            total_ans = base + total_contrib\n            print(total_ans)\n\n   However, note: the base is fixed? But wait, the base is the total number of subarrays? Yes, and that is fixed: n*(n+1)//2.\n\n   But note: the array length is n, so base is fixed.\n\n   However, the example: \n        n=5, base = 15.\n\n   But the example output after first query is 29.\n\n   So we output 15 + total_contrib.\n\n   But note: the initial array is given, so we must compute the initial total_contrib and then base+total_contrib is the initial answer.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"after each query\" we print the answer. The first query is the first update? But the initial array is given, and then we have m queries. So we must output the initial state? \n\n   The problem says: \"After each query print the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a.\"\n\n   The initial array is given, and then the first query is the first update. So we must output the answer for the initial array? \n\n   But the problem does not say to output the initial state. It says \"after each query\", meaning after the first query, then after the second, etc.\n\n   However, the example input: \n        \"5 5\n         1 2 3 4 5\n         1 1\n         2 2\n         5 3\n         4 2\n         5 1\"\n\n   And the example output: \n        29\n        28\n        26\n        20\n        20\n\n   So the first output is after the first query.\n\n   Therefore, we must output the answer after each of the m queries.\n\n   But what about the initial array? The problem says: \"after each query\", meaning we start with the initial array and then update.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the initial state to be printed? But the example output has 5 numbers (for 5 queries).\n\n   So we do:\n\n        Read n, m\n        Read the initial array a (n integers)\n\n        Precompute base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n        total_contrib = 0\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                total_contrib += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n        # Then we process m queries. For each query, we update and then output base+total_contrib.\n\n        But note: the initial state is not printed? The problem says \"after each query\", so we start with the initial array and then do the first update and then print.\n\n        However, the example input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n        Then the first query: \"1 1\" -> update a[0] to 1. But initially a[0] is 1? So no change? Then the answer is the same as the initial.\n\n        But the example output: 29.\n\n        How do we get 29 for the array [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n        So the initial array is not [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n        and then the first query: \"1 1\" -> so update the first element to 1. \n\n        Therefore, the initial array is given as [1,2,3,4,5]? Then we update the first element to 1 -> becomes [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        But wait, the example says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        Actually, the example input in the problem statement for the note is:\n\n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        Then after the first query (update a0 to 1) -> [1,2,3,4,5] becomes [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        But the example says: \"after the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries. Each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n, ...)\"\n\n        and the example input:\n\n            5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            1 1\n            2 2\n            5 3\n            4 2\n            5 1\n\n        Then:\n\n            Query1: i=1, x=1 -> set a0 to 1 -> so the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> but the example says [1,2,2,4,5] after first query.\n\n        So there is a mistake? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n        How? \n\n        The second query: i=2, x=2 -> set a1 to 2 -> then [1,2,3,4,5] becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> no, then set a1 to 2: becomes [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Then third: i=5, x=3 -> set a4 to 3 -> [1,2,3,4,3] -> then fourth: i=4, x=2 -> set a3 to 2 -> [1,2,3,2,3] -> then fifth: set a4 to 1 -> [1,2,3,2,1] -> not [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n        I see: the example input in the note is:\n\n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        but the example output is:\n\n            29\n            28\n            26\n            20\n            20\n\n        and the note says: after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        Actually, the note says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\". \n\n        How? The first query is \"1 1\": set the first element to 1 -> but the first element is already 1? \n\n        Then the second query: \"2 2\": set the second element to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Then the third: \"5 3\": set the fifth element to 3 -> [1,2,3,4,3] -> then fourth: \"4 2\": set the fourth to 2 -> [1,2,3,2,3] -> then fifth: \"5 1\": set the fifth to 1 -> [1,2,3,2,1].\n\n        This does not match [1,2,2,4,5] at the first query.\n\n        I think the example input in the problem statement for the note is different. The note says: \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" -> which implies that a0=2 (because for row0: y<a0 -> so a0 must be at least 2? because (0,0) and (0,1) are white) and a1=2 (because (1,0) and (1,1) are white). \n\n        So the array after the first query is [2,2,...] but the example says [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        Actually, the example in the note for the grid is independent? \n\n        I think the note for the grid is for the problem of program2, not program1.\n\n        So for program1, we have the example input:\n\n            n=5, m=5, initial array = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n            Then the first query: update index1 to 1 -> so a0 becomes 1? but it was 1 -> no change.\n\n            Then the answer for the initial array: \n                base = 15\n                adjacent pairs:\n                  i0: 1 and 2 -> different: add 1*(5-0-1)=4\n                  i1: 2 and 3 -> different: add 2*(5-1-1)=2*3=6\n                  i2: 3 and 4 -> different: add 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6\n                  i3: 4 and 5 -> different: add 4*(5-3-1)=4*1=4\n                total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35? \n\n            But the example output for the first query is 29.\n\n        This indicates that the initial array is not [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        The problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" -> but the example input has 5 integers: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n        And the example output after the first query is 29.\n\n        How to get 29? \n\n        We must have the array after the first query as [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        So the initial array must be [?,2,3,4,5] and then we update the first element to 1? \n\n        The problem says: the first query is \"1 1\", meaning update the first element to 1.\n\n        So the initial array must have been [something else, 2,3,4,5] and then we set the first to 1.\n\n        But the input says: the second line is the initial array.\n\n        Therefore, the example input:\n\n            n=5, m=5\n            initial array: [2,2,3,4,5]   ??? \n\n        Then after updating the first element to 1: [1,2,3,4,5]? -> but then we get 35, not 29.\n\n        Alternatively, the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5] and the first query is \"2 2\": update the second element to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,4,5]? no, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> then set a1 (index1) to 2: becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> no, we set a1 to 2: so [1,2,3,4,5] becomes [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        I see: the example input in the problem statement for the note of program1 is:\n\n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        and the example output is:\n\n            29\n            28\n            26\n            20\n            20\n\n        How to get 29 for the array [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        Array: [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n        base = 15\n\n        adjacent pairs:\n          i0: 1 and 2 -> different: add 1*(5-0-1)=4\n          i1: 2 and 2 -> same: 0\n          i2: 2 and 4 -> different: add 3*(5-2-1)=3*2=6\n          i3: 4 and 5 -> different: add 4*(5-3-1)=4*1=4\n\n        total = 15+4+6+4 = 29.\n\n        So the first query must change the array to [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        Therefore, the initial array must be [1,2,3,4,5] and the first query is: update the third element? \n\n        The first query: \"1 1\" -> update the first element to 1 -> no change? \n\n        Then the second query: \"2 2\" -> update the second element to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Then the third query: \"5 3\" -> update the fifth element to 3 -> [1,2,3,4,3] -> then the adjacent pairs:\n          i0: 1,2 -> 4\n          i1: 2,3 -> 2*3=6\n          i2: 3,4 -> 3*2=6\n          i3: 4,3 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35? but the second output is 28.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        After re\u2010reading the problem: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n        and the example input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n        and the first query: \"1 1\" -> update the first element to 1 -> no change.\n\n        Then the answer for the initial array: \n            base = 15\n            pairs: \n                (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different -> 1*4=4\n                (1,2): 2 and 3 -> different -> 2*3=6\n                (2,3): 3 and 4 -> different -> 3*2=6\n                (3,4): 4 and 5 -> different -> 4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        But the example output for the first query is 29.\n\n        I see: the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" meaning the array has n elements? \n\n        But the example input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n        and then the first query: \"1 1\" -> update the first element to 1 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> same as initial.\n\n        Then why 29? \n\n        Alternatively, the array indices in the problem are 1-indexed? \n\n        The problem says: \"query i, x\" -> update the i-th element.\n\n        And the array is given as a1, a2, ... an.\n\n        So the initial array: \n            a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=4, a5=5.\n\n        Then the first query: i=1, x=1 -> update a1 to 1 -> no change.\n\n        Then the second query: i=2, x=2 -> update a2 to 2 -> no change? \n\n        Then the third: i=5, x=3 -> update a5 to 3 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,3] -> then the answer becomes 15 + (for pairs: \n            (1,2): 1 and 2 -> 1*4=4\n            (2,3): 2 and 3 -> 2*3=6\n            (3,4): 3 and 4 -> 3*2=6\n            (4,5): 4 and 3 -> different -> 4*1=4 -> total=15+4+6+6+4=35) -> but the example output for the first query is 29, and the second is 28.\n\n        I think there is a misunderstanding: the example output 29 is for the array [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        How did the array become [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        The first query: update a3 to 2? \n\n        The problem says: the first query is \"1 1\", which is update a1 to 1 -> no change.\n\n        Then the second query: \"2 2\" -> update a2 to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Then the third query: \"5 3\" -> update a5 to 3 -> [1,2,3,4,3] -> then the fourth: \"4 2\" -> update a4 to 2 -> [1,2,3,2,3] -> then fifth: \"5 1\" -> [1,2,3,2,1].\n\n        But the example output: \n            29\n            28\n            26\n            20\n            20\n\n        How to get 29? \n\n        We must have after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        Therefore, the first query must be updating the third element to 2? \n\n        But the first query is \"1 1\", which is the first element.\n\n        I see: the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ... an-1\" ? \n\n        But the problem says: \"a1, a2, ..., an\", so the first element is a1, and the last is an.\n\n        And the query: \"i, x\" -> update the i-th element, which is a_i.\n\n        But the array has n elements, so the indices are 1..n.\n\n        The first query: i=3, x=2 -> update a3 to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> then the answer is 29.\n\n        But the first query in the input is \"1 1\", not \"3 2\".\n\n        This is a discrepancy.\n\n        After checking the sample input in the problem statement: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        and the sample output: \n            29\n            28\n            26\n            20\n            20\n\n        How can we get 29 after the first query \"1 1\"? \n\n        If we update a1 to 1, then the array is still [1,2,3,4,5] -> 35.\n\n        Unless the initial array is not [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        The problem says: the second line is the initial array: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the example. \n\n        But the example output 29 is for the array [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        Therefore, the first query must be updating the third element. \n\n        How is the first query \"1 1\" updating the third element? \n\n        Unless the index in the query is not the position in the array but the value? \n\n        The problem says: \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n        So i is the index.\n\n        And the array has indices 1..n.\n\n        So the first query: i=1 -> update the first element to 1.\n\n        This is not updating the third.\n\n        I see: the example input has 5 elements, and the first query is \"1 1\", which updates the first element. \n\n        But then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> same as initial.\n\n        Then the answer should be 35.\n\n        However, the example output is 29.\n\n        This suggests that the initial array is not [1,2,3,4,5] but [2,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        Then after updating the first element to 1: [1,2,3,4,5] -> then the answer is 35? \n\n        Or if the initial array is [1,3,3,4,5] and we update the second element to 2? \n\n        Let me try with initial array [1,3,3,4,5]:\n\n          base = 15\n          pairs:\n            i0: 1 and 3 -> different: 1*4=4\n            i1: 3 and 3 -> same: 0\n            i2: 3 and 4 -> different: 3*2=6\n            i3: 4 and 5 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total = 15+4+6+4 = 29.\n\n        Then the first query: update the second element to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> then the answer becomes 35.\n\n        But the example output after the first query is 29, and then after the second query 28.\n\n        So the first query is not changing anything? \n\n        I think the only explanation is that the first query is not the first update but the initial state is not printed, and the first query is the first update that changes the array to [1,2,2,4,5] from some initial state.\n\n        Given the confusion, I will assume the following:\n\n          We are given n and m.\n          We are given an array a of n integers.\n\n          We will maintain an array a (0-indexed) of length n.\n\n          We will compute the initial total_contrib for adjacent pairs from 0 to n-2.\n\n          Then for each query:\n              i, x = input\n              pos = i-1   (because the array is 0-indexed, and the first element is at index0)\n\n          Then we update a[pos] = x, and adjust the contributions for the adjacent pairs (pos-1,pos) and (pos,pos+1).\n\n          And then output base + total_contrib.\n\n        And we hope that the example works.\n\n        But the example input: \n            n=5, m=5\n            initial array = [1,2,3,4,5]   -> then the initial total_contrib = 4+6+6+4 = 20? -> then base=15, so total=35.\n\n        Then the first query: \"1 1\" -> update a[0] to 1 -> no change, so we output 35.\n\n        But the expected first output is 29.\n\n        Therefore, we must have a different initial array.\n\n        How about the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5] but the first query is \"3 2\" (i=3, x=2) -> then we update a[2] to 2.\n\n        Then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n        Then the adjacent pairs:\n          i0: 1,2 -> different: 1*4=4\n          i1: 2,2 -> same: 0\n          i2: 2,4 -> different: 3*2=6\n          i3: 4,5 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total_contrib = 4+0+6+4 = 14, then total_ans = 15+14=29.\n\n        So the first query in the input should be \"3 2\", not \"1 1\".\n\n        But the problem example input is \"1 1\".\n\n        I see the problem says: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        and the first query is \"1 1\", which is i=1, x=1.\n\n        This updates a[0] to 1.\n\n        Then the array is still [1,2,3,4,5] -> 35.\n\n        Then the second query: \"2 2\" -> update a[1] to 2 -> still [1,2,3,4,5] -> 35.\n\n        Then the third: \"5 3\" -> update a[4] to 3 -> [1,2,3,4,3] -> then we recalc:\n\n          base = 15\n          pairs:\n            i0: 1,2 -> 1*4=4\n            i1: 2,3 -> 2*3=6\n            i2: 3,4 -> 3*2=6\n            i3: 4,3 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        Then the fourth: \"4 2\" -> update a[3] to 2 -> [1,2,3,2,3] -> \n          pairs:\n            i0: 1,2 -> 4\n            i1: 2,3 -> 6\n            i2: 3,2 -> different: 3*2=6\n            i3: 2,3 -> different: 4*1=4\n          total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        Then the fifth: \"5 1\" -> update a[4] to 1 -> [1,2,3,2,1] -> \n          pairs:\n            i0: 1,2 -> 4\n            i1: 2,3 -> 6\n            i2: 3,2 -> 6\n            i3: 2,1 -> 4\n          total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        This does not match the example output.\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the example input/output.\n\n        But the problem says: the first example output is 29.\n\n        How can we get 29 for the array [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n        So the first query must be updating the third element to 2.\n\n        Therefore, the first query in the input should be \"3 2\", not \"1 1\".\n\n        Given the provided example input, we must output 29 after the first query if the update is to the third element.\n\n        But the input says \"1 1\".\n\n        I see: the problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ... an-1\" \n\n        wait, the problem says: \"a0, a1, ... an\" in the description? \n\n        Actually, the input specification says: \n            \"The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an\"\n\n        But then the array has n+1 elements? \n\n        This is for program1? \n\n        Let me check the problem statement for program1: \n            \"You are given an array a of length n\"\n\n        but the input specification: \n            \"The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ... an\"\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        I see: the problem says for program1: \n            \"In the first line you are given with two integers n and m (1<=n,m<=100000). The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ... an\"\n\n        and then the array has length n+1? \n\n        But then the adjacent pairs are from 0 to n-1? (because there are n+1 elements, so n adjacent pairs)\n\n        Then the base = (n+1)*(n+2)//2.\n\n        And the adjacent pair at index i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1) has contribution (i+1) * (n+1 - i - 1) = (i+1)*(n-i) if a[i]!=a[i+1].\n\n        Then for the array [1,2,2,4,5] with n+1=5+1=6? -> but we only have 5 elements.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n        But the provided code for program1 has:\n\n            n, m = inp()\n            a = inp()   # and then it says: for z in ... but in program1.py the code is:\n\n            n , m = inp()\n            a = inp()\n\n        and then the array a has n elements? \n\n        The problem says: the second line has n+1 integers.\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"In the first line you are given with two integers n and m (1<=n,m<=10^5). The second line contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an\"\n\n        So the array has n+1 elements.\n\n        Therefore, the array length is n+1.\n\n        Then the number of adjacent pairs is n.\n\n        The base = (n+1)*(n+2)//2.\n\n        The contribution for an adjacent pair at index i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1) is (i+1) * (n+1 - i - 1) = (i+1)*(n-i).\n\n        Example: n=5 (then the array has 6 elements) -> base = 6*7//2 = 21.\n\n        Then for the array [1,2,2,4,5,?] -> but the example array after first query is [1,2,2,4,5] -> but that's 5 elements, not 6.\n\n        The example says: \"after the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5]\" -> but then there are 5 elements, so n+1=5 -> n=4.\n\n        But the input: \"5 5\" -> n=5, so the array should have 6 elements.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Given the time, I will assume that the array has n elements (not n+1) for program1.\n\n        Because the problem says: \"You are given an array a of length n\".\n\n        And the example input has n=5 and then 5 integers.\n\n        And the example output 29 for the array [1,2,2,4,5] (which is 5 elements).\n\n        Therefore, I will assume the array has n elements.\n\n        And the input specification has a mistake: it should be \"n integers\", not \"n+1 integers\".\n\n        So we proceed with n elements.\n\n        But then the example input has n=5 and then 5 integers.\n\n        And the first query is \"1 1\", which does nothing, and then the answer is 35, not 29.\n\n        How to resolve? \n\n        I think the only possibility is that the first query is not \"1 1\" for the first element, but for the third element? \n\n        But the query is \"1 1\", which means index1.\n\n        Unless the indexing of the array in the query is not the same as the indexing in the array? \n\n        The problem says: the array is given as a1, a2, ... an, and the query updates the i-th element.\n\n        So the first element is a1.\n\n        But then the array has indices 1..n.\n\n        In 0-indexed: a[0] is a1.\n\n        So \"1 1\" updates a[0].\n\n        This is the first element.\n\n        Given the provided example input and output, I think there is a mistake in the example input.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             1 1\n             2 2\n             5 3\n             4 2\n             5 1\"\n\n        outputs \n            29\n            28\n            26\n            20\n            20\n\n        How to get 29 after the first query? \n\n        We must have the array after the first query as [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n        Therefore, the first query must be: i=3, x=2.\n\n        So the input should be: \n            5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2\n            2 2   # but then the second query is \"2 2\", which updates the second element to 2 -> then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> then the second query does nothing? \n            5 3\n            4 2\n            5 1\n\n        Then after the first query (3 2): \n            array = [1,2,2,4,5] -> awesomeness total = 29.\n        after the second query (2 2): \n            array = [1,2,2,4,5] -> no change, so 29? but the example output second is 28.\n\n        So not matching.\n\n        How to get 28? \n\n        If we have array [1,2,2,4,5] and then update the second element to 3: \n            becomes [1,3,2,4,5] -> \n            base = 15\n            pairs:\n                i0: 1,3 -> different: 1*4=4\n                i1: 3,2 -> different: 2*3=6\n                i2: 2,4 -> different: 3*2=6\n                i3: 4,5 -> different: 4*1=4\n            total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        not 28.\n\n        If we update the second element to 2 (no change) -> 29.\n\n        If we update the fourth element to 2: \n            [1,2,2,2,5] -> \n            pairs:\n                i0: 1,2 -> 4\n                i1: 2,2 -> 0\n                i2: 2,2 -> 0\n                i3: 2,5 -> 4\n            total = 15+4+0+0+4 = 23.\n\n        28 is not 23.\n\n        If we update the fifth element to 3: \n            [1,2,2,4,3] -> \n            pairs:\n                i0: 1,2 -> 4\n                i1: 2,2 -> 0\n                i2: 2,4 -> 6\n                i3: 4,3 -> 4\n            total = 15+4+0+6+4 = 29.\n\n        not 28.\n\n        If we update the first element to 2: \n            [2,2,2,4,5] -> \n            pairs:\n                i0: 2,2 -> 0\n                i1: 2,2 -> 0\n                i2: 2,4 -> 6\n                i3: 4,5 -> 4\n            total = 15+0+0+6+4 = 25.\n\n        not 28.\n\n        How to get 28? \n\n        Array of 5 elements: \n            base = 15\n            then the sum of contributions = 28 - 15 = 13.\n\n        One possibility: \n            three adjacent pairs with contributions: for example, \n                pair0: 1*4=4\n                pair1: 2*3=6\n                pair2: 3*2=6 -> 4+6+6=16 -> 15+16=31, not 28.\n            or \n                pair0: 1*4=4\n                pair1: 0\n                pair2: 3*2=6\n                pair3: 4*1=4 -> 4+6+4=14 -> 15+14=29.\n\n        28-15=13.\n\n        Possibilities for the contributions: \n            either one pair with 13?

And since there are two dolls, we do two operations on (1,1) (because we can only remove one at a time).\n\n            First removal of (1,1): becomes (1,2) and (2,1), and the state: (0,2):1, (1,1):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):1, (2,1):1.\n            Second removal of (1,1): becomes (1,2) and (2,1) again, so then state: (0,2):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,1):2.\n\n            Then we stop.\n\n            But the example says after 5 operations the white cells have 0 dolls.\n\n            However, the white cells are only up to (0,1) and (1,0) and (0,0) and (1,1). \n            In the final state: \n                (0,0):0, (0,1):0, (1,0):0, (1,1):0 -> good.\n            But (0,2) is not white (because a0=2, so y<2 -> y=2 is not white), (2,0) is not white (because a2=0, so y<0 -> no), (1,2) is not white (a1=2, y<2 -> y=2 not white), (2,1) is not white.\n\n            So it is done.\n\n        How to compute the minimum number of operations?\n\n        Note: each operation removes one doll and produces two new ones, so net increase of one doll.\n\n        Initially, one doll.\n\n        Finally, we have zero dolls in the white cells, but there might be dolls in black cells.\n\n        The catch: we only care about white cells having 0.\n\n        We can think: the entire process is independent for each cell? \n\n        But the operations are coupled: to remove a doll at (x,y) we produce (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n\n        We need to remove all dolls from white cells.\n\n        Insight: the movement is only right and down. And the grid is infinite.\n\n        We can use a DP or a combinatorial counting.\n\n        Consider a cell (x,y) that is white. We must remove any doll that ever appears there.\n\n        How many times must a doll appear at (x,y)? \n\n        But note: we can remove a doll at (x,y) only if we have one, and removing it produces two. However, the doll at (x,y) might be produced by its left neighbor (x-1,y) or its down neighbor (x, y-1).\n\n        In fact, the number of times we must pass through (x,y) is fixed by the initial condition.\n\n        The initial doll is at (0,0). To remove the initial doll, we must eventually remove it, and that will produce (0,1) and (1,0). Then to remove the doll at (0,1) we must eventually remove it, which will produce (0,2) and (1,1), and so on.\n\n        However, we only care about white cells.\n\n        Note: the process is similar to the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in a grid, but we are not exactly counting paths because we can have multiple dolls and we remove them in any order.\n\n        But note: the entire process is a tree: \n            The initial doll is the root.\n            When we remove a doll at (x,y), we create two children: (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n\n        The total number of operations is the number of nodes in the tree minus one (because the initial node is given).\n\n        But we don't need to remove dolls that are not in white cells? \n\n        However, the goal is: all white cells have 0 dolls. \n\n        This means that we must remove every doll that ever visits a white cell.\n\n        But note: once a doll is moved to a black cell, we don't care about it. \n\n        So we only need to remove the dolls that are in white cells at the moment we remove them.\n\n        And when we remove a doll in a white cell, we produce two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). These might be white or black.\n\n        We only care about the white ones.\n\n        Therefore, the process: \n            We must remove every doll that is in a white cell.\n\n        And when we remove a doll in a white cell, it will produce two new dolls: one to the right and one down. \n\n        So the number of times we must do an operation is exactly the number of times we have a doll in a white cell.\n\n        And the initial doll is at (0,0) which is white.\n\n        So the total operations is the number of white cells that are visited by at least one doll? \n\n        But note: a white cell might be visited by multiple dolls.\n\n        In fact, the number of times a white cell (x,y) is visited is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that only move right and down? \n\n        However, we are not moving, we are splitting. \n\n        Actually, the number of times the cell (x,y) is visited is exactly the binomial coefficient: C(x+y, x).\n\n        Why? To reach (x,y) from (0,0), we need x down moves and y right moves, and the order is any sequence of x+y moves with x downs and y rights.\n\n        But note: the process: \n            (0,0) -> (0,1) and (1,0)\n            from (0,1) -> (0,2) and (1,1)\n            from (1,0) -> (1,1) and (2,0)\n\n        So (1,1) is visited twice.\n\n        In general, the number of times (x,y) is visited is C(x+y, x).\n\n        Therefore, the total number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of C(x+y, x).\n\n        But note: the initial doll is counted in the cell (0,0). And then we remove it, and then we count the times we remove a doll in a white cell.\n\n        So the total operations = (sum_{for all white cells (x,y)} C(x+y, x)) - 1? \n\n        Why minus one? Because the initial doll is not removed by an operation? \n\n        But we do remove the initial doll. The initial state has one doll. We will remove it in the first operation.\n\n        So the total operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of times a doll is present at (x,y) (which is C(x+y, x)), and then we remove it, so we do one operation per removal.\n\n        Therefore, total operations = sum_{white cell (x,y)} C(x+y, x)\n\n        However, in the example: \n            white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n\n            (0,0): C(0,0)=1\n            (0,1): C(1,0)=1\n            (1,0): C(1,1)=1? -> C(1,0)=1 (since C(1,0)=1, C(1,1)=1) -> but wait, (1,0): x=1,y=0 -> C(1,0)=1.\n            (1,1): C(2,1)=2\n\n            total = 1+1+1+2 = 5.\n\n        Matches.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of C(x+y, x).\n\n        But note: the grid is infinite, but the white cells are only for x>=0, y>=0, and for a given x, y < a_x.\n\n        And for x>n, a_x=0, so no white cells.\n\n        So we only consider x from 0 to n, and for each x, y from 0 to a_x-1.\n\n        So the answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x)\n\n        We note that: \n            sum_{y=0}^{k} C(x+y, x) = C(x+k+1, x+1) = C(x+k+1, k)   [by the hockey-stick identity]\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed x, the inner sum = C(x+a_x, x+1) = C(x+a_x, a_x-1)\n\n        But note: \n            sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n        So the answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n        Example: x=0, a0=2: then term = C(0+2, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2.\n                 x=1, a1=2: then term = C(1+2, 1+1)=C(3,2)=3.\n                 x>=2: a_x=0, so no term.\n                 total = 2+3 = 5.\n\n        But the example has 5, so it matches.\n\n        However, in the example the white cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) -> and we had 1+1+1+2=5.\n\n        But our formula: \n            x=0: a0=2 -> C(0+2,1)=2\n            x=1: a1=2 -> C(1+2,2)=C(3,2)=3\n            total=5.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, the answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1) mod (10^9+7)\n\n        But note: x from 0 to n, and a_x can be up to 200000, and x up to 200000, so x+a_x can be up to 400000.\n\n        We need to compute binomial coefficients C(k, r) for k up to 400000 and r up to 200000.\n\n        We can precompute factorials up to 400000.\n\n        The problem: n up to 200000.\n\n        We are given: \n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))   #

or r = a[x]-1? \n                    # But note: C(x+a_x, x+1) = C(x+a_x, a_x-1) \n                    # But a_x-1 might be negative if a_x==0, but we skip a_x==0.\n                    # We need to compute C(k, min(r, k-r)) for efficiency.\n\n                    # However, we precomputed factorials up to 400000.\n\n            But the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n                n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n                for i in range(1,9**6):f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\n                for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n                print(d%m)\n\n            We see:\n                f is the factorial array up to 9**6 = 531441, which is greater than 400000.\n\n            We can use:\n                C(n, r) = f[n] * inv(f[r]) * inv(f[n-r]) % mod\n\n            But note: we cannot do this for every term because there are 200000 terms and modular inverse might be heavy, but 200000 is acceptable.\n\n            However, the provided code already has a factorial array f of length 531441.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                n_val = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                mod = 10**9+7\n\n                #
