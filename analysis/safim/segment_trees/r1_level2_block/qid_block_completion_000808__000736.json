Actually, we have e=2 and r=3: then we add to Alice: e becomes 2 (which is the third candy) -> then we have e=2 and r=3 -> then we break the tie and add to Alice: then we have e=2, and then we check: e+1=3, which is not less than r=3? -> so we break? But then we have: Alice: [1,1,1] -> sum=3\n            Bob: [1,1] -> sum=2 -> then we would then add to Bob: but r=3, then we do r-1=2 -> but then we are taking the candy at index2?",

For program2.py:\n\n        The code is:\n\n          t = int(input()) while t > 0:\n            n = int(input()) if n >= 1900:\n              print(\"Division\",1)\n            elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n              print(\"Division\", 2)\n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n              print(\"Division\",4)\n            t -= 1\n\n        The TODO: for the condition 1400<=rating<1600, we should print \"Division 3\". So the missing code is:\n\n          print(\"Division\",3)\n\n      But note: the condition in the elif is: n >= 1400 and n < 1600, so we can simply do:\n\n          print(\"Division\", 3) However, the problem says: Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n\n      The condition in the elif: n >= 1400 and n < 1600 -> which is 1400<=n<1600, which is the same as the problem. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          print(\"Division\",3)\n\n      But note: the sample test cases: \n          rating=1400 -> should be division 3.\n          rating=1599 -> division 3.\n          rating=1600 -> division 2. The condition for division 2: n>=1600 and n<1900 -> 1600<=n<1900. So it's correct. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        program1: the missing code for the elif block:\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        program2: the missing code for the elif block:\n            print(\"Division\",3) We output in JSON format:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"candidate = g + h\\n        if candidate > index:\\n            index = candidate\\n if e+1 < r:\\n            e += 1\\n            lowest += lst[e]\\n            g += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\",\n          \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",3)\"\n        }\n\n      But note: the provided code in program1.py has a variable 'index' that we are updating.",

Test case 3: [9,1] (n=2)\n          e=0, r=1, lowest=9, highest=1 -> \n            9>1 -> add to Bob: \n                r=0, highest=1+lst[0]? -> wait, in the elif block for highest<lowest, we do:\n                  highest += lst[r-1]   # r=1, so r-1=0 -> lst[0]=9 -> highest=1+9=10, then r-=1 -> r=0, h=2. total=1+2=3, which is >2 -> the while condition: h+g<=m -> 3<=2 -> false, so we break the while loop. Then we print index=0 -> correct. Test case 4: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14] (n=10)",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code in program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (e from the left and r from the right) and two variables (lowest for Alice's current total and highest for Bob's current total). The goal is to find the maximum total candies (h+g) such that the two totals are equal.\n\nThe current code has:\n  n = int(input())   # actually this is t, the number of test cases\n  for each test case:\n      h = 1   # count of candies eaten by Alice? (starting from left, but note initial: Alice has taken the first candy)\n      g = 1   # count of candies eaten by Bob? (starting from right, initial: Bob has taken the last candy)\n      counter = 0   # not used? we can ignore?\n      m = int(input())   # number of candies\n      lst = list of weights\n      index = 0   # this will be the answer for the test case? but note the print at the end is index\n      e = 0   # current left index (next available from left? but note: Alice has taken index0, so e starts at 0 and then we move to e+1 when adding next)\n      r = m-1 # current right index (Bob has taken the last candy, so r starts at m-1 and then we move to r-1)\n      lowest = lst[0]   # Alice's current total (starting with the first candy)\n      highest = lst[m-1] # Bob's current total (starting with the last candy)\n\n      while h+g <= m:   # total candies eaten so far is h+g, which must be <= m\n          if lowest < highest:\n              # then we add the next candy from the left to Alice\n              e += 1\n              lowest += lst[e]   # but note: e was 0, then we do e+1 -> 1, so we are adding the second candy? \n              g += 1   # wait, why g? Actually, the variables h and g: \n                       # Let me check: initially, Alice has 1 candy (h=1) and Bob has 1 candy (g=1). \n                       # Then when we add a candy for Alice, we are increasing the count for Alice? But the variable g is being increased? \n                       # This seems inconsistent.\n\n      Actually, looking at the initial conditions:\n          h = 1 (Alice's count) and g = 1 (Bob's count) -> total 2.\n          Then in the if block for lowest < highest: \n              we do: g += 1 -> now g=2, but that would be Bob's count? But we are adding to Alice.\n\n      This is confusing. Let me reexamine the variable names:\n\n      The problem says: \n          Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right.\n\n      In the code:\n          h: might be the count of candies eaten by Alice? \n          g: might be the count of candies eaten by Bob?\n\n      But then when we add a candy for Alice, we should update h, not g.\n\n      However, in the code:\n          if lowest < highest:\n              lowest += lst[e+1]   # so we are taking the next left candy (e+1) and adding to Alice (lowest)\n              e += 1\n              g += 1   # why g? This should be Alice's count, so h should be increased.\n\n      Similarly, in the else if block for highest<lowest, we update h (which is Alice's count) when we are adding to Bob? \n\n      This seems backwards.\n\n      Alternatively, the variables h and g might be misnamed. Let me see the condition: while h+g <= m.\n\n      Actually, the problem says: we are trying to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is Alice's count + Bob's count).\n\n      The idea of the algorithm is to use two pointers and two sums. We start with:\n          Alice: [0] -> sum = lst[0], count = 1\n          Bob: [m-1] -> sum = lst[m-1], count = 1\n\n      Then we try to balance the two sums by adding one candy at a time from the left (to Alice) if her sum is less, or from the right (to Bob) if his sum is less. When they are equal, we record the total candies eaten (which is count_Alice + count_Bob) and then try to add more? But note: we can only have one continuous segment from the left and one from the right without overlapping.\n\n      However, the note in the problem: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\" -> total candies eaten is 3+4=7.\n\n      How do we record the maximum total? The problem says: we want the maximum total candies eaten such that the two sums are equal.\n\n      The algorithm in the code:\n\n          while h+g <= m:   # total candies eaten so far is h+g, which must be <= m (so we haven't exceeded the total candies)\n            if lowest < highest:\n                # then we add the next candy from the left to Alice\n                e += 1   # so e was the current left pointer, now we move to the next\n                lowest += lst[e]   # add the candy at position e (which is the next left candy)\n                g += 1   # but wait, why g? This should be increasing Alice's count. \n\n          Similarly, when highest<lowest, we do:\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1   # and here we are increasing h (which we thought was Alice's count) when we are adding to Bob.\n\n      This is inconsistent. It seems the variables h and g are swapped in meaning.\n\n      Actually, let me check the initial conditions:\n\n          h = 1, g = 1 -> total 2.\n\n          In the first if block (lowest < highest) we do:\n              g += 1 -> then g becomes 2, so total becomes h+g = 1+2 = 3.\n\n          But we just added one candy for Alice, so Alice's count should be 2 and Bob's remains 1? Then the total is 3.\n\n          So h is Alice's count? Then why when we add to Alice we update g? \n\n      Alternatively, the variable names might be swapped: \n          h: Bob's count? \n          g: Alice's count?\n\n      But then in the else if block, when we add to Bob we update h (which would be Bob's count) -> that makes sense.\n\n      So let me reinterpret:\n\n          h: Bob's candy count\n          g: Alice's candy count\n\n      Then initially: \n          Alice has 1 candy -> g=1\n          Bob has 1 candy -> h=1\n\n      Then when we add a candy for Alice: \n          g += 1 -> becomes 2 (so Alice now has 2 candies) -> that matches.\n\n      And when we add a candy for Bob: \n          h += 1 -> becomes 2 (Bob has 2 candies) -> that matches.\n\n      So the condition: while h+g <= m: is the total candies eaten so far.\n\n      Now, when the two sums are equal, we have a candidate for the total candies eaten: g (Alice's count) + h (Bob's count). We want the maximum such total.\n\n      The code currently in the elif block (highest == lowest) is missing.\n\n      What should we do when they are equal?\n          We record the current total candies: g + h. But note, we might be able to continue? \n          However, we can also try to move both pointers? \n\n      But note: we are trying to maximize the total candies. When the sums are equal, we can record the total and then try to add more? \n\n      However, if we add one more to Alice, then her sum becomes larger, and then we might have to add to Bob to compensate, but we cannot skip.\n\n      The problem says: they eat in a row from their respective ends. So we are allowed to have two independent contiguous segments: one at the left (Alice) and one at the right (Bob). \n\n      The algorithm:\n\n          We start with:\n              alice_sum = lst[0], alice_count = 1\n              bob_sum = lst[-1], bob_count = 1\n          Then we have two pointers: left_index = 0, right_index = n-1.\n\n          We want to consider all the times when the two sums are equal and record the total candies (alice_count+bob_count). Then we try to extend.\n\n          The known method for this problem (from the note: the total n over test cases is 200000) is to use two pointers and move the one with the smaller sum.\n\n          However, when the sums are equal, we can record the total and then we can move both pointers? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            if alice_sum == bob_sum:\n                # record the total candies: alice_count + bob_count\n                # then we can try to move one step from both? \n                # But note: we are allowed to have multiple segments? No, they are contiguous from the ends.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We traverse until the two pointers meet? \n\n          The known solution for this problem (Candies and Two Sisters) is:\n\n            ans = 0\n            left = 0\n            right = n-1\n            sum1 = 0\n            sum2 = 0\n            while left <= right:\n                if sum1 <= sum2:\n                    sum1 += arr[left]\n                    left += 1\n                else:\n                    sum2 += arr[right]\n                    right -= 1\n                if sum1 == sum2:\n                    ans = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the next index for Alice (so she has eaten [0, left-1] -> count = left) and Bob has eaten [right+1, n-1] -> count = n-1 - right\n\n          But note: the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot skip. And they are independent: they can stop at any time. We are to maximize the total number of candies.\n\n          However, the above method does not exactly do that because it forces to traverse the entire array? \n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            i = 0\n            j = n-1\n            sum1 = 0\n            sum2 = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while i <= j:\n                if sum1 <= sum2:\n                    sum1 += arr[i]\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    sum2 += arr[j]\n                    j -= 1\n                if sum1 == sum2:\n                    ans = i + (n - j - 1)   # because Alice has eaten i candies (indices 0 to i-1) and Bob has eaten (n - j - 1) candies (indices j+1 to n-1)\n\n          Then we output ans.\n\n          But note: the condition of the problem: they can stop at any time. So we are allowed to not traverse the entire array? \n\n          The above algorithm traverses until the pointers cross? and we record the last time the two sums were equal.\n\n          However, the problem says: maximize the total number of candies. So we want the maximum ans over the entire process.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            ans = 0\n            i = 0\n            j = n-1\n            sum1 = 0\n            sum2 = 0\n            while i <= j:\n                if sum1 < sum2:\n                    sum1 += arr[i]\n                    i += 1\n                elif sum2 < sum1:\n                    sum2 += arr[j]\n                    j -= 1\n                else:\n                    # when equal, we record the current total candies: i (for Alice) and (n-1 - j) for Bob -> total = i + (n-1-j)\n                    ans = i + (n-1-j)   # because Alice has taken [0, i-1] -> i candies, Bob has taken [j+1, n-1] -> n-1 - j candies.\n                    # then we add from the left? because we want to continue? but note: we can break the tie arbitrarily? \n                    # Actually, we can add one from the left to break the tie? but then we break the equality. \n                    # However, we want to maximize the total. We record the current ans and then we continue? \n                    # But note: we can have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total candies at any equality.\n                    # So we record the maximum ans.\n\n                    # Then we add from the left to try to extend? \n                    # Actually, we can do: \n                    sum1 += arr[i]\n                    i += 1\n\n            But wait, what if we have: [1,1]? \n                Initially: i=0, j=1, sum1=0, sum2=0 -> equal, then we set ans = 0 + (n-1-1) = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? -> that's not right.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            ans = 0\n            i = -1\n            j = n\n            sum1 = 0\n            sum2 = 0\n            while i < j:\n                if sum1 == sum2:\n                    # record the total candies: (i+1) from Alice and (n - j) from Bob -> total = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                    ans = (i+1) + (n - j)\n                    # then we move both? \n                    if i+1 < j:\n                        i += 1\n                        sum1 += arr[i]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                elif sum1 < sum2:\n                    i += 1\n                    sum1 += arr[i]\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    sum2 += arr[j]\n\n            Then output ans.\n\n          But note: the constraints: total n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do two pointers.\n\n          However, the provided code in program1.py has a different structure. We are to complete the missing part.\n\n      Given the provided code:\n\n          while h+g <= m:   # h is Bob's count, g is Alice's count -> total candies = h+g, which must be <= m\n            if lowest < highest:\n                # then we add one more candy to Alice (from the left)\n                e += 1   # current left pointer is e, then we take e+1? but note: initially e=0, then we take e+1 -> index1? \n                lowest += lst[e]   # so we are adding the next candy (at index e, which was just incremented) -> but we must ensure e is within bounds? \n                g += 1   # Alice's count increases\n            elif highest < lowest:\n                highest += lst[r-1]   # we are adding the candy to the left of the current right pointer? \n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n            elif highest == lowest:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      What to do when they are equal?\n          We should record the total candies eaten: g (Alice's count) + h (Bob's count). And we want the maximum over the entire process.\n\n          Then we can try to add one more candy to either side? But note: we cannot break the condition that they are non-overlapping. \n\n          However, we have the condition: h+g <= m. So we can add one more? \n\n          But if we add to one side, the sums become unequal. We can then continue the process? \n\n          But note: we are in a while loop that continues until h+g > m? Actually, the condition is h+g<=m, so we break when h+g>m.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            # record the current total: g+h as a candidate for the maximum.\n            # then we try to add one more candy to Alice? or Bob? Actually, we can break the tie arbitrarily? \n            # But note: we want to maximize the total candies. We record the candidate and then we break the tie by adding to one side? \n\n          However, we can do:\n\n            index = g + h   # because we want to record the maximum total candies when the sums are equal.\n\n            # Then we try to add one more candy to Alice? \n            # But we must check if we can? (if e+1 < r) then we can add to Alice? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not require that we use all candies? We can stop at any time. But the algorithm is designed to add until the entire array is consumed? \n\n          However, the condition of the while loop is h+g<=m, so we can add until we have used all candies.\n\n          The idea: when the sums are equal, we record the total and then we break the tie by adding to Alice? \n\n          But note: we might have two possibilities: we can add to Alice or to Bob? However, the problem does not require that we have the same sum at the end? We are free to stop at any time. But we are trying to maximize the total candies. So we record the candidate and then we continue? because we might get a larger total later? \n\n          Example: [1,2,1,2] \n            Initially: \n                Alice: [1] -> sum=1, count=1\n                Bob: [2] (last candy) -> sum=2, count=1 -> total=2, but not equal? \n            Then since Alice's sum (1) < Bob's (2), we add to Alice: next candy is 2 -> Alice: [1,2] -> sum=3, count=2 -> now 3>2 -> then we add to Bob: next candy from right is 1 -> Bob: [2,1] -> sum=3, count=2 -> now equal. Then total=4.\n\n          So we record 4.\n\n          How does the provided code work for this?\n\n            m=4, lst=[1,2,1,2]\n            e=0, r=3, lowest=1, highest=2, g=1, h=1 -> total=2<=4 -> condition: lowest(1)<highest(2) -> \n                e becomes 1, lowest=1+lst[1]=1+2=3, g becomes 2 -> now g=2 (Alice has 2), h=1 (Bob has 1) -> total=3\n            Then: lowest=3, highest=2 -> then we do: highest<lowest -> \n                r becomes 2, highest=2+lst[2]=2+1=3, h becomes 2 -> total=4\n            Then: lowest=3, highest=3 -> we enter the elif block.\n\n          Now, in the elif block, we must record the total candies: g+h = 2+2 = 4.\n\n          Then what? We must continue? because we have e=1, r=2 -> and we can add more? \n          But note: the condition: h+g=4 which is <=4 -> so we are still in the loop.\n\n          However, if we add to Alice: we would need to take e+1=2, but e=1 -> then e+1=2, but then we are at the same index that Bob has? because Bob has taken index3 and then index2? and now Alice would take index2? -> that's not allowed.\n\n          So we cannot add more? \n\n          How do we break? The condition h+g<=m: we are at 4, which equals m, so we break? \n\n          But the while loop condition is h+g<=m, and we are at 4, so we break? \n\n          Actually, the while loop condition is at the beginning of the loop. We are about to start the next iteration? \n\n          But we are at the end of the current iteration. Then we check the condition: 4<=4 -> true, so we enter again.\n\n          Then we are in the elif block (because 3==3). Then we do the same? \n\n          We must avoid an infinite loop.\n\n          Therefore, in the elif block, we must break the tie and then move one step? \n\n          But note: we cannot add to both? because then we would be taking the same candy? \n\n          Actually, we can only add if there is a candy between e and r? \n\n          Condition: if e+1 < r, then we can add to Alice? but then we break the tie? \n\n          However, we can also break the tie by adding to one side? \n\n          The known solution: when the sums are equal, we record the candidate and then we add to Alice? (so that we break the tie and then continue). \n\n          But then we must check: after adding to Alice, we break the tie and then the next iteration will fix? \n\n          However, we are allowed to stop at any time. But the problem is: we are trying to maximize the total candies. So if we have an equality, we record it and then we break the tie arbitrarily to continue? \n\n          So in the elif block:\n\n            index = g + h   # record the current total as candidate (but we want the maximum, so we record the maximum candidate over the entire process)\n\n            # Then we try to add one more candy to Alice? (if available) to break the tie and continue? \n            if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between the current Alice's last and Bob's last?\n                # we add to Alice\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                # if we cannot add, then we break? \n                break\n\n          But what if we add to Alice and then the next step we might get a bigger total? \n\n          Example: [1,1,1,1,1] \n            Initially: \n                Alice: [1] -> g=1, lowest=1\n                Bob: [1] (last) -> h=1, highest=1 -> equal -> record index=2.\n                Then we add to Alice: e=1 (so we take the second candy) -> lowest=2, g=2.\n            Then: lowest=2, highest=1 -> then we add to Bob: r=3 (so we take the fourth candy) -> highest=2, h=2 -> then equal again -> record index=4.\n            Then we add to Alice: e=2 -> lowest=3, g=3 -> then we add to Bob: r=2 -> but wait, r was 3, then r-1=2 -> but then we are at the same candy? \n\n          Actually, we have e=2 and r=3: then we add to Alice: e becomes 2 (which is the third candy) -> then we have e=2 and r=3 -> then we break the tie and add to Alice: then we have e=2, and then we check: e+1=3, which is not less than r=3? -> so we break? \n\n          But then we have: \n            Alice: [1,1,1] -> sum=3\n            Bob: [1,1] -> sum=2 -> then we would then add to Bob: but r=3, then we do r-1=2 -> but then we are taking the candy at index2? which is already taken by Alice? \n\n          So we must not add if e+1 < r? \n\n          Actually, the condition should be: if e+1 < r, meaning there is at least one candy between the current Alice's last and Bob's last? \n\n          But note: the next candy for Alice is at e+1 (if e+1 < r) and for Bob at r-1 (if r-1 > e). \n\n          However, after we add to Alice, we do e+=1, so the next available for Alice is e+1, and for Bob is r (which hasn't changed). But we have already taken the candy at e? \n\n          The problem: we are using the array as is. We have two pointers: \n            e: the last index that Alice has taken (so she has taken [0, e])\n            r: the last index that Bob has taken (so he has taken [r, m-1])\n\n          Then the next candy for Alice is at e+1 (if e+1 < r) and for Bob at r-1 (if r-1 > e).\n\n          So in the elif block (when equal) we do:\n\n            # record the candidate: total = g+h\n            if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r? \n                # we break the tie by adding to Alice? \n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                # no more candy to add? then we break the loop? \n                break\n\n          But what if we break the tie by adding to Bob? It doesn't matter? \n\n          However, we want to maximize the total. We have recorded the candidate at this equality. Then we break the tie arbitrarily to see if we can get a larger total? \n\n          But note: we are going to continue the loop and we might get another equality? \n\n          So we do:\n\n            index = max(index, g+h)   # because we want the maximum over the entire process.\n\n          But wait, the variable 'index' is initialized to 0. Then we update it when we get an equality? \n\n          However, the problem: we might have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total candies.\n\n          So we should do:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n          Then we break the tie by adding to Alice? \n\n          But note: we might have an equality again? \n\n          However, we must be cautious: we are updating the same variables and then the loop continues.\n\n          So the code for the elif block:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n            # Then we break the tie: we add to Alice if we can? \n            if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                # if we cannot add, then we break? but the loop condition might break later? \n                # Actually, we break the loop? because we cannot add more? \n                # But the condition h+g<=m: we are at g+h = candidate, and then we add one more -> g+h becomes candidate+1, which might be <=m? \n                # But if e+1==r, then we cannot add without overlapping? \n                # So we break the loop? \n                break\n\n          However, what if we can add to Bob? But we arbitrarily choose Alice? \n\n          But note: we are in the elif block and we break the tie arbitrarily. We could also break the tie by adding to Bob? \n\n          But the problem: we are free to choose? \n\n          Actually, we can do either. But we must be consistent? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the tie by adding to the side that has the next candy? \n\n          But the known solution: we break the tie by adding to the left? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify. \n\n          But note: the example [1,1,1,1,1] we want to get 4? \n\n          How does it work?\n\n            Initially: \n                e=0, r=4, lowest=1, highest=1, g=1, h=1 -> candidate=2 -> index=2.\n                Then we add to Alice: e=1, lowest=2, g=2 -> then we have: \n                    lowest=2, highest=1 -> then we add to Bob: r=3, highest=2, h=2 -> then we have equality again: candidate=4 -> index=4.\n                Then we try to add to Alice: e=1 -> next is e+1=2, and r=3 -> 2<3 -> so we add: e=2, lowest=3, g=3 -> then we have: \n                    lowest=3, highest=2 -> then we add to Bob: r=2 -> but then we have e=2 and r=2 -> which is the same candy? -> but we cannot take the same candy.\n\n          Actually, when we add to Bob: we do r-1 -> so from r=3, we do r-1=2 -> then we take the candy at index2? which is the same as Alice's last? \n\n          So we must avoid that. \n\n          Therefore, in the condition for Bob: we do:\n\n            if highest < lowest:\n                if r-1 > e:   # there is at least one candy between the current Bob's last and the current Alice's last?\n                    highest += lst[r-1]\n                    r -= 1\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n          But wait, the provided code does not have that condition? \n\n          Actually, the provided code in the if and elif blocks do not check for the gap? They only check h+g<=m. But h+g<=m does not guarantee that there is a candy? \n\n          For example, if we have e=0, r=1: then we have taken two candies? and there is no candy between? \n\n          But the condition h+g<=m: we are at 2, which is <=m? \n\n          Then we try to add to Alice: e+1=1, but r=1 -> so we would be taking the same candy? \n\n          Therefore, we must check the indices: in the if block for Alice, we should only add if e+1 < r? \n\n          But the provided code does not have that. \n\n          However, the problem states: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are guaranteed that the array has m elements.\n\n          The provided code in the if and elif blocks:\n\n            if lowest < highest:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]   # but what if e+1 is beyond the current Bob's segment? \n                g += 1\n\n          This will cause an error if e+1 is not a valid index? \n\n          Actually, the condition of the while loop: h+g<=m. But note: \n            Initially: g=1, h=1 -> total=2, then we add to Alice: g becomes 2 -> total=3, then we add to Bob: h becomes 2 -> total=4, ... until we reach m.\n\n          But the indices: \n            e starts at 0, then we do e+=1 -> e=1, then e=2, ... until e = m-1? \n            Similarly, r starts at m-1, then r-=1 -> r=m-2, ... until r=0.\n\n          And we have the condition: while h+g<=m. \n\n          But note: when we add to Alice, we do e+=1, and then we use lst[e]. We must have e < m? \n\n          But initially e=0, then we do e+=1 -> e=1, which is valid for m>=2? \n\n          However, what if we are at the last candy? \n\n          Example: m=2: \n            Initially: e=0, r=1, g=1, h=1 -> total=2<=2 -> then we check: \n                if lowest < highest? \n                if not, then if highest<lowest? \n                if not, then we do the elif block.\n\n          So we are safe? \n\n          But what if we have m=1? \n            Then the while loop condition: h+g=2<=1? -> false, so we skip the loop.\n\n          So the code for the elif block:\n\n            We must record the candidate and then break the tie? \n\n          However, we must also consider that after we break the tie, we might run into an invalid state? \n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n            # Then we break the tie by adding to Alice if there is a candy available? \n            if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r (so e+1 is strictly less than r, meaning at least one candy in between)\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                # if we cannot add to Alice, then we break the loop? \n                break\n\n          But what if we can add to Bob? We don't check? \n\n          However, if we break the tie arbitrarily, we choose Alice. Then if we cannot add to Alice, we break. \n\n          But what if we can add to Bob? Then we should do that? \n\n          Actually, we are in the elif block (equal) and we break the tie arbitrarily by adding to Alice? \n\n          But the problem: we are free to choose? \n\n          However, the algorithm: we are simulating the process. We break the tie arbitrarily to continue. \n\n          But note: if we break the tie by adding to Alice, then we get an inequality and then the next iteration will add to Bob if needed? \n\n          But if we break the tie by adding to Alice and then we cannot add to Bob because we break the loop? then we miss the opportunity to add to Bob? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the tie by adding to the side that has the next candy? \n\n          But the problem: we are free to choose? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify the order. We are just trying to maximize the total candies. \n\n          However, the known solution: we break the tie by adding to the left? \n\n          But to be safe, we can break the tie by adding to the left only if there is a candy on the left? and similarly, if there is no candy on the left, we try the right? \n\n          But the condition: we are at e and r. The next candy for Alice is at e+1 (if e+1 < r) and for Bob at r-1 (if r-1 > e). \n\n          We can do:\n\n            if e+1 < r:\n                # add to Alice\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif r-1 > e:\n                # add to Bob\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          But note: it is possible that both are available? then we choose one arbitrarily? \n\n          However, we can only choose one? \n\n          But the problem: we are simulating the process. We break the tie arbitrarily. \n\n          But the total candies we are going to get might be the same? \n\n          However, we are going to continue the loop and we might get another equality? \n\n          So we do:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif r-1 > e:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]   # note: in the provided code, when adding to Bob, they did: highest += lst[r-1] and then r-=1 -> that is the same as: \n                # But note: in the provided code for Bob: \n                #   highest += lst[r-1]\n                #   r -= 1\n                #   h += 1\n                # This is equivalent to: \n                #   r_new = r-1\n                #   highest += lst[r_new]   # but wait, no: because we are using the old r to index: r-1 -> which is the next candy to the left of the current Bob's last.\n                # But in our current state, Bob has taken from r to m-1. The next candy to the left is at r-1. So we do:\n                #   r = r-1\n                #   highest += lst[r]   # which is the same as the provided code: lst[r-1] when r was the old r? \n                # Actually, if we do:\n                #   r_old = r\n                #   r = r-1\n                #   highest += lst[r]   # which is the candy at the new r (which is r_old-1) -> same as the provided code: they did lst[r-1] with the old r and then set r = r-1.\n                # So we can do: \n                #   r -= 1\n                #   highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          But note: the provided code for Bob in the elif block (for highest<lowest) does:\n\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n\n          So we are consistent.\n\n          However, we are in the elif block for equality, and we are adding to either Alice or Bob? \n\n          But the problem: we are breaking the tie arbitrarily. \n\n          But we must be cautious: if we add to Bob, then we update Bob's variables. \n\n          So the code for the elif block:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif r-1 > e:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          But note: what if both conditions are true? we do the first one? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if e+1 < r and r-1 > e: \n                # both are available, we choose arbitrarily? \n                # let's choose Alice? \n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif e+1 < r:\n                # only Alice has next candy\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif r-1 > e:\n                # only Bob has next candy\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          But the condition \"e+1 < r\" is the same as \"r-1 > e\" because:\n              e+1 < r  <=> r > e+1  <=> r-1 > e   (since integers)\n\n          So we can simply do:\n\n            if e+1 < r:   # which is equivalent to r-1>e\n                # we can add to either? but we choose Alice? \n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          Why? because if e+1 < r, then there is at least one candy between e and r. Then we can add to Alice. \n\n          But what if we choose Bob? \n\n          Actually, it doesn't matter? because we are going to continue the loop and then we will add to Bob in the next iteration if needed? \n\n          However, we break the tie arbitrarily. \n\n          But to be consistent with the provided code structure, we choose Alice? \n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n      But note: the while loop condition: h+g<=m. After we break, we break the current iteration and then the while loop condition is checked again? \n\n      However, we break out of the elif block and then the next iteration of the while loop? \n\n      But if we break in the else branch, we break out of the while loop? \n\n      Actually, we are using 'break' which breaks the while loop.\n\n      So we do:\n\n        elif highest == lowest:\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n      But what if we don't break? then we update and then the next iteration we are still in the while loop? \n\n      This should be fine.\n\n      However, we must consider that after we break the tie, we might have the next iteration that does not go into the elif block? \n\n      Example: we break the tie by adding to Alice, then we have lowest > highest? then the next iteration will go into the elif block for highest<lowest and add to Bob? \n\n      That is the normal process.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the elif block is:\n\n        candidate = g + h\n        if candidate > index:\n            index = candidate\n        if e+1 < r:\n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]\n            g += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n      But note: what if we have multiple equalities? we update the index to the last candidate? but we want the maximum candidate? \n\n      We are updating index only when we get an equality? and we are updating it to the maximum candidate so far? \n\n      However, we are doing:\n\n        if candidate > index: \n            index = candidate\n\n      So we are storing the maximum.\n\n      But what if we never have an equality? then index remains 0? \n\n      The problem: the answer can be 0 (like the third test case). \n\n      So that is acceptable.\n\n      However, the third test case: [3,1,1,1,1,1] -> \n        Alice: [3] -> 3\n        Bob: [1] (last) -> 1 -> not equal.\n        Then we add to Bob: [1,1] (last two) -> 2 -> still 3>2 -> add to Bob: 3 -> then we have 3==3 -> candidate=1+3=4 -> index=4.\n        Then we break the tie: if e+1<r? e=0, r=2 (because initially r=5, then we did two steps for Bob: so r=5-2=3? wait, let me simulate:\n\n        m=6, lst=[3,1,1,1,1,1]\n        e=0, r=5, lowest=3, highest=1, g=1, h=1 -> total=2<=6 -> lowest>highest -> so we add to Bob: \n            r becomes 4, highest=1+lst[4]=1+1=2, h=2 -> total=3\n        Then: lowest=3, highest=2 -> add to Bob: r becomes 3, highest=2+lst[3]=3, h=3 -> total=4 -> then we have equality? \n            candidate=4 -> index=4 (if we set index=0 initially, then 4>0 -> index=4)\n            Then we check: e+1=1, r=3 -> 1<3 -> true -> we add to Alice: \n                e=1, lowest=3+lst[1]=3+1=4, g=2 -> total=5\n        Then: lowest=4, highest=3 -> add to Bob: \n                r becomes 2, highest=3+lst[2]=3+1=4, h=4 -> total=6 -> then we have equality? \n            candidate=6 -> index=6 (since 6>4)\n            Then we check: e+1=2, r=2 -> 2<2 is false -> break.\n\n        Then we output 6? \n\n        But the expected answer for the fourth test case is 7? \n\n        The fourth test case: \n            Input: \n                n=10\n                weights: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14] \n            Expected: 7\n\n        How do we get 7? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n            Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n        How does our algorithm work?\n\n          We start:\n            e=0 -> lowest=7\n            r=9 -> highest=14\n            g=1, h=1 -> total=2\n\n          Then: 7<14 -> add to Alice: e=1, lowest=7+3=10, g=2 -> total=3\n          Then: 10<14 -> add to Alice: e=2, lowest=10+20=30, g=3 -> total=4\n          Then: 30>14 -> add to Bob: r=8, highest=14+9=23, h=2 -> total=5\n          Then: 30>23 -> add to Bob: r=7, highest=23+1=24, h=3 -> total=6\n          Then: 30>24 -> add to Bob: r=6, highest=24+11=35, h=4 -> total=7\n          Then: 30<35 -> add to Alice: but e=2, next e+1=3 -> but we have to check: e+1=3, r=6 -> 3<6 -> so we add: e=3, lowest=30+5=35, g=4 -> total=8\n          Then: 35==35 -> candidate=8 -> update index to 8? \n          Then we break the tie: e+1=4, r=6 -> 4<6 -> add to Alice: e=4, lowest=35+10=45, g=5 -> total=9\n          Then: 45>35 -> add to Bob: r=5, highest=35+8=43, h=5 -> total=10\n          Then: 45>43 -> add to Bob: but r=5, then r-1=4 -> but e=4, so we break? \n\n          Then we output 8? but expected 7.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        We are not stopping at the first opportunity? \n\n        We should have recorded 7? \n\n        How? \n          When we had: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, count=3\n            Bob: [14,9,1,11] -> 14+9+1+11 = 35? -> no, Bob is taking from the right: \n                Bob: [14,9,1,11] -> but the array: \n                    [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14]\n                Bob: from the right: \n                    first: 14 (index9)\n                    then: 9 (index8)\n                    then: 1 (index7)\n                    then: 11 (index6) -> so Bob: 14+9+1+11 = 35.\n\n          But we want Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> which are the last four? but the last four are: \n            index9:14, index8:9, index7:1, index6:11 -> that is 14,9,1,11 -> 35.\n\n          But the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which are the candies at indices: \n            index5:8, index6:11, index7:1, index8:9? -> that is not contiguous from the right? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: Bob eats from the right, contiguous segment. So he must take the last candy, then the last two, etc. \n\n          The example: \n            Bob eats: [10,8,11,1] -> but 10 is at index4? then 8 at index5, 11 at index6, 1 at index7. \n            So Bob's segment: [index4, index5, index6, index7]? \n            But that is not contiguous from the right? because the last candy is index9:14, which is not eaten? \n\n          The problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip). So he must eat a contiguous segment that ends at the last candy? \n\n          But the example: Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> but 1 is not the last candy? the last candy is 14. \n\n          Actually, the example says: \n            \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          But the input: \n            w1=7, w2=3, w3=20, w4=5, w5=10, w6=8, w7=11, w8=1, w9=9, w10=14.\n\n          So Bob must eat from the right: \n            He can choose to eat the last k candies? but then he would eat: \n                k=1: [14]\n                k=2: [9,14]\n                k=3: [1,9,14]\n                k=4: [11,1,9,14]\n                k=5: [8,11,1,9,14]\n                k=6: [10,8,11,1,9,14]\n\n          He cannot skip the last candy? \n\n          But the example says he eats [10,8,11,1] -> which are not at the end? \n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n          This means he must eat a contiguous block that ends at the last candy. \n\n          Therefore, the example: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> from the left: the first three.\n            Bob: [1,9,14] -> but that is 1+9+14=24, not 30.\n\n          Or Bob: [9,14] -> 23, not 30.\n\n          How do they get 30 for Bob? \n\n          The example says: Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which is 10+8+11+1=30.\n\n          But these are not contiguous at the right? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\"\n\n          But note: the candies are numbered from left to right. Bob eats from the right, meaning he can only take a contiguous segment that starts from some index and goes to the last candy? \n\n          But the example: [10,8,11,1] are not contiguous in the array? \n\n          Actually, they are not contiguous: \n            The array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14]\n            [10,8,11,1] are at indices 4,5,6,7 -> which is contiguous, but not at the right? the right contiguous segment must include the last candy? \n\n          The problem says: \"from the right\", meaning he eats a suffix? \n\n          But the example: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> in the second test case: \n            n=6: [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> Bob eats the first three from the right: [1,1,1] (which is the last three).\n\n          So Bob eats a suffix. \n\n          Therefore, the example: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] (prefix of length 3)\n            Bob: [1,9,14] (suffix of length 3) -> 1+9+14=24, not 30.\n\n          But the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which is not a suffix.\n\n          This is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\n          Let me read the note: \n            \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight.\"\n\n          How can Bob eat [10,8,11,1] if he can only eat from the right? \n\n          The only possibility: the problem allows Bob to eat any contiguous segment from the right, but not necessarily a suffix? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\"\n\n          This means he must eat a contiguous segment that is at the right, but not necessarily the entire suffix? \n\n          But then he could choose any contiguous segment at the right? \n\n          However, the example: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" and \"he can't skip candies\" -> meaning he must eat a contiguous segment that is a suffix? \n\n          I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\n          Looking at the official examples: \n            Example 2: \n                Input: 6 candies [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n                Alice eats the first three from the left: [1,1,1] (prefix)\n                Bob eats the first three from the right: [1,1,1] (suffix)\n\n          So Bob eats the suffix of length 3.\n\n          Example 4: \n                Alice: [7,3,20] (prefix)\n                Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> but these are not a suffix.\n\n          Unless the problem means that Bob eats from the right but not necessarily a contiguous block at the very end? \n\n          But the problem says: \"he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row\" -> meaning that if he eats a candy, he must eat all candies to the right of that candy? \n\n          No, it means that he eats a contiguous segment that starts from some index and goes to the right, but not necessarily the very end? \n\n          But then he could choose any contiguous segment anywhere on the right? \n\n          This is not what the problem says: \n            \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n          This means:\n            Alice: must eat a contiguous prefix.\n            Bob: must eat a contiguous suffix.\n\n          Therefore, the example: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> indices0,1,2.\n            Bob: must be a contiguous suffix: the last four: [1,9,14] -> indices7,8,9? -> but that is only three.\n\n          The last four: indices6,7,8,9: [11,1,9,14] -> sum=11+1+9+14=35.\n\n          How do we get 30 for Bob? \n\n          The example says: [10,8,11,1] -> sum=10+8+11+1=30.\n\n          These are indices4,5,6,7.\n\n          This is not a suffix.\n\n          I see the mistake: the problem does not require that the suffix is at the very end? \n\n          But the problem says: \"from the right\", and the candies are numbered from left to right. \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the sample input for the fourth test case: \n            n=10\n            weights: 7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14\n\n          And the solution: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> weight=30.\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> weight=30.\n\n          How is Bob's segment chosen? \n            The problem: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" -> meaning he can choose any contiguous segment that is at the right, but not necessarily touching the very right? \n\n          But then he could choose a segment in the middle? \n\n          However, the condition: \"he can't skip candies\" -> if he chooses to eat a candy in the middle, then he must eat all the candies to the right of that candy? \n\n          No, the problem says: \"he can't skip candies\" in the sense that if he decides to eat a candy, then he must eat all the candies from that candy to the right end? \n\n          This is the typical meaning: he eats a suffix.\n\n          Therefore, the example solution is not a suffix.\n\n          There is a known problem on Codeforces: \"Candies\" (or \"Candies and Two Sisters\")? \n\n          The problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1472/B\n\n          But this is not the same.\n\n          Actually, the problem is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1845/problem/B\n          or maybe: https://codeforces.com/contest/1474/problem/B\n\n          I recall a problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1472/problem/C\n\n          But the sample matches: \n            Example: \n                t=1\n                n=10\n                weights: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14]\n\n          And the answer is 7.\n\n          The known solution for this problem (from the constraints) is to use two pointers: \n            Alice takes a prefix and Bob takes a suffix, and we want the maximum total candies such that the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix.\n\n          And the prefix and suffix are disjoint.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm we are using (two pointers) is standard.\n\n          How then to explain the example? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> sum=30.\n            Bob: [1,9,14] -> sum=24 -> not 30.\n\n          But the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which is not a suffix.\n\n          I see the error in the example explanation: \n            \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          This is not a suffix. It is a contiguous segment from the right? \n\n          The problem: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" -> does it mean he can start from any point and take to the right, but not necessarily the very right? \n\n          No, typically \"from the right\" means from the very right and moving left.\n\n          After rethinking: the problem does not require that the suffix is contiguous with the very right? \n\n          But then the condition \"can't skip\" means that if he eats a candy, he must eat every candy to the right of it in the array? \n\n          For example, if he eats the candy at index7 (weight1), then he must also eat index8 and index9? \n\n          So the segment must be a suffix.\n\n          Therefore, the example explanation is indeed for a suffix: \n            Bob's suffix: [1,9,14] -> but that is indices7,8,9 -> sum=24.\n\n          How do we get 30 for Bob? \n            If we take a suffix of length 4: indices6,7,8,9: [11,1,9,14] -> sum=35.\n            length 5: indices5,6,7,8,9: [8,11,1,9,14] -> sum=43.\n            length 6: indices4,5,6,7,8,9: [10,8,11,1,9,14] -> sum=53.\n\n          None is 30.\n\n          I think there is a mistake in the example explanation. \n\n          But the example says: \" they each eat 30 weight\" and \" the answer is 7\".\n\n          The only way to get 7 total candies is if Alice eats 3 and Bob eats 4, and the sums are 30 and 30.\n\n          So the array must allow a prefix of 3 with sum 30 and a suffix of 4 with sum 30.\n\n          Let me calculate the array: \n            [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14]\n\n          Prefix of 3: [7,3,20] -> 30.\n          Suffix of 4: the last 4: [11,1,9,14] -> 11+1+9+14 = 35, not 30.\n\n          Suffix of 5: last 5: [8,11,1,9,14] = 8+11+1+9+14 = 43.\n\n          Suffix of 6: last 6: [10,8,11,1,9,14] = 10+8+11+1+9+14 = 53.\n\n          How about a suffix that is not at the very end? \n            The problem: contiguous suffix -> must be at the very end.\n\n          Therefore, the example explanation is flawed.\n\n          But the answer for the fourth test case is 7.\n\n          How to achieve 7? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, count=3.\n            Bob: we need a suffix with sum 30. \n                suffix of length 1: 14\n                length 2: 9+14=23\n                length 3: 1+9+14=24\n                length 4: 11+1+9+14=35\n                length 5: 8+11+1+9+14=43\n                length 6: 10+8+11+1+9+14=53\n                length 7: 5+10+8+11+1+9+14=58\n\n          None is 30.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might allow Bob to eat a contiguous segment from the right that is not necessarily the entire suffix? \n\n          For example, Bob might eat [9,14] -> contiguous and at the right, but not the entire suffix from his starting point? \n\n          But the problem: \"he can't skip candies\" -> if he eats the candy at index8, then he must eat index9? because they are contiguous and to the right of index8? \n\n          So if he eats index8, he must eat index9.\n\n          If he eats index7, he must eat index8 and index9.\n\n          Therefore, the only suffix segments are the ones we considered.\n\n          There is a different interpretation: \n            Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix, and they must be disjoint, and we want the sum of the prefix to equal the sum of the suffix, and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n          Then the example: \n            We can have:\n              Alice: [7,3,20] -> sum=30, count=3.\n              Bob: [1,9,14] -> sum=24, not 30.\n              Alice: [7,3] -> sum=10, count=2.\n              Bob: [14,9,1,11] -> not contiguous in the array? \n\n          This is not possible.\n\n          I think the example explanation meant: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] (indices0,1,2)\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] ( indices4,5,6,7) -> sum=10+8+11+1=30.\n\n          But then the total candies eaten is 3+4=7.\n\n          How is Bob's segment chosen? \n            The problem: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" -> but this segment is not at the right. \n\n          Unless \"from the right\" means that Bob starts from the right and moves left, but he can choose to stop at any time, and he can choose any contiguous segment as long as it is at the right of Alice's segment? \n\n          But then the condition: \"he can't skip candies\" -> if he eats a candy, he must eat every candy from that candy to the right end of his segment? \n\n          This would allow a contiguous segment anywhere, as long as it is at the right of Alice's segment and not overlapping.\n\n          But the problem says: \"from the right\", which typically means the very right.\n\n          Given the confusion, and the fact that the known solution for this problem (with the constraint that the total n over test cases is 200000) is the two pointers method that we are implementing, and that the sample test cases in the problem statement (test case 1,2,3) work with our algorithm, and the fourth test case might be an error, we will trust the algorithm.\n\n          The fourth test in the problem statement says the answer is 7, and our algorithm for the provided array [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14] does not yield 7 by the suffix interpretation.\n\n          However, the sample test cases provided in the note are:\n\n            Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n            Test case 2: n=6, [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> answer=6.\n            Test case 3: n=2, [9,1] -> answer=0.\n            Test case 4: n=10, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14] -> answer=7.\n\n          How can we get 7 for the fourth test case with the suffix interpretation? \n\n          We must have:\n            Alice: some prefix with sum S.\n            Bob: some suffix with sum S.\n            And the total candies eaten = len(prefix) + len(suffix) is maximized.\n\n          And the prefix and suffix are disjoint.\n\n          In the fourth test case, we can have:\n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> sum=30, length=3.\n            Bob: we need a suffix with sum 30. \n                suffix of length 4: [11,1,9,14] -> sum=35.\n                suffix of length 3: [1,9,14] -> 24.\n                ... none.\n\n          How about:\n            Alice: [7,3] -> sum=10, length=2.\n            Bob: [14,9,1,11,8,10] -> not contiguous.\n\n          How about:\n            Alice: [7] -> sum=7.\n            Bob: [14,9,1,11,8,10] -> not contiguous.\n\n          How about:\n            Alice: [7,3,20,5] -> sum=35, length=4.\n            Bob: [14,9,1,11] -> sum=35, length=4 -> total=8.\n\n          Then the answer would be 8, not 7.\n\n          So the example explanation for the fourth test case is for a different interpretation.\n\n          Given the time, and that the problem is from a contest, and the intended solution is the two pointers, and the sample test cases 1,2,3 work, and the fourth test case might be intended to be solved with the two pointers (yield 8) but the problem says 7, we must output the code as described.\n\n          However, the problem statement for the fourth test cure says the answer is 7.\n\n          I found a known problem: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1845/problem/B\n          but it's not this.\n\n          Another: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1474/problem/B\n\n          We must output the code as described in the provided structure.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the elif block is:\n\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n      Let's test with the sample test cases:\n\n        Test case 1: [1,1] (n=2)\n          e=0, r=1, lowest=1, highest=1, g=1, h=1 -> enter elif: \n            candidate=2, index=0 -> index=2.\n            then e+1=1, r=1 -> 1<1 is false -> break.\n          output: 2 -> correct.\n\n        Test case 2: [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6)\n          e=0, r=5, lowest=1, highest=1 -> enter elif:\n            candidate=2, index=0 -> index=2.\n            then e+1=1<5 -> true, so e=1, lowest=2, g=2.\n          Then: lowest=2, highest=1 -> add to Bob: \n                r=4, highest=1+ (lst[4]=1) =2, h=2.\n          Then: lowest=2, highest=2 -> enter elif:\n                candidate=4, index=2 -> index=4.\n                e+1=2<4 -> true, so e=2, lowest=3, g=3.\n          Then: lowest=3, highest=2 -> add to Bob: r=3, highest=3, h=3.\n          Then: lowest=3, highest=3 -> enter elif:\n                candidate=6, index=4 -> index=6.\n                e+1=3<3 -> false -> break.\n          output: 6 -> correct.\n\n        Test case 3: [9,1] (n=2)\n          e=0, r=1, lowest=9, highest=1 -> \n            9>1 -> add to Bob: \n                r=0, highest=1+lst[0]? -> wait, in the elif block for highest<lowest, we do:\n                  highest += lst[r-1]   # r=1, so r-1=0 -> lst[0]=9 -> highest=1+9=10, then r-=1 -> r=0, h=2.\n                total=1+2=3, which is >2 -> the while condition: h+g<=m -> 3<=2 -> false, so we break the while loop.\n          Then we print index=0 -> correct.\n\n        Test case 4: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1,9,14] (n=10)\n          We trust the algorithm will yield 8? but the problem says 7.\n\n          However, the problem's example explanation might be in error.\n\n          Given the constraints, we output the code.\n\n      For program2.py:\n\n        The code is:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          while t > 0:\n            n = int(input())\n            if n >= 1900:\n              print(\"Division\",1)\n            elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n              print(\"Division\", 2)\n            elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n              print(\"Division\",4)\n            t -= 1\n\n        The TODO: for the condition 1400<=rating<1600, we should print \"Division 3\".\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n          print(\"Division\",3)\n\n      But note: the condition in the elif is: n >= 1400 and n < 1600, so we can simply do:\n\n          print(\"Division\", 3)\n\n      However, the problem says: \n          Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n\n      The condition in the elif: n >= 1400 and n < 1600 -> which is 1400<=n<1600, which is the same as the problem.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          print(\"Division\",3)\n\n      But note: the sample test cases: \n          rating=1400 -> should be division 3.\n          rating=1599 -> division 3.\n          rating=1600 -> division 2.\n\n      The condition for division 2: n>=1600 and n<1900 -> 1600<=n<1900.\n\n      So it's correct.\n\n      Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        program1: the missing code for the elif block:\n            candidate = g + h\n            if candidate > index:\n                index = candidate\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        program2: the missing code for the elif block:\n            print(\"Division\",3)\n\n      We output in JSON format:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"candidate = g + h\\n        if candidate > index:\\n            index = candidate\\n        if e+1 < r:\\n            e += 1\\n            lowest += lst[e]\\n            g += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\",\n          \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",3)\"\n        }\n\n      But note: the provided code in program1.py has a variable 'index' that we are updating. And we are using 'candidate' as a temporary.\n\n      Also, the indentation: the missing code is in the elif block, so it should be indented by 8 spaces (since the while loop is indented by 4, and the elif is indented by 4, then the code inside should be 8).\n\n      But the provided code in the TODO: \n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      is at the same indentation as the other conditions.\n\n      So we output the code with the same indentation.\n\n      However, the surrounding code in program1.py:\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n              if lowest < highest:\n                  ... (indented by 8)\n              elif highest<lowest:\n                  ... (indented by 8)\n              elif highest == lowest:\n                  ... (we are to fill here, indented by 8)\n\n      So our code should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\n      But in the JSON string, we can use newlines and the same indentation.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the exact code as in the provided structure.\n\n      We output the code as a string.\n\n      Let me format:\n\n        program1: \n          \"candidate = g + h\\n        if candidate > index:\\n            index = candidate\\n        if e+1 < r:\\n            e += 1\\n            lowest += lst[e]\\n            g += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\"\n\n        This uses 8 spaces for the first indent and 12 for the inner (which is what the provided code uses).\n\n      But the provided code in the if and elif blocks are indented by 8 and then 12 for the inner.\n\n      For example, in the if block:\n\n            e+=1\n            lowest += lst[e]\n            g +=1\n\n      So we are consistent.\n\n      For program2, the missing code is only one line.\n\n      Therefore, the final answer."
