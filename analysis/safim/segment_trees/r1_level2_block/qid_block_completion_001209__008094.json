    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. The total length of all strings is at most 200,000, so we can process each test case in O(n).\n\nThe problem requires:\n1. The minimum number of operations to make the string \"good\". A string is good if when divided into contiguous subsegments of equal bits, each segment has even length.\n\nNote: The operation is changing a bit to either '0' or '1'.\n\nObservation:\nWe note that the entire string must be partitioned into contiguous segments of even length. Moreover, within a segment, all bits are the same.\n\nWe can think of the string as being partitioned into blocks of consecutive same characters. However, we are allowed to change some bits arbitrarily.\n\nWe are also required to output the minimum number of subsegments (after the operations) among all solutions that use the minimum number of operations.\n\nApproach:\n\nLet's consider the string as a sequence of adjacent pairs (since the length is even, we can break it into n/2 pairs). However, note that the problem does not require the segments to be of length 2, but any even length.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the string is divided into contiguous subsegments of equal bits and each segment must have even length. This means that the entire string is partitioned into segments of even length (2,4,6,...) and each segment is composed of the same character.\n\nWe can also note that the entire string must have an even length (given) and the operations are to change some bits.\n\nHow to minimize the operations? We are allowed to change any bit arbitrarily.\n\nLet's consider the following:\n\nWe can break the string into adjacent pairs. In a good string, each pair must be either \"00\" or \"11\". Why? Because if we have a segment of even length, then if we break the segment into pairs, each pair must be the same. Moreover, adjacent segments must be of different characters.\n\nBut note: the entire string might be one segment? Then all pairs are the same and the entire string is either all 0 or all 1? Actually, no: we can have multiple segments. However, the condition is that each contiguous segment of same characters must be of even length.\n\nTherefore, the necessary condition is that every adjacent pair (i.e., two consecutive characters) must be the same? Not exactly: because we can have a segment of length 4: \"0000\", then the adjacent pairs inside are \"00\" and \"00\", which are both same. But if we have a segment boundary in the middle, then the adjacent pair that crosses the boundary would be different? Actually, the boundary is between two segments of different characters.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that adjacent segments are of different characters? Actually, by the definition of segmentation: contiguous subsegments of equal bits. So if two adjacent segments have the same bit, they would be merged. Therefore, the segments must alternate.\n\nSo the entire string is partitioned into alternating segments of even length.\n\nTherefore, the string must be of the form: (00)^a (11)^b (00)^c ... etc. (with alternating 0 and 1).\n\nNow, what about the operations? We can change any bit arbitrarily.\n\nWe can think of the string as being processed in pairs. For each pair of adjacent characters (at positions 2*i and 2*i+1), we have four possibilities: \"00\", \"11\", \"01\", \"10\".\n\nIf we have \"00\" or \"11\", then that pair is good and requires 0 operations.\n\nIf we have \"01\" or \"10\", then we must change one of the two to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". So we need 1 operation per such pair.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to change a bit arbitrarily, and we might change a bit that is shared by two pairs? Actually, each bit is in exactly one pair? We are breaking the string into non-overlapping pairs: [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], ... \n\nHowever, note: the segmentation we are going to form after the operations might have segments that are longer than 2. But the problem does not require that we break the string into pairs. It requires that the entire string is partitioned into contiguous segments of even length (which could be 2,4,6,...) and each segment is composed of the same character.\n\nBut here's a key insight: we can always break a segment of even length into pairs of consecutive characters. And in each such pair, the two characters must be the same. Therefore, the condition that every adjacent pair (in the sense of non-overlapping pairs of consecutive characters: positions 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, ...) must be \"00\" or \"11\" is necessary.\n\nHowever, is it sufficient? Consider: if we have \"0000\", then we break into two pairs: \"00\" and \"00\", which are both good. And we can form one segment of length 4. Similarly, if we have \"0011\", then we have two pairs: \"00\" and \"11\". But note, we cannot form one segment for the entire \"0011\" because the two pairs are different. We must break between the two pairs. So we have two segments: \"00\" and \"11\". So the condition is sufficient: the entire string is partitioned into pairs that are either \"00\" or \"11\", and then we can merge adjacent pairs that are the same and of the same character to form longer segments.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the string to be good is that for every i from 0 to n/2-1, the pair (s[2*i], s[2*i+1]) is either \"00\" or \"11\".\n\nThus, the minimum number of operations is the number of pairs that are not \"00\" nor \"11\", i.e., the pairs that are \"01\" or \"10\". So we can count:\n\n  res = 0\n  for i in range(0, n, 2):\n      if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n          res += 1\n\nBut wait: what if we can avoid changing one of the bits and instead change a bit that is shared by two pairs? Actually, note that each pair is independent: because the pairs are non-overlapping. Changing a bit in one pair does not affect the adjacent pair. Therefore, the above count is indeed the minimum number of operations.\n\nHowever, the problem also asks for the minimum number of subsegments that s can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.\n\nAfter the operations, we have a string that is composed of pairs of \"00\" and \"11\". Now, we want to form the minimum number of contiguous segments. How do we form segments? We can merge consecutive pairs that are of the same character. For example:\n\n  \"00\" then \"00\" -> we can merge into one segment of length 4.\n\nBut if we have \"00\" then \"11\", we cannot merge.\n\nSo the number of segments is 1 (for the entire string) if the entire string is the same? But note: we have alternating pairs? Actually, the entire string might be alternating: \"00110011\" -> we break into \"00\", \"11\", \"00\", \"11\". Then we have 4 segments? But we can merge adjacent same characters? Actually, the segments are defined as contiguous same characters. So after the operations, we have:\n\n  \"00\" and then \"11\": these are two segments.\n\nBut if we have \"0000\", that's two consecutive \"00\" pairs: we can merge them into one segment.\n\nTherefore, the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of same pairs? Actually, we can merge consecutive pairs that are the same character? But note: the pairs are adjacent and if two consecutive pairs are both \"00\", then we can merge them. Similarly, if we have a run of k consecutive \"00\" pairs, that becomes one segment of length 2k.\n\nBut what if we have a run of \"00\" then \"11\" then \"00\"? Then we have three segments.\n\nSo the number of segments is the number of blocks of consecutive same pairs? Actually, we break the string of pairs (each pair is either \"00\" or \"11\") and we break whenever the character changes.\n\nBut note: the entire string is broken into pairs. We can traverse the pairs and count the segments by the changes.\n\nHowever, we have a choice: when we change a pair that is originally \"01\" or \"10\", we can choose to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". This choice might affect the possibility of merging adjacent segments.\n\nTherefore, we have to choose the value for each corrected pair (the ones that we changed) to either 0 or 1, so that we minimize the total number of segments.\n\nHow does the segment count work?\n\nLet the entire string be broken into n/2 pairs. After operations, each pair is either \"00\" (which we denote as 0) or \"11\" (which we denote as 1). Then the entire string is a sequence of 0's and 1's (each representing a pair). Then the number of segments is the number of contiguous same digits? Actually, no: because a segment is a contiguous block of same characters. But note: a segment can be formed by multiple consecutive pairs of the same digit. So the entire sequence of pairs becomes a string of 0's and 1's (each 0 represents a pair of zeros, and 1 represents a pair of ones). Then the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of 0's and 1's? Actually, yes: because if we have two consecutive 0's (meaning two consecutive pairs of \"00\"), then they form one segment of zeros of length 4. Similarly, a run of k consecutive 0's forms one segment of zeros of length 2k.\n\nTherefore, the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups in the sequence of pairs. For example:\n\n  [0,0,1,1,0] -> groups: [0,0] (one group), [1,1] (second group), [0] (third group) -> 3 segments.\n\nBut note: the entire sequence: the first two pairs form a segment of zeros (length 4), then two pairs of ones (length 4), then one pair of zeros (length 2). So total segments = 3.\n\nHow to compute the number of segments? It is 1 (for the first element) plus the number of indices i (from 1 to n/2-1) such that the current pair is different from the previous pair.\n\nBut we have a choice for the pairs that we corrected? We can choose to set a corrected pair to either 0 or 1 arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the value for each corrected pair to minimize the total number of segments.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of segments, given that we have:\n\n  - Some pairs are already fixed: if the original pair was \"00\", then we must set it to 0.\n  - Similarly, if the original pair was \"11\", then we must set it to 1.\n  - For the pairs that were \"01\" or \"10\", we can choose either 0 or 1.\n\nWe have a sequence of pairs (each is either fixed or free) and we want to assign the free pairs to 0 or 1 to minimize the total number of segments.\n\nHow to compute the minimal segments?\n\nWe can use dynamic programming? But note: the total length of the string over test cases is only 200,000, but the number of pairs is 100,000 per test case? However, the total over test cases is 200,000 (for the entire string, so 100,000 pairs total over test cases). So we can do a linear scan.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200,000.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let arr = [] # the sequence of pairs, but we only record the type and the value if fixed.\n\nWe can break the sequence of pairs into contiguous groups of non-free pairs? Actually, we can traverse the entire sequence and use a state machine.\n\nAlternatively, we can note:\n\n  The total number of segments is 1 + (number of indices i from 1 to len(arr)-1 such that arr[i] != arr[i-1])\n\nBut we can choose the free pairs arbitrarily.\n\nWe want to minimize the total segments.\n\nWe can use a greedy approach: we can try to merge as many as possible.\n\nBut note: the fixed pairs break the sequence. We can consider the entire sequence as broken by the fixed pairs. The free pairs occur in contiguous segments? Actually, the free pairs can be in between fixed pairs.\n\nWe can break the sequence of pairs into contiguous blocks that are separated by fixed pairs? Actually, we can consider the entire sequence as:\n\n  [block of free pairs]? (at the beginning) then a fixed pair, then a block of free pairs, then a fixed pair, ... and then a block of free pairs at the end.\n\nBut note: the entire sequence might be free? Then we can set all to the same value and get only one segment.\n\nBut also, we might have:\n\n  fixed, then free, then fixed, then free, etc.\n\nHow to minimize the segments? The segments are determined by the transitions:\n\n  - Between two fixed pairs: if we have two consecutive fixed pairs that are the same, then they are in the same segment? But if there is a free block in between, we can set the entire free block to that same value and merge the two fixed pairs and the free block into one segment? \n\nActually, the entire block of free pairs between two fixed pairs can be set arbitrarily. We can set them to the same value as the left fixed pair? Then we merge the left fixed pair and the free block? But then the free block and the next fixed pair: if the next fixed pair is the same as the left, then we can merge the entire block (left fixed, free, and right fixed) into one segment? But if the next fixed pair is different, then we break at the right fixed pair.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the free block to alternate? But that would break the segment at every change? That would be bad.\n\nActually, we can set the entire free block to the same value. Why? Because we are free to choose each free pair independently. We don't have to set them to alternating values. We can set them all to 0 or all to 1.\n\nTherefore, for a contiguous block of free pairs between two fixed pairs (or at the beginning or end), we can set the entire block to a single value.\n\nBut note: if we set the entire block to a value, then:\n\n  - At the boundaries: \n      Case 1: at the beginning: a free block then a fixed pair. \n          We can set the entire free block to the same as the fixed pair? Then we merge the free block and the fixed pair into one segment? \n          But if the free block is at the very beginning, then we set it to the same as the next fixed pair, then the entire block (free and the fixed) becomes one segment.\n\n      Case 2: between two fixed pairs: \n          Let the left fixed pair is A, the right fixed pair is B.\n          We can set the free block to A? Then we have: ... A (fixed) then A (free block) then B (fixed). Then the transition from A (free) to B (fixed) breaks the segment. So the free block merges with the left fixed, but not with the right fixed if A != B.\n          Similarly, if we set the free block to B, then it merges with the right fixed, but not the left if A != B.\n          If we set the free block to A, then the segments: the left fixed and the free block form one segment (if we set to A) and then the right fixed is a separate segment (if A != B). So the boundary between the free block and the right fixed is a change? But note: the free block is set to A, and the next fixed is B (if A != B), then we have a break at the end of the free block and the fixed B.\n\n          However, what if we set the free block to a value that is neither A nor B? But we can only set to 0 or 1. And if A and B are different, then we cannot set the free block to both. So we have two choices: set to A or set to B.\n\n          How does the segment count change?\n\n          Without the free block, the segment count for the fixed pairs: \n            ... A, then B ... -> if A != B, then we have a break between A and B.\n\n          With the free block in between, if we set the free block to A:\n            Then we have: ... A (fixed) -> A (free block) -> B (fixed): \n                The A (fixed) and A (free) merge -> so we have one segment for the A's. Then the B (fixed) is a new segment. \n                But note: the break between the free block (A) and the fixed B is a break? So we have an extra break? Actually, the break between the last A in the free block and the first B of the fixed is a break. So the total breaks: \n                    ... (A fixed) and (A free) are merged -> no break in between. Then (A free) and (B fixed) -> break. Then (B fixed) ... \n                So the break count between the free block and the next fixed is the same as if we didn't have the free block? Actually, without the free block, we had a break between A and B. Now we still have a break between the free block (set to A) and B. So the break count is the same? \n\n          Similarly, if we set the free block to B, then we have:\n                A (fixed) -> then B (free) -> then B (fixed): \n                The free block (B) and the fixed B merge, so we have a break between A and the free block (which is B) and then no break between free and the next fixed. So again, the break between A and B is still there.\n\n          Therefore, the free block in between two fixed pairs that are different does not help to remove the break? It just adds a segment of the chosen value in between, but the break between the left fixed and the free block (if we set to B) is there, and the break between the free block and the right fixed (if we set to A) is there? Actually, no: if we set the free block to A, then the left fixed (A) and the free block (A) merge, so we don't have a break between them. Then we have a break between the free block (A) and the right fixed (B). Similarly, if we set to B, we have a break between the left fixed (A) and the free block (B), and then the free block (B) and the right fixed (B) merge. So in both cases, we have one break in the entire block (the break between the two fixed pairs is still there, and we have one break either at the beginning or the end of the free block). \n\n          However, note: without the free block, we had one break (because A and B are adjacent). With the free block, we still have one break? So the total number of breaks is the same? Then the segment count (which is breaks+1) would be the same? \n\n          But wait: the segment count is the number of contiguous groups. Without the free block: \n            ... A, B ... -> two segments? Actually, the entire sequence: ... A ... then B ... -> the A is one segment and the B is the next. So two segments? Then the break count is 1 (one break between A and B). Then the total segments = 1 (for the first segment) + 1 (for the break) = 2? Actually, the segment count is the number of groups: if we have two groups, then the count is 2.\n\n          With the free block: \n            Option 1: set to A: then we have [A (fixed) + free block (A)] as one segment, and then [B (fixed)] as the next segment -> two segments? \n            Option 2: set to B: then we have [A (fixed)] as one segment, and then [free block (B) + B (fixed)] as the next segment -> two segments.\n\n          So the segment count does not change? Then why would we care?\n\n          But what if the two fixed pairs are the same? \n            Without the free block: ... A, A ... -> no break, so one segment (if they are consecutive) but note: they are consecutive? Actually, without the free block, the two fixed pairs are adjacent? Then they are both A, so they are merged? Then we have one segment.\n\n          With the free block in between: \n            We can set the free block to A: then we have ... A (fixed) -> A (free) -> A (fixed): all merged -> one segment.\n            We can set the free block to B: then we have ... A (fixed) -> B (free) -> A (fixed): then we have breaks: \n                A to B: break, then B to A: break -> so three segments.\n\n          Therefore, if the two fixed pairs are the same, we can set the free block to that same value and merge everything, so we avoid two breaks? Then the segment count becomes 1 (if we set to A) or 3 (if we set to B). So we would choose to set to A to minimize the segments.\n\n          Therefore, the free block in between two same fixed pairs can be set to that same value to merge the entire block and avoid extra segments.\n\n          How many segments does it save? Without the free block, the two fixed pairs (if adjacent) would be merged (so one segment). With the free block, if we set to the same, we still have one segment. But if we set to the opposite, we get three segments. So we choose the same to avoid extra segments.\n\n          However, what if the free block is at the beginning? \n            Then we have: [free block] then [fixed pair] (say A). \n            We can set the free block to A: then the entire block (free and fixed) becomes one segment.\n            We can set to not A: then we have a break between the free block and the fixed, so two segments.\n\n          Similarly, at the end: [fixed pair] (say A) then [free block]: set to A -> one segment; set to not A -> two segments.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal segment count for the entire sequence is:\n\n            base: the segment count we would have if we ignore the free blocks? Actually, we can compute the entire segment count by:\n\n            Let F be the sequence of pairs (with free blocks set arbitrarily). Then the segment count is 1 + (number of indices i from 1 to n/2-1 such that F[i] != F[i-1]).\n\n            We can choose the free blocks arbitrarily to minimize this.\n\n          How to minimize? We can break the sequence by the fixed pairs. The fixed pairs break the sequence into segments that we cannot change. Then the free blocks are in between. We can set each contiguous free block arbitrarily (all to the same value) and independently.\n\n          The minimal segment count for the entire sequence is:\n\n            base_segments = 1\n            We traverse the entire sequence of pairs (from index 0 to n/2-1) and we know the fixed pairs. We can simulate:\n\n              segments = 1\n              last = None   # the last fixed or chosen value for the previous pair\n\n            But we don't know the free blocks until we assign.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            The entire sequence is broken by the fixed pairs. The free blocks are between fixed pairs (or at the ends). We can set each free block to:\n\n              - For a free block at the beginning: set to the value of the next fixed pair to avoid a break at the boundary? Then the entire block (free and the next fixed) becomes one segment. Then we start the segment count from that fixed.\n\n              - For a free block between two fixed pairs: \n                  if the two fixed pairs are the same, set the entire free block to that same value -> then we merge the entire block (left fixed, free, right fixed) into one segment? Actually, no: the entire block becomes one segment? But note: the left fixed and the free block (if set to the same) merge, and then the free block and the right fixed (same) merge. So the entire block (left fixed, free, right fixed) becomes one contiguous segment. Then we avoid two breaks: \n                      originally (without the free block) we had no break between the two fixed pairs? Actually, without the free block, the two fixed pairs are adjacent and same -> no break. With the free block set to the same, we still have no break? Then the segment count does not change? \n\n                  But wait: without the free block, the two fixed pairs are adjacent and same -> they are merged. With the free block set to the same, we have: ... fixed (A) -> free (A) -> fixed (A): all merged. So the entire block is one segment. So the segment count for the entire sequence does not change? \n\n                  However, if the two fixed pairs are different, then we cannot avoid a break. But we can choose the free block arbitrarily: it doesn't matter because we will have a break either at the beginning or the end? Actually, we can set the free block to the left fixed to avoid a break between the left fixed and the free block? Then we have a break between the free block and the right fixed. Or set to the right fixed to avoid a break at the end? Then we have a break at the beginning. So we still have one break. \n\n            Therefore, the free blocks do not help to reduce the number of breaks? Then why did we get an example with two segments? \n\n          Let me reexamine:\n\n            Without free blocks: \n                sequence: [A, A] -> one segment? \n                sequence: [A, B] -> two segments.\n\n            With a free block in the middle of two fixed A's: \n                [A, free, A] -> if we set free to A: then [A, A, A] -> one segment? \n                Without the free block, we had one segment. With the free block set to A, we still have one segment? \n\n            But note: the free block is an extra pair. So the entire string becomes longer? But the segment count is the same? \n\n          Actually, the segment count is the number of contiguous groups. The free block set to A merges with the two A's? Then we have one contiguous group of three pairs? So one segment.\n\n          Now, what if we have two fixed pairs that are the same and separated by a free block? Without the free block, if they were adjacent, we had one segment. With the free block, we still have one segment? So the segment count does not change? \n\n          Then why in the example above (with two fixed A's and a free block in between) we said we avoid two breaks? Actually, we avoid having two breaks? But we don't have any break? \n\n          The key is: the free block set to the same value as the fixed pairs does not introduce any break. So the entire block (left fixed, free, right fixed) is one segment. Therefore, the segment count for the entire sequence is the same as if we had no free blocks? \n\n          But wait: what if we have multiple free blocks? \n\n          Actually, the free blocks are set to the same value throughout? Then they form one contiguous segment? \n\n          Therefore, the minimal segment count is independent of the free blocks? \n\n          However, consider the example: \n            fixed: [A] at the beginning, then a free block of length 2 (two free pairs), then [B] at the end.\n\n          Without the free block: we have two segments: [A] and [B] -> 2 segments.\n\n          With the free block: \n            We can set the free block to A: then we have [A, A, A] (the first fixed and the two free) -> one segment, then [B] -> one segment. Total segments: 2.\n            Or set the free block to B: then [A] and then [B, B, B] -> 2 segments.\n            Or set the first free pair to A and the second to B: then [A, A] -> segment1, [B] (the second free) -> segment2, and then [B] (the fixed) -> segment3? Actually, the second free pair (B) and the fixed B are adjacent and same? Then they merge? So we have: [A, A] -> segment1, [B (from free) and B (fixed)] -> segment2. So 2 segments.\n\n          But wait: if we set the two free pairs to different values? \n            [A] (fixed) -> then [A] (first free) -> same as the fixed, so merge? Then we have a segment of A (with the fixed and the first free). Then the next free pair is set to B: then we break? Then the next fixed is B: then we break? Then we have: \n                segment1: [A, A] (fixed and first free) -> length 2? Actually, the fixed is one pair (so two characters) and the first free is one pair (two characters) -> so segment1: 4 characters? \n                then the next free pair: set to B -> one pair -> segment2: 2 characters? \n                then the fixed B: one pair -> segment3: 2 characters? \n            But wait: the free block: the two free pairs are adjacent? Then if we set the first to A and the second to B, then they are adjacent? Then we break between the two free pairs? So we have:\n                segment1: [A (fixed), A (first free)] -> one segment (because same and adjacent? but note: the fixed and the first free are adjacent? yes) -> so segment1: two pairs -> 4 characters.\n                segment2: [B (second free)] -> one segment: 2 characters.\n                segment3: [B (fixed)] -> one segment: 2 characters.\n            Total segments: 3.\n\n          Therefore, we must set the entire contiguous free block to the same value to avoid extra breaks within the free block.\n\n          So the minimal segment count for the entire sequence is:\n\n            base = 1\n            breaks = 0\n\n            We traverse the pairs from left to right. We know the fixed pairs and we can choose the free blocks arbitrarily (but we set each contiguous free block to a single value).\n\n            How to compute the minimal breaks? \n\n            We can break the sequence into contiguous blocks that are separated by fixed pairs? Then:\n\n              Let the entire sequence be: \n                  [free0], [fixed0], [free1], [fixed1], ... , [free_{k-1}], [fixed_{k-1}], [free_k]\n\n            Then the total segment count is:\n\n              = (number of segments from the free0) \n                + (for each i from 0 to k-1: the segment for fixed_i and the free_i+1? and the breaks between them) \n                + (the segment for free_k)\n\n            But note: we can set the free0 to the same as fixed0? Then they merge? So we don't have a break between free0 and fixed0.\n\n            Similarly, we can set free_k to the same as fixed_{k-1}? Then they merge.\n\n            For a free block between fixed_i and fixed_{i+1}: we can set it to fixed_i? Then we don't have a break between fixed_i and the free block, but we have a break between the free block and fixed_{i+1} if fixed_i != fixed_{i+1}. \n            Or set to fixed_{i+1}? Then we have a break between fixed_i and the free block (if they are different) and no break between the free block and fixed_{i+1}. \n            Or set to a value that is neither? Then we have two breaks? But we can set the entire free block to one value. \n\n            Actually, we can set the entire free block to a value that minimizes the breaks. The breaks introduced by the free block in the middle:\n\n              Option 1: set to fixed_i: \n                  break at the end (with fixed_{i+1}) if fixed_i != fixed_{i+1} -> one break.\n              Option 2: set to fixed_{i+1}: \n                  break at the beginning (with fixed_i) if fixed_i != fixed_{i+1} -> one break.\n              Option 3: set to a third value? Not possible.\n\n            But if fixed_i == fixed_{i+1}, then we can set the free block to that value and avoid both breaks? Then no break.\n\n            Therefore, the breaks introduced by a free block between fixed_i and fixed_{i+1} is:\n\n              if fixed_i == fixed_{i+1}: then we can avoid any break? So 0 breaks.\n              if fixed_i != fixed_{i+1}: then we must have one break? \n\n            However, note: without the free block, we would have one break between fixed_i and fixed_{i+1}. With the free block, we still have one break? So the break count does not change? \n\n            Therefore, the free blocks do not add extra breaks? \n\n            Then the total breaks in the entire sequence is:\n\n              breaks = 0\n              for i in range(1, len(fixed_pairs)):\n                  if fixed_pairs[i] != fixed_pairs[i-1]:\n                      breaks += 1\n\n            And then we add the breaks at the boundaries? \n\n            Actually, we have to consider the entire sequence including the free blocks? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note: the minimal segment count is:\n\n            segments = 1\n            for i in range(1, n/2):\n                if the pair i-1 and i are in different segments, then segments++\n\n            But we can choose the free blocks arbitrarily? \n\n          However, we can also note: the minimal segment count is the same as the segment count we would get if we set all free blocks to the same value as the next fixed pair? Or the previous? \n\n          Actually, we can simulate:\n\n            Let F be the entire sequence of pairs (with free blocks set arbitrarily). The segment count is 1 + (number of indices i from 1 to n/2-1 such that F[i] != F[i-1]).\n\n            We want to minimize that.\n\n            We can set the free blocks arbitrarily. The fixed pairs are fixed.\n\n            The minimal segment count is achieved by:\n\n              We set each free block to the same value throughout? And we set it to a value that minimizes the breaks with the adjacent fixed pairs.\n\n            Specifically, for a free block:\n\n              - At the beginning: we set it to the first fixed pair? Then we avoid a break at the boundary? Then the segment count for the entire sequence: \n                  The free block and the first fixed are merged -> so the first segment is the free block and the first fixed. Then the rest: we start from the first fixed? \n\n              - At the end: set to the last fixed.\n\n              - In the middle: set to the left fixed? Then we avoid a break with the left, but we get a break with the right if the left and right are different? \n\n            How does that affect the segment count? \n\n            Actually, the segment count is:\n\n              = 1 + (number of breaks)\n\n            And the breaks occur at every adjacent pair (i and i+1) that are different.\n\n            The breaks that occur within a free block? We avoid that by setting the entire free block to the same value.\n\n            The breaks that occur at the boundaries of a free block:\n\n              - Between the free block and the next fixed: if we set the free block to the next fixed, then no break? But then we have a break between the previous fixed and the free block? \n\n            Actually, we can choose the free block to minimize the breaks at the boundaries. For a free block between two fixed pairs (L and R):\n\n              Option 1: set the entire free block to L: \n                  break at the boundary between the free block and R? if L != R -> break.\n                  break at the boundary between L and the free block? no break (because same).\n              Option 2: set to R: \n                  break at the boundary between L and the free block? if L != R -> break.\n                  break at the boundary between the free block and R? no break.\n\n            So in both cases, we have one break? \n\n            But if L == R, then we can set to L (or R) and then we have no break at either boundary.\n\n            Therefore, the breaks introduced by a free block in the middle is:\n\n              1 if L != R, and 0 if L == R.\n\n            However, without the free block, if L and R are adjacent, then we have one break if L != R, and 0 if L == R.\n\n            So the free block does not change the break count? \n\n            Then the total break count is the same as if we ignored the free blocks? \n\n            But wait: what if the free block is long? We only care about the boundaries? \n\n            Therefore, the minimal break count is:\n\n              breaks = 0\n              # We consider the entire sequence of pairs, but we collapse each contiguous free block (with the adjacent fixed pairs) by the following:\n\n              Actually, we can simulate the entire sequence by:\n\n                segments = 1\n                # We traverse the pairs from left to right, and we keep the current segment's value.\n\n                We start: \n                  if the first pair is free, we can set it arbitrarily? But we don't know the next fixed? Actually, we can look ahead to the next fixed? \n\n            Alternatively, we can note: the minimal segment count is the same as the segment count of the fixed pairs (ignoring the free blocks) plus the free blocks that are at the boundaries? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let A = the list of fixed pairs (with their positions) and the free blocks as gaps.\n\n            The segment count for the fixed pairs alone (if we remove the free blocks) is:\n\n              fixed_segments = 1\n              for i in range(1, len(fixed_pairs)):\n                  if fixed_pairs[i] != fixed_pairs[i-1]:\n                      fixed_segments += 1\n\n            But then we add the free blocks: \n\n              For the beginning free block: if we set it to the first fixed pair, then it merges with the first fixed pair -> so the first fixed pair's segment is extended to the left? Then the segment count for the fixed pairs remains the same? \n\n              For the end free block: similarly.\n\n              For a free block in the middle: if it is between two fixed pairs that are the same, then we can merge the entire block (free and the two fixed) into one segment? Then the segment count for the fixed pairs might decrease? \n\n            Specifically, if we have two fixed pairs that are the same and separated by a free block, then in the fixed pairs alone (without the free block) they are not adjacent? So in the fixed pairs alone, they might be separated by other fixed pairs? \n\n            But note: the free block is between two fixed pairs that are consecutive in the sequence? \n\n            Therefore, the fixed pairs alone (if we remove the free blocks) are not necessarily consecutive? \n\n            How do we account for the free blocks? \n\n          After rethinking, a simpler approach:\n\n            We know that the entire sequence of pairs is a string of length m = n/2, composed of:\n\n              - Some positions are fixed (either '0' or '1')\n              - Some positions are free (which we can set to either '0' or '1')\n\n            We want to assign the free positions to minimize the number of segments, which is 1 + (number of i from 1 to m-1 such that s[i] != s[i-1]).\n\n            We can use a greedy dynamic programming that runs in O(m) but m can be up to 100,000 per test case? And the total m over test cases is 100,000 (because the total n is 200,000) -> so we can do O(m) per test case? \n\n            However, the total n over test cases is 200,000, so m is 100,000. And the total over test cases is 100,000 pairs? Then we can do a DP that is O(m) per test case? But the total m is 100,000, so we can do one pass.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the total m (number of pairs) is 100,000.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Let dp[i][0] = (min_segments, ...) up to the i-th pair, if we set the i-th pair to 0.\n              Let dp[i][1] = similarly for 1.\n\n            But we have to consider that some positions are fixed: if the i-th pair is fixed to 0, then we only have dp[i][0] and not dp[i][1].\n\n            The recurrence:\n\n              dp[i][0] = \n                  if i==0: 1\n                  else:\n                      cost0 = 1 if (0 != the value at i-1) then we add a segment break? Actually, the segment count is the number of breaks? \n\n                  Actually, the segment count up to i is not additive in the usual way? \n\n              Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  segments = 1\n                  for i in range(1, m):\n                      if s[i] != s[i-1]:\n                          segments += 1\n\n                  So we want to minimize segments.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Let dp[i][0] = the minimal total segments from 0 to i, if the i-th pair is set to 0.\n              Similarly, dp[i][1] = ... to 1.\n\n              Then:\n\n                  dp[0][0] = 1\n                  dp[0][1] = 1\n\n                  But if the first pair is fixed to 0, then dp[0][1] = INF.\n\n              For i>=1:\n\n                  dp[i][0] = min(\n                      dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==0 then no break else 1),   # if we set i to 0 and i-1 to 0 -> no break, so same segment count as dp[i-1][0]\n                      dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==0? no, so 1)  # then we add a break\n                  ) \n\n                  But wait: the segment count is the number of segments, so if we have a break, we add one segment? Actually, the total segments = 1 + (number of breaks). But breaks occur between i-1 and i.\n\n                  Actually, the recurrence:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = \n                          min( \n                              dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==0 else 1), \n                              dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==0 else 1)\n                          )\n\n                  But note: the value dp[i][0] is the total segments up to i? \n\n                  However, the segments are not additive in the sense that the break between i-1 and i only adds one segment? Actually, the total segments is 1 (for the first) plus the number of breaks (which is the number of i from 1 to i such that the current is different from the previous). \n\n                  So we can also compute:\n\n                      breaks = 0\n                      for i in range(1, m):\n                          if s[i] != s[i-1]:\n                              breaks += 1\n                      segments = breaks + 1\n\n                  Therefore, we can compute the breaks with a state machine.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                      dp[i][0] = min( \n                          dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==0 else 1),   # if we set i to 0, then if the previous is 0, then no break, so the total breaks = dp[i-1][0] (which is the total breaks up to i-1) \n                          dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==0 else 1)\n                      )\n\n                  But wait, dp[i][0] should represent the total segments up to i? Or the total breaks up to i? \n\n                  Actually, we want the total segments up to i? But the segments up to i is 1 + (number of breaks up to i). \n\n                  Alternatively, we can let dp[i][0] = the total number of breaks from 0 to i (i.e., breaks between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, ... , i-1 and i) if we set the i-th pair to 0.\n\n                  Then at the end, the total segments = 1 + (dp[i][0] or dp[i][1]).\n\n                  Then:\n\n                      dp[0][0] = 0   # no break at the first pair\n                      dp[0][1] = 0\n\n                  For i>=1:\n\n                      if the i-th pair is free:\n                          option0 = min( \n                              dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==0 else 1),   # if we set i to 0, and i-1 is 0: then no break -> add 0\n                              dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==0 else 1)   # if i-1 is 1: then break -> add 1\n                          )\n                          option1 = min(\n                              dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==1 else 1),   # break if 0!=1 -> add 1\n                              dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==1 else 1)   # no break -> add 0\n                          )\n                          dp[i][0] = option0\n                          dp[i][1] = option1\n\n                      if the i-th pair is fixed to 0, then:\n                          option0 = min( \n                              dp[i-1][0] + (0 if 0==0 else 1), \n                              dp[i-1][1] + (0 if 1==0 else 1)\n                          )\n                          dp[i][0] = option0\n                          dp[i][1] = INF   # not allowed\n\n                  Then after processing, the total segments = 1 + min(dp[m-1][0], dp[m-1][1])\n\n            But note: the total m can be up to 100,000 per test case, and the total m over test cases is 100,000, so we can do one DP per test case? But the total test cases t can be up to 10,000? \n\n            However, the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the total m is 100,000. And the total test cases t is at most 10,000, but the sum of n is 200,000, so the number of test cases t is at most 100,000/ (minimum n per test case) -> but the minimum n is 2, so the maximum t is 100,000? Actually, the problem says: the first line is t, and then for each test case, n and then a string of length n. And the sum of n over test cases <= 200,000.\n\n            Therefore, the total number of pairs is 100,000. So we can do a DP that runs in O(100,000) in total.\n\n            But note: the total over test cases is 100,000 pairs, so we can do a DP that runs in O(m) per test case, and the sum of m is 100,000.\n\n            However, the number of test cases might be up to 100,000? But the sum of n is 200,000, so the maximum number of test cases is 100,000 (if each n=2). But 100,000 test cases, each with m=1, then we do a DP of length 1 for each -> total operations 100,000, which is acceptable.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total n over test cases doesn\u2019t exceed 200,000, so the total pairs is 100,000. We can do a single DP that in total over test cases does 100,000 states.\n\n            However, we have to be careful: the DP for one test case might have m up to 100,000? But the total over test cases is 100,000, so the largest test case might have m=100,000 and only one test case? Then we do one DP with 100,000 states -> 200,000 operations (two states per pair) -> 200,000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n              t = number of test cases\n              index = 0\n              for _ in range(t):\n                  n = int(inp[index]); index+=1\n                  s = inp[index].strip(); index+=1\n                  m = n//2\n                  # We break s into pairs? Actually, we don't need to break, we can process by two.\n\n                  # But for the DP, we need to know for each pair i (0-indexed) whether it is:\n                  #   fixed0: if the pair is \"00\"\n                  #   fixed1: if the pair is \"11\"\n                  #   free: if the pair is \"01\" or \"10\"\n\n                  # Actually, we can precompute for each pair i:\n                  #   if s[2*i] == s[2*i+1]:\n                  #       if s[2*i]=='0': then fixed0\n                  #       else: fixed1\n                  #   else: free\n\n                  # Then we do a DP:\n\n                  # dp0 = breaks up to current if we set the current to 0\n                  # dp1 = breaks up to current if we set the current to 1\n\n                  # We traverse i from 0 to m-1.\n\n                  dp0 = 0\n                  dp1 = 0\n                  # But at i=0:\n                  #   if fixed0: then we can only use 0, and breaks=0 -> segments=1, but breaks=0? \n                  #   if fixed1: then only 1.\n                  #   if free: then we can choose 0 or 1.\n\n                  # However, at i=0, there is no break, so the breaks=0.\n\n                  # But the total segments = 1 + breaks_total, and breaks_total is the total breaks we compute.\n\n                  # We'll compute the total breaks from the DP.\n\n                  # Let:\n                  #   for i=0:\n                  #       if fixed0: \n                  #           dp0 = 0\n                  #           dp1 = a big number\n                  #       if fixed1:\n                  #           dp0 = big\n                  #           dp1 = 0\n                  #       if free:\n                  #           dp0 = 0\n                  #           dp1 = 0\n\n                  # Then for i>=1:\n\n                  #   if the current pair is fixed0:\n                  #       new_dp0 = min( dp0_prev, dp1_prev+1 )   # if previous was 0, then no break; if previous was 1, then break (so add 1)\n                  #       new_dp1 = big   # not allowed\n                  #   similarly for fixed1.\n                  #   for free:\n                  #       new_dp0 = min( dp0_prev, dp1_prev+1 )\n                  #       new_dp1 = min( dp0_prev+1, dp1_prev )\n\n                  # Then after processing, total_breaks = min(dp0, dp1)\n                  # total_segments = 1 + total_breaks\n\n                  # But wait: the breaks we are counting is the number of breaks between consecutive pairs? Yes.\n\n                  # However, the problem also requires the minimum number of operations: which is the number of free pairs? Because each free pair requires one operation.\n\n                  # We already know: \n                  #   operations = number of free pairs? \n                  #   But note: a free pair is one that is not \"00\" nor \"11\", so we count them.\n\n                  # But wait: the free pairs are the ones that are \"01\" or \"10\", and we change one bit to make them either \"00\" or \"11\", so one operation per free pair.\n\n                  # So we can precompute:\n                  #   op = 0\n                  #   for i in range(0, n, 2):\n                  #       if s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                  #           op += 1\n\n                  # Then we also compute the minimal segments = 1 + min(dp0, dp1)   [where dp0 and dp1 are the total breaks for the entire sequence]\n\n                  # But note: the breaks are only between consecutive pairs?

But we are taking the minimum.\n\n                  #   So the DP is minimizing the segments.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n              op = 0\n              arr = []   # for each pair: \n                         #   if the pair is \"00\" -> 0 (fixed)\n                         #   if the pair is \"11\" -> 1 (fixed)\n                         #   if the pair is \"01\" or \"10\" -> -1 (free)\n\n              for i in range(0, n, 2):\n                  if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                      if s[i]=='0':\n                          arr.append(0)\n                      else:\n                          arr.append(1)\n                  else:\n                      arr.append(-1)\n                      op += 1\n\n              m = len(arr)\n              # if m==0, then n=0, but n>=2.\n\n              # dp0: breaks up to current for setting current to 0\n              # dp1: breaks up to current for setting current to 1\n\n              # Initialize:\n              if arr[0] == -1:\n                  dp0 = 0\n                  dp1 = 0\n              elif arr[0] == 0:\n                  dp0 = 0\n                  dp1 = 10**9   # a big number\n              else: # arr[0]==1\n                  dp0 = 10**9\n                  dp1 = 0\n\n              for i in range(1, m):\n                  if arr[i] == 0:\n                      # only 0 is allowed\n                      new_dp0 = min(dp0, dp1+1)   # if previous is 0, then no break; if previous is 1, then break (so add 1)\n                      new_dp1 = 10**9\n                  elif arr[i] == 1:\n                      new_dp0 = 10**9\n                      new_dp1 = min(dp0+1, dp1)\n                  else: # free\n                      new_dp0 = min(dp0, dp1+1)\n                      new_dp1 = min(dp0+1, dp1)\n                  dp0, dp1 = new_dp0, new_dp1\n\n              total_breaks = min(dp0, dp1)\n              segments = total_breaks + 1   # because segments = 1 + breaks\n\n              print(op, segments)\n\n          But wait: the sample test cases:\n\n            Example 1: \"B\" -> n=1? but n must be even. The problem says n>=2 and even.\n\n            Example 2: \"AB\" -> \n                n=2, s=\"AB\"\n                arr: \n                  i=0: s[0]='A', s[1]='B' -> free -> arr = [-1], op=1.\n                m=1: \n                  dp0=0, dp1=0 -> then total_breaks = min(0,0)=0, segments=1.\n                So output: 1 1.\n\n            But the sample: \n                Input: \n                  5\n                  1 0 1 0\n                  B\n                  1 0 0 0\n                  AB\n                  ... \n                The first test case: \"B\" -> n=1? but the problem says the first test case: a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0, and s=\"B\". But the length of s is 1, but a+b+2c+2d = 1+0+2+0=3 -> not equal? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: |s| = a+b+2c+2d.\n\n            In the sample: \n                \"In the first test case, the sentence s is \"B\". Clearly, it can't consist of a single word A, so the answer is NO.\"\n\n            But our program1.py is for the first problem? \n\n            We are given two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n            We are to complete both.\n\n            But the current code we are writing is for program2.py.\n\n            The sample for program2.py:\n\n              Input: \n                The first contains a single positive integer t (1<=t<=10000). For each test case, the first line contains n, and the second line contains s.\n\n              The sample note: \n                In the first test case (for program2.py): \n                  s = \"BAABBABBAA\" -> but the example in the problem has multiple test cases? \n\n            The sample provided in the problem for program2.py:\n\n              \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following. Change s_3, s_6 and s_7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", ... the minimum number of subsegments is 2.\"\n\n              So the first test case: \n                  n=10, s=\"1100000000\" -> but the original s is \"BAABBABBAA\", which is 10 characters.\n\n              How many operations? \n                  We count the free pairs in the original s: \n                    Break into pairs: \n                      \"BA\", \"AB\", \"BA\", \"BB\", \"AA\" -> but wait, 10 characters -> 5 pairs.\n\n                  Pairs:\n                    \"BA\": not \"00\" nor \"11\" -> free -> op_count +=1\n                    \"AB\": free -> op_count +=1\n                    \"BA\": free -> op_count +=1\n                    \"BB\": \"11\" -> fixed1 -> no op\n                    \"AA\": \"00\" -> fixed0? but wait, \"AA\" is \"11\" for the letter A? Actually, the pair is two A's -> \"AA\" -> that's two A's, so we consider it as \"11\" for the purpose of the pair? \n\n                  Actually, we are only caring about the bit: \n                    We don't care if it's A or B? The string s is of '0' and '1'? \n\n              But the problem says: the string s consists of 'A' and 'B'. However, in the program2.py, the input is a binary string of zeros and ones? \n\n              The problem says: \"The second line contains a binary string s of length n, consisting only of zeros and ones.\"\n\n              So in the example, the string is given as \"1100000000\" for the modified version? But the original s is \"BAABBABBAA\" -> that's not zeros and ones? \n\n              Actually, the problem says: \"Alina has discovered a weird language, which contains only 4 words: A, B, AB, BA.\" for program1.py. \n\n              For program2.py: \"Tokitsukaze has a binary string s of length n, consisting only of zeros and ones\"\n\n              So in program2.py, the string is of zeros and ones.\n\n              The example: \n                  Input: \n                    t=?\n                  The sample: \n                    \"In the first test case\" -> they say: change s_3, s_6, s_7 to '0', so the original s must have been: \n                      positions: 1-indexed? \n                      s_3: the third character -> so if the string is \"1100000000\", then changing the third, sixth, seventh to '0'? \n\n                  The original string: \n                      They say: \"BAABBABBAA\" -> but that's with letters. \n\n              Actually, the problem says: \"the sentence s is \"BAABBABBAA\"\", but then they change it to \"1100000000\". \n\n              How? They mapped A to '1' and B to '0'? Or vice versa? \n\n              But note: the problem says: \"Change s_3, s_6 and s_7 to '0'\", and the result is \"1100000000\". \n\n              Original: \n                  B A A B B A B B A A\n                  positions: \n                    1: B\n                    2: A -> becomes 1? \n                    3: A -> becomes 0? \n                    4: B\n                    5: B\n                    6: A -> becomes 0\n                    7: B -> becomes 0\n                    8: B\n                    9: A\n                    10: A\n\n              If we map A to '1' and B to '0', then the original string is \"0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1\" -> \"0110010011\"\n\n              Then change positions 3,6,7 to '0': \n                  position3: the third character (0-indexed index2) -> change the third character (which is the second '1') to '0': becomes 0.\n                  position6: index5: change the sixth character (index5) which is '1' to '0'\n                  position7: index6: change the seventh character (index6) which is '0' to '0'? -> no change? \n\n              So we get: \"0100000011\" -> not \"1100000000\".\n\n              Alternatively, if we map A to '0' and B to '1', then the original string is \"1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\" -> \"1001101100\"\n\n              Change positions 3,6,7 to '0': \n                  position3: index2: change the third character (which is '0') to '0' -> no change.\n                  position6: index5: change the sixth character (which is '0') to '0' -> no change.\n                  position7: index6: change the seventh character (which is '1') to '0' -> becomes 0.\n\n              Then we get: \"1001001000\" -> not \"1100000000\".\n\n              How do they get \"1100000000\"?\n\n              They changed s_3, s_6, s_7: \n                  s_3: the third character -> if the string is 1-indexed: \n                      s1='B', s2='A', s3='A', s4='B', s5='B', s6='A', s7='B', s8='B', s9='A', s10='A'\n                  Change s3 to '0'? -> becomes '0'\n                  Change s6 to '0'\n                  Change s7 to '0'\n\n              Then: \n                  s1='B', s2='A', s3='0', s4='B', s5='B', s6='0', s7='0', s8='B', s9='A', s10='A'\n\n              But that's not \"1100000000\".\n\n              Actually, they say: \"after that s becomes \"1100000000\"\", meaning they changed more? \n\n              Or note: they changed to '0', but they also might have changed the representation: they mapped the entire string to binary? \n\n              The problem says: \"change the value of s_i to '0' or '1'\", so the string becomes a binary string.\n\n              And the example input: the string s is given as a binary string? \n\n              But the sample input for program2.py: \n                  The first test case: \n                    n=10\n                    s=\"BAABBABBAA\"   -> but the problem says the string is binary? \n\n              This is confusing.\n\n              However, the problem statement for program2.py says: \"The second line contains a binary string s of length n, consisting only of zeros and ones.\"\n\n              So the input string is in zeros and ones.\n\n              Therefore, the example \"BAABBABBAA\" is not the input for program2.py. The input for program2.py is a binary string.\n\n              The sample input for the first test case of program2.py is not provided in the note? \n\n              But the note says: \n                  \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following.

This DP runs in O(m) per test case, and the total m is 100,000, so it's acceptable.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the total pairs is 100,000. And the total test cases t can be up to 10,000? But the sum of n is 200,000, so the maximum t is 100,000 (if each n=2) and then the total pairs is 100,000, so the DP will run 100,000 states in total? \n\n          Actually, the total pairs over test cases is 100,000, so we can do:\n\n            total_pairs = 0\n            for each test case:\n                n = ... \n                m = n//2\n                total_pairs += m   # which is 100,000\n\n            Then the inner loop runs m times per test case, and the total inner loop iterations is 100,000.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            t = int(inp[0])\n            index = 1\n            out_lines = []\n            for i in range(t):\n                n = int(inp[index]); index+=1\n                s = inp[index].strip(); index+=1\n                # process the string s of length n\n                op = 0\n                arr = []\n                for j in range(0, n, 2):\n                    if s[j] == s[j+1]:\n                        if s[j]=='0':\n                            arr.append(0)\n                        else:\n                            arr.append(1)\n                    else:\n                        arr.append(-1)\n                        op += 1\n\n                m = len(arr)\n                if m==0:\n                    # n==0, but n>=2, so skip?\n                    out_lines.append( (op, 0) ) # but segments should be 0? but then 1+0=1? but no pairs -> 0 segments? \n                    # Actually, if n==0, then no segments? \n                    # But the problem: n>=2, so we can ignore.\n                    # Let's assume n>=2, so m>=1.\n                    continue\n\n                # dp for the first element\n                if arr[0] == -1:\n                    dp0 = 0\n                    dp1 = 0\n                elif arr[0] == 0:\n                    dp0 = 0\n                    dp1 = 10**9\n                else: # 1\n                    dp0 = 10**9\n                    dp1 = 0\n\n                for j in range(1, m):\n                    if arr[j] == 0:\n                        new_dp0 = min(dp0, dp1+1)\n                        new_dp1 = 10**9\n                    elif arr[j] == 1:\n                        new_dp0 = 10**9\n                        new_dp1 = min(dp0+1, dp1)\n                    else: # free\n                        new_dp0 = min(dp0, dp1+1)\n                        new_dp1 = min(dp0+1, dp1)\n                    dp0, dp1 = new_dp0, new_dp1\n\n                total_breaks = min(dp0, dp1)\n                segments = total_breaks + 1\n                out_lines.append( (op, segments) )\n\n            for (op, seg) in out_lines:\n                print(op, seg)\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases doesn\u2019t exceed 200,000, so we don't need to worry about too many test cases.\n\n          However, the problem says: the sum of the lengths of s over all test cases doesn\u2019t exceed 200,000. So we are safe.\n\n          But wait: the sample test case in the problem: \n              \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n          For a good string initially: \n              op = 0\n              and we do the DP: \n                  arr: for each pair, if it's \"00\" ->0, \"11\"->1, and no free.\n              Then the segments = 1 + (min_breaks) and the min_breaks is computed by the DP.\n\n          Example: \"0000\": \n              pairs: [0,0] -> \n                  arr = [0,0]\n                  m=2.\n                  i0: fixed0 -> dp0=0, dp1=big.\n                  i1: fixed0 -> \n                      new_dp0 = min(0, big+1)=0\n                  total_breaks=0, segments=1.\n\n          Example: \"0011\": \n              arr = [0,1]\n              i0: dp0=0, dp1=big.\n              i1: fixed1 -> new_dp1 = min(0+1, big)=1\n              segments = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          But the actual segments: \n              \"00\" and \"11\" -> 2 segments.

It might be sufficient? \n\n          Then, the code breaks the string into runs of consecutive same characters.\n\n            Example: s = \"AABBA\" -> \n                runs: \n                  'AA' -> length=2, char='A'\n                  'BB' -> length=2, char='B'\n                  'A' -> length=1, char='A'\n\n            The code:\n\n              ult = 'X'\n              k = 0\n              z = []\n              for x in s:\n                  if x == ult:\n                      k += 1\n                  else:\n                      if ult != 'X':   # but initially ult='X', so we skip the first time?\n                          z.append((k, ult))\n                      ult = x\n                      k = 1\n              z.append((k, ult))\n\n            Actually, the first character: \n                ult = 'X', then we see x (the first char) -> else branch: set ult=x, k=1.\n            Then next: if same as ult, then k++.\n            At the end, we append the last run.\n\n            So for \"AABBA\": \n                runs: (2, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (1, 'A')\n\n            Then the code:\n\n                r = 0\n                z.sort()   # sorts by the run length? \n                for k,v in z:\n                    if k % 2 == 0:\n                        if v == 'A' and d >= k//2:\n                            d -= k//2\n                        elif v == 'B' and c >= k//2:\n                            c -= k//2\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: what to do?\n                    else:\n                        r += k//2   # integer division: for k=1 -> 0, k=3 -> 1, etc.\n\n            Then after, it checks if r >= c+d -> YES, else NO.\n\n          What is the idea?\n\n          We need to assign the runs to the words.\n\n          The words: \n            \"A\": must be a run of one 'A'? \n            \"B\": one 'B'\n            \"AB\": a run of one 'A' and then one 'B'? But the run is of consecutive same characters. \n            \"BA\": similarly.\n\n          However, the entire string is the concatenation of the words. The runs are the maximal contiguous same characters. \n\n          The words \"AB\" and \"BA\" will appear as a change from A to B or B to A. \n\n          The runs of even length: \n            We can use them to cover some of the two-letter words? \n\n          Insight:\n\n            We can use a run of even length of 'A' to cover multiple \"BA\" words? \n\n            How? \n\n            Consider a run of k consecutive 'A' (k even). We can split this run into (k/2) words of \"BA\"? \n\n            But note: the word \"BA\" has a 'B' at the beginning. How can we have a run of 'A' without a 'B'? \n\n            Actually, the run of 'A' is surrounded by non-A? \n\n            The run of k 'A's: \n              If it is at the beginning, then the next run is 'B'. Then we can use the first 'A' as the end of a \"BA\" word? \n\n            Actually, the words are concatenated arbitrarily. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the runs to cover the two-letter words that are entirely within the run? \n\n          But the two-letter words \"AB\" and \"BA\" are not contiguous same characters. \n\n          How do they appear in the run? They don't. \n\n          Therefore, the runs are the maximal contiguous same characters, so the two-letter words must be split between runs.\n\n          The two-letter words \"AB\" and \"BA\" will appear at the boundaries between runs? \n\n          Actually, the entire string is partitioned into runs. The boundaries between runs are the places where the two-letter words can be formed? \n\n          But note: the word \"AB\" is a word by itself. It will appear as a run of one 'A' and then a run of one 'B'. But then the run of 'A' is of length 1 and the run of 'B' is of length 1.\n\n          The words \"A\" and \"B\" are single runs of length 1.\n\n          The words \"BA\" is a run of one 'B' and then one 'A'.\n\n          Therefore, the runs of length 1 are the ones that can be used as the single-letter words, or as part of a two-letter word? \n\n          However, a run of length 1 of 'A' can be used as:\n            - a word \"A\", or \n            - the first part of a word \"AB\" (if the next run is a 'B' of length 1) or \n            - the second part of a word \"BA\" (if the previous run is a 'B' of length 1).\n\n          Similarly for a run of length 1 of 'B'.\n\n          The runs of length>=2: \n            We can break a run of even length of 'A' (say length k) into k/2 words of \"BA\"? \n              How? \n                The word \"BA\" has a 'B' and an 'A'. If we have a run of 'A's, we cannot put a 'B' in the middle? \n\n          Actually, we can use the run of even length to cover multiple two-letter words that are of the type that use the opposite letter at the boundary? \n\n          This is complex.\n\n          Known solution for the problem (from known problems: this is problem C from a Codeforces round) uses:\n\n            Step 1: Check total A and B.\n            Step 2: Break the string into runs.\n            Step 3: \n                Let free = 0   # free two-letter words that we can get from the runs of length>=2?\n                Let must = 0   # the two-letter words that we can get from the runs of length 1?\n\n            For a run of length k:\n                if the run is of even length:\n                    if it is an 'A' run: then we can use it to cover d (for \"BA\")? \n                    if it is a 'B' run: then we can use it to cover c (for \"AB\")?\n                else: \n                    then we can get k//2 two-letter words from the run? \n\n          But the code in the TODO is:\n\n            if k % 2 == 0:\n                if v == 'A' and d >= k//2:\n                    d -= k//2\n                elif v == 'B' and c >= k//2:\n                    c -= k//2\n                else:\n                    # TODO: what to do?\n\n            else:\n                r += k//2   # k//2 is floor division: for k=1 -> 0, k=3 -> 1, k=5->2, etc.\n\n          Then after, it uses r to cover the remaining c and d.\n\n          What is r? \n            It is the sum of k//2 for all runs of odd length.\n\n          And for even runs, we try to cover as many d (if 'A') or c (if 'B') as possible.\n\n          Why? \n\n          Explanation:\n\n            In a run of even length of 'A's: \n                We can use the entire run to cover (k//2) words of \"BA\". How?\n                  Consider: a run of 4 'A's: \"AAAA\". \n                  How to cover with \"BA\" words? \n                      We can use two \"BA\" words: \n                          BA + BA = \"BABA\" -> but that's not a run of A's, it has B's in between.\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to break the run? \n\n            Actually, the run is contiguous same characters. We cannot break it arbitrarily? \n\n          Alternative insight from known solutions:\n\n            We can use the following:\n\n              Let ab = c   # the number of \"AB\" we need\n              Let ba = d   # the number of \"BA\" we need\n\n              We consider the runs of length>1. For a run of consecutive same character of length L:\n\n                If L is even, then we can extract (L/2 - 1) extra two-letter words? \n\n            But I recall a known solution:\n\n"
