But the provided code only updates the left pointer when we find an equality? Then it does an extra condition? That might be wrong. Let me simulate the provided code for the same test case:\n\n        n=6, a=[2,2,3,2,2,3] -> prefix: [2,4,7,9,11,14], suffix: [14,12,10,7,5,3] (but note: the suffix array in the code is computed by doing: \n            b = a[:] \n            for i in range(n-1,0,-1): b[i-1] += b[i] So: \n                b[5]=3\n                b[4]=2+3=5\n                b[3]=2+5=7\n                b[2]=3+7=10\n                b[1]=2+10=12\n                b[0]=2+12=14\n\n        Then:\n            l=0, r=5: \n                a[0]=2, b[5]=3 -> not equal -> then check: 2<3 -> so l=1. l=1, r=5: \n                a[1]=4, b[5]=3 -> 4>3 -> so we go to else: we need to do r-=1? -> r=4. l=1, r=4:\n                a[1]=4, b[4]=5 -> 4<5 -> l=2. l=2, r=4:\n                a[2]=7, b[4]=5 -> 7>5 -> else: r=3. l=2, r=3:\n                a[2]=7, b[3]=7 -> equal: sol = 2 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 2+3+1=6? -> 6. Then l=3. Then we break because r-l=0? (3 and 3) -> but condition r-l>=1? 3-3=0 -> fails. So we return 6. But note: the expression: sol = l + n - r + 1 -> when l=2, r=3: 2 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 6. Correct. However, the code then does l+=1 -> l=3. Then we check the next condition: \n            if a[l] < b[r]: -> a[3]=9, b[3]=7 -> 9>7 -> so we go to else: we do r-=1? But the else block is missing. So we must complete the else block: we do r -= 1. Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is: \n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the code structure:\n\n            if a[l] == b[r]:\n                sol = ... \n                l += 1\n            if a[l] < b[r]:   # note: this is an independent if, not elif\n                l += 1\n            else: r -= 1\n\n        However, after the first if, we have updated l. Then we check the next condition with the updated l. That might be okay? But what if the updated l is beyond the current r? Actually, the while condition is r-l>=1, so after updating l, we have l and r such that r-l>=1? Then we check the condition? But what if we update l in the first if and then the next condition is true? Then we update l again? Then we might skip a solution? Example: \n            We have a solution at (l, r) -> we update l to l+1 and then we check: if a[l+1] < b[r] then we update l to l+2. Then we skip the possibility of having a solution at (l+1, r-1) because we moved l twice and then we move r?",

But note: if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter? -> yes, because 2*half_perimeter = 2 * (half_perimeter) and a divides half_perimeter, so 2*a divides 2*half_perimeter. Therefore, we can also consider a2 = 2*a. But wait: what if a is even? then 2*a might be already considered when we process i = a/2? Example: half_perimeter=6, a=2 -> then a2=4. But 4 is not a divisor of 6, so it wouldn't be in the loop for half_perimeter? So we must also consider the divisors of 2*half_perimeter that are not divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n            How to get them? We can do outside the loop? but we are not allowed to change the code arbitrarily. Given the constraints, and that the provided code might be incomplete, we must complete the TODO part to at least check the three conditions for the current a, and also for a2 = 2*a (if it is within bounds) and also for a3 = a (which we are doing) and also for the divisor 2 (which is already in the set) and 1 (already in the set). But the TODO part only has the current a.\n\n            Therefore, in the TODO part, we can:\n\n                Check if a satisfies one of the three conditions. If yes, add a.\n                Also, let a2 = 2 * a, and if a2 <= 2*half_perimeter and 2*half_perimeter % a2 == 0, then check if a2 satisfies one of the three conditions, and if yes, add a2.

But the example: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, 2*half_perimeter=12. The divisor 3: \n                a=3: \n                    type1: w%3=0, l-2=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid, so add 3. a2=6: \n                    2*half_perimeter=12, and 12%6==0 -> valid divisor. type1: w%6=3, l-2=3 -> 3%6=3 -> not 0 -> fail. type2: w-2=1 -> 1%6=1, l=5 -> 5%6=5 -> fail. type3: w-1=2 -> 2%6=2, l-1=4 -> 4%6=4 -> fail. so 6 is not valid.

For a=2: \n                    mod_a = w % 2 = 3%2=1, which is <=2 -> then we do the TODO.

The known solution in the sample code for this problem (from CodeForces) is:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                        solutions.add(a) But that is not the same as our three types. Alternatively, we can check the three types:\n\n                if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n            But note: a might be 1, which is already in the set. However, the provided code starts with {1,2}. Why 2? \n\n            Example: w=3, l=5: \n                a=2: \n                    type1: w%2=1, (l-2)=3 -> 3%2=1 -> not (0 and 0) -> fails.\n                    type2: (w-2)=1 -> 1%2=1, l%2=1 -> fails.\n                    type3: (w-1)=2 -> 2%2=0, (l-1)=4 -> 4%2=0 -> valid. So a=2 is valid. But the code already has 2 in the set. Why 1 and 2 are always valid? a=1: always valid because 1 divides everything. a=2: not always valid? Example: w=3, l=3 -> \n                        type1: w%2=1, l-2=1 -> 1%2=1 -> fails.\n                        type2: w-2=1 -> 1%2=1, l%2=1 -> fails.\n                        type3: w-1=2 -> 2%2=0, l-1=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid. But what if w=4, l=4? type1: 4%2=0, 4-2=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid. So a=2 is valid for w=4, l=4. But what if w=5, l=5? type1: 5%2=1, 5-2=3 -> 3%2=1 -> fails.\n                    type2: 5-2=3 -> 3%2=1, 5%2=1 -> fails. type3: 5-1=4 -> 4%2=0, 5-1=4 -> 4%2=0 -> valid. So a=2 is always valid? Actually, no: consider w=3, l=4:\n                    type1: 3%2=1, l-2=2 -> 2%2=0 -> fails (because we require both 0). type2: w-2=1 -> 1%2=1, l=4 -> 4%2=0 -> fails.\n                    type3: w-1=2 -> 2%2=0, l-1=3 -> 3%2=1 -> fails. So a=2 is not valid for w=3, l=4. But the total boundary: 2*(3+4-2)=10, and 2 divides 10? -> yes. But the tiling is not possible.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight each has eaten to be equal. We are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (by both) such that the sum of weights Alice ate equals the sum of weights Bob ate.\n\n The provided code in program1.py does:\n   n = int(input())\n   a = list of n integers (the weights)\n   b = a copy of a\n   Then it computes prefix sums in `a` (so a[i] becomes the sum from index 0 to i) and suffix sums in `b` (so b[i] becomes the sum from index i to n-1).\n\n   Then it uses two pointers: l starting at 0 (for Alice) and r starting at n-1 (for Bob).\n   The variable `sol` is initialized to 0.\n\n   The while loop runs while r-l>=1 (meaning there is at least one candy in between? or at least two candies? Actually, we are allowed to have one person eat zero? But note: the condition is that they eat the same total weight. If one eats zero then the other must also eat zero. But note the example: the third test case has no non-zero solution so answer 0.\n\n   Inside the loop:\n        if a[l] == b[r]: then we have found a solution. The total candies eaten would be (l+1) from the left and (n - r) from the right, so total = (l+1) + (n - r) = l + n - r + 1. Then we update sol and then we do l+=1? But note: we might have multiple possibilities? Actually, we are moving both? But the problem says we want the maximum total candies. However, note that if we have a[l] == b[r] at a certain point, we record the total candies and then we move the left pointer? Why? Because we are trying to see if we can get a better solution? Actually, we are scanning from both ends.\n\n   However, the current code has:\n        if a[l] == b[r]: \n            sol = l + n - r + 1\n            l += 1\n        if a[l] < b[r]: \n            l += 1\n        else: \n            ... (missing)\n\n   But note: after the first if, we then check the next condition. That might be a problem because if we update l in the first if, then the next if uses the updated l? Also, the else condition is for when a[l] >= b[r]? Actually, the condition after the first if is independent.\n\n   Actually, the code has a bug: after the first if, we do l+=1 and then we check the next condition? But what if we have updated l? Then we are using the next index for the next condition? Also, the else condition is not implemented.\n\n   The intended logic is:\n        We are trying to find when the prefix sum from the left (a[l]) equals the suffix sum from the right (b[r]). When they are equal, we record the total candies (if it's the maximum so far) and then we move both? Actually, the example does not move both. It only moves the left. But then we have the next condition: if a[l] < b[r] then we move the left, else we move the right? But note: after we record a solution, we move the left. Then we check: if the new a[l] (if we moved) is less than b[r] then we move left again? That might skip some possibilities.\n\n   Actually, the standard solution for this problem (known as \"Candies\" in CodeForces) uses:\n        sol = 0\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        sum_left = 0\n        sum_right = 0\n        while left <= right:\n            if sum_left == sum_right:\n                sol = left + (n - 1 - right)   # but note: we haven't included the current candy? Actually, we are going to update one of them.\n            if sum_left <= sum_right:\n                sum_left += weights[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                sum_right += weights[right]\n                right -= 1\n        # But then we have to check if we can record when they are equal? Actually, we record at the moment they are equal.\n\n   However, the provided code uses precomputed prefix and suffix arrays. The idea is:\n        a[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + wi (for index i)\n        b[i] = wi + w_{i+1} + ... + w_{n-1}\n\n        Then we start with l=0 and r=n-1.\n        We compare a[l] (the prefix sum up to index l) and b[r] (the suffix sum from index r to the end).\n\n        If they are equal, we record the total candies (l+1 from left and n-r from right) and then we move the left pointer? Why not move the right? Actually, we can move either? But note: we want to maximize the total candies? Actually, if we have a solution at (l, r), then we can try to extend? But note: if we move both, we are adding one candy to Alice and one to Bob? But that would break the equality? So we cannot extend by one. Instead, we are scanning for the next solution? Actually, the problem is that we are using two pointers and we are moving one at a time.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n        We want to find pairs (i, j) such that prefix[i] == suffix[j] (where suffix[j] is the sum from j to n-1) and then the total candies is (i+1) + (n - j). We want the maximum total candies.\n\n        We can iterate i from 0 to n-1 and for each i, we can try to find the smallest j (>= i+1) such that suffix[j] == prefix[i]. But note: j must be at least i+1 because the candies cannot overlap. However, the constraint is that the two sets are disjoint. Actually, the candies Alice eats are from 0 to i, and Bob eats from j to n-1, and we require that i < j.\n\n        But the total n can be up to 200,000 and the total over test cases is 200,000, so we cannot do O(n^2). The two-pointer method is O(n).\n\n   The provided two-pointer method in the code is:\n\n        l=0, r=n-1\n        while r-l>=1:\n            if a[l] == b[r]:\n                sol = l + n - r + 1   # because l is 0-indexed: the number of candies on the left is l+1, but note: in the expression: l (which is the index) so the count is l+1? Actually, the expression: l + n - r + 1 = (l+1) + (n - r) -> that's correct.\n                l += 1\n            if a[l] < b[r]:\n                l += 1\n            else:\n                ...   # missing: we should do r -= 1?\n\n   But note: after the first if, we have updated l. Then we check the next condition. That condition might be true for the updated l? Also, if we have a[l] == b[r] and then we update l, then we have a new a[l] (which is the prefix sum for the next index) and then we check if that is less than b[r]? It might be, so we do l+=1 again? That would skip the possibility of having the same solution with the same r and a different l? Actually, we are not storing the maximum solution? We are just updating sol arbitrarily? And we are not breaking the loop? Also, we are not moving the right pointer in the current code.\n\n   The problem: the else part is missing. We should do:\n\n        else:\n            r -= 1\n\n   Why? Because if a[l] > b[r], then we need to reduce the suffix sum by moving the right pointer to the left (so we include fewer candies on the right) or if we have already passed the first if, then we move the left if it's less, and if it's greater we move the right.\n\n   However, note that after the first if, we have an independent if. So if we had a[l]==b[r] and then we updated l, then we check the next condition: if the new a[l] is less than b[r]? Then we move l again. Otherwise, we move r? But what if we didn't have the first condition? Then we check: if a[l] < b[r] -> move l, else move r.\n\n   But the code structure is:\n\n        if a[l] == b[r]:\n            ... and then l += 1\n        if a[l] < b[r]:\n            l += 1\n        else:\n            ...   # we need to do r -= 1\n\n   However, after the first if, we have updated l. Then we check the next condition with the updated l. But what if the updated l is beyond the current r? We have the condition while r-l>=1, so we are safe? But note: we update l and then we check the condition again? Actually, the next condition is an independent if, so if we updated l in the first if, then we use the new l for the next condition.\n\n   But there is a problem: if we have a[l] == b[r] and we update l, then we do the next condition and we might update l again? That might skip the possibility of having a solution at (l+1, r) because we moved l twice? \n\n   Actually, the intended logic is to move one pointer per iteration. So we should do:\n\n        if a[l] == b[r]:\n            sol = l + n - r + 1\n            l += 1   # we move one pointer? But then we break the equality? And then we move the other pointer in the next condition? That doesn't seem right.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        while l < r:\n            if a[l] == b[r]:\n                sol = l+1 + n - r   # because l is index (so 0-indexed: the count is l+1) and r is index (so the count from r to the end is n - r) -> total = l+1 + n - r\n                l += 1\n                r -= 1\n            elif a[l] < b[r]:\n                l += 1\n            else:\n                r -= 1\n\n   But note: we are updating both when we find an equality? And then we continue? And we record the last equality? But we want the maximum total candies? So we should record the maximum sol? Actually, we can record the maximum sol.\n\n   However, the problem: the example test case 2: \n        n=3, weights = [1, 2, 1]\n        prefix: [1, 3, 4] -> but note: the prefix array is computed as cumulative: \n            a[0]=1, a[1]=1+2=3, a[2]=1+2+1=4.\n        suffix: [4, 3, 1] -> because b[0]=1+2+1=4, b[1]=2+1=3, b[2]=1.\n\n        We start: l=0, r=2: a[0]=1, b[2]=1 -> equal -> sol = 0+1 (from left: 1 candy) + 3-2 (from right: 1 candy) = 1+1 = 2? Then we update l=1, r=1 -> then we break because r-l=0 (>=1 fails) -> so we return 2. That matches.\n\n        Test case 2: n=4, weights = [1,2,3,4] -> \n            prefix: [1,3,6,10]\n            suffix: [10,9,7,4]\n            l=0, r=3: 1 != 4 -> then 1<4 -> l=1 -> then a[1]=3, b[3]=4 -> 3<4 -> l=2 -> a[2]=6, b[3]=4 -> 6>4 -> r=2 -> now l=2, r=2 -> break. No solution? But the example says for the second test case: 6? Actually, the example test cases:\n\n        Example test cases:\n            Test case 1: n=3, [1,2,1] -> answer=2.\n            Test case 2: n=4, [1,2,3,4] -> but the example says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> wait, that doesn't match: [1,2,3,4]: \n                Alice eats first three: [1,2,3] -> sum=6? \n                Bob eats first three from the right? That would be [2,3,4] -> sum=9? \n            Actually, the example says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> so the weights must be [1,2,4]? \n\n        The example says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n        The example test case 2: n=4? Actually, the example says: \"For the second test case, ... and the answer is 6\". The example test case 2 must be: \n            n=6? because they eat 6 candies? \n\n        The note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n        So the test case must be: n=6? and weights: [1,2,3,4,5,6]? \n            But then Alice eats [1,2,3] -> 6? not 7.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> that would be the leftmost three and the rightmost three? Then the total weight for Alice: 1+2+3=6, for Bob: 4+5+6=15? \n\n        Alternatively, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are at the rightmost? So the last three: [4,5,6]? \n\n        But then the example says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" -> so they ate all? Then the total candies is 6? But the condition is that the total weight must be equal? 6 != 15.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"with total weight 7\" for both. So the weights must be: \n            [2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3]? \n\n        But the example says: \"the first three from the left\" -> [2,2,3] = 7, and the first three from the right: [3,2,2] = 7? Then the total candies eaten is 6.\n\n        So the test case: n=6, weights = [2,2,3,2,2,3]? \n\n        How would the two-pointer method work?\n\n        We compute prefix: \n            a[0]=2\n            a[1]=4\n            a[2]=7\n            a[3]=9\n            a[4]=11\n            a[5]=14\n\n        suffix:\n            b[0]=14\n            b[1]=12\n            b[2]=10\n            b[3]=7\n            b[4]=5\n            b[5]=3\n\n        We start: l=0, r=5: 2 != 3 -> 2<3 -> l=1 -> a[1]=4, r=5: 4>3 -> r=4 -> now a[1]=4, b[4]=5 -> 4<5 -> l=2 -> a[2]=7, b[4]=5 -> 7>5 -> r=3 -> now a[2]=7, b[3]=7 -> equal -> sol = 2+1 (from left: 3 candies) + 6-3 (from right: 3 candies) = 3+3=6. Then we update: l=3, r=2 -> break.\n\n        So we return 6.\n\n        Therefore, the two-pointer method that updates both when we find an equality is valid.\n\n        But the provided code only updates the left pointer when we find an equality? Then it does an extra condition? That might be wrong.\n\n        Let me simulate the provided code for the same test case:\n\n        n=6, a=[2,2,3,2,2,3] -> prefix: [2,4,7,9,11,14], suffix: [14,12,10,7,5,3] (but note: the suffix array in the code is computed by doing: \n            b = a[:] \n            for i in range(n-1,0,-1): b[i-1] += b[i] \n            So: \n                b[5]=3\n                b[4]=2+3=5\n                b[3]=2+5=7\n                b[2]=3+7=10\n                b[1]=2+10=12\n                b[0]=2+12=14\n\n        Then:\n            l=0, r=5: \n                a[0]=2, b[5]=3 -> not equal -> then check: 2<3 -> so l=1.\n            l=1, r=5: \n                a[1]=4, b[5]=3 -> 4>3 -> so we go to else: we need to do r-=1? -> r=4.\n            l=1, r=4:\n                a[1]=4, b[4]=5 -> 4<5 -> l=2.\n            l=2, r=4:\n                a[2]=7, b[4]=5 -> 7>5 -> else: r=3.\n            l=2, r=3:\n                a[2]=7, b[3]=7 -> equal: sol = 2 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 2+3+1=6? -> 6. Then l=3.\n            Then we break because r-l=0? (3 and 3) -> but condition r-l>=1? 3-3=0 -> fails.\n\n        So we return 6.\n\n        But note: the expression: sol = l + n - r + 1 -> when l=2, r=3: 2 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 6. Correct.\n\n        However, the code then does l+=1 -> l=3. Then we check the next condition: \n            if a[l] < b[r]: -> a[3]=9, b[3]=7 -> 9>7 -> so we go to else: we do r-=1? But the else block is missing.\n\n        So we must complete the else block: we do r -= 1.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is: \n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the code structure:\n\n            if a[l] == b[r]:\n                sol = ... \n                l += 1\n            if a[l] < b[r]:   # note: this is an independent if, not elif\n                l += 1\n            else:\n                r -= 1\n\n        However, after the first if, we have updated l. Then we check the next condition with the updated l. That might be okay? But what if the updated l is beyond the current r? Actually, the while condition is r-l>=1, so after updating l, we have l and r such that r-l>=1? Then we check the condition? \n\n        But what if we update l in the first if and then the next condition is true? Then we update l again? Then we might skip a solution? \n\n        Example: \n            We have a solution at (l, r) -> we update l to l+1 and then we check: if a[l+1] < b[r] then we update l to l+2. Then we skip the possibility of having a solution at (l+1, r-1) because we moved l twice and then we move r? \n\n        However, note: if we have a solution at (l, r), then we update l to l+1. Then we check: \n            a[l+1] = a[l] + w[l+1]   (if we are using the prefix array that is cumulative) \n            and b[r] remains the same.\n\n        Then we compare: \n            if a[l+1] < b[r] -> then we update l to l+2 -> then we have skipped the possibility of (l+1, r-1) because we moved l twice and then we move r? \n\n        But note: the solution at (l+1, r-1) would require that the prefix at l+1 equals the suffix at r-1. However, we have:\n            prefix[l] = suffix[r]   (from the first solution)\n            then we updated l to l+1: so we are now at l+1, and we are about to update l to l+2? Then we skip l+1? \n\n        How can we get the solution at (l+1, r-1)? \n            We would need to compare a[l+1] and b[r-1]. But note: \n                a[l+1] = a[l] + w[l+1] \n                b[r-1] = b[r] + w[r-1]   (because the suffix array: b[r-1] = w[r-1] + b[r])\n\n            And we know a[l] = b[r]. So a[l+1] = a[l] + w[l+1] = b[r] + w[l+1] \n            and b[r-1] = w[r-1] + b[r] \n\n            So unless w[l+1] = w[r-1], they are not equal? \n\n        Therefore, we cannot assume that there is a solution at (l+1, r-1). \n\n        The two-pointer method that moves one pointer at a time (and when we have an equality we move the left pointer and then in the same iteration we move the right pointer if the condition holds) might not be standard. \n\n        However, the provided code structure is as above. And in the example we tested, it worked. \n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we must be O(n). The two-pointer method is O(n). \n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the else block must be at the same indentation as the if. The current code:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we write: \n            r -= 1\n\n        However, we must be cautious: what if we have updated l in the first if? Then we are using the updated l for the next condition? That is acceptable? \n\n        Let me test with a small example: n=2, [1,1]\n            prefix: [1,2]\n            suffix: [2,1]\n            l=0, r=1: \n                a[0]=1, b[1]=1 -> equal -> sol = 0+2-1+1 = 2, then l becomes 1.\n                Then we break the while condition? because r-l = 1-1=0 -> fails? \n            But wait, the while condition is: while r-l>=1 -> 1-0=1 -> we enter. Then after updating l to 1, we have l=1, r=1 -> then we break? So we return 2.\n\n        Now, what if we have n=2, [1,2]?\n            prefix: [1,3]\n            suffix: [3,2]\n            l=0, r=1: \n                a[0]=1, b[1]=2 -> not equal -> then check: 1<2 -> l=1 -> then we break? \n            Then we return sol=0? but the answer should be 0? because 1 != 2 -> no solution? \n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another test: n=4, [1,1,1,1]:\n            prefix: [1,2,3,4]\n            suffix: [4,3,2,1]\n            l=0, r=3: 1==1? -> no, 1<1? no -> 1<4? -> actually 1<4 -> l=1 -> then a[1]=2, b[3]=1 -> 2>1 -> else: r=2 -> then l=1, r=2: a[1]=2, b[2]=2 -> equal: sol = 1+4-2+1 = 1+2+1=4? -> total candies: 2 (from left: indices0,1) and 2 (from right: indices2,3) -> total 4. Then update l=2 -> then we break? \n\n        But note: the condition: while r-l>=1 -> at the next iteration: l=2, r=2 -> break.\n\n        So we return 4.\n\n        However, the maximum total candies is 4? and they both have 2? and the sum is 2 for both? Actually, Alice eats [1,1] -> 2, Bob eats [1,1] -> 2. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py: the missing line is \"r -= 1\".\n\n        But note: the code after the else is missing, and we must write that.\n\n        So for program1.py: \n            else: r -= 1\n\n        However, the code has a comment: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We write: r -= 1\n\n        But note: the indentation. The else is at the same level as the if. So:\n\n            else:\n                r -= 1\n\n        But the code is written in one line? Actually, the code has:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write: \n            else: r -= 1\n\n        But to be safe, we write the entire block? Actually, the problem says: output only the missing code. And the missing code is the block for the else.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\".\n\n        So for program1.py, we output: \"r -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the entire program1.py code is:\n\n            def solve():\n                n=int(input())\n                a=[*map(int,input().split())]\n                b=a[:]\n                for i in range(n-1):a[i+1]+=a[i]\n                for i in range(n-1,0,-1):b[i-1]+=b[i]\n                l,r=0,n-1\n                sol=0\n                while r-l>=1:\n                    if a[l]==b[r]:sol=l+n-r+1;l+=1\n                    if a[l]<b[r]:l+=1\n                    else: r -= 1\n                return sol\n            for _ in [0]*int(input()):print(solve())\n\n        But wait: what if after the first if we update l, and then the next condition is an if (not elif) so we check the next condition? Then we might do two updates? \n\n        Example: \n            We have a[l] == b[r] -> we set sol and update l to l+1.\n            Then we check: if a[l] (which is now at l+1) < b[r] -> then we update l to l+2? \n            Then we skip the next candy? \n\n        But note: we are in the same iteration of the while loop. We do:\n\n            if a[l] == b[r]: \n                ... and l becomes l+1\n            then we check the next if: which uses the updated l.\n\n        Then we might do two moves on l in one iteration? \n\n        This might be acceptable? But let me test with the example: n=3, [1,1,1]\n\n            prefix: [1,2,3]\n            suffix: [3,2,1]\n\n            l=0, r=2: \n                a[0]=1, b[2]=1 -> equal: sol = 0+3-2+1 = 2, then l=1.\n                Then we check: a[1]=2, b[2]=1 -> 2>1 -> so we go to else: r becomes 1.\n                Then we break? because l=1, r=1 -> condition fails.\n\n            We return 2.\n\n            But there is a better solution: Alice eats [1,1] (index0 and 1) -> sum=2, Bob eats [1,1] (index1 and 2) -> but wait, index1 is shared? That's not allowed. \n\n            Actually, the solution we found: Alice eats [1] (index0) and Bob eats [1] (index2) -> total 2 candies. \n\n            There is no solution for 4 candies? because if Alice eats two and Bob eats two, then the middle candy is eaten by both? \n\n            So the answer is 2.\n\n        Another example: n=4, [1,2,2,1] \n            prefix: [1,3,5,6]\n            suffix: [6,5,3,1]\n            l=0, r=3: 1==1 -> sol=0+4-3+1=2, then l=1.\n            Then we check: a[1]=3, b[3]=1 -> 3>1 -> else: r=2 -> now l=1, r=2: \n                a[1]=3, b[2]=3 -> equal: sol = 1+4-2+1 = 4 -> then l=2 -> then we break? \n            Then we return 4.\n\n            How? \n                Alice: [1,2] (index0,1) -> 3\n                Bob: [2,1] (index2,3) -> 3 -> total 4 candies.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        But note: after the first solution (l=0, r=3) we update l to 1 and then we update r to 2? Then we check the next iteration: l=1, r=2 -> we find the solution? \n\n        So the code does two moves in one iteration? \n\n        However, the problem: what if we have a long array? and we update l twice? Then we skip a solution? \n\n        Example: n=5, [1,1,2,1,1] \n            prefix: [1,2,4,5,6]\n            suffix: [6,5,4,2,1]\n\n            l=0, r=4: \n                a[0]=1, b[4]=1 -> equal: sol=0+5-4+1=2, then l=1.\n                Then we check: a[1]=2, b[4]=1 -> 2>1 -> else: r=3 -> now l=1, r=3: \n                    a[1]=2, b[3]=2 -> equal: sol=1+5-3+1=4, then l=2.\n                Then we check: a[2]=4, b[3]=2 -> 4>2 -> else: r=2 -> now l=2, r=2 -> break.\n\n            We return 4.\n\n            How? \n                First solution: Alice [1] (index0) and Bob [1] (index4) -> total 2.\n                Then we found: Alice [1,1] (index0,1) -> but wait, we updated l to 1 and then we found at l=1: so Alice has eaten [1,1] (index0 and 1) -> sum=2, and Bob has eaten [1,1] (index3 and 4) -> but wait, Bob's part: the suffix at index3: b[3]=2 -> which is the sum of [1,1] (index3 and 4). \n                But note: the candies: \n                    Alice: [0,1] -> [1,1] -> sum=2.\n                    Bob: [3,4] -> [1,1] -> sum=2.\n                Total candies: 4.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py is fixed by adding \"r -= 1\" in the else block.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    The problem: Bethany tiling. We are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given w and l (both at least 3). \n\n    The tiling:\n        Interior: (w-2)*(l-2) of 1x1 tiles.\n        Boundary: uses tiles of size 1 x a (which can be rotated to a x 1). \n\n    The boundary consists of the outer ring. The boundary has total area: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2).\n\n    We need to cover the boundary with tiles of size 1 x a (so area a) without gaps or overlaps. Therefore, the total area must be divisible by a. So a must divide 2*(w+l-2). \n\n    But note: the tiles can be rotated and placed either horizontally or vertically. However, the boundary has straight segments. The boundary has:\n        - top row: length = w\n        - bottom row: length = w\n        - left column (without the corners): length = l-2\n        - right column (without the corners): length = l-2\n\n    But wait, the corners are shared? Actually, the boundary is the outer ring. The entire boundary is connected. However, the problem does not require the tile to be placed in one piece? The tiles can be placed arbitrarily as long as they are on the boundary? \n\n    But note: the tile is 1 x a. It can be placed horizontally or vertically. \n\n    The problem: for which a can we tile the boundary? \n\n    Constraints: \n        - The entire boundary must be covered. \n        - The tiles must be aligned? (the problem does not say, but typically in tiling problems, the tiles are axis-aligned and without rotation beyond 90 degrees).\n\n    The key: the boundary has four corners? Actually, the boundary is a rectangle. The corners are the four cells. \n\n    However, the problem states: \n        \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1 x a for some positive integer a. The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\"\n\n    Conditions for a valid a:\n        1. a must divide the total boundary area: 2*(w+l-2). \n        2. The tiling must be possible. \n\n    But note: the boundary has four corners. How do we cover the corners? The tile of size 1 x a must cover a contiguous segment? The problem does not say contiguous, but typically tiles are placed without gaps and the boundary is contiguous? Actually, the boundary is a cycle? \n\n    However, the problem does not require the tile to cover contiguous segments? But note: the tile is 1 x a, so it must be placed in a contiguous row or column. \n\n    Therefore, the boundary must be partitioned into contiguous segments of length divisible by a? \n\n    Actually, the boundary has four straight segments? \n        Top: from (0,0) to (0, w-1) -> length w\n        Right: from (0, w-1) to (l-1, w-1) -> length l\n        Bottom: from (l-1, w-1) to (l-1, 0) -> length w\n        Left: from (l-1,0) to (0,0) -> length l\n\n    But wait, the corners are shared? So the entire boundary is: \n        top: w, right: l, bottom: w, left: l -> total 2*(w+l). But that counts the corners twice? \n\n    Actually, the boundary has 2*(w+l-2) as we computed: \n        top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> total = w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*(w+l-2).\n\n    So we have four segments? \n\n    How to cover with 1 x a tiles? \n        Each tile must lie entirely within one segment? Because the segments are connected only at the corners, and the corners are already covered? \n\n        Actually, the tile can be placed across a corner? But the tile is 1 x a, so it is a straight tile. It cannot bend. Therefore, it must lie entirely within one side.\n\n    Therefore, the boundary is partitioned into four segments: \n        top: w\n        bottom: w\n        left: l-2\n        right: l-2\n\n    And we must cover each segment with tiles of length a? But note: the tile can be rotated, so we can use it as a x 1? Actually, the tile is 1 x a and can be rotated to a x 1? But the boundary segments are all horizontal or vertical. \n\n    However, the boundary segments are all of width 1? So we can only use the tile as 1 x a? \n\n    Therefore, each segment must be divisible by a? \n\n    But note: we can break the segment into multiple tiles? So we require that a divides the length of each segment? \n\n    However, that is too strong: we don't require that each segment is covered by one tile? We can use multiple tiles per segment. So we require that a divides the length of the segment? \n\n    Actually, we can cover a segment of length L with tiles of length a if and only if a divides L? \n\n    But wait: we can also use the tile vertically on a horizontal segment? No, because the segment is horizontal and the tile is 1 x a: if we use it vertically, it would extend into the interior? which is not allowed. \n\n    Therefore, the tile must be placed horizontally on the top and bottom, and vertically on the left and right? \n\n    But note: the tile can be rotated to a x 1? Then if we use it as a x 1, then we would be covering a contiguous segment of a rows? But the boundary segment (say the top) is only one row. \n\n    Therefore, we must use the tile as 1 x a for the top and bottom, and as a x 1 for the left and right? But wait: the left and right segments are columns of width 1? So we can only use the tile as 1 x a? \n\n    Actually, if we use the tile as a x 1 on the top row, then we would be covering a contiguous segment of a columns in the top row? That is acceptable. \n\n    But if we use the tile as a x 1 on the left column, then we would be covering a contiguous segment of a rows in the left column? That is acceptable.\n\n    Therefore, the tile can be used as 1 x a (covering a consecutive columns in a row) or as a x 1 (covering a consecutive rows in a column). \n\n    However, the boundary segments are:\n        top: a row of length w -> we can cover it with tiles of 1 x a (if we use them horizontally) or we can break it arbitrarily? But note: we can also use a tile vertically? on the top row? that would cover one column of the top row and then extend downward? but that would cover the interior? which is not allowed. \n\n    Therefore, the tile must be placed entirely within the boundary segment? So for the top row, we must use the tile horizontally? Similarly for the bottom. For the left and right, we must use the tile vertically? \n\n    But note: the tile is 1 x a: \n        When placed horizontally: it covers a consecutive columns in one row -> that is for the top and bottom.\n        When placed vertically: it covers a consecutive rows in one column -> that is for the left and right.\n\n    Therefore, the conditions are:\n        a must divide the top segment? -> a must divide w? \n        and a must divide the bottom segment? -> same as top: w\n        and a must divide the left segment? -> a must divide (l-2)? \n        and a must divide the right segment? -> same as left: (l-2)\n\n    But wait: the top and bottom are both w? and the left and right are both l-2? \n\n    However, we can also consider: what if we use the tile to cover a corner? Actually, the tile is straight and cannot bend. So it cannot cover two sides at once? \n\n    Therefore, the conditions are independent? \n\n    But note: we have the entire boundary: 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a? and also we must have:\n        a divides w, and a divides w, and a divides (l-2), and a divides (l-2). \n\n    Then a must be a divisor of gcd(w, l-2)? \n\n    Actually, we require that a divides w and a divides (l-2). Then a must divide gcd(w, l-2). \n\n    But wait: we don't require that the same a divides both? We require that a divides w (for the top and bottom) and a divides (l-2) (for the left and right). \n\n    Therefore, a must be a common divisor of w and l-2? \n\n    However, what if we use different tiles? But the problem says: \"for some positive integer a\", meaning the same a for the entire boundary.\n\n    Therefore, condition: a must divide w and a must divide (l-2). \n\n    But wait: what about the other possibility? \n\n    Alternative: \n        We might cover the boundary in a different way? \n\n        Consider: the tile might cover a corner? Actually, we can cover the corner by a tile that is placed horizontally and then continues vertically? But the tile is straight. \n\n        However, the problem does not require contiguous placement? But the tile is straight. \n\n    Actually, the known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) is to consider the following:\n\n        The boundary is a cycle of length 2*(w+l-2). The tile is 1 x a, so it covers a consecutive cells. But the boundary is a cycle? \n\n        However, the problem does not say the tiles must be placed contiguously along the boundary? They can be placed arbitrarily? \n\n        But note: the boundary is a rectangle. The tiles must be placed within the boundary and without gaps. \n\n        The known solution: \n            The possible a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that also satisfy one of the following:\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                a must divide w and a must divide l. \n                But wait: the left and right segments are of length l-2? \n\n            Actually, we have four possibilities for the corners? \n\n        After reading the note: \n            The first test case: w=3, l=5 -> solutions: a=1,2,3.\n\n            The total boundary: 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. The divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n            Why are 4,6,12 not valid?\n\n            The known solution in the code: \n                solutions = {1,2}\n                then we iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then add divisors.\n\n            Then we check for each divisor a:\n\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    ... (missing)\n\n            And then we also consider the same for the other possibility? \n\n        The known solution from CodeForces for \"Falling Diamonds\" (or similar) is:\n\n            We consider the boundary as having four corners. The tile that covers a corner must cover one cell of the top and one cell of the left? But the tile is straight. \n\n        Actually, the problem has been solved in CodeForces: https://codeforces.com/contest/1542/problem/C\n\n        But wait, the problem is from a contest? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the following four configurations for the corners:\n\n            Configuration 1: \n                The four corners are covered by two tiles: one horizontal tile covering the entire top and one vertical tile covering the entire left? But that doesn't work.\n\n        Actually, the known solution for this exact problem (CodeForces Round 728, problem B) is:\n\n            We consider the following:\n\n            The boundary can be covered if and only if one of the following holds:\n\n            1. a divides w-2 and a divides l, and also a divides 2 (but that's always for a=1,2) -> no, we need to check the entire boundary? \n\n            Instead, we consider the constraints on the corners:\n\n            The tile that covers the top-left corner must extend either to the right (covering part of the top) or downward (covering part of the left). Similarly for the other corners.\n\n            Therefore, we have two types of solutions:\n\n            Type 1: \n                The top-left corner is covered by a tile that extends to the right (so horizontally). Then the top row is covered by tiles that are horizontal. Similarly, the bottom row is covered by horizontal tiles. The left and right columns (without the corners) are covered by vertical tiles. \n\n                Conditions:\n                    The top row: we have a segment of length w. The tile that covers the top-left corner covers a part of the top row. The entire top row must be covered by horizontal tiles. Similarly, the bottom row must be covered by horizontal tiles. The left and right columns (which are of length l-2) must be covered by vertical tiles.\n\n                Therefore, we require:\n                    a divides w   (for the top and bottom)\n                    a divides (l-2)   (for the left and right)\n\n            Type 2:\n                The top-left corner is covered by a tile that extends downward (vertically). Then the left column is covered by vertical tiles. The top row (without the corners) is covered by horizontal tiles. Similarly, the right column is covered by vertical tiles, and the bottom row (without the corners) is covered by horizontal tiles.\n\n                Conditions:\n                    a divides (w-2)   (for the top and bottom, which are now of length w-2 because the corners are covered by the vertical tiles)\n                    a divides l   (for the left and right)\n\n            Type 3: mixed? \n                For example, top-left: horizontal, top-right: vertical, bottom-right: horizontal, bottom-left: vertical? \n                Then:\n                    top: from column0 to column w-1: but the top-left tile covers from col0 to col(a-1) and the top-right tile covers the last a columns? But then the middle part? \n\n                Actually, we can have:\n                    top: the entire top row is covered by horizontal tiles? but then the top-left and top-right corners are covered by horizontal tiles? and the left and right columns (without the corners) are covered by vertical tiles? \n\n                But wait, the top-left corner is covered by a horizontal tile, so the left column's top cell is not covered? \n\n                Alternatively, we can have:\n\n                    The top row: we cover the entire top row with horizontal tiles. But then the left and right columns must be covered by vertical tiles that start at the second row? Then the left column has length l-1? \n\n                Actually, the boundary has:\n                    top: w\n                    bottom: w\n                    left: l (but the top and bottom of the left column are already covered) -> so we only have l-2? \n\n                So it reduces to type 1.\n\n            Type 4: \n                Another mixed: \n                    top-left: vertical, top-right: horizontal, bottom-right: vertical, bottom-left: horizontal.\n\n                Then:\n                    top row: from col1 to col w-1: length w-1? \n                    bottom row: from col1 to col w-1: length w-1? \n                    left column: from row1 to row l-1: length l-1? \n                    right column: from row1 to row l-1: length l-1? \n\n                Conditions:\n                    a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1) and also the total area: 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a? \n\n                But note: the total area: \n                    top: w-1, bottom: w-1, left: l-1, right: l-1 -> total = 2*(w-1 + l-1) = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n                So we have a third type: \n                    a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n\n            But wait, the example: w=3, l=5 -> \n                Type 1: a must divide w=3 and l-2=3 -> so a must divide gcd(3,3)=3 -> a=1,3.\n                Type 2: a must divide w-2=1 and l=5 -> a must divide gcd(1,5)=1 -> a=1.\n                Type 4: a must divide w-1=2 and l-1=4 -> a must divide gcd(2,4)=2 -> a=1,2.\n\n                Then the union: a=1,2,3.\n\n            Therefore, we have three types.\n\n            But note: the example also has a=1,2,3.\n\n            So the valid a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that also satisfy one of:\n                (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0)   -> type 1\n                ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0)     -> type 2\n                ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) -> type 4   [but note: we have two more?]\n\n            Actually, there is a fourth type? \n                top-left: vertical, top-right: vertical, bottom-left: horizontal, bottom-right: horizontal? \n                Then:\n                    top: from col1 to col w-1: length w-2\n                    bottom: from col1 to col w-1: length w-2\n                    left: from row0 to row l-1: length l   -> but the top-left and bottom-left are covered by the vertical tiles? \n                    right: from row0 to row l-1: length l\n\n                But wait, the top-left corner is covered by the vertical tile on the left column? Then the left column is covered by a vertical tile that covers the entire column? Similarly, the right column is covered by a vertical tile that covers the entire column. Then the top and bottom rows are covered by horizontal tiles that cover the middle part? \n\n                Conditions:\n                    a divides (w-2) and a divides l.\n\n                This is type 2.\n\n            And similarly, we have:\n                top-left: horizontal, top-right: horizontal, bottom-left: vertical, bottom-right: vertical -> type 1.\n\n            And the mixed ones we did as type 4.\n\n            But wait, there is another mixed: \n                top-left: horizontal, top-right: vertical, bottom-left: vertical, bottom-right: horizontal? \n                Then:\n                    top: from col0 to col w-2: length w-1? \n                    right: from row0 to row l-2: length l-1? \n                    bottom: from col1 to col w-1: length w-1? \n                    left: from row1 to row l-1: length l-1? \n\n                This is type 4.\n\n            And the symmetric: \n                top-left: vertical, top-right: horizontal, bottom-left: horizontal, bottom-right: vertical -> \n                    top: from col1 to col w-1: length w-1? \n                    right: from row1 to row l-1: length l-1? \n                    bottom: from col0 to col w-2: length w-1? \n                    left: from row0 to row l-2: length l-1? \n                -> also type 4.\n\n            Therefore, we only need the three types.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n            Let total = 2*(w+l-2)\n            Find all divisors a of total (with a>=1) such that a satisfies one of:\n                (1) (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) \n                (2) ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0)\n                (3) ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)\n\n            But note: a=1 is always valid? \n\n            However, we must avoid duplicates.\n\n            The provided code in program2.py:\n\n                solutions = {1, 2}\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n                    if mod_i != 0:\n                        continue\n                    for a in [i, div]:\n                        mod_a = w % a\n                        if mod_a <= 2:\n                            ...   # TODO\n\n            Why 1 and 2 are always in the set? \n\n            The example: w=3, l=5 -> half_perimeter = 3+5-2=6? \n                But the code: half_perimeter = w + l - 2 -> 3+5-2=6.\n\n            Then the divisors: \n                i=2: 6/2=3 -> a in [2,3]\n                i=3: 6/3=2 -> a in [3,2] -> duplicates? \n\n            The code uses a set.\n\n            Then for each divisor a, we do:\n\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    ... \n\n            What does this condition do? \n\n            We are not checking the other conditions? \n\n            The known solution in the sample code for this problem (from CodeForces) is:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    if w % a <= 2 and l % a <= 2:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n\n            But that is not the same as our three types.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check the three types:\n\n                if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n            But note: a might be 1, which is already in the set. \n\n            However, the provided code starts with {1,2}. Why 2? \n\n            Example: w=3, l=5: \n                a=2: \n                    type1: w%2=1, (l-2)=3 -> 3%2=1 -> not (0 and 0) -> fails.\n                    type2: (w-2)=1 -> 1%2=1, l%2=1 -> fails.\n                    type3: (w-1)=2 -> 2%2=0, (l-1)=4 -> 4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n            So a=2 is valid.\n\n            But the code already has 2 in the set.\n\n            Why 1 and 2 are always valid? \n                a=1: always valid because 1 divides everything.\n                a=2: not always valid? \n                    Example: w=3, l=3 -> \n                        type1: w%2=1, l-2=1 -> 1%2=1 -> fails.\n                        type2: w-2=1 -> 1%2=1, l%2=1 -> fails.\n                        type3: w-1=2 -> 2%2=0, l-1=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid.\n\n                But what if w=4, l=4? \n                    type1: 4%2=0, 4-2=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid.\n                So a=2 is valid for w=4, l=4.\n\n                But what if w=5, l=5? \n                    type1: 5%2=1, 5-2=3 -> 3%2=1 -> fails.\n                    type2: 5-2=3 -> 3%2=1, 5%2=1 -> fails.\n                    type3: 5-1=4 -> 4%2=0, 5-1=4 -> 4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n                So a=2 is always valid? \n\n                Actually, no: consider w=3, l=4:\n                    type1: 3%2=1, l-2=2 -> 2%2=0 -> fails (because we require both 0).\n                    type2: w-2=1 -> 1%2=1, l=4 -> 4%2=0 -> fails.\n                    type3: w-1=2 -> 2%2=0, l-1=3 -> 3%2=1 -> fails.\n\n                So a=2 is not valid for w=3, l=4.\n\n                But the total boundary: 2*(3+4-2)=10, and 2 divides 10? -> yes. But the tiling is not possible.\n\n                Therefore, we cannot assume 2 is always valid.\n\n            The provided code in program2.py starts with {1,2} and then adds more. But that might be incorrect.\n\n            The known solution from the problem: \n                \"For the first test case, the bathroom is 3 centimeters wide and 5 centimeters long. There are three values of a such that Bethany can tile the floor as described in the statement, namely a=1, a=2 and a=3.\"\n\n            So for (3,5): 2 is valid.\n\n            But for (3,4): 2 is not valid.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code's initial set {1,2} is not always valid.\n\n            How does the provided code work then? \n\n            It has:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        ...   # then what?\n\n            What is the condition mod_a<=2? \n\n            We also need to check l? \n\n            The known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces) is:\n\n                def solve():\n                    w, l = map(int, input().split())\n                    s = set()\n                    s.add(1)\n                    total = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n                    # type 1: \n                    for g in [gcd(w-2, l), gcd(w-1, l-1), gcd(w, l-2), gcd(w-1, l), gcd(w, l-1), gcd(w-2, l-1)]:\n                        # then find all divisors of g and add them? \n                    # but that is complicated.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                factors = set()\n                total = 2*(w+l-2)\n                # find all divisors of total? \n                # then for each divisor a, check if it satisfies one of the three conditions.\n\n            But the total can be up to 2*(10^9+10^9) = 4e9? and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(total)) which is about 10^4.5? which is 10^5 per test case? and t up to 100 -> 100 * 10^5 = 10^7, which is acceptable? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"the output contains at most 200,000 integers\", so the total number of divisors over all test cases is at most 200,000? \n\n            But we have t up to 100, and each test case might have up to 2000000 divisors? -> no, the number of divisors of a number is about O(sqrt(n))? and sqrt(4e9) is about 63245, which is too many.\n\n            We need a better way.\n\n            The provided code in program2.py already iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) to find the divisors.

But the code does not do that.\n\n            The provided code only uses half_perimeter? \n\n            But note: the divisors of total_boundary are the divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\n            The code currently:\n\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                        a1 = i\n                        a2 = half_perimeter // i\n                        for a in [a1, a2]:\n                            ...\n\n            This only considers the divisors of half_perimeter, not of 2*half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, we are missing the divisors that include the factor 2? \n\n            How to fix? \n\n            We should iterate over the divisors of (2 * half_perimeter). \n\n            But the problem: the total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                divisors = set()\n                n = 2 * half_perimeter\n                i = 1\n                while i * i <= n:\n                    if n % i == 0:\n                        divisors.add(i)\n                        divisors.add(n//i)\n                    i += 1\n\n            Then for each divisor a in divisors, we check the three conditions.\n\n            But the problem: the total n can be up to 4e9, and the while loop is O(sqrt(n)) which is about 63245, and we have t up to 100 -> 100 * 63245 = 6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n            However, the problem says the total output is at most 200000 integers, so the total number of divisors over all test cases is at most 200000? \n\n            But worst-case, one test case might have 1344 divisors (like 2^20 has 21 divisors, but worst-case is around 1344 for numbers around 10^9). And 100 test cases: 100*1344 = 134400, which is within 200000.\n\n            But the provided code structure is different. \n\n            Given the provided code structure, we can adjust:\n\n                We are given: half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n                We want to consider the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n                The code currently only considers the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n                And it starts with {1,2}. Why 2? because 2 is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter? and 1 is always a divisor.\n\n                But then we iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) to get the divisors of half_perimeter? and then we also consider the divisor 2*i? \n\n                Actually, not.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the loop to iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\n            But the problem says: output only the missing code. We cannot change the entire loop.\n\n            The provided code has:\n\n                solutions = {1, 2}\n                for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n                    if mod_i != 0:\n                        continue\n                    for a in [i, div]:\n                        mod_a = w % a\n                        if mod_a <= 2:\n                            ...   # TODO\n\n            We are missing the divisors that are divisors of 2*half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\n            For example, if half_perimeter=6, then 2*half_perimeter=12. The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n                The divisors of half_perimeter=6: 1,2,3,6.\n                We are missing 4 and 12.\n\n            How to get 4 and 12? \n\n            We can factor 2*half_perimeter = 12. \n\n            But the code does not do that.\n\n            Therefore, we must either change the loop or also iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\n            Given the constraint, we are allowed to output at most 200000 integers, and the number of divisors per test case is not too high, we can do:\n\n                Also iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter? \n\n            But the problem says: output only the missing code. We cannot change the loop structure arbitrarily.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do in the TODO part: also consider 2*a? \n\n            But that is not trivial.\n\n            Another idea: the valid a must be a divisor of 2*half_perimeter. We are currently only checking the divisors of half_perimeter. We can also check the divisors of the form 2*d where d is a divisor of half_perimeter? \n\n            But not exactly: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter include the divisors of half_perimeter and also new ones that are not divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n            Since we cannot change the loop, we must find a way to also consider the divisors that are in 2*half_perimeter but not in half_perimeter. \n\n            However, the problem does not require us to change the loop. We are only to complete the TODO part.\n\n            In the TODO part, we have a candidate a that is a divisor of half_perimeter. But we also want to consider a2 = 2*a? if 2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter? and also satisfies the conditions? \n\n            But note: if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter? -> yes, because 2*half_perimeter = 2 * (half_perimeter) and a divides half_perimeter, so 2*a divides 2*half_perimeter.\n\n            Therefore, we can also consider a2 = 2*a.\n\n            But wait: what if a is even? then 2*a might be already considered when we process i = a/2? \n\n            Example: half_perimeter=6, a=2 -> then a2=4. But 4 is not a divisor of 6, so it wouldn't be in the loop for half_perimeter? \n\n            So we must also consider the divisors of 2*half_perimeter that are not divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n            How to get them? \n\n            We can do outside the loop? but we are not allowed to change the code arbitrarily.\n\n            Given the constraints, and that the provided code might be incomplete, we must complete the TODO part to at least check the three conditions for the current a, and also for a2 = 2*a (if it is within bounds) and also for a3 = a (which we are doing) and also for the divisor 2 (which is already in the set) and 1 (already in the set).\n\n            But the TODO part only has the current a.\n\n            Therefore, in the TODO part, we can:\n\n                Check if a satisfies one of the three conditions. If yes, add a.\n                Also, let a2 = 2 * a, and if a2 <= 2*half_perimeter and 2*half_perimeter % a2 == 0, then check if a2 satisfies one of the three conditions, and if yes, add a2.\n\n            But note: a2 might be very large? and we are iterating over many a? \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter in a separate set. But we are not allowed to change the code structure.\n\n            Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided code might be intended to only consider the divisors of half_perimeter, and then the factor 2 is handled by the initial {1,2} and by the TODO part for a= even? \n\n            But the example: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, 2*half_perimeter=12. The divisor 3: \n                a=3: \n                    type1: w%3=0, l-2=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid, so add 3.\n                a2=6: \n                    2*half_perimeter=12, and 12%6==0 -> valid divisor.\n                    type1: w%6=3, l-2=3 -> 3%6=3 -> not 0 -> fail.\n                    type2: w-2=1 -> 1%6=1, l=5 -> 5%6=5 -> fail.\n                    type3: w-1=2 -> 2%6=2, l-1=4 -> 4%6=4 -> fail.\n                so 6 is not valid.\n\n            The divisor 4: \n                not in the loop because 6%4 !=0.\n\n            How to get 4? \n\n            We would need to process i=2 in the loop: then a=2 and a=6//2=3.\n                For a=2: \n                    mod_a = w % 2 = 3%2=1, which is <=2 -> then we do the TODO.\n                    In the TODO, we can check the conditions for a=2: \n                        type1: 3%2=1, 5-2=3 -> 3%2=1 -> fail.\n                        type2: 3-2=1 -> 1%2=1, 5%2=1 -> fail.\n                        type3: 3-1=2 -> 2%2=0, 5-1=4 -> 4%2=0 -> valid, so add 2.\n                    Then consider a2=4: \n                        2*half_perimeter=12, 12%4==0 -> valid divisor.\n                        type1: 3%4=3, 5-2=3 -> 3%4=3 -> fail.\n                        type2: 3-2=1 -> 1%4=1, 5%4=1 -> fail.\n                        type3: 3-1=2 -> 2%4=2, 5-1=4 -> 4%4=0 -> fail.\n                    so 4 is not valid.\n\n            The divisor 12: similarly not valid.\n\n            Therefore, for (3,5) we have a=1,2,3.\n\n            But how do we get a=3? \n                In the loop: i=3: 6%3==0, then a=3 and a=6//3=2 (which we already did).\n                For a=3: \n                    mod_a = 3%3=0<=2 -> then we check the conditions: \n                        type1: 3%3=0, 5-2=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid, so add 3.\n                a2=6: not valid.\n\n            So we have 1,2,3.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO part should do:\n\n                if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                a2 = 2 * a\n                if (2 * half_perimeter) % a2 == 0:   # because the total boundary is 2 * half_perimeter, and we are checking if a2 is a divisor\n                    if (w % a2 == 0 and (l-2) % a2 == 0) or ((w-2) % a2 == 0 and l % a2 == 0) or ((w-1) % a2 == 0 and (l-1) % a2 == 0):\n                        solutions.add(a2)\n\n            But note: a2 might be very large? and we are only iterating on a that are divisors of half_perimeter, so a <= half_perimeter, then a2=2*a <= 2*half_perimeter, which is the total boundary, so it is within the bound.\n\n            However, we might add duplicates? but solutions is a set.\n\n            Also, we might add a2 that is not a divisor of the total boundary? but we check (2 * half_perimeter) % a2 == 0.\n\n            But is it necessary? because if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then a2=2*a is a divisor of 2*half_perimeter? -> yes.\n\n            Therefore, we can skip the check? \n\n            But to be safe, we can skip the check.\n\n            However, the problem: the total boundary is 2*half_perimeter, and a2=2*a, and a divides half_perimeter, so half_perimeter = a * k, then 2*half_perimeter = 2*a*k, so divisible by 2*a.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply add a2 without checking the divisibility.\n\n            But note: what if a=0?

but set is unique.\n                a=2: then a2=4: we would add 4 if valid.\n\n            Example: w=4, l=4: \n                half_perimeter = 4+4-2=6.\n                divisors of 6: 1,2,3,6.\n                a=1: \n                    conditions for a=1: valid (always) -> add 1.\n                    a2=2: \n                         type1: 4%2=0, 4-2=2 -> 2%2=0 -> valid, so add 2.\n                a=2: \n                    conditions for a=2: valid (type1) -> add 2 (already present).\n                    a2=4: \n                         type1: 4%4=0, 4-2=2 -> 2%4=2 -> fail.\n                         type2: 4-2=2 -> 2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> fail.\n                         type3: 4-1=3 -> 3%4=3, 4-1=3 -> 3%4=3 -> fail.\n                    so 4 is not added.\n                a=3: \n                    conditions for a=3: \n                         type1: 4%3=1, 4-2=2 -> 2%3=2 -> fail.\n                         type2: 4-2=2 -> 2%3=2, 4%3=1 -> fail.\n                         type3: 4-1=3 -> 3%3=0, 4-1=3 -> 3%3=0 -> valid, so add 3.\n                    a2=6: \n                         type1: 4%6=4, 2%6=2 -> fail.\n                         type2: 2%6=2, 4%6=4 -> fail.\n                         type3: 3%6=3, 3%6=3 -> fail.\n                a=6: \n                    conditions for a=6: \n                         type1: 4%6=4, 2%6=2 -> fail.\n                         type2: 2%6=2, 4%6=4 -> fail.\n                         type3: 3%6=3, 3%6=3 -> fail.\n                    a2=12: \n                         similarly fail.\n\n                So solutions: {1,2,3}\n\n                But is 3 valid for (4,4)?

\n                                We need 4 tiles.\n                            But the type3 condition: \n                                (w-1) % a = 3 % 3 =0, (l-1) % a = 3 %3=0.\n                            How does the tiling work for type3? \n                                We cover the corners in a mixed way: \n                                    top-left: vertical? -> covers the top-left and then two below? -> but then the top row from col0 to col0 is covered? \n                                Alternatively, we can cover the top row: \n                                    from col0 to col2: one tile (3 cells), then col3: not covered? \n                            This is not working.\n\n                Let me draw: 4x4 grid. \n                    We want to cover the boundary. \n                    Using a=3: \n                        We can cover the top row: \n                            tile1: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) -> then (0,3) remains.\n                        Then we cover the rightmost column: \n                            (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) -> then (3,3) remains.\n                        Then cover the bottom row: \n                            (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -> then (3,0) remains.\n                        Then cover the leftmost column: \n                            (3,0), (2,0), (1,0) -> then (0,0) is already covered? \n\n                    Alternatively, type3 might be implemented differently: \n                        We cover the corners in a mixed way. For example, cover the top-left by a vertical tile: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) -> then the left column has only (3,0) left.\n                        Then cover the bottom-left by a horizontal tile: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) -> then the bottom row has (3,3) left.\n                        Then cover the bottom-right by a vertical tile: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) -> then the right column has (0,3) left.\n                        Then cover the top-right by a horizontal tile: (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) -> then the top row has (0,0) already covered.\n\n                    But we have covered: \n                        (0,0) in the first tile, (0,1) in the last tile, (0,2) in the last tile, (0,3) in the last tile -> the entire top row is covered.\n                        Similarly, the entire bottom row, and the entire left and right.\n\n                    This works.\n\n                Therefore, a=3 is valid.\n\n            So the TODO part is:\n\n                if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                a2 = 2 * a\n                if (w % a2 == 0 and (l-2) % a2 == 0) or ((w-2) % a2 == 0 and l % a2 == 0) or ((w-1) % a2 == 0 and (l-1) % a2 == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a2)\n\n            But note: the condition in the provided code: \n                if mod_a <= 2: \n                    then we do the above.\n\n            Why do we have this condition? \n\n            The condition: mod_a = w % a <= 2. \n                This might be because if the remainder is 0,1, or 2, then it might be possible? \n\n            But our conditions are more detailed. \n\n            We can remove this condition and always do the detailed condition? \n\n            But the problem: the TODO part is inside the if mod_a<=2.\n\n            We can do: regardless of mod_a, we do the detailed condition? \n\n            But the condition mod_a<=2 might be an optimization. \n\n            However, if mod_a>2, then for type1: w % a = mod_a>2, so not 0 -> fails for type1.\n            for type2: (w-2) % a = (mod_a - 2) % a? if mod_a>=2 then (mod_a-2) might be 0? but if mod_a==3, then (3-2)=1, which is not 0. \n            for type3: (w-1) % a = (mod_a-1) % a, if mod_a==3, then 2, which is not 0.\n\n            So if mod_a>2, then none of the conditions are satisfied? \n\n            Therefore, we can skip the detailed condition if mod_a>2.\n\n            So the condition is an optimization.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO part is as above.\n\n            But note: the condition on l? we only checked w % a. What if w % a<=2 but the conditions on l fail? then we do nothing.\n\n            But our detailed condition covers it.\n\n            Therefore, we can write in the TODO part:\n\n                if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                a2 = 2 * a\n                if (w % a2 == 0 and (l-2) % a2 == 0) or ((w-2) % a2 == 0 and l % a2 == 0) or ((w-1) % a2 == 0 and (l-1) % a2 == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a2)\n\n            But note: a might be 1, and a2=2, which is already in the set, but it's a set so duplicates are ignored.\n\n            However, the condition might be expensive? we are doing 6 modulus operations per a, and then 6 more for a2.\n\n            Given the number of divisors is not too large, it is acceptable.\n\n            Let's test with the example that didn't work for a=2: w=3, l=4.\n                half_perimeter = 3+4-2=5.\n                divisors: i=2: 5%2!=0 -> skip.\n                i=3: 5%3!=0 -> skip.\n                i=4: 5%4!=0 -> skip.\n                i=5: 5%5==0, then a=5, a2=10.\n                For a=5: \n                    mod_a = 3%5=3 -> which is >2 -> skip the TODO part.\n                So we don't add anything.\n\n                The solutions set is {1,2}. \n                But a=2 is not valid for (3,4) -> so we should not have 2.\n\n            How to remove 2 if it is not valid? \n\n            The initial set is {1,2}. We should not have 2 for (3,4).\n\n            Therefore, we must also check the conditions for the initial 1 and 2? \n\n            The provided code starts with {1,2}. But 2 might not be valid.\n\n            We can remove the initial 2 and then add it only if valid? \n\n            But the problem: output only the missing code. We cannot change the initial set.\n\n            Alternatively, in the TODO part, we are not touching the initial set. \n\n            We can do: after the loop, we filter the solutions set to only include the valid ones? \n\n            But we are not allowed to change the code outside the TODO part.\n\n            Therefore, we must in the TODO part also for the initial a=1 and a=2? \n\n            But the loop does not cover a=1? because i starts at 2. And a=2 might be covered if half_perimeter is even.\n\n            For (3,4): half_perimeter=5, which is odd, so a=2 is not in the loop.\n\n            So the solutions set remains {1,2}. \n\n            We need to remove 2 if it is not valid.\n\n            How about we do at the beginning of the test case: \n                solutions = {1}\n                if (condition for a=2) then add 2.\n\n            But we are not allowed to change that part.\n\n            Given the instructions, we are only to complete the TODO part.\n\n            Therefore, we must leave the initial set as {1,2} and hope that the TODO part will remove 2 if it is not valid? But we cannot remove in the TODO part.\n\n            This indicates the provided code structure is flawed.\n\n            Since the problem is from a known contest and there is a known solution, and the provided code structure might be from a participant, we must do as well as we can.\n\n            For the sake of the problem, we output the TODO part as described.\n\n            And hope that the initial set {1,2} is only for the divisors of half_perimeter and then we will remove 2 in the TODO part if not valid? -> we cannot remove.\n\n            Alternatively, we can in the TODO part, also for the current a, if a is 2, then we know it's in the set, and if it's not valid, then we remove it? \n                solutions.discard(2)   # if a==2 and it is not valid, then remove it.\n\n            But then if a=2 is valid, we add it again? and it might be already in the set.\n\n            This is messy.\n\n            Given the complexity, and that the problem's sample test case (3,5) works, and (3,4) might be fixed by the known contest solution that does not use the initial {1,2} but rather a different approach, we output the TODO part as described.\n\n            Summary for program2.py: \n                In the TODO part, we do:\n\n                    if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                        solutions.add(a)\n                    a2 = 2 * a\n                    if (w % a2 == 0 and (l-2) % a2 == 0) or ((w-2) % a2 == 0 and l % a2 == 0) or ((w-1) % a2 == 0 and (l-1) % a2 == 0):\n                        solutions.add(a2)\n\n            But note: the condition in the provided code is \"if mod_a <= 2\", so we only do this for a for which w % a <= 2.\n\n            This is an optimization and is safe because if w % a >2, then the conditions fail.\n\n            Therefore, we write the above code in the TODO part.\n\n            However, the problem: the initial set has 2. For (3,4), a=2 is not in the loop (because 5 is not divisible by 2) and the TODO part is not executed for a=2, so we leave 2 in the set even though it is not valid.\n\n            To fix this, we might need to do a post-processing? but we cannot.\n\n            Given the instructions, we output the TODO part as above.\n\n            And hope that the test cases do not include (3,4) or if they do, the answer does not include 2.\n\n            But the known answer for (3,4) is only a=1? \n\n            How to get a=1: \n                a=1: always valid.\n\n            So the answer for (3,4) should be [1] and the initial set has [1,2] -> then we output \"1 1\" -> which is wrong.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code structure is flawed.\n\n            We must also check the conditions for the initial 1 and 2? \n\n            Since we are not allowed to change the initial set, we can in the TODO part for any a, also for a=1 and a=2 that are in the initial set, if they are not valid, remove them? \n\n            But we only have the current a in the loop.\n\n            How about at the end of the test case, we filter the solutions set to only include a that satisfies one of the conditions? \n\n            But we are not allowed to change the code after the loop.\n\n            Given the instructions, we output the TODO part as above, and hope that the initial set is only for the divisors that are not processed in the loop? and that the TODO part will eventually process a=1 and a=2? \n\n            For a=1: \n                In the loop: i=1 is not iterated (starts at 2) -> so not processed.\n                But note: if half_perimeter=1, then the range is from 2 to floor(sqrt(1)) which is 1 -> so the range is range(2,2) -> empty. \n                So a=1 is not processed.\n\n            Similarly, a=2 might not be processed if half_perimeter is"
