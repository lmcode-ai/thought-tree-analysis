But the sample: \n          Start: s1=0, s2=0. Then we do the equality: record, then take left: s1= becomes nonzero. Then we do the TODO: if s1 < s2, which is false, or if s2 < s1, which is true, then we take a right candy. So in one iteration, we take one left and then one right? That is allowed. But what if after the equality case, we have s1 < s2? then we do the TODO: take a left candy. Then we have s1 updated. Then we check the next if: if s2 < s1? -> if now s1>s2, we take a right candy?

Or:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2. Or:\n            Alice: nothing, Bob: nothing -> total=0. Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3,1] -> 7, Bob: nothing -> not equal. Or:\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1,3] -> 4 -> not equal. How about:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2. Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal. Can we do better? Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal. Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2. But also:\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal. Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal.

Then we check s1<s2: if not, skip. Then we check s2<s1: if true, then we do: s2 += l[1] -> which is valid? because p2=1 is within bounds. But then we do p2 -=1 -> p2=0. Then next iteration: p1-1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false -> break. So it doesn't crash. Another example: p1=1, p2=0 -> then we are in the loop: p1-1=0<=0 -> true. Then we might have s1 and s2. If we are in the s2<s1 case, we do: s2 += l[0] -> valid, then p2=-1. Then next iteration: condition fails.",

Then condition: p1-1 = 0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break. Then we print l2[-1] = 0. But the answer should be 0?",

Then we might take a candy from the right: but we do p2-=1. Then the next condition: p1-1<=p2? In the [1,1] example, after the equality block in the second iteration, we have p1=2, then we do the s2<s1 block: we take l[p2] with p2=0 -> that's valid? but then we set p2=-1. But the candy at index0 was already taken by Alice in the first step? How can we avoid? We cannot.",

In the provided program, the if s2 < s1: has a body: \"s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\", which is at the same level as the if. We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But that is two statements in one line? Or we can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break But then the overall program would be:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2): if s1 == s2: \n                    l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                    s1+=l[p1]; \n                    p1+=1\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    if p1 <= p2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                if s2 < s1: \n                    s2+=l[p2]; \n                    p2-=1\n\n        This is valid.

We are using multiple lines. That is acceptable. For program2, we output:\n\n            print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        But note: the existing code in the if n>=1900: is \"print(\"Division\",1)\" and in the else: \"print(\"Division\",4)\". We match the style. Now, we output the JSON. Important: escape the quotes. We'll use:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if p1 <= p2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",2)\"\n            } But the program1 string has newlines and spaces.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code for program1.py has a while loop that uses two pointers (p1 starting at 0 and p2 starting at n-1) and two sums (s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob). The idea is:\n   - We traverse from both ends until the pointers cross (condition: p1-1<=p2? Actually, the condition in the while loop is written as `while (p1-1<=p2):` but note that initially p1=0, so p1-1 = -1 and p2 = n-1. This condition might be intended to be `while p1 <= p2`? However, the problem says the total candies eaten is the count of Alice's candies plus Bob's candies.\n\n But note: the provided code does:\n   - When s1 == s2: it records the current total candies (which is p1 (number of candies Alice has eaten) and (n-1-p2) (number of candies Bob has eaten)) in a list l2. Then it adds the current left candy to s1 and moves p1 to the right.\n   - Then it checks if s1 < s2: but this part is incomplete (it has a TODO).\n   - Then if s2 < s1: it adds the right candy to s2 and moves p2 to the left.\n\n However, the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we must be efficient.\n\n The issue: the condition in the while loop is `while (p1-1<=p2)`. Let me check: \n   Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1 <= n-1 -> true.\n   After some steps, when p1 becomes 1, then condition: 0<=p2 -> until p2 is at least 0.\n\n But note: we are moving p1 and p2. We want to stop when p1 > p2? Actually, we can stop when p1 > p2 because then there are no candies left.\n\n However, the condition in the while loop is `p1-1 <= p2`. This condition is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. This allows p1 to be at p2+1? But note that we are going to process until the pointers cross? Actually, we are processing even when p1==p2? and then we might process one more step? \n\n But observe: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy. So when p1==p2, that candy is not eaten by either? Actually, we are only adding to s1 when we move p1 and to s2 when we move p2. So if we have an odd number of candies, the middle one is not eaten.\n\n The algorithm:\n   We are going to traverse with two pointers. We maintain:\n      s1 = total weight of Alice (from the left)\n      s2 = total weight of Bob (from the right)\n\n   We want to record the total number of candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever s1 == s2.\n\n   Steps:\n      while p1 <= p2:   (but the condition is written as p1-1<=p2, which is the same as p1<=p2+1, so it includes p1==p2+1? Actually, when p1==p2+1, we break? But we want to break when p1>p2, so condition p1<=p2 is the natural one. However, the condition in the code is `p1-1<=p2` which is the same as `p1<=p2+1` -> that would allow p1 to be p2+1. But then we do nothing? because the body of the loop is not entered? Actually, we break when p1-1>p2.\n\n   However, the provided code does:\n        if s1 == s2: ... then update s1 and p1.\n        then if s1 < s2: ... (TODO: we must complete this)\n        then if s2 < s1: ... update s2 and p2.\n\n   But note: after updating s1 in the first if, we then check s1 < s2? and then s2 < s1? But what if after adding to s1, we have s1==s2? Then we don't record? Actually, we record only when we are at the moment of equality? And then we immediately break the equality by adding to s1.\n\n   The idea is: we are traversing and whenever we have an equality, we record the current count. Then we always try to add to the smaller side? Actually, the code does:\n\n        if s1 == s2: \n            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # current total candies: p1 (from left) and (n-1-p2) (from right) -> note: the candy at p1 is about to be taken? Actually, we record the state before we take the next candy? But then we take the next candy for Alice.\n\n        Then we have two conditions: if s1 < s2, we need to add from the left? But wait, the next step: we have just updated s1? Actually, the code structure is:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: \n                    l2.append(...)\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                if s1 < s2:   # TODO: complete\n                if s2 < s1: \n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n        But note: after the first if, we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check the next two conditions. However, what if after updating s1, we have s1 < s2? Then we do the TODO. Similarly, if after updating s1 we have s2 < s1, we update s2.\n\n        But what if we don't have s1==s2? Then we skip the first if. Then we check s1 < s2? and then s2 < s1? \n\n        The problem: the TODO is for the case when s1 < s2. We must add from the left? But wait, we are at a state where s1 < s2. How do we fix that? We can only add from the left (by moving p1) or from the right (but if we add from the right, that would make s2 even bigger? so we should add from the left). However, note that we have already passed the equality check. So we are in a state of imbalance.\n\n        Actually, the algorithm should be:\n\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  record the current total = p1 + (n-1-p2)   [because Alice has eaten p1 candies (indices 0..p1-1) and Bob has eaten (n-1-p2) candies (indices p2+1..n-1)]\n                  then we try to move Alice to the next candy? Why? Because we want to see if we can get a larger total? But note: we are going to continue. However, we must break the equality to proceed.\n\n          But the problem: we are trying to maximize the total number of candies. We record every time we have an equality. Then at the end we take the last recorded value? Actually, the code prints l2[-1]. So we want the last time we had an equality? But note: we are traversing and we might have multiple equalities. The problem asks for the maximum total candies. So we record every time we have an equality and then take the maximum? But the code only records in the equality case and then prints the last one. However, the last one might not be the maximum? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we are moving the pointers and we are updating the sums. The total number of candies at an equality event is the current count. And we are traversing from the ends inward. The total candies at an equality event is p1 + (n-1-p2). We want the maximum such total.\n\n        How can we fix the code? We should record the maximum total? But the problem says: \"print the maximum number of candies\". However, the provided code only appends to l2 when we have an equality and then prints the last element of l2. Why the last? Because we are traversing and the last equality we meet might be the one with the most candies? Actually, as we move inward, the total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? No, it is not: initially we have 0 candies, then we add one from the left and one from the right and we have 2, then we might add more? Actually, the total candies is p1 (from left) + (n-1-p2) (from right). As we move p1 to the right and p2 to the left, the total candies is increasing? Actually, no: when we add a candy to Alice, p1 increases by 1 and the total becomes (p1+1) + (n-1-p2) = previous total + 1. Similarly, when we add to Bob, the total becomes p1 + (n-1-(p2-1)) = p1 + (n-p2) = previous total + 1. So the total is increasing by one each time we take a candy? But wait: we are taking one candy per step? Actually, in the equality case we take one from the left, then we might take one from the right in the next step? But note: the code does:\n\n          if s1==s2: \n              record total = p1 + (n-1-p2)   [current state: Alice has p1 candies? Actually, at the moment of equality, Alice has p1 candies? But note: we haven't taken the next candy. How do we count?]\n\n        Let me clarify the state:\n\n          We have:\n            Alice has taken candies [0, p1-1] -> so p1 candies.\n            Bob has taken candies [p2+1, n-1] -> so (n-1 - p2) candies.\n\n          Then we record: total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n          Then we do: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1 -> so now Alice has p1 (which is the old p1+1) candies.\n\n        Then we check: if s1 < s2: ... and if s2 < s1: ... \n\n        So the recording happens at the moment of equality, and then we break the equality by taking the next left candy.\n\n        Then we try to balance by taking from the right if needed? \n\n        The algorithm: we are always moving the pointers. We record every time we have an equality. Then we break the equality by taking a left candy? and then we try to balance by taking from the side that is lower? Actually, we don't: the code after the equality check has two ifs (not elifs) so they are independent. But note: after we update s1, we then check if s1 < s2? and then if s2 < s1? \n\n        Actually, the code structure is:\n\n          while ...:\n              if s1==s2: \n                  record total\n                  take next left candy -> update s1 and p1\n              if s1 < s2: \n                  ...   # TODO: we need to complete this\n              if s2 < s1: \n                  take next right candy -> update s2 and p2\n\n        But what if after the first if we have updated s1 and now s1 < s2? Then we do the TODO. Similarly, if after the first if we have s2 < s1, we take a right candy.\n\n        However, what if we don't have an equality? Then we skip the first if and then check the next two. So the TODO must be: when s1 < s2, we take a left candy? But wait, we have already taken a left candy in the equality case? And if we are in the s1 < s2 case, we might need to take a left candy? But note: we might have just taken a left candy in the equality case? Then we are in the s1 < s2 case? Then we take another left candy? That would be two left candies in one iteration? \n\n        Actually, the while loop runs until the condition. In one iteration, we might do:\n\n          - if s1==s2: record, then take left, then check s1<s2? if yes, then we do the TODO (which might take another left? or right?) -> but that would be two moves in one iteration? \n\n        Alternatively, we should only do one move per iteration? \n\n        The intended algorithm is:\n\n          We have two pointers and two sums. We start with s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=n-1.\n\n          We want to traverse until p1>p2? But we record when s1==s2.\n\n          The standard solution for this problem (Two Candies) is:\n\n            ans = 0\n            left = 0\n            right = n-1\n            s1 = 0\n            s2 = 0\n            while left <= right:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the next available from left, so left candies have been taken? Actually, the candies taken by Alice: [0, left-1] -> count=left, Bob: [right+1, n-1] -> count = n-1 - right.\n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += w[left]\n                    left += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += w[right]\n                    right -= 1\n\n            # But note: we might have an equality at the end? So we check again? Actually, the standard solution also checks after the loop? \n\n          However, the problem: we want the maximum total candies at any equality. So we record every time we have an equality and then take the maximum? But note: the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies (left + (n-1-right)) is non-decreasing? Not exactly: when we move left, total increases by 1. When we move right, total increases by 1. But we are moving until the pointers cross. The maximum total we can get is when we have taken all candies? But that might not be balanced.\n\n          Actually, we record the last time we had an equality? But the problem asks for the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum total candies at any equality.\n\n          The provided code records every time we have an equality in a list and then prints the last element. Why the last? Because the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing as we take more candies. So the last time we have an equality would be the maximum? \n\n          However, consider: we start with 0, then we take one from left and one from right: total=2. Then we take one from left: total=3? But then we break the equality. Then we take one from right: total=4? and then we have an equality? So the last equality might be at total=4, which is larger than 2.\n\n          Therefore, the last recorded equality is the one with the largest total? Because we are moving the pointers and the total is increasing? Actually, the total is increasing by one each time we take a candy. So the later the equality, the larger the total.\n\n          So we can just record the last equality.\n\n        But the provided code does:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # at this moment, Alice has taken p1 candies? Actually, at the start: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> total=0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we add the first candy to Alice: p1 becomes 1, then we check the next conditions.\n\n          Then in the next iteration, we might have an equality again? and we record again.\n\n        So we are recording every time we have an equality. Then we print the last one. That should be the maximum because the total is increasing.\n\n        Now, what about the TODO? The code has:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to complete that. What should we do when s1 < s2? We want to increase s1? because it is smaller. So we take a candy from the left? \n\n        So we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        Similarly, when s2 < s1, we take from the right.\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: `while (p1-1<=p2)`. We must ensure we don't go out of bounds.\n\n        However, when we are in the s1 < s2 case, we are going to take a candy from the left: we use index p1. We must have p1 <= p2? Actually, the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2, which is the same as p1<=p2+1. When we are at p1<=p2, we can take from the left? But what if p1==p2+1? Then we break the loop? So we are safe? Actually, the condition at the top of the loop ensures we don't run when p1-1>p2. So when we are in the loop, we have p1-1<=p2 -> so p1<=p2+1. \n\n        But if p1==p2+1, then we are going to try to take l[p1] which is out of bounds? \n\n        Therefore, we must break the loop when p1>p2? Actually, the condition in the while loop is set to avoid that? But note: when p1==p2+1, the condition p1-1<=p2 -> (p2+1-1)<=p2 -> p2<=p2 -> true. So we enter the loop. Then we do the checks. We don't have s1==s2? Then we check s1<s2? Then we try to take l[p1] with p1 = p2+1 -> which is out of bounds.\n\n        So we must avoid that. We should only take a candy if there is one available.\n\n        How about we change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? But the provided condition is `p1-1<=p2`. We can adjust the code to use `while p1 <= p2` and then break when we try to take a candy beyond? \n\n        Alternatively, we can check inside the TODO: if p1 <= p2? But the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, and we are guaranteed that the condition in the while loop holds? \n\n        Actually, the condition `p1-1<=p2` is equivalent to `p1<=p2+1`. We are going to take a candy from the left only if p1 <= p2? Because if p1==p2+1, then we cannot take from the left? Similarly, we cannot take from the right if p1>p2? \n\n        Therefore, we should only take a candy if the pointer is valid. But note: the condition of the while loop is set to allow p1==p2+1? Then we are in the loop but we cannot take any candy? Then we would get stuck? \n\n        We must break the loop when we cannot take any candy? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to `while p1 <= p2` and then in the equality case, we take a candy only if p1<=p2? But the provided code in the equality case does take a candy without checking? \n\n        Actually, the problem: the condition `p1-1<=p2` is a bit odd. Let me run a small example: n=1.\n\n          t=1, n=1, w = [10]\n\n          Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record total = 0 + (1-1-0) = 0. Then we do: s1 += w[0] -> 10, p1=1.\n          Then we check: s1 (10) < s2 (0)? -> false. Then check s2 (0) < s1 (10)? -> true: then we do s2 += w[0] -> s2=10, p2=-1.\n\n          Then condition: p1-1 = 0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> break.\n\n          Then we print l2[-1] = 0. But the answer should be 0? because they cannot eat the same weight? Actually, they can eat zero candies? But the problem says: they want to eat the same total weight. Zero is allowed? The problem says \"non-zero\" in the example? Actually, the example: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> so they eat one each? But in the example the weights are [1,1]? \n\n          The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" -> so zero is allowed? \n\n          However, the example n=1: they cannot both eat the same non-zero weight? So the answer is 0? \n\n          But the code recorded 0? and then printed 0. So that's correct.\n\n        However, what if we have two candies: [1,1]? \n\n          n=2, w=[1,1]\n\n          p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record total = 0 + (2-1-1) = 0. Then s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += w[1] -> s2=1, p2=0.\n\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=1 -> equality: record total = 1 (from Alice: [0]) + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2. Then we do: s1 += w[1] -> but p1=1, so w[1]=1 -> s1=2, p1=2.\n          Then check: s1=2, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += w[0] -> but p2=0 -> w[0] is already taken? Actually, Bob has taken the candy at index 1? Now we are taking the candy at index 0? But that candy was already taken by Alice? \n\n          This is a problem: we are taking the same candy twice? \n\n        How to avoid? We must not take a candy that has been taken. The pointers: \n          Alice has taken [0, p1-1] and Bob has taken [p2+1, n-1]. The available candies are [p1, p2].\n\n        So when we take a candy from the left, we take at index p1 and then p1 becomes p1+1. Similarly, from the right: take at p2 and then p2 becomes p2-1.\n\n        In the two candies example:\n\n          Step1: \n            p1=0, p2=1 -> available: [0,1]\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then take left: s1=1, p1=1 -> now available: [1] (only index1? but note: Bob hasn't taken any) -> actually, Bob hasn't taken any, so available is [1]? \n\n          Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> so we take from the right: we take w[1] (which is the candy at index1) -> s2=1, p2=0 -> now available: [].\n\n          Step2: \n            condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true.\n            Now: s1=1, s2=1 -> equality: record total = p1 (which is 1) + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n            Then we take left: but p1=1, which is beyond the available? because available is from p1=1 to p2=0 -> no candy? \n\n          We must not take a candy if there is none. How do we avoid? \n\n          The condition in the equality case: we do s1 += l[p1] and p1+=1. But at this point, p1=1 and p2=0 -> we are going to take l[1]? but that candy was already taken by Bob? because Bob took index1? \n\n          Actually, when we took the right candy, we set p2=0, so the available candies are from p1=1 to p2=0 -> which is an empty set. So we should not take any candy.\n\n          Therefore, we must break the loop when p1>p2? \n\n          How about we change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? Then in the second iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 is false -> break. So we don't enter the loop again.\n\n          But the condition in the provided code is `while (p1-1<=p2)`. For the second iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> 0<=0 -> true. So we enter.\n\n          Then we try to take the left candy at index p1=1 -> which is out of bounds? because the array has indices 0 and 1? but we have p1=1 -> that's the last candy? but then we set p1=2? \n\n          However, in the two candies example, we have w[1]=1. So we take it? But that candy was already taken by Bob? \n\n          This is a problem: we are taking the same candy twice.\n\n        How to fix? We must not take a candy that is not available. The available candies are [p1, p2]. So when we are in the equality case, we can only take a left candy if p1<=p2? Similarly, in the s1<s2 case, we can only take a left candy if p1<=p2? \n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop is `p1-1<=p2` which is `p1<=p2+1`. We are going to take a candy only if we have one available. So we should check in each branch that we have a candy to take? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to `while p1 <= p2` and then we know we have at least one candy? \n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we can do:\n\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                  # Then we must take a candy? but which one? Actually, we can take either? but the problem: we are trying to maximize the total? \n                  # The standard solution in this problem is to take from the left when s1<=s2? but here we break the equality by taking from the left? \n                  # However, we can also take from the right? but the problem: we are free to choose? \n                  # But note: the problem says Alice eats from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. So we are constrained: we can only take from the left by increasing p1, and from the right by decreasing p2.\n\n                  # The provided code always takes from the left in the equality case? \n                  if p1 <= p2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      break   # but then we break? but we are in the loop condition? \n              else:\n                  if s1 < s2:\n                      if p1 <= p2:\n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n                      else:\n                          break\n                  else: # s2 < s1\n                      if p1 <= p2:\n                          s2 += l[p2]\n                          p2 -= 1\n                      else:\n                          break\n\n        But the provided code does not have this structure. We are constrained by the existing code.\n\n        The existing code for program1.py:\n\n            I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n            for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                n=I()[0]\n                l=I()\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: \n                        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                        s1+=l[p1]; \n                        p1+=1\n                    if s1 < s2: \n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s2 < s1: \n                        s2+=l[p2]; \n                        p2-=1\n                print(l2[-1])\n\n        We must complete the TODO. We cannot change the condition of the while loop? \n\n        How about we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But then we might take a candy that is not available? when p1>p2? \n\n        However, the condition of the while loop is `p1-1<=p2`, which means we are in the loop only when p1<=p2+1. But when p1==p2+1, we are going to take l[p1] which is out of bounds? \n\n        Therefore, we must check that p1<=p2? \n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: we are at p1-1<=p2 -> so p1<=p2+1. We are going to take from the left only if p1<=p2? because if p1==p2+1, then we cannot take from the left? \n\n        How about we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But the code does not have an else? Then if we don't take, we get stuck? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the loop if we cannot take? \n\n        However, the problem: the total n over test cases is bounded, and we are guaranteed that the condition will eventually break? \n\n        But the example: n=1, we did:\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n          s1==s2 (0==0): record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2? -> then we do: s2 += l[p2] -> p2=0 -> l[0]=1 -> s2=1, then p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n          Then we print l2[-1]=0.\n\n        Now, what if we have two candies [1,2]? \n\n          n=2, w=[1,2]\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record total=0, then take left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> false? no, s1>s2 -> so we take right: s2=2, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=2 -> s1<s2 -> then we do TODO: take left? but p1=1, which is within [1,0]? -> no, because 1>0 -> so we should not take? \n\n          But the condition p1<=p2? 1<=0 -> false. So we skip? Then we check s2<s1? 2<1 -> false. Then we break? \n\n          Then we print l2[-1]=0. But the answer should be 0? because they cannot have the same total? \n\n          However, what if they take one candy each? Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [2] -> totals 1 and 2 -> not equal. Or Alice takes nothing and Bob takes nothing -> total 0. So 0 is the answer? \n\n          But the example: the first test case in the problem had [1,1] and they took one each -> total 2. \n\n          How about [1,2]: \n            Alice takes [1] -> 1, Bob takes nothing -> 0 -> not equal.\n            Alice takes nothing, Bob takes [2] -> 0 and 2 -> not equal.\n            Alice takes [1,2] -> 3, Bob takes nothing -> 0 -> not equal.\n            Alice takes nothing, Bob takes [1,2] -> 0 and 3 -> not equal.\n            Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [2] -> 1 and 2 -> not equal.\n\n          So the answer is 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code for [1,2] returns 0 -> correct.\n\n        But what if we have [1,1]? \n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then take left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we take right: s2= w[1]=1, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = p1 (1) + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2 -> so we record 2.\n          Then we take left: but p1=1 -> we take w[1]=1? -> s1=2, p1=2.\n          Then check: s1=2, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> take right: but p2=0 -> we take w[0]=1? -> s2=2, p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=1, p2=-1 -> 1<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n          Then we print l2[-1]=2 -> correct.\n\n        However, the problem: when we take the candy at index1 for the second time? In the second iteration, we are at p1=1 and p2=0. Then we do:\n\n          if s1==s2: 1==1 -> true -> record 2, then we do s1 += l[1] -> which is 1? so s1 becomes 2, and p1 becomes 2.\n\n          Then we do the next if: s1=2, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> so we do s2 += l[0] -> which is 1? so s2 becomes 2, and p2 becomes -1.\n\n          But note: the candy at index0 was already taken by Alice? No: in the first step, Alice took index0? Then Bob took index1? Then in the second step, Alice takes index1? but that was already taken by Bob? \n\n        This is a problem: we are taking the same candy twice.\n\n        How to avoid? We must not take a candy that is not available. The available candies are [p1, p2]. In the second iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> but the candy at index1 is at position1, which is not in [1,0]? because the segment [1,0] is empty? \n\n        Actually, the available segment is [p1, p2] -> [1,0] -> no candy. So we should not take any candy. \n\n        Therefore, we must check in each branch that p1<=p2? \n\n        But the provided code does not have that. We are constrained to complete the TODO without changing the existing code? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we can only write the missing part? \n\n        The missing part is only the TODO block? \n\n        How about we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop is `p1-1<=p2`, which means that p1<=p2+1. So p1<=p2 is a subset of the condition. We are in the loop, so p1-1<=p2. But p1<=p2 is a stronger condition? \n\n        However, if p1==p2+1, then we cannot take from the left? \n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n        But what if p1>p2? Then we skip? Then we check the next condition: if s2 < s1? But if we skip, then we might not break the loop? \n\n        Actually, if we skip, then we break the loop? because the next condition might not be met? and then we break? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop: we are still in the loop? and we do nothing? then we will be stuck? \n\n        Example: n=1, after the first step we had p1=1, p2=-1. Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1 false -> break. So we break.\n\n        But what if we are in the loop and we skip both the equality and the s1<s2 and the s2<s1? Then we break? \n\n        Actually, the condition of the while loop: we break when p1-1>p2. So if we do nothing, we break? \n\n        However, we are in the loop and we do nothing? then we break? \n\n        But the condition at the top of the loop is checked at the next iteration? \n\n        Actually, the structure of the while loop: we do the body and then check the condition again? \n\n        So if we do nothing in the body, then we break? \n\n        But we are not breaking the body? we just skip the actions? then we go to the next iteration? \n\n        However, the condition at the top is checked at the beginning of the next iteration? \n\n        So if we do nothing, then we break? \n\n        But in the next iteration, the condition might be false? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                # else: we cannot take, so we break? but the condition of the loop will break next time? \n            ...\n\n        This should be safe.\n\n        Let me test [1,1] again with the check:\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += l[1] -> 1, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=1 -> record 2, then we do: s1 += l[1] -> but now we check: p1=1, p2=0 -> we are in the equality case, and we do: s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1 is within [1,0]? -> no, because 1>0 -> so we should not take? \n\n          But the code in the equality case does not have a check? \n\n          We are not allowed to change the equality case? \n\n        Therefore, we must also fix the equality case? But the problem says: output only the missing code. So we cannot change the equality case? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and the missing code is only the TODO block? \n\n        But the example [1,1] will crash? because when p1=1 and p2=0, we do:\n\n          if s1==s2: true -> then we do s1 += l[1] -> which is the candy at index1? but that candy was already taken by Bob? \n\n        How do we know? The array is still there? but we are using the same array. The problem: we are taking the same candy twice? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not say that the candies are removed from the array? We are just using pointers to simulate. But the candy at index1 is still in the array? but we have already taken it? \n\n        This is a logical error. \n\n        The solution: we must not take a candy that is not available. The available candies are [p1, p2]. So in the equality case, we should only take if p1<=p2? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n        Alternatively, we can hope that the condition p1<=p2 is maintained by the loop? \n\n        Actually, in the equality case, we take a candy from the left: we do p1+=1. Then we are going to have p1 increased. Then in the next conditions, we take from the right? but the right pointer p2 might be less than p1? \n\n        How about we change the condition of the while loop to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code? \n\n        We are only allowed to write the TODO block? \n\n        Therefore, we must complete the TODO block as:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the existing code in the equality case and the s2<s1 case also have checks? But they don't. \n\n        However, the problem states: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and the sample test cases must work? \n\n        But the sample [1,1] will fail? \n\n        How about we run [1,1] with the TODO block filled as above:\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then s1 += l[0]=1, p1=1.\n          Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we check the next if: s1>s2 -> false? no, 1>0 -> so we skip the TODO block? \n          Then we check: if s2 < s1: true -> then we do: s2 += l[1]=1, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Step1: \n             s1=1, s2=1 -> equality: record 2, then s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1, so we take l[1] -> which is 1? then p1=2.\n          Then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> then we check: s1>s2 -> true? so we skip TODO? \n          Then we check: s2 < s1 -> true: then we do: s2 += l[0] -> which is 1? then p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=1, p2=-1 -> 1<=-1 false -> break.\n\n          Then we print 2.\n\n          But the candies: \n            Alice took: index0 and index1 -> total=2.\n            Bob took: index1 and index0 -> total=2.\n\n          But they both took the same candies? \n\n        This is not allowed: each candy can be taken by at most one person.\n\n        Therefore, the code is flawed.\n\n        The intended solution is to use two pointers and only take from the available segment [p1, p2]. We should not take a candy that is outside [p1, p2]. \n\n        How to fix within the constraints? We are only allowed to write the TODO block? \n\n        We must not take a candy that is not available. So in the TODO block, we do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And similarly, in the s2<s1 block, we have:\n\n            if s2 < s1: \n                if p1 <= p2:   # but wait, we are taking from the right: we need to check that p2 is at least p1? \n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n        But we cannot change the s2<s1 block? \n\n        And we cannot change the equality block? \n\n        Therefore, the program might access out of bounds or take the same candy twice.\n\n        However, note the condition of the while loop: `p1-1<=p2`. After we take a candy in the equality block, we set p1 = p1+1. Then we are in the next conditions. Then we might take a candy from the right: but we do p2-=1. Then the next condition: p1-1<=p2? \n\n        In the [1,1] example, after the equality block in the second iteration, we have p1=2, then we do the s2<s1 block: we take l[p2] with p2=0 -> that's valid? but then we set p2=-1. \n\n        But the candy at index0 was already taken by Alice in the first step? \n\n        How can we avoid? We cannot. \n\n        Alternative: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and the sample test cases are small. But the logic is flawed.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we must only complete the TODO block.\n\n        And the TODO block is only for the case s1 < s2. \n\n        Therefore, we complete the TODO block as:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the input does not have a test case that causes double taking? \n\n        However, the sample [1,1] does cause double taking. \n\n        But wait: in the [1,1] example, after the first iteration, we have p1=1 and p2=0. Then in the second iteration, we are in the equality case. Then we do:\n\n            l2.append(1 + (2-1-0)) = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n            then we do: s1 += l[1] -> which is the second candy? but the second candy is at index1, which is within the available segment? at the beginning of the iteration, the available segment is [p1, p2] = [1,0] -> which is empty? \n\n        How do we know the available segment? The available segment is [p1, p2] inclusive. But p1=1, p2=0 -> no candy. \n\n        Therefore, we should not take. \n\n        But the code does not check. \n\n        This is a flaw in the provided code. \n\n        Since we are not allowed to change the provided code except the TODO, we must complete the TODO as above.\n\n        And for the program to run correctly, we must hope that the test cases do not include ones that cause out-of-bound or double taking? \n\n        But the problem says: \"runs correctly\", meaning it must pass the sample test cases? \n\n        The sample test cases in the problem:\n\n          Example 1: n=2, [1,1] -> answer=2.\n          Example 2: n=3, [2,1,1] -> answer=3? \n          Example 3: n=3, [1,2,1] -> answer=4? \n\n        Let me check example 2: n=3, [2,1,1]\n\n          They say: Alice will eat the first three candies (total 2+1+1=4) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (which is the same three) -> but that's not allowed. \n\n          Actually, the problem: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous from the left) and Bob eats from the right (any contiguous from the right). They cannot eat the same candy.\n\n          How about: \n            Alice eats [2] (from the left) -> total=2.\n            Bob eats [1,1] (from the right) -> total=2.\n            Total candies: 1+2=3.\n\n          So answer=3.\n\n          How does the code do?\n\n          w = [2,1,1]\n\n          p1=0, p2=2 -> condition: -1<=2 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then s1=2, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=2, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += w[2]=1, p2=1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=1 -> true.\n          Now: s1=2, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += w[1]=1, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=2, s2=2 -> equality: record total = p1 (1) + (n-1-p2)= (1) + (3-1-0)=1+2=3.\n          Then we take left: s1 += w[1]=1 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n          Then check: s1=3, s2=2 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += w[0]=2 -> s2=4, p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=1, p2=-1 -> 1<=-1 false -> break.\n\n          Then we print l2[-1]=3 -> correct.\n\n          But then we took the candy at index1 twice? Alice took it in the last equality step? and then Bob took it in the next step? \n\n          Specifically: \n            In the last equality step (when we recorded 3), we then did: s1 += w[1] -> which is the candy at index1. But at that time, p1=1, so we took w[1]=1. Then p1 becomes 2.\n            Then we did: s2 += w[0] -> which is the candy at index0. But that candy was already taken by Alice in the first step? \n\n          This is double taking.\n\n        How to avoid? We must not take a candy that is not available. In the last equality step, the available segment is [p1, p2] = [1,0] -> empty. So we should not take any candy. \n\n        Therefore, we must add checks in the equality case and in the s2<s1 case. But we are not allowed.\n\n        Given the constraints of the problem (only output the TODO block), we complete the TODO block as:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the test cases do not cause double taking? \n\n        But the sample [1,1] and [2,1,1] both involve double taking in the provided code. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that the provided code has a while condition that is too broad. We should change it to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\n        But we are not allowed.\n\n        After re-thinking: the condition in the while loop is `p1-1<=p2`. This allows p1 to be p2+1. In the equality case, we are taking a candy from the left: we require that p1 is within [0, n-1] and also within [p1_initial, p2] (available). But at the moment of the equality, the available segment is [p1, p2]. We should only take if p1<=p2. \n\n        Therefore, we must change the equality case to:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break   # or just skip? but then we might get stuck? \n\n        But we cannot change that.\n\n        Given the instructions, we only complete the TODO block.\n\n        And the TODO block is only for the s1<s2 case.\n\n        So we write for program1.py's TODO:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that the test cases are not adversarial? \n\n        But the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, and the sample test cases include [1,1] and [2,1,1] which we've seen work in terms of the answer (they output 2 and 3) even though they do double taking? \n\n        However, double taking is accessing an index that is out of the available segment, which might be out of bounds? \n\n        In [1,1]: \n          In the second iteration, after the equality case, we do:\n             s1 += l[1] -> index1 is within the array bounds (0-indexed, size=2, so index1 is valid) but it is not available? \n          Then in the s2<s1 case, we do:\n             s2 += l[0] -> index0 is within bounds.\n\n          So it doesn't crash, but it is logically wrong.\n\n        But the answer is printed as 2, which is correct.\n\n        In [2,1,1]:\n          In the last equality step, we do:\n             s1 += l[1] -> index1 is within bounds.\n          Then in the s2<s1 case, we do:\n             s2 += l[0] -> index0 is within bounds.\n\n          So it doesn't crash.\n\n        Therefore, the program will not crash, and the answer is the last recorded equality, which is the maximum.\n\n        So we complete the TODO block as above.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code for the TODO block is:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the code has two if's after the equality: \n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                ... (our TODO)\n            if s2 < s1: \n                ...\n\n        They are not elif's, so both could be done in one iteration? But that would be rare. \n\n        For example, if after the equality case we have s1 becomes 3 and then we do the TODO block and then s1 becomes 4, and then we check the next if: if s2 < s1? -> if s2 is less than 4, we do the next block. \n\n        But that would be two moves in one iteration? \n\n        However, the problem: we are allowed to take one candy at a time? \n\n        But the simulation: in one iteration of the while loop, we might move both pointers? \n\n        That would be incorrect because the moves should be sequential. \n\n        But the sample: \n          Start: s1=0, s2=0.\n          Then we do the equality: record, then take left: s1= becomes nonzero.\n          Then we do the TODO: if s1 < s2, which is false, or if s2 < s1, which is true, then we take a right candy.\n\n          So in one iteration, we take one left and then one right? \n\n        That is allowed.\n\n        But what if after the equality case, we have s1 < s2? then we do the TODO: take a left candy. Then we have s1 updated. Then we check the next if: if s2 < s1? -> if now s1>s2, we take a right candy? \n\n        Example: weights = [1,2,3,1]\n\n          n=4, w=[1,2,3,1]\n\n          We want: \n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n          How about:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2 candies.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n            Bob: [1,3] -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1,3] -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: nothing, Bob: nothing -> total=0.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3,1] -> 7, Bob: nothing -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1,3] -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n          How about:\n            Alice: [1] -> 1\n            Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n          Can we do better? \n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1] -> 1 -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [1] -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n          But also:\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n          Or:\n            Alice: [1,2,3,1] -> 7, Bob: [1,3,1] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n          So the answer is 2.\n\n          How does the code do?\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=3 -> condition: -1<=3 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then take left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we take right: s2= w[3]=1, p2=2.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=2 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=1 -> equality: record total = 1 + (4-1-2)=1+1=2.\n          Then take left: s1 += w[1]=2 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n          Then check: s1=3, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> take right: s2 += w[2]=3 -> s2=4, p2=1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=1, p2=1 -> true.\n          Now: s1=3, s2=4 -> s1<s2 -> then we do TODO: take left? but p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2, so we skip.\n          Then condition: s2>s1 -> skip the next if? \n          Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=1, p2=1 -> true.\n          Then: s1=3, s2=4 -> then we do TODO: take left? but p1=2, p2=1 -> skip.\n          Then next if: skip.\n          Then we are stuck? \n\n          But the condition will be true again? and we do nothing -> infinite loop.\n\n        Therefore, we must break when we cannot take any candy? \n\n        How about we change the TODO to:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break   # break the loop? but we are in the while loop, break will break the while? \n            ...\n\n        But break in the TODO block will break the while loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break out of the while loop by setting p1 and p2 to values that break the condition? \n\n        But the condition is p1-1<=p2. If we set p1 = a big number and p2 = a small number, we can break? \n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    # force the condition to break next time? \n                    # or break the while loop by setting p1 = p2+2? \n                    p1 = p2+2   # then p1-1 = p2+1 > p2 -> next condition fails.\n                    break   # but break is not allowed? because we are in a for/while? \n\n        But the problem: we are in a while loop. We can break. \n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded, and we are not in an infinite loop. \n\n        But in the example above, we would break out and then print the last recorded equality, which is 2 -> correct.\n\n        But is it safe to break when we cannot take a left candy? \n\n        Because if we cannot take a left candy, then we also cannot take a right candy? not necessarily: we might be able to take a right candy? \n\n        But in the TODO block, we are in the s1<s2 case. We try to take a left candy to increase s1. If we cannot, then there is no way to increase s1, so we will never get s1>=s2? then we can break.\n\n        Similarly, in the s2<s1 case, if we cannot take a right candy (because p1>p2) then we break? \n\n        But the existing code for the s2<s1 case does not have a check. \n\n        How about we do in the TODO block:\n\n            if s1 < s2:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        And in the s2<s1 case, we should also break if p1>p2? but we cannot change it.\n\n        However, in the s2<s1 case, the code is:\n\n            if s2 < s1: \n                s2 += l[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n\n        This will crash if p2 is out of bounds? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When we are in the loop, p1-1<=p2. When we do p2-=1, then p2 becomes p2-1. Then next time, the condition might fail.\n\n        But if p1<=p2 is false, then in the TODO block we break. In the s2<s1 case, we don't have a break, but we do an action that might be invalid? \n\n        For example, if p1>p2, then in the s2<s1 case, we do s2 += l[p2] with p2 out of bounds? \n\n        Specifically, if p2 is -1, then l[p2] is invalid.\n\n        Therefore, we must also check in the s2<s1 case? \n\n        But we cannot change it.\n\n        Given the instructions, we only complete the TODO block.\n\n        And in the TODO block, we can break to avoid infinite loop, and hope that in the s2<s1 case, if p2 is out of bounds, the condition of the while loop will break next time? \n\n        But if p2 is -1, then in the next iteration the condition p1-1<=p2 (p2=-1) might be false.\n\n        However, in the example above with [1,2,3,1] and after the second iteration we had p1=2, p2=1. Then in the next iteration, we had s1=3, s2=4 -> we do the TODO: p1=2, p2=1 -> p1>p2, so we break. Then we break out of the while loop. Then we print l2[-1]=2.\n\n        But what if we have s2<s1 and p2 is out of bounds? \n\n        Example: n=1, [5]\n\n          Step0: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then take left: s1=5, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=5, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += l[0] -> but p2=0 -> valid? -> s2=5, p2=-1.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=-1 -> 0<=-1 false -> break.\n\n          Then print 0.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n        But if we have a different scenario: \n          weights = [1, 2], and we are in a state: p1=2, p2=1 -> then we have s1 and s2 not equal, and then we try to do the TODO or the s2<s1 block? \n\n          In the while condition: p1-1=1, p2=1 -> 1<=1 -> true.\n          Then we skip the equality case.\n          Then if s1 < s2: ... \n          Then if s2 < s1: ... \n          But we don't know s1 and s2? \n\n        How about we simulate [1,2] from scratch:\n\n          p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> equality: record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n          Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += l[1]=2, p2=0.\n          Then condition: p1-1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n          Now: s1=1, s2=2 -> s1<s2 -> then we do TODO: \n                if p1<=p2: p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false -> so we break.\n          Then we print l2[-1]=0.\n\n          Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can break in the TODO block when we cannot take a left candy.\n\n        So the TODO block becomes:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        This will break the while loop and exit.\n\n        But break will exit the while loop immediately? \n\n        Yes.\n\n        Then we avoid the infinite loop.\n\n        And for the s2<s1 case, if we are in a state where p1>p2, we would have already broken out in the TODO block if it was s1<s2, or if it was s2<s1, then the code will try to do:\n\n            s2 += l[p2]   # with p2 possibly out of bounds? \n\n        But if we broke out in the TODO block, we exit the while loop and skip the s2<s1 case.\n\n        If we are in the s2<s1 case and p1>p2, then we would have already broken out in a previous opportunity? \n\n        Actually, in the while loop, we do the three if's sequentially. If in the TODO block we break, then we exit the while loop and the next if's are not executed.\n\n        But what if we are in the s2<s1 case and p1>p2, and we did not break in the TODO block? \n\n        For example, if we are in the s2<s1 case and p1>p2, then we will try to do:\n\n            s2 += l[p2]   # p2 might be out of bounds.\n\n        How to avoid? We cannot.\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2. If p1>p2, then p1-1 might be <= p2? \n\n        Example: p1=2, p2=1 -> p1-1=1<=1 -> true. Then we enter the loop.\n\n        Then we skip the equality case.\n\n        Then we check s1<s2: if not, skip.\n\n        Then we check s2<s1: if true, then we do: s2 += l[1] -> which is valid? because p2=1 is within bounds.\n\n        But then we do p2 -=1 -> p2=0.\n\n        Then next iteration: p1-1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false -> break.\n\n        So it doesn't crash.\n\n        Another example: p1=1, p2=0 -> then we are in the loop: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n          Then we might have s1 and s2. \n          If we are in the s2<s1 case, we do: s2 += l[0] -> valid, then p2=-1.\n          Then next iteration: condition fails.\n\n        Only if p2 is negative we might crash. \n\n        When would p2 be negative? \n\n        In the previous step, p2=0, then we do p2-=1 -> p2=-1.\n\n        Then in the next iteration, the condition: p1-1<=p2? -> p1-1<=-1. \n          If p1=0: then -1<=-1 -> true.\n          Then we might try to access l[p2] in the s2<s1 case? \n\n        But how did we get to p2=-1? \n          We must have done p2-=1 in the s2<s1 case when p2 was 0.\n\n        Then in the next iteration, if we are in the s2<s1 case, we do: s2 += l[-1] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must not do that.\n\n        How about we change the condition of the while loop to `while p1<=p2`? \n\n        But we cannot.\n\n        Given the constraints, we complete the TODO block as described.\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n          The problem is simple: we are given a rating and we output the division.\n\n          The code:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while t > 0:\n                n = int(input())\n                if n >= 1900:\n                    print(\"Division\",1)\n                elif n >= 1600 and n <1900:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                elif n >= 1400 and n < 1600:\n                    print(\"Division\", 3)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Division\",4)\n                t -= 1\n\n          The TODO is for the division 2. We should print \"Division 2\".\n\n          So we do:\n\n                print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        But note: the condition is n>=1600 and n<1900, so we output division 2.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        However, the problem says: output in the format \"Division X\", and the existing code uses:\n\n            print(\"Division\",1)   -> this prints \"Division 1\" (with a space)\n\n        So it's consistent.\n\n        Now, we output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\n        Summary:\n\n          program1: \n            We complete the TODO block with:\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n          program2:\n            We complete the TODO block with:\n                print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1 the missing code is the block for the condition \"if s1 < s2\". \n\n        We write the code exactly as above.\n\n        However, the existing code in program1 has:\n\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO comment with the code.\n\n        Similarly for program2.\n\n        We output in JSON:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"if p1 <= p2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n            \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",2)\"\n          }\n\n        But note: the program1 code has indentation. The existing code has 8 spaces for the body of the if. We match the existing indentation.\n\n        In the provided program1, the TODO is at the same indentation as the other if's. The existing code in the if s2 < s1: block is:\n\n            s2+=l[p2]; \n            p2-=1\n\n        But we are writing a block with multiple lines. We can write:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The if block is indented 8 spaces (relative to the while). We will use 12 spaces for the inner block? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write in one line? \n\n        But the problem: we are to output the missing code. We can output it as a block.\n\n        Let me count the existing indentation:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the while block, then 8 for the inner if's.\n\n        So the TODO is at 8 spaces. Then the inner if should be at 12 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code in the if s2 < s1: block is written in two lines but with the same indentation? \n\n        Actually, it is:\n\n                    if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        So the TODO is at 8 spaces. We can write:\n\n                    if s1 < s2: \n                        if p1 <= p2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n\n        But that would be 12 and 16 spaces? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must have valid Python.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without new lines? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                else: break\n\n        But that is less readable.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we'll use the block structure.\n\n        But note: the existing code in the if s2 < s1: block is written in one line? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But the existing code for the if s2 < s1: is:\n\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        So it is in one line. \n\n        We can write the TODO block in one line? \n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                else: break\n\n        But that is two lines? \n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                else: break\n\n        But the if s1 < s2: is already there. We only need to replace the TODO comment with the inner if-else.\n\n        We write:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But that would be at the same indentation as the if s1 < s2: body.\n\n        However, the body of if s1 < s2: should be a block. We can write:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: \n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else: \n                    break\n\n        But that is multiple lines.\n\n        Given the freedom, we'll output the block as we did.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        We output only the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n        For program1, the missing code is the body of the if s1 < s2:.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But note: the existing line has \"if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        We are replacing the TODO comment with the above block? \n\n        Actually, we are replacing the entire line? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We are replacing the line with:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But that would be changing the existing if condition? \n\n        We are only to complete the block for that if.\n\n        Therefore, we only output the inner block? \n\n        But the TODO is at the body of the if s1 < s2. We are to complete the body.\n\n        So the missing code is the body of the if s1 < s2.\n\n        We output:\n\n    if p1 <= p2:\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\n        But the indentation: in the program, the if s1 < s2: is at 8 spaces. The body should be indented 12 spaces.\n\n        We output the body with 4 spaces of indentation? and the system will put it in the context of 8+4=12? \n\n        But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Alternatively, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation level as the other statements in the if body? \n\n        In the provided program, the if s2 < s1: has a body: \"s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\", which is at the same level as the if.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But that is two statements in one line? \n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But then the overall program would be:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: \n                    l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                    s1+=l[p1]; \n                    p1+=1\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    if p1 <= p2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                if s2 < s1: \n                    s2+=l[p2]; \n                    p2-=1\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1 the string:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But note: the existing code in the if s2 < s1: is in one line. We are using multiple lines. That is acceptable.\n\n        For program2, we output:\n\n            print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        But note: the existing code in the if n>=1900: is \"print(\"Division\",1)\" and in the else: \"print(\"Division\",4)\".\n\n        We match the style.\n\n        Now, we output the JSON.\n\n        Important: escape the quotes.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if p1 <= p2:\\n                s1 += l[p1]\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",2)\"\n            }\n\n        But the program1 string has newlines and spaces. We represent the newline as \\n and the spaces as spaces.\n\n        The program1 code: the body of the if s1 < s2: should be indented 12 spaces? In the program, the while is at 4, the if's are at 8, and the body of the if's should be at 12. But the existing if s1==s2: has multiple statements in one line? \n\n        We'll use 12 spaces for the inner if and else? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use 4 spaces for each indent, and the program has:\n\n            while ...:\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the while body\n                if ...:   # 4 more -> 8\n                    ...   # 4 more -> 12\n\n        So we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2:   # at 8+4 = 12 spaces\n                    s1 += l[p1]   # at 12+4 = 16\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But the problem: we are only outputting the missing block, which is the body of the outer if s1 < s2. So we output:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And we indent this block by 4 spaces relative to the if s1 < s2: which is at 8 spaces. So the entire block is at 12, 16, 16, 12, 12.\n\n        We write the string with these spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify, and the existing code uses 4-space indentation.\n\n        We'll assume the program uses 4-space indentation.\n\n        So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        and we represent it as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a single line? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But that is two lines.\n\n        Or one line:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n\n        But that is not valid.\n\n        We'll do the block.\n\n        Final output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if p1 <= p2:\\n    s1 += l[p1]\\n    p1 += 1\\nelse:\\n    break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",2)\"\n            }\n\n        But the existing code in the if s2 < s1: is in one line. We are using multiple lines. That is acceptable.\n\n        However, to match the existing style of the if s1==s2: which is in one line, we can do one line for the if and else? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But that is two lines. We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        But the body of the if s1 < s2: is now two lines. That is valid.\n\n        Or we can do one line for the entire block? \n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n\n        That is not valid.\n\n        We'll do two lines.\n\n        But note: the if s1 < s2: is already a line. We are only to complete its body.\n\n        So the body is two lines: \n\n            if p1 <= p2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But then the overall if s1 < s2: has a body that is 5 lines? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n            else: break\n\n        This is two lines.\n\n        We choose this.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing code is:\n\n    if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n    else: break\n\n        But wait, this is two lines. And the next line is \"if s2 < s1: ...\", which is at the same indentation as the if s1 < s2:.\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                else: break\n            if s2 < s1: \n                s2+=l[p2]; \n                p2-=1\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        We'll output for program1: \n\n            \"if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\\n            else: break\"\n\n        But the existing if s1 < s2: has a comment at the end: we replace the entire line? \n\n        The line is: \"    if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        We replace it with:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n                else: break\n\n        But then we are changing the structure.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we output only the body of the if s1 < s2: as two lines, with the same indentation as the body of the other if's.\n\n        The other if's have one line bodies. We can do one line? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; \n            else: break\n\n        But that is two lines.\n\n        Or we can do one line for the entire body of if s1 < s2: \n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n\n        This is one line.\n\n        And it is valid.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n\n        Then the code becomes:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n            if s2 < s1: \n                s2+=l[p2]; \n                p2-=1\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing code is:\n\n            if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\n\n        For program2, it is:\n\n            print(\"Division\",2)\n\n        Now, we output the JSON.\n\n        Note: in the string for program1, we have a semicolon and the else. We must escape the quotes in the JSON.\n\n        We do:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if p1 <= p2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1; else: break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(\\\"Division\\\",2)\"\n            }\n\n        This should work.\n\n        Let's hope."
