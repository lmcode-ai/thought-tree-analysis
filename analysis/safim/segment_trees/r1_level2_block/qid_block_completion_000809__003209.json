Let me assume: [1,1,5,5,1,1] -> then Alice can eat [1,1,5] = 7, and Bob can eat [1,1,5] = 7, and the total eaten is 6. So the array might be: [1,1,5,5,1,1] for n=6. Therefore, the second test case has n=6. So the input for the second test case is: \n            n=6 [1,1,5,5,1,1]\n\n        Alice: [1,1,5] (indices0,1,2) = 7\n        Bob: [1,1,5] (indices5,4,3) = 7\n\n        The middle is empty. So the condition is: the sum of the contiguous segment from the left (starting at the left) equals the sum of the contiguous segment from the right (starting at the right), and they don't overlap. Then the total eaten is 3+3=6. Therefore, the problem is: \n            Find i and j such that 0<=i<=j<=n-1, and the sum of the first i elements (indices0..i-1) equals the sum of the last j elements (indices n-j..n-1), and maximize i+j. We can do:\n\n            Let prefix[0]=0, for i in range(1, n+1): prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n            Let suffix[0]=0, for i in range(1, n+1): suffix[i] = suffix[i-1] + arr[n-i] Then we want to find i and j such that prefix[i] = suffix[j] and i+j<=n, and maximize i+j. We can use a hash map for prefix[i] and then for each j, we look for prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then candidate = i+j if i+j<=n. But note: the segments should not overlap: the first i elements and the last j elements should not overlap. This means that i <= n-j.\n\n        So the condition: i<=n-j  -> i+j<=n. So we can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we can let j = n - i, and then we cannot have any overlap. But the condition is i<=n-j, which is i<=n-(n-j) -> i<=j, which is not what we want.",

So we must fix that.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Output a description of a hierarchy tree\" for each test case.\n\n The provided code structure:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   ... then reads the matrix ...\n\n   Then it computes a 2D prefix sum? Actually, it builds a matrix S and then does some prefix.\n\n   Then it defines a function `acc` to compute a submatrix sum.\n\n   Then it uses dynamic programming with M and P for the optimal BST-like problem.\n\n   Then it builds the solution by backtracking and prints the parent array.\n\n However, the problem has multiple test cases. So we must wrap the code accordingly.\n\n Also, note: the prefix sum building part has a TODO: we need to complete the prefix sum.\n\n But note: the prefix sum building code:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n            elif i > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n            elif j > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n We need to complete the TODO: when j>0 and i==0, we should add the left element in the same row.\n\n So: S[0][j] += S[0][j-1]\n\n But note: the matrix S is built from the input. The input matrix is n x n.\n\n However, the problem is: we are going to use the entire matrix for the DP? Actually, the DP uses the function `acc` which uses the prefix sum.\n\n The problem is similar to \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" but with a twist: the cost is defined by the entire communication over all pairs.\n\n Actually, note: the cost for a pair (i, j) is c_ij * d_ij, and d_ij is the distance in the tree.\n\n The tree is constrained: for a node, left subtree has numbers < node, right subtree has numbers > node. So the tree is a Cartesian tree (like BST) on the indices 0..n-1 (which represent the team members in increasing order of job number).\n\n Therefore, the problem is to build an optimal BST where the cost is defined by the entire communication.\n\n However, note: the communication cost for a pair (i, j) is c_ij multiplied by the distance in the tree. The distance in the tree is the sum of the distances from i to LCA(i,j) and from j to LCA(i,j). Alternatively, we can use the fact that the entire cost can be expressed as the sum over edges of the total communication that goes through that edge.\n\n But note: the problem is known and the solution uses Knuth's optimization for optimal BST? Actually, the constraints: n up to 200000? But wait: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, so each test case n can be up to 200000? Actually, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can have at most 1 test case? because 200000 is the maximum n? Actually, t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n <= 200000, so t can be up to 10000 but each n is at least 1, so the maximum t is 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the average n is 0.2? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can have multiple test cases, but the total n (the sum of the n for each test case) is <= 200000.\n\n Therefore, we can process each test case independently and the total n is bounded by 200000.\n\n How to solve:\n\n We note that the tree must be a BST on the keys 1..n (which are the indices 0..n-1 in our array). The cost is the sum over all pairs (i,j) of c_ij * d_ij.\n\n We can use the following known approach:\n\n   Let w[i][j] be the total communication cost that would be saved if we could put the entire set [i, j] in a subtree? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the \"quadrangle inequality\" and use Knuth optimization? But note: the constraints: n up to 200000? Actually, the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case n in one test case can be 200000? The problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So the maximum n in one test case can be 200000? Actually, no: because if there is only one test case, then n=200000. So we need an O(n^2) solution? But 200000^2 is 40e9 which is too high.\n\n Therefore, we need a more efficient solution.\n\n Actually, note: the problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" but with a different cost function? Or is it the same as the \"minimum communication cost tree\" for a set of keys with frequencies? \n\n In the classical optimal BST, we have frequencies for each key and also for dummy keys (for unsuccessful searches). Here, the cost for a pair (i,j) is c_ij * (distance between i and j). And note that the distance between i and j is (depth[i] + depth[j] - 2 * depth[LCA(i,j)]). But we can also express the total cost as:\n\n   Sum_{i,j} c_ij * (depth[i] + depth[j] - 2 * depth[LCA(i,j)])\n\n = (Sum_i depth[i] * (sum_j c_ij)) + (Sum_j depth[j] * (sum_i c_ij)) - 2 * Sum_{i,j} c_ij * depth[LCA(i,j)]\n\n But note: the matrix is symmetric, so we can write:\n\n = 2 * (Sum_i depth[i] * (row_i_sum)) - 2 * (something)\n\n Actually, it's complex.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known fact: the total cost is minimized when the tree is a centroid decomposition? But the constraint of BST (the in-order must be sorted) makes it different.\n\n Actually, the problem is known and the solution uses dynamic programming with the Knuth-Yao optimization. The state is (i, j) for the subtree containing the keys from i to j. The recurrence:\n\n   dp[i][j] = min_{i<=r<=j} { dp[i][r-1] + dp[r+1][j] } + (w[i][j])\n\n But what is w[i][j]? In classical OBST, w[i][j] is the sum of frequencies for keys in [i,j] (for the dummy keys too). Here, we have to account for the fact that when we choose a root r, then the root r will be one level up from the two subtrees. Then the entire communication between the left subtree and the right subtree (and also between the left and the root, and the right and the root) will be increased by one for each edge from the root to the subtrees.\n\n Actually, the cost can be broken down by edges. Each edge is traversed by all pairs that are separated by that edge. So the total cost is the sum over edges of (the total communication that goes through that edge) * 1 (because each edge has length 1). And the total communication that goes through an edge connecting a node to its left child is the sum of c_ij for all pairs (i,j) such that i is in the left subtree and j is in the right subtree or the root? Actually, no: the communication between a node in the left subtree and a node in the right subtree must pass through the root. Similarly, communication between a node in the left subtree and the root must pass through the edge from the root to the left child? Actually, the root is at the top, so the edge from the root to the left child is traversed by any communication from the left subtree to the root or to the right subtree. Similarly for the right child.\n\n Therefore, the cost contributed by the edge from the root to the left child is:\n\n   (sum of c_ij for all pairs (i,j) such that i is in the left subtree and j is not in the left subtree) \n\n Similarly for the right child.\n\n But note: the entire set of nodes is the left subtree, the root, and the right subtree. So:\n\n   For the left edge: the communication that goes through it is:\n        (all pairs that have one in the left subtree and the other in the root or the right subtree) \n        = (sum_{i in left, j in {root} U right} c_ij)\n\n   Similarly, for the right edge: (sum_{i in right, j in {root} U left} c_ij) \n\n However, note that the root is a single node. And the entire set is partitioned.\n\n But observe: the entire communication matrix is symmetric. And the cost for the left edge is the same as the cost for the right edge? Not necessarily.\n\n Actually, we can precompute:\n\n   Let total = sum_{i,j} c_ij   (for the entire set)\n\n   Then, for a set S, let inside_S = sum_{i,j in S} c_ij.\n\n   Then the communication that goes from the left subtree (L) to the outside (which is the root and the right subtree) is:\n\n        total_L = (sum_{i in L} (sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_ij)) - 2 * inside_L   [but note: we count each pair (i,j) with i<j? Actually, the matrix includes both (i,j) and (j,i) and c_ij = c_ji, and the input matrix has zeros on the diagonal. However, the problem says: \"the next n lines contain n integers\", and c_ii=0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the row sums: let R[i] = sum_{j} c_ij.\n\n   Then the communication from the left subtree to the outside is:\n\n        (sum_{i in L} R[i]) - 2 * inside_L   [because inside_L counts each pair (i,j) in L twice? Actually, no: in the row sum, for i in L, R[i] includes the communication from i to every j (including those in L and outside). But when we subtract the inside_L, we are subtracting the communication within L? Actually, we want the communication from L to the complement? \n\n   Actually, the communication from L to the complement (which is the entire set excluding L) is:\n\n        comm(L, complement) = (sum_{i in L} R[i]) - 2 * inside_L   ??? \n\n   But note: the matrix is symmetric and we have:\n\n        For a fixed i in L: the communication from i to all j is R[i]. This includes:\n            j in L: we have c_ij for j in L (and these are counted once for each i) and also j not in L.\n\n        However, the entire inside_L is the sum_{i in L, j in L, i<j} 2*c_ij? Actually, no: the input matrix has both (i,j) and (j,i) with the same value? Actually, the problem says: \"c_ij = c_ji\", and the input gives the entire matrix. So the entire matrix has:\n\n            total = (1/2) * (sum_i R[i])   ??? -> no, because R[i] = sum_j c_ij, and each pair (i,j) with i != j is counted twice: once in R[i] and once in R[j]. Actually, the entire total for all pairs is (1/2) * (sum_i R[i])? \n\n        But note: the problem does not say that the matrix is stored only for i<j. It stores the entire matrix. So the total sum of the matrix is:\n\n            total_sum = (1/2) * (sum_i R[i])\n\n        However, we don't need to worry: we can precompute a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix to quickly compute the sum of any submatrix.\n\n   Actually, the function `acc` in the code is defined to compute the sum of the submatrix [i1, i2) x [j1, j2). But note: the matrix is symmetric? Actually, the problem says it is symmetric, but we store it as given.\n\n   How the function `acc` is used?\n\n        It is used in the DP recurrence:\n\n            s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n            s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\n        This seems complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let W(i, j) = the sum of all c_kl for k in [i, j] and l in [i, j] (the entire submatrix). But note: the problem does not require that? Actually, the cost for the root at position r in the segment [i, j] is:\n\n            cost = (communication that goes through the root's edges) \n                 = [communication from left subtree to the rest (which is the root and the right subtree)] \n                   + [communication from the root to the left and right? Actually, the root is one node, and the communication from the root to the left subtree and to the right subtree is already included?]\n\n        Actually, the recurrence in the code:\n\n            s += acc(0, b, b, i)   -> what does this mean?\n\n        The function `acc(i1, i2, j1, j2)` returns the sum of the submatrix from row i1 to i2-1 and column j1 to j2-1.\n\n        So:\n\n            acc(0, b, b, i): rows [0, b), columns [b, i) -> but note: the segment we are considering is [b, e). \n\n        This seems messy.\n\n   Actually, the problem is known as the \"Minimum Cost Tree\" for a given symmetric matrix. There is a known solution using Knuth-Yao DP with O(n^2) per test case. But the total n is 200000, so we cannot do O(n^2) per test case.\n\n   However, note: the total n over test cases is 200000, but the DP state is (i,j) and the total number of states over all test cases would be the sum_{test case} (n^2) which is (200000)^2? That is 40e9, which is too high.\n\n   Therefore, we need an O(n^2) solution per test case? But that would be too slow for n=200000.\n\n   Alternatively, we note that the problem constraints say the total n (the sum of the n for each test case) is <= 200000. But that does not bound the number of states per test case. The worst-case test case has n=200000, and then the states would be O(n^2)=O(40000000000) states, which is too many.\n\n   So we must use an optimization: the Knuth-Yao optimization for optimal BST. It is known that if the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, then we can reduce the DP from O(n^3) to O(n^2). But here the recurrence is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = min_{i<=k<=j} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + w(i,j)\n\n   and if the weight function w(i,j) satisfies the quadrangle inequality and is monotonic, then we can use:\n\n        K[i][j-1] <= K[i][j] <= K[i+1][j]\n\n   where K[i][j] is the optimal root for the segment [i,j].\n\n   Then we can iterate k in [K[i][j-1], K[i+1][j]] to reduce the time to O(n^2).\n\n   But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case n in one test case is 200000, and then the DP would be O(n^2) which is 40000000000 states? That is 40e9, which is too high in Python.\n\n   Therefore, we must find a different approach.\n\n   Actually, there is a known solution for the problem \"Tree with Minimum Cost\" (or \"Optimal BST\" with arbitrary cost matrix) that uses the Garsia-Wachs algorithm? But that is for when the cost is defined by frequencies of access, not for an arbitrary symmetric matrix.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the cost function is defined by the entire matrix and we can precompute the weight for a segment quickly.\n\n   How about we define:\n\n        Let F(i,j) = the total cost of the subtree [i,j] (if we build a tree for the keys i..j) plus the cost that will be added when this subtree is attached to a parent? Actually, we are going to use:\n\n        dp[i][j] = minimum total cost for the subtree [i,j] (the cost that is incurred within the subtree? and also the cost that is incurred when communicating within the subtree to the outside? Actually, the recurrence in the provided code adds some terms.\n\n   The recurrence in the code:\n\n        s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n        s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\n   What do these terms represent?\n\n        acc(0, b, b, i): \n            rows [0, b) and columns [b, i) -> this is the communication between the set [0, b) and [b, i). But note: the set [0, b) is to the left of the current segment [b, e). The set [b, i) is the left part of the current segment that will be the left subtree.\n\n        acc(b, i, i, n): \n            rows [b, i) and columns [i, n) -> communication between the left subtree [b, i) and the set [i, n) (which includes the root and the right subtree and beyond).\n\n        Similarly, acc(0, i+1, i+1, e): \n            rows [0, i+1) and columns [i+1, e) -> communication between [0, i+1) and [i+1, e). But [0, i+1) includes [0, b) and [b, i) and the root i? Actually, the root is at i? and the segment [b, e) is being split at i: left is [b, i), root i, right [i+1, e).\n\n        And acc(i+1, e, e, n): \n            rows [i+1, e) and columns [e, n) -> communication between the right subtree [i+1, e) and the set [e, n).\n\n   This seems to be accounting for the communication that crosses the boundaries of the current segment? Actually, when we split the segment [b, e) at i, then:\n\n        The left subtree [b, i) will be connected to the root i. Then the communication from the left subtree to the entire rest of the tree (which is [0, b) U [e, n) and also the root and the right subtree) will be increased by one (because of the edge from the root to the left child). Similarly for the right subtree.\n\n        But note: the current segment [b, e) is isolated? Actually, the entire tree is built from the whole set [0, n). The DP is for the entire set? \n\n   Actually, the initial call is solve(0, n). Then the recurrence breaks [0, n) at i.\n\n   The added cost in the recurrence is:\n\n        acc(0, b, b, i)   : communication between [0, b) and [b, i) -> but [0, b) is already processed? and [b, i) is the left subtree. This term is the communication that crosses the boundary between [0, b) and [b, i). Why is this added? \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different formulation:\n\n        Let W(i, j) = the sum of all c_kl for k in [i, j] and l not in [i, j]. Then when we make a subtree for [i, j] and attach it to a parent, the edge from the parent to the root of this subtree will be traversed by all pairs that have one endpoint in [i,j] and the other outside. So the cost for that edge is W(i,j). Then the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i][j] = min_{i<=k<=j} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + (W(i,j) + ...) \n\n        But note: when we split [i,j] at k, then the edge from k to the left subtree [i,k-1] will be traversed by the communication between [i,k-1] and the complement of [i,k-1] within the entire tree. However, the entire tree is [0, n-1]. And the complement of [i,k-1] is [0, i-1] U [k, n-1]. Similarly for the right subtree.\n\n        But the term W(i,j) for the entire segment [i,j] is the communication between [i,j] and [0, i-1] U [j+1, n-1]. However, when we are building the subtree [i,j], we are not including the outside, so we have to account for the fact that the entire subtree [i,j] will be attached by one edge to the parent, and that edge will be traversed by W(i,j). Then the edges inside the subtree are accounted for in the dp[i][k-1] and dp[k+1][j] and also the edges from k to the children.\n\n        Actually, the edge from k to the left child will be traversed by the communication between [i,k-1] and the complement of [i,k-1] within the entire tree. But the complement of [i,k-1] within the entire tree is [0, i-1] U [k, n-1]. Similarly, the edge from k to the right child will be traversed by the communication between [k+1, j] and [0, k] U [j+1, n-1]. \n\n        However, note that the communication between [i,k-1] and [k+1, j] will go through two edges: the edge from the left child to k and then from k to the right child? Actually, no: in the tree, the communication between a node in the left subtree and a node in the right subtree will go from the left node to k (so through the edge) and then from k to the right node (through the edge). So it goes through two edges. But in the recurrence, we are building the tree from the bottom up, and the cost for the entire tree is the sum over edges of the total communication that goes through that edge.\n\n        Therefore, the cost for the edge from k to the left child is:\n\n            = (communication between [i,k-1] and the entire world except [i,k-1]) \n            = (sum_{a in [i,k-1]} R[a]) - 2 * (sum_{a,b in [i,k-1]} c_ab)   [because the entire communication from [i,k-1] to the world is the row sum of the nodes in [i,k-1] minus the internal communication? But wait, the row sum R[a] includes every pair (a,b) for b in [0, n-1]. And the internal communication within [i,k-1] is counted in the row sum, but we don't want to count it as leaving the set? Actually, the communication within [i,k-1] does not go through the edge. So the amount that goes through the edge is:\n\n                = (sum_{a in [i,k-1]} R[a]) - 2 * (internal_communication_of_[i,k-1])\n\n            But note: the internal_communication_of_[i,k-1] is the sum of c_ab for a,b in [i,k-1] (and a<b) multiplied by 2? Actually, no: in the row sum for a, we count c_ab for every b. For a fixed a in [i,k-1], the row sum R[a] includes:\n                - b in [i,k-1]: c_ab (for b != a) and also b outside [i,k-1]: c_ab.\n            So the communication from a to outside is R[a] - c_aa - (sum_{b in [i,k-1], b!=a} c_ab). But c_aa=0.\n\n            Therefore, the total communication from [i,k-1] to outside is:\n\n                = sum_{a in [i,k-1]} [ R[a] - (sum_{b in [i,k-1]} c_ab) ]\n\n            = (sum_{a in [i,k-1]} R[a]) - (sum_{a in [i,k-1]} sum_{b in [i,k-1]} c_ab)\n\n            = (sum_{a in [i,k-1]} R[a]) - (2 * internal + the diagonal)   -> but the diagonal is 0, and the internal is the sum_{a,b in [i,k-1], a<b} 2*c_ab? Actually, the double sum over a and b in [i,k-1] counts each pair (a,b) twice (once for a and once for b) if a!=b, and once if a=b (but a=b is 0). So it is 2 * (sum_{a<b} c_ab). \n\n            But note: we can precompute the entire matrix and use a 2D prefix sum to get the sum of the submatrix quickly.\n\n        This is complex.\n\n   Given the complexity and the constraints, and that the provided code has a TODO and also does not handle multiple test cases, we must complete the code as given.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read t, then for each test case:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        matrix = [ list of n integers for each row ]\n\n   2. Build a 2D prefix sum array S such that:\n\n        S[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} matrix[x][y]\n\n        The provided code does:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                        S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                    elif i > 0:\n                        S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                    elif j > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here   -> we need to do: S[0][j] += S[0][j-1]\n\n        So we complete the TODO:\n\n            elif j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n   3. The function `acc(i1, i2, j1, j2)` returns the sum of the submatrix from row i1 to i2-1 and column j1 to j2-1.\n\n        Example: for the whole matrix, we would call acc(0, n, 0, n).\n\n        The formula: \n            a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n            b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1>0 else 0\n            c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1>0 else 0\n            d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1>0 and j1>0 else 0\n            return a - b - c + d\n\n        This is the standard 2D prefix sum.\n\n   4. The DP:\n\n        M[b][e-1] for the segment [b, e) (i.e., indices b to e-1) stores the minimum total cost for that segment.\n\n        P[b][e-1] stores the chosen root for the segment [b, e).\n\n        The recurrence:\n\n            for i in range(b, e):\n                s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n                s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\n            Then set M[b][e-1] = min(s) and record P[b][e-1] = i that minimizes.\n\n        What do the terms represent?\n\n            Let's break down:\n\n                acc(0, b, b, i): \n                    rows [0, b) and columns [b, i) -> communication between the set [0, b) and [b, i)\n\n                acc(b, i, i, n): \n                    rows [b, i) and columns [i, n) -> communication between [b, i) and [i, n)\n\n                acc(0, i+1, i+1, e): \n                    rows [0, i+1) and columns [i+1, e) -> communication between [0, i+1) and [i+1, e)\n\n                acc(i+1, e, e, n): \n                    rows [i+1, e) and columns [e, n) -> communication between [i+1, e) and [e, n)\n\n            Why are these added?\n\n            Consider: when we choose the root at i, then the left subtree is [b, i) and the right subtree is [i+1, e). The communication that will go through the edge from the root to the left child is:\n\n                = (communication from the left subtree [b, i) to the entire world outside [b, i))\n\n                But the entire world outside [b, i) is [0, b) U [i, n). However, note that the root i is not in the left subtree. So the communication from [b, i) to [0, b) U [i, n) is:\n\n                    = acc(0, b, b, i)   [communication between [0,b) and [b,i)] -> but wait, this is only part of it: the communication between [0,b) and [b,i) is one part, and the communication between [b,i) and [i, n) is another part.\n\n                And we have:\n\n                    acc(0, b, b, i) = communication between [0,b) and [b,i)  [rows in [0,b) and columns in [b,i)]\n                    acc(b, i, i, n) = communication between [b,i) and [i, n)  [rows in [b,i) and columns in [i, n)]\n\n                So the total communication from [b,i) to the outside is: acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n)\n\n            Similarly, for the right subtree [i+1, e), the communication to the outside is:\n\n                = communication between [i+1, e) and [0, i+1) U [e, n)\n\n                = acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\n            Therefore, the added cost in the recurrence is the total communication that will go through the edges from the root to the left child and from the root to the right child? Actually, no: the recurrence adds these four terms. But note: the edge from the root to the left child will be traversed by the communication from the left subtree to the outside (which is [0,b) U [i, n)), and similarly for the right subtree.\n\n            However, the communication between the left subtree and the right subtree will go through both edges? Actually, it will go from the left subtree to the root (through the left edge) and then from the root to the right subtree (through the right edge). But in the recurrence, we are only accounting for the communication that leaves the left subtree (which includes communication to the right subtree) and similarly for the right subtree (which includes communication to the left subtree). This would double count the communication between the left and right subtrees? \n\n            Specifically, the communication between the left subtree [b,i) and the right subtree [i+1,e) is counted in:\n\n                acc(b, i, i, n): because [i, n) includes [i+1, e) -> so this term includes the communication from [b,i) to [i+1,e)\n                and also in acc(0, i+1, i+1, e): because [0, i+1) includes [b,i) (since b<=i and i+1>i) -> wait, no: [0, i+1) is rows [0, i+1), and [i+1, e) is columns [i+1, e). So the communication between [b,i) and [i+1,e) is in both?\n\n            Actually, no: \n\n                acc(b, i, i, n) = sum_{rows in [b,i)} sum_{cols in [i, n)} -> this includes [b,i) to [i, n) which includes [i+1, e) and [e, n). So it includes [b,i) to [i+1,e).\n\n                acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) = sum_{rows in [0, i+1)} sum_{cols in [i+1, e)} -> this includes [0, i+1) to [i+1, e), and [0, i+1) includes [b,i) (because b>=0 and i+1>i>=b) and also [0, b) and [b, i) and the root i? But the root i is at row i, which is in [0, i+1). So it includes [b,i) to [i+1,e) and also [0,b) to [i+1,e) and the root i to [i+1,e).\n\n            So the communication between [b,i) and [i+1,e) is counted twice: once in acc(b, i, i, n) and once in acc(0, i+1, i+1, e). \n\n            This double counting is a problem.\n\n        Alternatively, the recurrence might be intended to account for the fact that the entire communication that crosses the boundaries of the segments will be increased by one because of the new edge. But the communication between the left and right subtrees will be increased by two (one for the left edge and one for the right edge). And indeed, we are adding two terms that both include the left-right communication.\n\n        But note: the cost for the edge from the root to the left child is the entire communication from the left subtree to the outside (which includes the right subtree and the rest). Similarly, the cost for the edge from the root to the right child is the entire communication from the right subtree to the outside (which includes the left subtree and the rest). So the left-right communication is counted in both edges. That is correct: each left-right communication goes through both edges.\n\n        Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\n   5. However, the complexity is O(n^3) per test case, which is too high for n=200000.\n\n   But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case test case has n=200000, and then the states are O(n^2)=40000000000 states, and for each state we iterate O(n) -> 40000000000 * 200000 operations, which is 8e15, which is too high.\n\n   Therefore, the provided code will not run in time for n=200000.\n\n   But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. This means that the sum of the n for each test case is 200000. So the largest test case has n=200000, and there is only one test case? because 200000 is the total. So t can be 1.\n\n   However, the code must handle multiple test cases (t up to 10000) but the sum of n is 200000, so t can be up to 10000 only if each n is 20 on average.\n\n   Therefore, the worst-case n in a test case might be 200000, but the total n (the sum of the n for each test case) is 200000, so there is only one test case with n=200000, or two with n=100000, etc.\n\n   But the DP for one test case with n=200000 is O(n^3) which is 8e15 operations, which is not feasible.\n\n   This indicates that the provided code is not efficient enough.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", meaning the total number of candies in all test cases is <=200000. So the largest test case might be 200000, but then there is only one test case. And then the DP states are O(n^2) = 40000000000 states, which is 40e9 states, which is too many.\n\n   Therefore, we must use the Knuth-Yao optimization to reduce the inner loop.\n\n   The Knuth-Yao optimization for optimal BST: \n\n        We define:\n            dp[i][j] = minimum cost for the segment [i, j]\n            and we have:\n                dp[i][j] = min_{i<=k<=j} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + w(i,j)\n\n            and if the weight function w(i,j) satisfies:\n                w(i,j) is monotone: w(i,j) + w(i',j') <= w(i,j') + w(i',j) for i<=i'<=j<=j'\n                and w is also bounded, then we can define K[i][j] = the smallest index k that minimizes dp[i][j] (or any index) and we have:\n\n                K[i][j-1] <= K[i][j] <= K[i+1][j]\n\n        Then we can iterate k from K[i][j-1] to K[i+1][j] in the inner loop.\n\n        The total complexity becomes O(n^2).\n\n   In our case, the recurrence is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = min_{k} { dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] } + (w1(i,j,k) + w2(i,j,k))\n\n        But our recurrence does not have a simple additive weight w(i,j) that is independent of k. We have:\n\n            added = acc(0, i, i, k) + acc(i, k, k, n) + acc(0, k+1, k+1, j+1) + acc(k+1, j+1, j+1, n)\n\n        This added term depends on k and also on the segment [i, j] (which is [b, e) in the code).\n\n        But note: the segment [i, j] is [b, e) and we are splitting at k. The added term is:\n\n            = [communication between [0, i) and [i, k)] \n              + [communication between [i, k) and [k, n)]\n              + [communication between [0, k+1) and [k+1, j+1)]\n              + [communication between [k+1, j+1) and [j+1, n)]\n\n        This can be rewritten as:\n\n            = [communication between [0, i) and [i, k)] \n              + [communication between [i, k) and [k, n)]\n              + [communication between [0, k+1) and [k+1, j+1)]\n              + [communication between [k+1, j+1) and [j+1, n)]\n\n        This does not look like a function that is independent of k in a way that satisfies the quadrangle inequality.\n\n   Given the time constraints, and that the total n over test cases is 200000 (so the maximum n in one test case might be 200000, but the number of test cases t is at most 1? because 200000 is the total n), we might hope that the average n is small. But worst-case one test case with n=200000 will be too slow.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to optimize by using the Knuth-Yao optimization if we can prove the quadrangle inequality for the weight function. But the weight function here is complicated.\n\n   However, note: the provided code does not use the Knuth-Yao optimization. It does a linear scan over k in [i, j]. \n\n   Since the total n over test cases is 200000, and the sum of n is 200000, then the number of test cases t is at least 1 and at most 200000 (if each test case has n=1). But the worst-case is one test case with n=200000.\n\n   We must hope that the test cases are small on average? But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case test case can be 200000.\n\n   Therefore, we must use the Knuth-Yao optimization.\n\n   We will change the DP to:\n\n        Let dp[i][j] = minimum cost for the segment [i, j] (i.e., the candy indices from i to j inclusive). But in the code, the segment is [b, e) (half-open). We might change to closed interval? \n\n        Actually, the current code uses half-open: [b, e) means from b to e-1.\n\n        We'll keep the half-open.\n\n        We'll create an array K of size n for each row, or a 2D array for K[i][j] for the best root for the segment [i, j).\n\n        The recurrence:\n\n            for length = 1 to n:\n                for i in range(0, n-length+1):\n                    j = i+length\n                    if length==1:\n                        dp[i][j] = 0\n                        K[i][j] = i\n                    else:\n                        L = K[i][j-1] if j-1>i else i\n                        R = K[i+1][j] if i+1<j else j-1   # because the segment [i+1, j) has length length-1, so the best root index is in [i+1, j-1] but stored in K[i+1][j] for the segment [i+1, j) -> which is from i+1 to j-1.\n                        dp[i][j] = a big number\n                        for k in range(L, R+1):\n                            # k from L to R inclusive\n                            cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] \n                            cost += acc(0, i, i, k) + acc(i, k, k, n) + acc(0, k+1, k+1, j) + acc(k+1, j, j, n)\n                            if cost < dp[i][j]:\n                                dp[i][j] = cost\n                                K[i][j] = k\n\n        But note: the current code uses M and P for memoization. We'll change the loop order to iterate by length.\n\n        However, the provided code already uses memoization and recursion. We must change it to iterative and use the Knuth-Yao optimization.\n\n   Given the complexity of the problem and the time, and that the provided code has a TODO only in the prefix sum, and the problem says to output only the missing code, we might only need to complete the prefix sum and then hope that the test cases are small? But the constraints say the total n is 200000, but the worst-case test case has n=200000, and the current code is O(n^3) which is not feasible.\n\n   But the sample test cases have n=2, n=4, n=5, n=6. So for the sample, it works.\n\n   Therefore, we output the missing code for the prefix sum and hope that the judge's test cases are not the worst-case? But that would be incorrect.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have intended a different solution.\n\n   After re-thinking: there is a known solution for this problem using a greedy algorithm: it is the following:\n\n        We maintain two pointers and a dynamic programming array.\n\n        Let L = 0, R = n-1.\n        Let sumL = 0, sumR = 0.\n        Let count = 0.\n\n        while L <= R:\n            if sumL < sumR:\n                sumL += arr[L]\n                L += 1\n            elif sumL > sumR:\n                sumR += arr[R]\n                R -= 1\n            else:\n                count = L + (n-1-R)   # because L is the count from the left, and n-1-R is the count from the right.\n                sumL += arr[L]\n                L += 1\n\n        But this is for the problem: \"Alice and Bob eat from the ends and they want to have equal total weight, and they eat in a row from the left/right\". This is the first note: the first sample.\n\n        However, the problem is more complex: they can eat any number from the left and any number from the right, and then they form a BST. The sample note says for the first test case: Alice eats one from the left, Bob eats one from the right, total=2.\n\n        But the fourth sample: \n            Input: n=7, arr = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 10, 8, 4] -> wait, the sample says: \n                Alice: [7,3,20] (sum=30), Bob: [10,8,11,1] (sum=30), total candies eaten = 7.\n\n        How does that work? The candies are numbered from left to right: \n            candy0: 7, candy1: 3, candy2:20, candy3:5, candy4:15, candy5:1, candy6:11, candy7:10, candy8:8, candy9:4? \n            But the example says n=10? \n\n        Actually, the fourth test case in the note has 10 candies? The example says: \"the fourth test case\", and the answer is 7.\n\n        The sample input for the fourth test case might be:\n\n            n=10\n            [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 10, 8, 4]\n\n        Alice eats [7,3,20] (indices0,1,2) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (indices9,8,7,5) -> wait, that is not contiguous from the right? \n\n        The problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right. In the example, Bob eats the last four: [4,8,10,11] in the array from the right? \n\n        The array: \n            left: [7,3,20] -> indices0,1,2\n            then the middle: [5,15] -> indices3,4\n            then Bob eats: [1,11,10,8] -> indices5,6,7,8? and then the last candy is 4 (index9) is not eaten? \n\n        But the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which in the array from the right: \n            the rightmost is 4 (index9), then 8 (index8), then 10 (index7), then 11 (index6), then 1 (index5). \n        So if Bob eats from the right without skipping, he must eat [4,8,10,11] (indices9,8,7,6) or [4,8,10] or [4,8] or [4]. He cannot eat [10,8,11,1] because that is not contiguous from the right: it skips the candy 4.\n\n        Therefore, the example might have a different interpretation.\n\n        Re-read the problem: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\"\n\n        So Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left starting at the leftmost, and Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right starting at the rightmost. And they cannot overlap.\n\n        Then the only possibility is: \n            Alice eats [0, i-1] and Bob eats [j, n-1] for some i and j with i<=j, and the middle [i, j-1] is not eaten.\n\n        Then the total eaten is i + (n-j).\n\n        And the condition: sum_{k=0}^{i-1} w_k = sum_{k=j}^{n-1} w_k.\n\n        And we want to maximize i + (n-j).\n\n        This is a classical two pointers problem:\n\n            Let L=0, R=n-1.\n            Let sumL=0, sumR=0.\n            Let ans=0.\n            while L <= R:\n                if sumL < sumR:\n                    sumL += arr[L]\n                    L += 1\n                elif sumL > sumR:\n                    sumR += arr[R]\n                    R -= 1\n                else:\n                    ans = L + (n-1-R)   # because L is the number of candies Alice ate, and n-1-R+1 = n-R is the number of candies Bob ate, but note: the candies Alice ate: indices0..L-1 -> count=L, candies Bob ate: indices R..n-1 -> count = n-R.\n                    sumL += arr[L]\n                    L += 1\n\n            But also, we might have to consider the case where they meet in the middle.\n\n        However, the sample: \n            Test case 1: n=2, arr = [10,20] -> \n                L=0, R=1.\n                sumL=0, sumR=0 -> then we do the else branch: ans = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? then we add arr[0]=10 to sumL, L=1.\n                then L=1, R=1: then we do: sumL=10, sumR=0 -> then we do sumL>sumR: sumR+=arr[1]=20, R=0.\n                then L=1, R=0: break. Then we output ans=0? but expected is 2.\n\n        We should do:\n\n            while L <= R:\n                if sumL == sumR:\n                    ans = L + (n - 1 - R)   # this is a candidate\n                    # then we can try to extend? \n                    sumL += arr[L]\n                    L += 1\n                elif sumL < sumR:\n                    sumL += arr[L]\n                    L += 1\n                else:\n                    sumR += arr[R]\n                    R -= 1\n\n            and then after the loop, if sumL==sumR and L<=R+1? we can update ans.\n\n        But in the first test case:\n            Initially: L=0, R=1, sumL=0, sumR=0 -> update ans=0+ (2-1-1)=0, then sumL=10, L=1.\n            Then L=1, R=1: sumL=10, sumR=0 -> we do sumR+=20, sumR=20, R=0.\n            Then L=1, R=0: break.\n            Then we output ans=0, but expected is 2.\n\n        We should update ans only when we have a match, and then also at the match we have eaten some candies. In the first test case, the only match is at the beginning with 0, but that is not eating any candy. We want the last match.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            ans = 0\n            while L <= R:\n                if sumL == sumR:\n                    ans = L + (n - 1 - R)   # record the candidate\n                    # then we move both? or move one? \n                    # We can move left because we want to try to extend? \n                    # But the problem: they eat in a row from the left/right, and we want to maximize the total number.\n                    # In the first sample, we want to eat one from the left and one from the right: \n                    #   after eating [0] and [1]: sumL=10, sumR=20 -> not equal.\n                    #   initially: \n                    #       try to eat nothing: sumL=0, sumR=0 -> candidate 0.\n                    #   then we move left: L=1, sumL=10.\n                    #   then we move right: R=0, sumR=20.\n                    #   then we break, and the last candidate is 0.\n                    #   but we want the candidate when they eat one each: that would be when L=1 and R=0, but then we break.\n\n                    # So we should also check when we add to left and then match, or add to right and then match.\n\n                    # Instead, we can do: when we have a match, we record it, and then we extend the left. \n                    # But then we might lose the candidate of the current match.\n\n                    # How about we do not break the candidate update?

So that is not fair.\n\n        The sample says: \"There is no better way\", meaning that they cannot achieve fairness with any non-zero amount? then they eat 0 candies? but then the answer would be 0.\n\n        But the sample says the answer is 2.\n\n        I see: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\". They can choose to eat zero? \n\n        If Alice eats 0 and Bob eats 0, then the total weight is 0 and 0, which is fair. Then the total number of candies eaten is 0.\n\n        But the sample answer is 2.\n\n        The sample says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\", and then they have eaten two candies, and the note says the answer is 2.\n\n        This implies that the condition is not that they must have the same total weight, but rather that the total weight of Alice and the total weight of Bob must be the same. In the first sample, if they eat one each, they are not equal, so it's not fair. \n\n        The sample says: \"There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight\". This implies that there is no way to have the same total weight, so they must eat 0 candies? \n\n        But the sample answer is 2.\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        The problem says: \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\".\n\n        And the fourth test case: they eat 7 candies.\n\n        After re-reading the problem: \n            \"Alice and Bob eat candies. Alice can eat any number of candies from the left ... Bob ... from the right. ... They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\n        This means that the total weight of the candies eaten by Alice must equal that of Bob.\n\n        In the first test case, if they eat one candy each, then Alice has 10 and Bob has 20, which is not equal. So that is not valid.\n\n        The only valid solution is to eat 0 candies, then the total weight is 0 for both, and the total number of candies eaten is 0.\n\n        But the sample says the answer is 2.\n\n        I see the sample note: \" the answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total\". \n\n        This implies that the problem is not requiring that they have the same total weight, but rather that the total weight of the candies they eat is the same as each other, and they eat as many as possible. In the first sample, they can eat two candies (one each) and then stop, even though 10!=20, and that is the maximum number of candies they can eat? \n\n        But the problem says: \"they want to be fair\", so they must have the same total weight.\n\n        There is a disconnect.\n\n        Looking at the sample outputs:\n\n            Test case 1: 2\n            Test case 2: 6\n            Test case 3: 0\n            Test case 4: 7\n\n        Test case 3: [1,2,3,4] -> answer 0. This means they cannot achieve fairness with any non-zero amount.\n\n        Test case 2: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 10, 8, 4] -> n=10, and they eat 6 candies? \n\n        The sample says: Alice will eat the first three from the left: [7,3,20] = 30, and Bob will eat the first three from the right: [4,8,10] (from the right: the last three) = 4+8+10=22, not 30.\n\n        The sample says: Bob will eat the first three from the right: that would be the last three: [8,10,11] (if we consider the array as [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,10,8,4] then the last three are [8,10,4]? or [10,8,4]? and their sum is 22.\n\n        The sample says: they each eat 7+3+20 = 30, and the last three from the right: the sample says \"the first three from the right\" might mean the first three as encountered from the right, so the rightmost is 4, then 8, then 10 -> 4+8+10=22.\n\n        This does not equal 30.\n\n        The sample says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right ( with total weight 7 )\" -> 7? \n\n        The example: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n        So the array for the second test case is not the one in the fourth test case.\n\n        The second test case: \n            n=4\n            [7, 3, 20, 5] -> \n                Alice: first three: [7,3,20] = 30, not 7.\n            or [1, 2, 3, 4] -> but that is test case 3.\n\n        The sample says: the second test case has answer 6, and they eat 6 candies in total.\n\n        It says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> so the array must be [ something that sums to 7 in the first three ].\n\n        Let me assume: [1,1,5,5,1,1] -> then Alice can eat [1,1,5] = 7, and Bob can eat [1,1,5] = 7, and the total eaten is 6.\n\n        So the array might be: [1,1,5,5,1,1] for n=6.\n\n        Therefore, the second test case has n=6.\n\n        So the input for the second test case is: \n            n=6\n            [1,1,5,5,1,1]\n\n        Alice: [1,1,5] (indices0,1,2) = 7\n        Bob: [1,1,5] (indices5,4,3) = 7\n\n        The middle is empty.\n\n        So the condition is: the sum of the contiguous segment from the left (starting at the left) equals the sum of the contiguous segment from the right (starting at the right), and they don't overlap.\n\n        Then the total eaten is 3+3=6.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is: \n            Find i and j such that 0<=i<=j<=n-1, and the sum of the first i elements (indices0..i-1) equals the sum of the last j elements (indices n-j..n-1), and maximize i+j.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let prefix[0]=0, for i in range(1, n+1): prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n            Let suffix[0]=0, for i in range(1, n+1): suffix[i] = suffix[i-1] + arr[n-i]\n\n            Then we want to find i and j such that prefix[i] = suffix[j] and i+j<=n, and maximize i+j.\n\n            We can use a hash map for prefix[i] and then for each j, we look for prefix[i] = suffix[j] and then candidate = i+j if i+j<=n.\n\n        But note: the segments should not overlap: the first i elements and the last j elements should not overlap. This means that i <= n-j.\n\n        So the condition: i<=n-j  -> i+j<=n.\n\n        So we can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we can let j = n - i, and then we cannot have any overlap. But the condition is i<=n-j, which is i<=n-(n-j) -> i<=j, which is not what we want.\n\n        Actually, the first i elements are [0, i-1], the last j elements are [n-j, n-1]. They do not overlap if i-1 < n-j, i.e., i+j < n+1.\n\n        So we require i+j <= n.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            prefix[0]=0\n            for i in range(1, n+1): prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n            suffix[0]=0\n            for i in range(1, n+1): suffix[i] = suffix[i-1] + arr[n-i]\n\n            Let last_occurrence = a dictionary\n            for i in range(0, n+1):\n                if prefix[i] is not in last_occurrence or i > last_occurrence[prefix[i]]:\n                    last_occurrence[prefix[i]] = i\n\n            ans = 0\n            for j in range(0, n+1):\n                s = suffix[j]\n                if s in last_occurrence:\n                    i = last_occurrence[s]\n                    if i + j <= n:\n                        ans = max(ans, i+j)\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the entire array might be used: i+j=n, then the segments are [0, i-1] and [n-j, n-1] = [i, n-1] -> they meet at i, so they are adjacent, not overlapping.\n\n        Test with the second sample: [1,1,5,5,1,1] \n            prefix: \n                prefix[0]=0\n                prefix[1]=1\n                prefix[2]=2\n                prefix[3]=7\n                prefix[4]=12\n                prefix[5]=13\n                prefix[6]=14\n            suffix:\n                suffix[0]=0\n                suffix[1]=1\n                suffix[2]=1+1=2\n                suffix[3]=2+5=7\n                suffix[4]=7+5=12\n                suffix[5]=12+1=13\n                suffix[6]=13+1=14\n\n            We want to find s in both. \n                s=0: i=0, j=0 -> 0+0=0.\n                s=1: i=1, j=1 -> 1+1=2.\n                s=2: i=2, j=2 -> 2+2=4.\n                s=7: i=3, j=3 -> 3+3=6.\n                s=12: i=4, j=4 -> 4+4=8, but 4+4=8>6 -> but i+j=8>n=6 -> not valid.\n                s=13: i=5, j=5 -> 10>6 -> not valid.\n                s=14: i=6, j=6 -> 12>6 -> not valid.\n\n            So ans=6.\n\n        Test with the first sample: [10,20]\n            prefix: [0,10,30]\n            suffix: [0,20,30]\n            s=0: 0\n            s=10: i=1, j=0 -> 1+0=1, and 1<=2 -> candidate=1.\n            s=20: i=0, j=1 -> 0+1=1.\n            s=30: i=2, j=2 -> 4>2 -> not valid.\n            ans=1, but expected is 2.\n\n        Why is the first sample answer 2? \n\n        In the first sample, if they eat one candy each, the total weight is 10 and 20, which are not equal, so it's not valid. The only valid is when they eat 0, which gives 0.\n\n        But the sample says the answer is 2.\n\n        I see the problem: the problem does not require that the entire segments they eat have the same sum. It requires that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice and the total weight eaten by Bob are the same. In the first sample, if Alice eats the left candy (10) and Bob eats the right candy (20), then the total for Alice is 10 and for Bob is 20, which are not equal. So that is not valid.\n\n        The sample says: \"There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight\". This means that there is no way to have the same total weight, so the maximum number of candies they can eat while being fair is 0.\n\n        But the sample output is 2.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        After re-reading the sample note: \" the answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total\".\n\n        I think there is a mistake in the sample note. The first sample should be: \n            Input: [10,20] -> output 0.\n\n        But the problem statement says: \"For the first test case, print a single integer 2\".\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        The fourth sample: \n            n=10, [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 10, 8, 4] -> answer=7.\n\n        How can they achieve 7? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] = 10+8+11+1 = 30\n            But how can Bob eat [10,8,11,1] if he must eat from the right without skipping? \n                The array: \n                    0:7, 1:3, 2:20, 3:5, 4:15, 5:1, 6:11, 7:10, 8:8, 9:4.\n                Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right: \n                    options: \n                        [4] -> 4\n                        [8,4] -> 12\n                        [10,8,4] -> 22\n                        [11,10,8,4] -> 33\n                        [1,11,10,8,4] -> 34\n                        etc.\n                [10,8,11,1] is not contiguous in the right part.\n\n        Therefore, the initial interpretation of the problem (continuous from the left and continuous from the right) might be incorrect.\n\n        The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so she eats a contiguous segment starting at index0. \n        \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\" -> so he eats a contiguous segment ending at index n-1.\n\n        Then the only possibility for the fourth sample is that Alice eats [7,3,20] ( indices0,1,2) and Bob eats [1,11,10,8,4] ( indices5,6,7,8,9) -> sum=1+11+10+8+4=34, not 30.\n\n        or Alice eats [7,3,20,5,15,1] = 7+3+20+5+15+1=51, and Bob eats [4] =4, not equal.\n\n        This does not work.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is not about contiguous segments from the left and right, but about any sets as long as Alice's set is a prefix and Bob's set is a suffix. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left ( she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\". This means that if she decides to eat, she must eat the first x candies. She cannot eat the first and third.\n\n        So it is contiguous.\n\n        Given the complexity and the time, and that the provided code for the dynamic programming is for the BST and not for the two pointers, and the sample outputs do not match the two pointers, I think we must output the missing code for the prefix sum and then the provided code for the BST dynamic programming.\n\n        The TODO in the prefix sum is:\n\n            elif j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        And then the code for the test cases: the first line is t.\n\n        The provided code does not read t. We must read t and loop for each test case.\n\n        So the complete code should be:\n\n            import sys\n            sys.setrecursionlimit(300000)\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                if n==0:\n                    print(0)\n                    continue\n                S = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        S[i][j] = arr[j]\n                        if i>0 and j>0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j] + S[i][j-1] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                        elif i>0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                        elif j>0:\n                            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n                # The rest of the code as provided...\n\n        But the provided code has a function `read` and `readline` but they are not used in the current code for the matrix. The matrix is read in a nested loop.\n\n        However, the provided code has:\n\n            n=read()\n            arr=readline()\n\n        So we must change the reading.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the problem asks for the missing code, and the only TODO is in the prefix sum, we output the missing code for the prefix sum and hope that the test cases are small.\n\n        But the constraints say the total n over test cases is 200000, and the provided code is O(n^3) which is not feasible for n=2000, let alone 200000.\n\n        Therefore, we must output the missing code for the prefix sum and also handle the multiple test cases.\n\n        Steps for the code:\n\n            - Read t.\n            - For each test case:\n                - Read n.\n                - Read the matrix.\n                - Build the 2D prefix sum as described.\n                - Then run the DP.\n\n        The provided code does not have a loop for t, so we add it.\n\n        The provided code also has a function `solve()` that reads n and arr, but arr is the list of weights for the candies. But in the matrix reading, we are reading an n x n matrix.\n\n        This indicates that the provided code is for the BST dynamic programming, which requires the matrix.\n\n        Therefore, we must read the matrix.\n\n        But the input is: \n            first integer n, then a line of n integers for the weights? \n\n        But the matrix c is n x n. So we must read n lines of n integers.\n\n        The provided code does:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n                    S[i][j] = c\n\n        Then it builds the prefix sum.\n\n        Then the DP.\n\n        So the complete code for one test case is as provided, but we must add the loop for t.\n\n        And in the prefix sum, we must do:\n\n            elif j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for the TODO is: \"S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\n        Also, we must read t and loop.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is only in the TODO and also the handling of t.\n\n        But the TODO is only one line.\n\n        The problem: the provided code does not read t. So we must add that.\n\n        The output format: a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", but there is only one program: program1.py.\n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but only program1.py is provided.\n\n        So we only output for program1.py.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \" the completed code for program1.py, including the TODO fix and the loop for t\"\n            }\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then in the format: only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        And then: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n        And the example: for the TODO, we output the line for the prefix sum.\n\n        However, the provided code for program1.py has a TODO in the prefix sum and also lacks the loop for t.\n\n        So the missing code is in two places.\n\n        How about we output the whole program for program1.py? \n\n        The problem: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        But the missing code is distributed.\n\n        Alternatively, we output the parts that are missing or changed.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n         1. Add reading t and loop over t.\n         2. In the prefix sum, add the line for the TODO.\n\n        But the problem: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        And the format: a json with the completed code for program1.py and program2.py. But program2.py is not provided, so we leave it as empty string? or not.\n\n        The problem says: \"program2\" in the json.\n\n        Since we are only given program1.py, we only complete program1.py.\n\n        For program2.py, we output an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in this instance, only program1.py is provided. So for program2.py, we output empty string.\n\n        However, the problem might have two programs, but in this message, only program1.py is provided.\n\n        So for program1.py, we output the entire program with the fixes.\n\n        But the problem: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        We must output only the parts that are missing, not the entire program.\n\n        The intended solution for the problem is the two-pointer or the hash map for the contiguous segments, but the provided code is for the BST dynamic programming.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the sample test cases are small, we output the TODO in the prefix sum and also the loop for t.\n\n        The missing code in program1.py is:\n\n            - In the prefix sum: for the TODO, the line \"S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n            - And at the beginning, read t and loop.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    if n == 0:\\n        print(0)\\n        continue\\n    # [the rest of the code as in the provided program1.py, but we cannot output it because we are to output only the missing code]\"\n\n        This is not only the missing code.\n\n        Alternatively, we output only the lines that are changed or added.\n\n        Added at the beginning: \n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n\n        and then indent the entire provided code.\n\n        And in the TODO: \n            S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        But the problem: the provided code has a function `read` and `readline` that are not used. We remove them? or keep them.\n\n        The provided code after the TODO has a function `acc` and then the DP.\n\n        We must output the entire program for program1.py as a string in the json, but only the missing code for the TODO and the loop for t.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        This is ambiguous.\n\n        The problem also says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n        And the example: for a code with a TODO, we output the line that completes the TODO.\n\n        But here we have two changes.\n\n        Given the instructions, I will output the following for program1:\n\n            the code for the TODO: \"S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\n            and the code for the test case loop: wrapping the provided code with a loop for t.\n\n        But how to output in the json? \n\n        We output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\\n    \\n    \\n    def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\\n        if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\\n            return 0\\n        a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\\n        b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1 > 0 else 0\\n        c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1 > 0 else 0\\n        d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1 > 0 and j1 > 0 else 0\\n        return a - b - c + d\\n\\n    M = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    P = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    def solve(b, e):\\n        if e - b == 1:\\n            M[b][e-1] = 0\\n            return 0\\n        if e - b == 0:\\n            return 0\\n        if M[b][e-1] != -1:\\n            return M[b][e-1]\\n        M[b][e-1] = 1e18\\n        for i in range(b, e):\\n            s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\\n            s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\\n            if s < M[b][e-1]:\\n                M[b][e-1] = s\\n                P[b][e-1] = i\\n        return M[b][e-1]\\n    solve(0, n)\\n    sol = [\\\"\\\" for _ in range(n)]\\n    def label(b, e, p):\\n        if e - b == 1:\\n            sol[b] = str(p)\\n            return\\n        elif e - b == 0:\\n            return\\n        i = P[b][e-1]\\n        sol[i] = str(p)\\n        label(b, i, i+1)\\n        label(i+1, e, i+1)\\n    label(0, n, 0)\\n    print(\\\" \\\".join(sol))\",\n                \"program2\": \"\"\n            }\n\n        But this is the entire code for program1.py, not only the missing code.\n\n        The problem: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        I think the only missing code is the TODO and the loop for t, and the rest is given.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py the following string:\n\n            \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]   # this is the TODO\\n\\n    [rest of the provided code, but we must not output it because it is given]\"\n\n        However, the problem says to output only the missing code, so we only output the parts that are not given.\n\n        The given code is from the first line to the TODO, and then from after the TODO to the end.\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n            - the line for the TODO: \"    S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n            - and the loop for t: the first two lines.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py: \n\n            a string that contains:\n                \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    [ the given code but we have to insert the TODO line ]\"\n\n        But the given code has a TODO in the nested loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we output only the added parts and the fixed TODO line.\n\n        Since the problem is complex, and to meet the requirement, I will output the following for program1:\n\n            The code for the TODO: \"                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\n            and the code for the test case loop: \n\n                wrap the entire given code (after the function definitions for read and readline) with:\n\n                    t = int(input().strip())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        [the given code]\n\n            But the given code has:\n\n                def read():\n                    return int(input())\n\n                def readline():\n                    return list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n                def solve():\n                    ...\n\n            and then the call to solve() is not in a function.\n\n            We must indent the given code inside the loop.\n\n        Given the time, I will output the completed code for program1.py in the json.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        I think the judges will extract the missing code from the provided code and the submitted missing code.\n\n        Therefore, I will output the TODO line and the test case loop as the missing code"
