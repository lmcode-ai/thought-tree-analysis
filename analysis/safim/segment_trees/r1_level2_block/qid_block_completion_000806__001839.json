But the provided code uses 4 spaces? We can write for program2: a string that is \"\\n    y -= 1\" ? But the problem says: output the missing code. Alternatively, we can output for program2: \"y -= 1\" and then the user will put it in the body with the correct indent? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the minimal code. We decide:\n\n            program1: one line: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            program2: one line: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But for program2, we must note that the body of the while loop is one line. Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"y -= 1\"}\n\n        However, for program2, the while loop condition is already written. We are only adding the body. But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We'll output the body.

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first challenge involves maximizing the number of candies Alice and Bob can eat while ensuring their total weights are equal. The second challenge involves modifying a string formed by repeating \"BAN\" multiple times so that \"BAN\" is no longer a subsequence, using the minimum number of swaps.\n\n### Approach for Program 1: Candy Eating Problem\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Alice eats candies from the left, and Bob eats from the right. They must eat candies in contiguous segments without overlapping, and the sum of the weights of the candies each eats must be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n2. **Intuition**: We can use prefix sums from the left and suffix sums from the right. For each test case, we compute the prefix sums up to half the total weight of all candies (since the sum each person eats cannot exceed half the total weight). We store these prefix sums in a dictionary mapping each sum to the number of candies eaten.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Iterate from the left, compute cumulative sums, and store each sum (if it does not exceed half the total weight) along with the count of candies eaten.\n   - **Suffix Sum Calculation**: Iterate from the right, compute cumulative sums, and for each sum, check if it exists in the prefix dictionary. If it does, ensure the segments do not overlap (i.e., the left segment ends before the right segment starts). If valid, update the maximum number of candies eaten.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each test case in O(n) time, where n is the number of candies. Given the constraints (sum of n across test cases \u2264 200,000), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Approach for Program 2: BAN String Modification\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The string is formed by repeating \"BAN\" n times. We need to perform swaps so that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence. The goal is to find the minimal number of swaps and the swap operations.\n2. **Intuition**: By swapping the 'A's from the left with 'N's from the right, we disrupt the natural order of 'B', 'A', 'N' in the string. Each such swap ensures that no valid subsequence \"BAN\" exists.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Represent the string as a list of integers (0 for 'B', 1 for 'A', 2 for 'N').\n   - **Swapping Process**: Use two pointers starting from the left and right ends. The left pointer finds the next 'A' (1), and the right pointer finds the next 'N' (2) from the end. Swap these elements and record the swap indices. Repeat until the pointers meet.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Each test case is processed in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string (3k for k repetitions). The number of swaps is \u2308k/2\u2309, which is optimal.\n\n### Solution Code for Program 1\n```python\nif s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n```\n\n### Solution Code for Program 2\n```python\ny -= 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program 1**: The solution checks if the current suffix sum (from the right) exists in the prefix sum dictionary (from the left). If it does, it verifies that the segments do not overlap (using `d[s] + idx < n`). If valid, it updates the maximum number of candies eaten (`r`).\n- **Program 2**: The solution moves the right pointer (`y`) leftwards until it finds an 'N' (represented by 2). This ensures that each 'A' from the left is swapped with an 'N' from the right, disrupting any \"BAN\" subsequence with minimal swaps.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends. They want to have the same total weight and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n Approach:\n We are guaranteed that the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do a two-pointer or prefix/suffix sum approach.\n\n The idea:\n Let the entire array be `a`.\n We are to find the maximum k such that there exists an index i (for Alice) and an index j (for Bob) with i from 0 to some point and j from n-1 to some point (with i<j) and:\n   sum(a[0:i+1]) = sum(a[j:n])\n and then the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (n - j).\n\n However, note: they cannot overlap. So we can use two pointers.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute prefix sums and suffix sums. But note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200000.\n\n We can do:\n   Let prefix[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + w_i (for i from 0 to n-1)\n   Let suffix[j] = w_j + ... + w_{n-1} (for j from 0 to n-1)\n\n But note: we want prefix[i] = suffix[j] and we want to maximize (i+1 + n - j) = i + j + 2? Actually, if we define:\n   prefix[i] = sum of first i+1 candies (so i from 0 to n-1)\n   suffix[j] = sum of last (n - j) candies (so j from 0 to n-1, meaning from index j to n-1)\n\n Then the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (n - j). But note: we require that the candies don't overlap: i < j.\n\n However, note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. So we require that the segments [0, i] and [j, n-1] are disjoint. This implies i < j.\n\n How to do it efficiently?\n We can use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (for Alice) and one starting at the end (for Bob). We traverse the prefix and suffix.\n\n Steps for one test case:\n   Let left = 0, right = n-1\n   Let sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n   Let ans = 0\n   We can have two pointers: i from 0 to n-1 and j from n-1 down to 0, but we can do:\n\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   while i < j:\n        if sumA < sumB:\n            sumA += a[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            sumB += a[j]\n            j -= 1\n        if sumA == sumB:\n            ans = (i) + (n - j - 1)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i-1] -> i candies, Bob has eaten [j+1, n-1] -> n-1-j candies, so total = i + (n-1-j) = i + n - j - 1.\n\n   But note: the above while loop condition is i<j. However, we might break when i==j and then we haven't processed that candy? Actually, we don't want to eat the same candy.\n\n However, the above approach might not be optimal? Actually, we can do:\n\n   We traverse from the left and build a dictionary of prefix sums and the index (the number of candies eaten from the left) for which the prefix sum is achieved. But note: we only care about prefix sums that are at most half of the total? Actually, we can do:\n\n   We note that the total sum is S. Since both must be equal, the common sum cannot exceed S/2.\n\n   Alternate approach (as in the provided code snippet):\n\n   The provided code does:\n        x = sum(a) // 2   # because the common sum cannot exceed half the total\n        s, d = 0, {}\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n            s += i\n            if s > x: break\n            d[s] = idx + 1   # so d maps a prefix sum to the number of candies (which is idx+1)\n\n        Then it does:\n        s, r = 0, 0\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   # now we traverse from the right\n            s += i\n            if s in d: \n                # then we have a common sum: the prefix sum s is achieved by d[s] candies from the left, and the suffix sum s is achieved by idx+1 candies from the right.\n                # and the total candies eaten would be d[s] + (idx+1)\n                # but note: we must ensure that the segments do not overlap. \n                # How many candies have we taken from the left? d[s] -> indices [0, d[s]-1]\n                # How many from the right? idx+1 -> indices [n-1-idx, n-1]\n                # We require that d[s] - 1 < n-1-idx   => d[s] <= n-1-idx - 1? Actually, we require that the last index from the left (d[s]-1) is less than the first index from the right (n-1-idx). \n                # So condition: d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n                # Actually, the next candy after the left segment is at index d[s] (0-indexed, the left segment ends at d[s]-1) and the right segment starts at n-1-idx. We require d[s] <= n-1-idx.\n\n                # But note: the total number of candies we are taking is d[s] + (idx+1). However, if the segments overlap, then we are double counting? Actually, we are not because we break the array. But we must ensure that the two segments are disjoint.\n\n                # Since we are building the prefix from the beginning and the suffix from the end, and we are adding the suffix in reverse order (so the first element in the reversed array is the last element of the original), then the index in the original array for the suffix part: \n                #   The first candy we take from the right is at index n-1, then n-2, ... \n                #   In the reversed array, index 0 corresponds to a[n-1], index 1 corresponds to a[n-2], ... index idx corresponds to a[n-1-idx].\n                # So the right segment we have taken is the last (idx+1) candies: indices from n-1 down to n-1-idx.\n\n                # The left segment: indices 0 to d[s]-1 -> that's d[s] candies.\n\n                # The condition for non-overlap: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx   => d[s] <= n-1-idx - 1? Actually, we require that the left segment does not include any candy in the right segment. The left segment ends at index d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at n-1-idx. So we require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx, i.e., d[s] <= n-1-idx - 1? \n                # Actually, we require d[s] <= n-1-idx? Because the left segment ends at d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] <= n-1-idx.\n\n                # But note: if d[s] = n-1-idx, then the left segment ends at n-1-idx-1 and the right segment starts at n-1-idx -> no overlap.\n\n                # So condition: d[s] <= n-1-idx? Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied? Because the total prefix sum and suffix sum are both s, and the entire array sum is at least 2s (if there is overlap, then we are counting some candies twice? but we are building the prefix and suffix independently and they are disjoint?).\n\n                # However, note: we are building the prefix from the beginning and the suffix from the end. The dictionary `d` was built for the prefix without considering the suffix. Then when we build the suffix, we start from the end and go backwards. The condition for non-overlap is that the prefix part does not extend beyond the suffix part. \n\n                # How many total candies have we taken? d[s] from the left and idx+1 from the right. The condition is that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? But that is always true? However, we must have the two segments disjoint. The left segment covers [0, d[s]-1] and the right segment covers [n-1-idx, n-1]. The condition for disjointness is d[s]-1 < n-1-idx, which is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n                # But note: the entire array has n candies. We are taking d[s] from the left and idx+1 from the right. The condition for disjointness is that the left segment does not extend into the right segment. The last index of the left segment is d[s]-1 and the first index of the right segment is n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] + idx < n.\n\n                # Actually, the total number of candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). The condition for disjointness is that the two segments do not share any candy. The left segment has d[s] candies and the right segment has idx+1 candies, and if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint? Not exactly: because the left segment is at the beginning and the right segment at the end. The condition is that the left segment does not extend beyond the index where the right segment starts. Specifically, the left segment ends at index d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at index n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] + idx < n.\n\n                # Therefore, we must check: if d[s] + idx < n? But note: in the reversed array, we are at index `idx` (0-indexed) meaning we have taken idx+1 candies from the right. The original index of the last candy taken from the right is n-1-idx. The condition is: d[s] (the count of left candies) must be <= n-1-idx? Actually, the left segment ends at index d[s]-1, and we require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] <= n-1-idx.\n\n                # But note: the total number of candies we have taken is d[s] + (idx+1). The condition d[s] <= n-1-idx is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. \n\n                # However, we are building the prefix and suffix independently. The dictionary `d` was built without considering the suffix. But note: we break the prefix when the sum exceeds x (which is total_sum//2). Similarly, the suffix might also exceed? But we don't break the suffix? Actually, the suffix loop goes until the end? \n\n                # But note: if the suffix sum s is in the dictionary, then we have a common sum. However, we must check that the two segments do not overlap. \n\n                # How to relate the index in the reversed array to the original index? \n                #   The reversed array: index 0 -> original index n-1\n                #   index 1 -> n-2, ... index idx -> n-1-idx.\n\n                # The left segment: we have taken d[s] candies -> the last index is d[s]-1 (0-indexed).\n                # The right segment: we have taken idx+1 candies -> the first index of the right segment is n-1-idx (because we start at the last candy and move left).\n\n                # Condition: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx   => d[s] + idx < n.\n\n                # Therefore, we can do: \n                #   if d[s] + idx < n: then we can update r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n                # But note: the variable `idx` in the reversed loop: we are iterating with `idx` from 0 to n-1. The condition we require is that the left segment (d[s] candies) and the right segment (idx+1 candies) are disjoint. \n\n                # Actually, the total candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). But we must subtract one if they overlap? No, we are not taking any candy twice. The condition is that the two segments are disjoint. So the total candies is d[s] + (idx+1). However, we must ensure that the two segments do not overlap. \n\n                # Therefore, we update: \n                #   if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n: then we can have d[s] + (idx+1) candies? But wait: the condition for disjointness is d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n                #   d[s] + (idx+1) <= n   => d[s] <= n - (idx+1) = n-1-idx? \n                #   But note: the condition we derived was d[s] <= n-1-idx? Actually, we have:\n                #       left segment: [0, d[s]-1] -> d[s] candies -> last index is d[s]-1.\n                #       right segment: [n-1-idx, n-1] -> idx+1 candies -> first index is n-1-idx.\n                #   We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n                #   But note: if d[s] = n-1-idx, then the left segment ends at n-1-idx-1 and the right segment starts at n-1-idx -> disjoint.\n\n                #   So condition: d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n                #   But note: the total candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). And if d[s] <= n-1-idx, then d[s] + (idx+1) <= n-1-idx + (idx+1) = n.\n\n                #   Therefore, the condition d[s] <= n-1-idx is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n                #   However, we must note: the entire array has n candies. The condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary and sufficient for disjointness? Actually, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary for disjointness? But is it sufficient? \n                #   Example: n=5, d[s]=3, idx+1=3 -> total 6, which is >5 -> not disjoint? Actually, 3+3=6>5 -> not possible. But if d[s]=3 and idx+1=2, then total=5. Then the left segment is [0,2] and the right segment is [3,4] -> disjoint. \n                #   Actually, the condition for disjointness is that the left segment does not extend into the right segment: the last index of the left segment (d[s]-1) must be less than the first index of the right segment (n-1-idx). \n                #   So: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx  => d[s] + idx < n.\n\n                #   Therefore, we require: d[s] + idx < n.\n\n                #   Then the total candies is d[s] + (idx+1) = d[s] + idx + 1.\n\n                #   So we update: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n                # But note: the variable `idx` in the reversed loop: we are iterating from 0 to n-1. The suffix sum we are building is from the end. \n\n                # However, the provided code does not have the condition for disjointness? It just does:\n                #   if s in d: \n                #       then update r? \n\n                # But the problem says: \"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\" -> so we must ensure disjointness.\n\n                # Therefore, we must check that the two segments are disjoint. \n\n                # How to get the original index of the last candy in the left segment? It's d[s]-1 (0-indexed). The first candy in the right segment is at index n-1-idx (0-indexed). We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx.\n\n                # So we can do:\n                #   if d[s] - 1 < n - 1 - idx:   # which is d[s] + idx < n\n                #       r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n                # But note: the variable `idx` in the reversed loop: we are at the (idx)-th element in the reversed array, meaning we have taken idx+1 candies from the right. So the condition becomes: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the condition d[s] + idx < n is the same as d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n                #   d[s] + idx < n   <=> d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n                #   Example: d[s]=3, idx=2 -> 3+2=5 < n=6 -> then we update to 3+2+1=6? But 6<=6 -> disjoint? Actually, the condition d[s] + idx < n is 5<6 -> true, then we update to 6. But 6 is the entire array? Then the condition for disjointness: \n                #       left segment: [0,2] -> 3 candies, right segment: [3,5] -> 3 candies -> disjoint? \n                #   But note: the condition we derived was d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> 2 < 6-1-2 = 3 -> true. \n                #   However, if d[s]=3, idx=2, and n=5: then d[s]+idx=5 which is not <5 -> false. Then we skip. \n                #   But if we had d[s]=3, idx=1: then d[s]+idx=4<5 -> true, then we update to 3+1+1=5. \n                #   Then the segments: left [0,2] and right [5-1-1=3,4] -> [3,4] -> disjoint? \n                #   Condition: 2<3 -> true.\n\n                # Therefore, we update: \n                #   if d[s] + idx < n:\n                #       r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        Then print(r)\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <=200000, so building the dictionary and then iterating the suffix is O(n) per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do this.\n\n However, the provided code does not have the condition for disjointness? It just does:\n        if s in d: \n            # then update r? \n\n But we must add the condition.\n\n But note: the dictionary `d` was built for the prefix without exceeding half the total. And the suffix we are building might also be building beyond half? But we break the prefix when it exceeds x (which is total_sum//2). However, the suffix might also exceed? But we don't break the suffix? \n\n Actually, we can break the suffix when s > x? But the problem does not require that? We can do:\n\n        s, d = 0, {}\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n            s += i\n            if s > x: \n                break\n            d[s] = idx + 1   # storing the number of candies for that prefix sum\n\n        Then for the suffix, we start from the end and add until we have s in d? But we don't break? \n\n        However, if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we know that the common sum cannot exceed x, so we can break? But note: the prefix only stored sums up to x. So if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we won't find a common sum? Actually, we might: because we are building the suffix from the end and we might get a sum that is in the dictionary even if we go beyond x? But the dictionary only has sums <= x. So if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we can break? \n\n        But note: the suffix sum might be increasing and we are only interested in sums that are in the dictionary (which are <=x). So we can break when s > x? \n\n        However, the problem does not require that, but it might save time. But the total n is 200000, and the total over test cases is 200000, so we can do without.\n\n        But the provided code does not break the suffix loop. \n\n        So we complete the code in program1.py as:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: \n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        However, note: the variable `idx` in the reversed loop: we are iterating the reversed array, so the index in the reversed array is `idx` (0-indexed). The number of candies taken from the right is idx+1. But in the condition, we use `idx` (the index in the reversed array) and we require d[s] + idx < n? \n\n        Actually, the condition for disjointness is: \n            left segment: [0, d[s]-1] -> d[s] candies -> last index = d[s]-1.\n            right segment: we have taken the last (idx+1) candies -> the first index of the right segment is n-1-idx (because the last candy is at n-1, then n-2, ... until n-1-idx). \n            Condition: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx   -> d[s] + idx < n.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            if s in d: \n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the suffix sum might appear multiple times? The dictionary `d` stores the last occurrence? Actually, we store the first occurrence? We traverse from left, so for a given sum we store the smallest index? Actually, we want the largest number of candies for a given sum? But we are storing the first time we achieve the sum. However, we want to maximize the total candies. So if we have the same sum achieved by a prefix of length L1 and L2 (with L1 < L2), then we would prefer L2? But we are storing the first time we achieve the sum? \n\n        Actually, we do:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: break\n                d[s] = idx+1   # this will store the last occurrence? Actually, if the same sum appears again, we overwrite? But the prefix sums are increasing? So each sum appears only once? \n\n        Therefore, we are storing the first time we achieve the sum? Actually, we are storing the cumulative sum at each step. Since the weights are positive, the prefix sums are strictly increasing. So each sum appears at most once.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if s in d: \n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the variable `idx` in the reversed loop: we are iterating from 0 to n-1. The suffix sum we are building is the sum of the last (idx+1) candies. \n\n        However, we must note: the same suffix sum might appear again? But the suffix sums (from the end) are also increasing? So each suffix sum appears only once? \n\n        Therefore, we can break early? Actually, we don't need to, because we are iterating the entire array from the end? \n\n        But we can break the suffix loop when s > x? Because if s > x, then we won't find a common sum (since the prefix sums stored are <=x). \n\n        We can do:\n\n            s, r = 0, 0\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: \n                    break   # because the suffix sum is already greater than half, and the prefix sums stored are <=x, so we won't find a match beyond this point? \n                if s in d: \n                    if d[s] + idx < n:\n                        r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: we are iterating the suffix from the last candy to the first. The suffix sum is increasing. So if we break when s>x, that's safe.\n\n        However, the problem does not require that, but it might be more efficient. But the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable without. But we can add it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do without breaking because the condition s>x might not be hit? But the total sum of the entire array is S, and we break the prefix when s>x (x = S//2). The suffix might also break when s>S//2? \n\n        But note: the entire array sum is S. The suffix sum we are building is the sum of the last k candies. The maximum k we take is until we have taken the entire array? But we break the suffix when s > x? \n\n        Actually, we can break the suffix loop when s > x? \n\n        However, what if the entire array sum is even? Then x = S//2, and we might have a suffix sum that equals x? But we break when s > x? Then we would break after we add the candy that makes s exceed x? But we might have already seen s=x? \n\n        So we must check s in d before breaking? \n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            s, r = 0, 0\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: \n                    # but we must check if s was in d? Actually, we break the prefix at s>x, so if s>x then we break? But note: the suffix might be increasing and we are only interested in sums <=x. \n                    # So we break? \n                    break\n                if s in d: \n                    if d[s] + idx < n:\n                        r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the suffix sum might be increasing, so once we break, we don't need to check further? \n\n        However, what if the suffix sum becomes greater than x and then later becomes less? No, because we are adding positive numbers. The suffix sum is increasing as we add more candies from the end? Actually, we are iterating from the last candy to the first, so we are building the suffix sum from the end: \n            Initially: s0 = a[n-1]\n            then s1 = a[n-1] + a[n-2]\n            then s2 = a[n-1] + a[n-2] + a[n-3] ... \n            so it's increasing.\n\n        Therefore, we can break when s > x.\n\n        So the complete code for program1.py:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                total = sum(a)\n                x = total // 2   # we only care about sums up to x\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    d[s] = idx + 1   # number of candies for this prefix sum\n\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                # Now traverse the suffix: from last candy to first\n                # We break when s > x\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    if s in d:\n                        # Check disjointness: the left segment has d[s] candies (indices 0 to d[s]-1) and the right segment has idx+1 candies (indices n-1-idx to n-1)\n                        # Condition: d[s] - 1 < n-1-idx   -> d[s] + idx < n\n                        if d[s] + idx < n:\n                            r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n                print(r)\n\n        But wait: what if there is no common sum? Then r remains 0? But the problem says: they can choose to eat 0 candies? Then the total is 0? But note: the problem says \"the maximum number of candies\", and 0 is a valid answer? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. If they eat 0 candies, then both have 0, which is fair. But the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so 0 is the minimum? \n\n        But note: the problem might have a solution with more than 0? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"print the maximum number of candies\". So if we don't find any common sum, we output 0? \n\n        But the example: \n            Input: \n                1\n                2\n                1 2\n            Then: \n                prefix: [1, 3] -> x = 3//2 = 1 -> so we break the prefix when s>1? \n                Then d: {1:1}   (because at index0, s=1 -> stored as 1 candy)\n                Suffix: \n                    reversed a = [2,1]\n                    idx0: s=2 -> which is >1 -> break? \n                Then r remains 0? \n                But the answer should be 0? because if Alice eats the first candy (weight1) then Bob must eat the last candy (weight2) -> not equal. If Alice eats nothing and Bob eats nothing -> 0, but they can also eat one candy each? but then the weights are not equal. \n\n        So 0 is correct.\n\n        But what if we have:\n            n=3, [1,2,1]\n            total=4, x=2.\n            prefix: \n                index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                index1: s=3 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,2,1]\n                idx0: s=1 -> check: 1 in d -> then condition: d[1] + 0 < 3 -> 1+0=1<3 -> true -> r = max(0, 1+0+1)=2? \n                But wait: the left segment: 1 candy (weight1) and the right segment: 1 candy (weight1) -> total=2 candies? \n                But note: the entire array: [1,2,1]. Alice eats the first candy (index0:1) and Bob eats the last candy (index2:1). Then they both have weight1. And the total candies eaten is 2. \n\n            Then we continue:\n                idx1: s=1+2=3 -> break? \n\n            So we output 2.\n\n        But what if we have:\n            n=3, [1,1,1]\n            total=3, x=1.\n            prefix: \n                index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1 -> then break? because 1<=1? but we break when s>x? x=1 -> s=1 is not >1, so we store and then next: \n                index1: s=2 -> break? \n            suffix:\n                reversed: [1,1,1]\n                idx0: s=1 -> in d -> condition: d[1]+0<3 -> 1<3 -> true -> r = max(0,1+0+1)=2.\n                idx1: s=2 -> break? \n            So output 2.\n\n        But what if they can eat more? \n            Alice: [1,1] -> weight2, Bob: [1] -> weight1 -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1] and Bob: [1] -> total=2 -> that's the maximum.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        However, note: what if the entire array is eaten? \n            Example: [1,1] -> n=2, total=2, x=1.\n            prefix: \n                index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1 -> then index1: s=2 -> break? \n            suffix:\n                reversed: [1,1]\n                idx0: s=1 -> in d -> condition: d[1]+0<2 -> 1<2 -> true -> r = max(0,1+0+1)=2.\n                Then we break? because we break the suffix at idx0? no, because s=1<=1 -> then next:\n                idx1: s=2 -> break? \n            Then output 2.\n\n        But wait: if they eat the entire array: Alice eats [1] (left) and Bob eats [1] (right) -> but then the entire array is eaten? \n            Actually, the entire array has two candies. Alice eats the first and Bob eats the last. Then they have both eaten one candy -> fair. And total candies=2.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        But note: what if the common sum is achieved by a prefix that is not the first time? Actually, the prefix sums are increasing so each sum appears only once.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                total = sum(a)\n                x = total // 2\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    d[s] = idx + 1\n\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                # Traverse the suffix: from last to first (reverse of a)\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    if s in d:\n                        # Condition: the two segments are disjoint: d[s] (left count) and the right count is idx+1 -> but we are using idx (the index in the reversed array) which is the number of candies we've taken from the right minus one? \n                        # Actually, the number of candies from the right is idx+1.\n                        # The condition: the left segment ends at index d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at index n-1-idx.\n                        # We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx -> d[s] + idx < n.\n                        if d[s] + idx < n:\n                            # total candies = d[s] (from left) + (idx+1) (from right) = d[s] + idx + 1\n                            r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n                print(r)\n\n        Let's test with the example: \n            Example 1: n=2, [1,1] \n                total=2, x=1.\n                prefix: \n                    index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1 -> then next: index1: s=2 -> break.\n                suffix: \n                    reversed a = [1,1]\n                    idx0: s=1 -> in d -> condition: d[1] (which is 1) + 0 < 2 -> 1<2 -> true -> r = max(0,1+0+1)=2.\n                output 2.\n\n            Example 2: n=3, [1,2,1] -> as above, output 2.\n\n            Example 3: n=3, [1,1,1] -> output 2.\n\n            Example 4: n=5, [1,2,3,2,1] \n                total=9, x=4.\n                prefix: \n                    index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                    index1: s=3 -> d[3]=2\n                    index2: s=6 -> break? because 6>4 -> break.\n                suffix: \n                    reversed: [1,2,3,2,1] -> [1,2,3,2,1] -> \n                    idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes -> condition: d[1]=1, 1+0=1<5 -> true -> r = max(0,1+0+1)=2.\n                    idx1: s=1+2=3 -> in d -> condition: d[3]=2, 2+1=3<5 -> true -> r = max(2, 2+1+1)=4.\n                    idx2: s=3+3=6 -> break? \n                output 4.\n\n                Check: \n                    Alice: [1,2] -> sum=3, Bob: [1,2] (the last two) -> sum=3 -> total candies=4 -> valid.\n\n            Example 5: n=5, [1,3,2,2,1] \n                total=9, x=4.\n                prefix: \n                    index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                    index1: s=4 -> d[4]=2 -> then next: index2: s=6 -> break.\n                suffix: \n                    reversed: [1,2,2,3,1]\n                    idx0: s=1 -> in d -> condition: 1+0<5 -> true -> r=2.\n                    idx1: s=1+2=3 -> in d? d has 1 and 4 -> no.\n                    idx2: s=3+2=5 -> not in d -> then break? no, because 5<=4? no -> 5>4 -> break? \n                So output 2.\n\n                But wait: can we get 4? \n                    Alice: [1,3] -> sum=4, Bob: [1,2] (the last two: [2,1] -> but wait, the last two are [2,1] -> sum=3? \n                    Bob must eat from the right: the last candy is 1, then the next is 2 -> so if Bob eats the last two: [1,2] -> but that's the last candy (1) and the second last (2) -> sum=3.\n                    Alternatively, Bob eats only the last candy: 1 -> then Alice has 4 and Bob has 1 -> not equal.\n\n                    How about Alice: [1] (sum=1) and Bob: [1] (last candy:1) -> total=2? \n                    Or Alice: [1,3] (sum=4) and Bob: [1] (last candy:1) -> not equal.\n\n                    How about Alice: [1] and Bob: [2,1] (last two) -> sum=3? not equal.\n\n                    How about Alice: [1,3,2] -> sum=6, Bob: [1,2] -> sum=3 -> not equal.\n\n                    How about Alice: [1,3] (sum=4) and Bob: [2,2]? But Bob must eat from the right: the last two are [2,1] -> he can only eat contiguous from the right. He can eat the last one: 1, then the next (if he eats two) is 2 and then 1? but the array is [1,3,2,2,1]. Bob can only eat from the right: he can choose to eat 1 candy (the last) or 2 candies (last two: 1 and 2) or 3 candies (last three: 1,2,2) -> sum=5, or 4 candies: 1,2,2,3 -> sum=8, or 5: the whole array.\n\n                    So Bob cannot eat the two 2's without the 1? \n\n                    Therefore, the maximum is 2? \n\n                So the code outputs 2, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we write the missing code for program1.py as:\n\n            if s in d:\n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the variable `r` is initialized to 0.\n\n        However, the provided code already has:\n            s, r = 0, 0\n\n        So we only need to fill the if block.\n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must complete the TODO.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            if s in d:\n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: we also have to break when s > x? The provided code does not have that. We must add the break condition? \n\n        The provided code does not have the break condition for the suffix loop? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            s, r = 0, 0\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must add the break condition? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and without break it is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so it's acceptable. However, we can break to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\n        But the problem does not require that. However, the provided code does not have the break condition? \n\n        We are allowed to complete the TODO only? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        The TODO is only in the if block? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the break condition for the suffix might be considered as part of the solution? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the example output format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        We are to output the missing code for program1 and program2.\n\n        For program1, the missing code is only the block for the if condition? \n\n        But the provided code for program1 has:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we must complete the if block. We are not allowed to change other parts? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output the entire block that is missing? \n\n        But note: the break condition for the suffix when s>x is not in the provided code. We must add it? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The provided code does not have the break condition? \n\n        But without the break condition, the code might be inefficient? However, the total n over test cases is 200000, and the worst-case for the suffix loop is 200000 per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total operations is 200000 (for the prefix) + 200000 (for the suffix) per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, meaning the sum of the n's is 200000. So the entire program will run in O(200000) for the prefix and O(200000) for the suffix? \n\n        Actually, the total n over test cases is 200000, so the entire program will run in O(200000) for the prefix and O(200000) for the suffix? \n\n        Therefore, we can skip the break condition? \n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do without the break condition? \n\n        However, the break condition for the prefix is already there? \n\n        For the suffix, we can do without? \n\n        But the problem does not require it. \n\n        Therefore, we complete the TODO as:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: we must check that s is in d? The condition is already in the if.\n\n        So the entire block for the if condition is:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the variable `idx` is the index in the reversed array. The number of candies taken from the right is idx+1, but we use `idx` (the index) in the condition? \n\n        Yes, because the condition is d[s] + idx < n, which is equivalent to d[s] + (idx) < n, and then we add 1 for the total? \n\n        Actually, the total candies = d[s] (from left) + (idx+1) (from right) = d[s] + idx + 1.\n\n        And the condition for disjointness is d[s] + idx < n.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            if s in d: \n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But the provided code already has the \"if s in d\", so we only need to write the inner part.\n\n        However, the TODO is at the line of the if condition. We can write:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        Or we can write:\n\n            if s in d:\n                if d[s] + idx < n:\n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is at the line: \n\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: we are inside the if s in d. So we can write:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        So for program1, the missing code is:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the variable `r` is defined and we are updating it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write in one line:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But the style is up to us.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            if d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says \"missing lines\", so we output the line(s) that should replace the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is a single line? Then we output one line? \n\n        But we have an if condition? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at the end of the if condition? \n\n        The code is:\n\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write:\n\n            if s in d: \n                if d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that goes in the TODO. \n\n        The TODO is at the same line as the if? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            if s in d: if d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But that is not valid Python? \n\n        We must write:\n\n            if s in d: \n                ...   # we need to indent\n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact format? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        That is one line.\n\n        But note: the condition \"d[s] + idx < n\" must be checked only when s is in d? \n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        This is safe because if s is not in d, the condition short circuits.\n\n        Therefore, we write for program1:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But note: the original code has the if condition \"if s in d\", so we are replacing that line? \n\n        The original line is:\n\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace that line with:\n\n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But then we don't have an extra line? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if s in d: \n                if d[s] + idx < n: \n                    r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        But the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the TODO is at that line. We are allowed to output multiple lines? \n\n        The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output a block? \n\n        However, the example output format is a string for \"program1\". We can output:\n\n            \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\n        as one line.\n\n        But to be safe, we output one line.\n\n        So for program1: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n\n        But note: the variable `r` is defined.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        The problem: \n            We are given an integer n. We form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We want to perform swaps so that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence. We want the minimum number of operations and one such sequence.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                k = int(input())\n\n                if k == 1:\n                    ans = max(1, k - 1)\n                    print(ans)\n                    print(1, 2)\n                else:\n                    t = []\n                    p = [0, 1, 2] * k   # this creates a list: [0,1,2,0,1,2,...] of length 3k. \n                    x, y = 0, len(p) - 1\n                    while x < y:\n                        while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n                        while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n                        if x >= y:\n                            break\n                        t.append([x + 1, y + 1])\n                        p[x], p[y] = p[y], p[x]\n                    print(len(t))\n                    for x, y, in t:\n                        print(x, y)\n\n        What is the idea?\n\n        The problem says: \n            For k=1: \n                s(1) = \"BAN\" -> we swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n            For k=2: \n                s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> we swap indices 2 and 6 -> becomes \"BNNBAA\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        How to generalize?\n\n        Note: The problem says the minimum number of operations. For k=1, we did 1 operation. For k=2, we did 1 operation.\n\n        The problem says: It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations.\n\n        The provided code for k>=2:\n\n            t = []   # list of operations\n            p = [0,1,2] * k   # this represents the pattern? \n                For k=2: p = [0,1,2,0,1,2] -> 6 elements.\n\n            Then we set x=0, y=len(p)-1 (which is 5 for k=2)\n\n            Then:\n                while x < y:\n                    while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1   # we are looking for an index x where p[x]==1\n                    while x < y and p[y] != 2: ...   # TODO: we are looking for an index y where p[y]==2\n\n                    Then if x>=y: break\n                    Then we append (x+1, y+1) to t, and swap p[x] and p[y].\n\n            Then we output the number of operations and the operations.\n\n        What do the numbers 0,1,2 represent?\n            The string \"BAN\" has three characters. We can represent:\n                'B' -> 0\n                'A' -> 1\n                'N' -> 2\n\n            Then the string for k=1: [0,1,2]\n            for k=2: [0,1,2,0,1,2]\n\n        The goal: after swapping, we want that \"BAN\" (which is [0,1,2]) is not a subsequence.\n\n        How does the swapping work?\n            We are swapping the 1's (which represent 'A') from the left with 2's (which represent 'N') from the right.\n\n        For k=2: \n            Initially: p = [0,1,2,0,1,2]\n            We set x=0: p[0]=0 -> skip, then x=1: p[1]=1 -> found.\n            Then we set y=5: p[5]=2 -> found? \n            Then we swap: p[1] and p[5] -> becomes [0,2,2,0,1,1] -> which corresponds to \"BNN BAA\" -> which is \"BNNBAA\".\n\n        Why is this good? \n            We break the pattern: originally, we had two \"BAN\"s. After swapping, we have:\n                first three: [0,2,2] -> \"BNN\" -> no 'A' in the first three? \n                next three: [0,1,1] -> \"BAA\" -> no 'N'? \n            How about as a subsequence? \n                To form \"BAN\": \n                    We need a 'B' (0), then an 'A' (1) after it, then an 'N' (2) after that.\n                The first 0 is at index0. Then we look for a 1 after index0: we have at index3? but wait: \n                    The array: [0,2,2,0,1,1]\n                We have two 0's: at index0 and index3. \n                For the 0 at index0: the next 1 must be after index0: the next 1 is at index4. Then we need a 2 after index4: we have none? because the last two are 1's. \n                For the 0 at index3: then we look for a 1 after index3: we have at index4 and 5. Then we look for a 2 after index4: none. \n                So no \"BAN\".\n\n        How many operations? 1.\n\n        For k=3: \n            p = [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2]\n            We do:\n                x: find the first 1 -> at index1 -> x=1\n                y: find the last 2 -> at index8 -> y=8\n                swap: p[1] and p[8] -> [0,2,2,0,1,2,0,1,1]\n                Then we update: x becomes 2 (because we break the inner while? actually, we break the inner while and then we swap, then we do x++ and y--? not exactly: after swapping, we break out of the inner while and then we do x++ and y--? \n\n            Then we continue the outer while: \n                x: now x=2 -> we look for the next 1: \n                    p[2]=2 -> skip\n                    p[3]=0 -> skip\n                    p[4]=1 -> found -> x=4\n                y: now y=7 -> we look for a 2: \n                    p[7]=1 -> skip? \n                    then we decrement y: y=6 -> p[6]=0 -> skip\n                    y=5: p[5]=2 -> found.\n                Then swap p[4] and p[5]: \n                    becomes: [0,2,2,0,2,1,0,1,1] -> then we break because x=4 and y=5 -> then x becomes 5, y becomes 4 -> then the outer loop breaks.\n\n            Operations: two swaps: (1,8) and (4,5)\n\n            Check: \n                The string: \n                    indices: \n                        0:0->'B'\n                        1:2->'N'\n                        2:2->'N'\n                        3:0->'B'\n                        4:2->'N'\n                        5:1->'A'\n                        6:0->'B'\n                        7:1->'A'\n                        8:1->'A'\n                    -> \"B\", \"N\", \"N\", \"B\", \"N\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\" -> \"BNNBN ABAA\" (without spaces)\n\n                Check for \"BAN\": \n                    We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' after the 'A'. \n                    Let's try:\n                        Take the first 'B' (index0): then we need an 'A' after it: we have at index5,7,8. Then for each 'A', we need an 'N' after that. \n                        For the 'A' at index5: after it we have indices6,7,8: which are 'B','A','A' -> no 'N'. \n                        For the 'A' at index7: after it: index8 -> 'A' -> no 'N'.\n                        For the 'A' at index8: no after -> no 'N'.\n\n                    Then take the next 'B' at index3: then we need an 'A' after index3: we have at index5,7,8. Then for each:\n                        index5: after it we have no 'N'? \n                        index7: after it: no 'N'\n                        index8: no 'N'\n\n                    Then the next 'B' at index6: then we need an 'A' after index6: at index7,8. Then after index7: no 'N'. After index8: no.\n\n                So no \"BAN\".\n\n            Therefore, for k=3, we did 2 operations.\n\n        What is the pattern? \n            The minimum number of operations: \n                k=1 -> 1\n                k=2 -> 1\n                k=3 -> 2\n                k=4 -> 2? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \n                For k=1: output 1 and then the operation (1,2)\n                For k>=2: the provided code does a while loop that swaps the leftmost 'A' (1) with the rightmost 'N' (2) until we can.\n\n            How many swaps? \n                We have k occurrences of 'A' and k occurrences of 'N'. We are pairing the first ceil(k/2) or floor? \n\n            In the while loop: \n                We start with x=0, y=len(p)-1.\n                We find the first 'A' (1) from the left and the last 'N' (2) from the right. Then we swap. Then we move x to the next and y to the previous. Then we do until x<y.\n\n            How many swaps? \n                We can do at most floor(k/2) swaps? \n                For k=2: 1 swap -> floor(2/2)=1.\n                For k=3: 2 swaps? but floor(3/2)=1 -> that doesn't match.\n\n            Actually, we are doing:\n                For k=3: \n                    first swap: the first A (index1) and the last N (index8) -> then the next A is at index4 and the next N from the right is at index5 -> then swap -> then x becomes 5 and y becomes 4 -> break.\n\n                So we did two swaps.\n\n            How many swaps? \n                We are doing min( number of A's from the left that are before the N's from the right? ) \n\n            Actually, we are pairing the i-th A (from the left) with the i-th N from the right? \n\n            The positions of A: \n                k=3: indices: 1,4,7 -> but after swapping the first A (at1) with the last N (at8), then the array becomes [0,2,2,0,1,2,0,1,1] -> then the next A is at index4? and the next N from the right: we start from the new array: the last N? but we swapped the last N (at8) to become 1. Then the next N from the right is at index5? \n\n            How many swaps? We do until we run out of A's on the left that are to the left of an N on the right? \n\n            Actually, the condition: we break when x>=y. \n\n            How many swaps? \n                The first A is at index1, the last N is at index (3k-1) -> for k=3: index8.\n                Then the next A is at index4, the next N from the right is at index (3k-4) = 5? \n                Then the next A would be at index7, but then the next N from the right would be at index (3k-7)=2? but 7>2 -> break.\n\n            So we do floor((k+1)/2) swaps? \n                k=1: floor((1+1)/2)=1 -> matches.\n                k=2: floor((2+1)/2)=1 -> matches.\n                k=3: floor((3+1)/2)=2 -> matches.\n\n            Therefore, the minimum number of operations is ceil(k/2)? or floor((k+1)/2)? \n\n            But the problem says: \n                For k=1: output 1\n                For k=2: output 1\n                For k=3: output 2\n\n            So we can write: m = (k+1)//2   (since (1+1)//2=1, (2+1)//2=1, (3+1)//2=2)\n\n            However, the provided code for k>=2 does:\n\n                t = []\n                p = [0,1,2]*k\n                x,y = 0, len(p)-1\n                while x<y:\n                    ... \n                then output len(t)\n\n            And we see that the while loop does exactly (k+1)//2 swaps? \n\n            How? \n                The while loop: \n                    We find the next A from the left (which is at an index that is a multiple of 3 plus 1: for the j-th block (0-indexed j from 0 to k-1), the A is at index = 3*j+1.\n                    We find the next N from the right: for the j-th block from the right, the N is at index = 3*(k-1-j)+2? \n                    Then we swap. Then we move x to the next and y to the previous.\n\n                How many swaps? \n                    We start with the first block and the last block: swap the A of the first block with the N of the last block.\n                    Then the second block and the second last block: swap the A of the second block with the N of the second last block.\n                    ... until we meet in the middle.\n\n                So the number of swaps is floor((k+1)/2) = (k+1)//2.\n\n            Therefore, the code for k>=2 is correct.\n\n        Now, the TODO in the inner while loop for the right pointer:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to complete the inner while loop for the right pointer: we are looking for a 2 (which represents 'N') from the right. We start at y and go left until we find a 2.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            y -= 1\n\n        But note: we must not go beyond x.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        Then after this while loop, if we break because we found a 2, then we proceed to swap.\n\n        But what if we break because x>=y? then we break the outer loop.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n            y -= 1\n\n        But note: we must do:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        The TODO is at the end of the while condition? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But that is one line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        But the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO. \n\n        The TODO is at the same line? \n\n        We write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is already written. We are to write the body? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        The body of the while loop is one line: y -= 1.\n\n        So we write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the while loop condition is written, and we are to write the body? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must write the body. We write:\n\n            y -= 1\n\n        But we must indent? \n\n        The problem says: output the missing code. We output the line that should be the body.\n\n        So we output: \"    y -= 1\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the missing line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire block? \n\n        But the TODO is only for that while loop body.\n\n        Therefore, for program2, the missing code is: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the next line after the while loop is:\n\n            if x >= y: \n                break\n\n        So we write:\n\n            for program1: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            for program2: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        However, for program2, we must note that the while loop body is only one line. \n\n        But the provided code for program2 has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the body? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is a comment. We remove the TODO and write the body? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We output for program2: the line \"y -= 1\", which is the body of the while loop.\n\n        But the while loop condition is already there. \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            program2: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: in program1, the line we output is to replace the entire line that has the TODO? \n\n        The original line in program1: \n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace that line with: \n            if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\n\n        And in program2, the line:\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace that line with:\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        We are to output the code that goes in the TODO? \n\n        For program1, we output the entire line that replaces the line with TODO? \n\n        For program2, we output the body of the while loop? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output a block for program2? \n\n        However, the example output format is a string. \n\n        We'll output:\n\n            program1: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            program2: \"    y -= 1\"\n\n        But the indentation for program2: the body should be indented. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output for program2: \"y -= 1\" and then the user will put it in the body? \n\n        But the problem says: the code is given and we fill the missing lines or blocks.\n\n        We'll output the exact code that should be inserted.\n\n        For program1, we replace the entire line that has the TODO with the new line.\n\n        For program2, we add the body line (with an indent) after the while condition.\n\n        But the provided code for program2 has the while condition and then the TODO is at the end of the line. We must start a new line for the body? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        We'll assume that for program2, we output the body as a new line with 4 spaces of indent? \n\n        But the provided code uses 4 spaces? \n\n        We can write for program2: a string that is \"\\n    y -= 1\" ? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output for program2: \"y -= 1\" and then the user will put it in the body with the correct indent? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the minimal code.\n\n        We decide:\n\n            program1: one line: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            program2: one line: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But for program2, we must note that the body of the while loop is one line. \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"y -= 1\"}\n\n        However, for program2, the while loop condition is already written. We are only adding the body.\n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We'll output the body.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the example output format is a string.\n\n        We'll do as above.\n\n        Let me write the entire program2 after completion:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                k = int(input())\n\n                if k == 1:\n                    ans = max(1, k - 1)\n                    print(ans)\n                    print(1, 2)\n                else:\n                    t = []\n                    p = [0, 1, 2] * k\n                    x, y = 0, len(p) - 1\n                    while x < y:\n                        while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n                        while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                            y -= 1\n                        if x >= y:\n                            break\n                        t.append([x + 1, y + 1])\n                        p[x], p[y] = p[y], p[x]\n                    print(len(t))\n                    for x, y, in t:\n                        print(x, y)\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \n                \"program2\": \"y -= 1\"\n            }\n\n        But note: in program1, the variable `idx` is defined in the for loop: \n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n\n        And `d` is the dictionary from the prefix.\n\n        And `n` is the number of candies.\n\n        And `r` is the result.\n\n        This should be correct.\n\n        Let me test program1 with the example: n=2, [1,1] in the test case.\n\n        We have:\n            a = [1,1]\n            total = 2, x=1.\n            prefix: \n                s=0 -> then add a[0]=1 -> s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then next: add a[1]=1 -> s=2 -> break.\n            Then suffix: \n                a[::-1] = [1,1]\n                idx0: i=1 -> s=1 -> then check: s in d -> yes -> and d[1]=1, idx=0 -> condition: 1+0=1 < 2 -> true -> then r = max(0, 1+0+1)=2.\n            Then output 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        For program2: k=2 -> \n            p = [0,1,2,0,1,2]\n            x=0, y=5.\n            while x<y:\n                first inner while: while x<y and p[x]!=1: x++ -> at x=0: p[0]=0 -> x=1 -> p[1]=1 -> break.\n                then: while x<y and p[y]!=2: \n                    p[5]=2 -> so we don't enter the while -> so y remains 5.\n                then swap: t.append([2,6])? but we use 0-indexed: x=1, y=5 -> then we output 1+1=2 and 5+1=6 -> so (2,6) -> which matches the example.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the json.\n\n        Note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the string for each program.\n\n        We write:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\", \"program2\": \"y -= 1\"}\n\n        But note: in program2, the while loop body must be indented. But we are outputting the code as a string. The user will insert it? \n\n        We output the string \"y -= 1\" for program2, and the user will put it in the body of the while loop.\n\n        The provided code for program2 has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the body? \n\n        Actually, we remove the TODO and put the body? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. \n\n        We output the body as a string. The user will insert it in the next line with an indent? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the minimal code that is missing.\n\n        We'll output as above.\n\n        However, for program2, the TODO is at the end of the while condition. We can also output:\n\n            for program2: \"\\n        y -= 1\"\n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. \n\n        Since the provided code uses 4-space indentation, we can output for program2: \"    y -= 1\" (with 4 spaces) or \"y -= 1\" and let the user indent? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the code that is missing, and the user will put it in the correct place.\n\n        We'll output \"y -= 1\" for program2, and the user will put it in the body of the while loop with the correct indent.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire while loop? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the block for the while loop body is missing.\n\n        We output the body.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"if s in d and d[s] + idx < n: r = max(r, d[s] + idx + 1)\"\n            program2: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But to be safe for program2, we output the line with the same indent level as the other lines? \n\n        The provided code for program2 has:\n\n            while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n\n        This is a while loop with a body of \"x += 1\". \n\n        Similarly, the next while loop should have a body of \"y -= 1\".\n\n        So we output \"y -= 1\" for program2.\n\n        We assume the user will put it in the next line with the same indent as the body of the previous while loop.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
