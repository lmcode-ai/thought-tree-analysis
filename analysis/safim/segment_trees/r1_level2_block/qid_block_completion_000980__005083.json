So we can do multiple moves on the same index? Yes, we can. So for the third element (index2) we did one move? Then the value becomes 1? But then the example says 3? Wait, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" -> so each one move? Then b3 becomes 1, b4 becomes 1, b5 becomes 1? That is not [ -1,0,3,4,5].",

Then it adjusts the left and right. But the example: for the first element we set to -1 (so c0=-1) and the second element is 0 (so c1=0) and then the third element is 3 (so c2=3) and so on. The code for the left part (which is provided) is:\n\n    t2 = t1\n    k = 0\n    while(t2>0):\n        t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        t2 -= 1 But if we set the current element (at t1) to 0, then k=0. Then for the element to the left (t1-1), we do:\n    moves = (0 // a[t1-1] + 1) = 1\n    then k = a[t1-1] * 1 = a[t1-1] (positive) But then we require that the element at t1-1 is less than the element at t1 (which is 0). So we set the element at t1-1 to -a[t1-1]? Then for the next left element (t1-2), we require that it is less than -a[t1-1]. So we set it to a value that is at most -a[t1-1]-1. How many moves? We have k = a[t1-1] (positive). Then for the next element (t1-2), we do:\n\n    moves = (k // a[t1-2] + 1) [but note: k is positive, so this is positive]\n    then k = a[t1-2] *",

So for the right part, k is nonnegative. Then the number of moves for j is: multiple = (k // a[j]) + 1\n        Then the value at j is: multiple * a[j] = a[j] * ( (k // a[j]) + 1 ) Then we set k = that value for the next. But note: the example: \n        n=5, a = [1,2,1,1,1]\n        Fix t1=1 (the second element, index1) to 0. Then for the right part: \n            j=2: a[2]=1, k=0 -> multiple = 0//1+1 = 1, moves=1, value=1.\n            j=3: a[3]=1, k=1 -> multiple = 1//1+1 = 1+1=2, moves=2, value=2.\n            j=4: a[4]=1, k=2 -> multiple = 2//1+1=3, moves=3, value=3. Total moves for the right part: 1+2+3=6. Then for the left part: \n            j=1: we set to 0? then we go left: \n                at index0: k=0 (from the fixed point) -> moves = 0//a[0]+1 = 1, then k = a[0]*1 = 1. Then the left part cost=1. Total cost for t1=1: 1 (left) + 6 (right) = 7. But the example solution for the entire array is 4 moves? Alternatively, if we fix t1=0: \n            left part: none (since t1=0, no left element)\n            right part: \n                j=1: a[1]=2, k=0 -> multiple=0//2+1=1, moves=1, value=2.\n                j=2: a[2]=1, k=2 -> multiple=2//1+1=3, moves=3, value=3. j=3: a[3]=1, k=3 -> multiple=3//1+1=4, moves=4, value=4. j=4: a[4]=1, k=4 -> multiple=4//1+1=5, moves=5, value=5. total moves=1+3+4+5=13.

The minimum is 6? but the example says 4. How do we get 4? The example solution: \n            b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0)\n            b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> so we did nothing on b1? that is 0 moves. b2 = 3 (three moves: add a2 three times) -> 3 moves. b3 = 4 (one move: add a3 once) -> 1 move? but then 4? \n            b4 = 5 (one move: add a4 once) -> 1 move? \n            total = 1+0+3+1+1 = 6. But the example says 4 moves. The example says: \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that would be the first element? so b0 becomes -1. Then \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> so one move for each of the last three. Total 4 moves. So the moves are only on indices0,2,3,4. And the values:\n            b0 = -1\n            b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> but initially 0, so we did nothing.\n            b2 = 1? but they got 3 -> so they did three moves on index2: so b2=3? \n            b3 = 1? but they got 4 -> so they did four moves? \n            b4 = 1? but they got 5 -> five moves? But then total moves = 1+3+4+5=13.",

But the while loop condition is t2 < m-1, so we stop at t2 = m-2, and then we process the element at t2+1 = m-1. That is correct. Let me test with the example: a = [1,1,3,4,5], n=5, fix at t1=1 (index1). Right part: \n            t2 = 1, k=0, t=0. First iteration: t2<4 (m-1=4? but m=5, so m-1=4 -> condition: t2<4 -> true for t2=1)\n                c0 = 0 // a[2] + 1 = 0//3+1 = 1.\n                t = 1. k = 1*3 = 3.\n                t2 becomes 2. Next: t2=2 <4 -> true.\n                c0 = 3 // a[3] + 1 = 3//4+1 = 0+1=1.\n                t=2. k=1*4=4. t2=3. Next: t2=3<4 -> true. c0 = 4//5+1 = 0+1=1.\n                t=3. k=5. t2=4 -> then condition: 4<4 -> false, so break. So the right part cost=3. Then the left part: \n            t2=1, k=0. while(t2>0): \n                index0: \n                    moves = (0 // a[0] + 1) = 1. k = 1 * a[0] = 1.\n                t2 becomes 0 -> break. left cost=1. Total t (from right and left) = 3 (right) + 1 (left) = 4? but the variable t in the right part is 3, and then the left part adds 1 to the same t? The code:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k, t = 0, 0   # here t is initialized to 0 for the right part.\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                ...",

However, to be safe, we should avoid x=0. The problem says the input n>=3 and odd, and we are precomputing factorials for numbers up to 10**6, so x will be at least 1? But the function is called with fact[MAX-1] which is non-zero. Then in the loop for invfact, we call invfact for indices from MAX-2 down to 0. But when i=0, we do:\n\n    invfact[0] = modmul(1, invfact[1])   -> because i=0: modmul(0+1, invfact[0+1]) = modmul(1, invfact[1]) But we never call inv(0). So it's safe.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the minimum number of moves to make array b (initially zeros) strictly increasing by only adding or subtracting a_i to b_i in each move.\n\nThe provided code structure is:\n\nm = int(input())\na = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\nt1, min = 0, 10**20\nwhile(t1 < m):\n    t2 = t1\n    k, t = 0, 0\n    while(t2 < m-1):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    t2 = t1\n    k = 0\n    while(t2 > 0):\n        t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        t2 -= 1\n    if(min > t):\n        min = t\n    t1 += 1\nprint(min)\n\nWe note that the problem is non-trivial. The idea is to fix a starting point and then adjust the array to the left and to the right.\n\nHowever, the provided code has two while loops: one for going to the right (which is incomplete) and one for going to the left (which is complete). The left part is handled by the second while loop (t2>0). The right part (t2 < m-1) is missing.\n\nWe must complete the right part.\n\nThe problem can be approached by considering that we are allowed to change b_i arbitrarily by multiples of a_i (each move is one a_i). We require b_0 < b_1 < ... < b_{n-1}.\n\nWe can think greedily: we want to minimize the moves. We can fix an index i (t1) as the \"pivot\" that we do not change? Actually, the code is iterating t1 from 0 to m-1. For each t1, it computes the cost for making the array increasing by having the element at t1 unchanged? Or set to zero? Actually, note that initially b_i=0, but we can change arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is known and can be solved by dynamic programming. However, the provided code structure is fixed.\n\nLooking at the left part:\n\nwhile(t2>0):\n    t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n    k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n    t2 -= 1\n\nThis code is adjusting the element to the left (t2-1). The variable k is the amount that we have to add to the current element (which is at t2) to make the next left element (t2-1) less than it? Actually, we require b_{t2-1] < b_{t2]. Since we are going backwards, we start from the fixed point and move left.\n\nThe left part: we are at position t1 (which we are considering as the starting point, and we set it to 0? Actually, the code sets k=0 at the beginning of the left part. Then for the element to the left (t2-1), we require that b_{t2-1] < b_{t2] = k (which is the value we have set for b_{t2] after adjustments). But note: we are building the array from the fixed point to the left. We are going to set b_{t2-1] to a multiple of a_{t2-1] (by adding or subtracting) and we want the largest multiple that is less than k. The number of moves for that element is the absolute value of the multiple we choose. However, the code does:\n\nt += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n\nand then sets k to a_{t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1). This is actually making k negative? Because if k is positive, then k // a[t2-1] is nonnegative, but then we add 1 and multiply by a_{t2-1]? That would be a positive number? But we need b_{t2-1] < b_{t2] = k. So we want b_{t2-1] to be at most k-1. The code is setting b_{t2-1] to a negative multiple? Actually, note that the moves can be negative. The expression:\n\nWe are setting the value for b_{t2-1] to be: value = - (multiple) * a_{t2-1]? Or positive? Actually, the code does not specify sign. But note: the expression (k // a[t2-1] + 1) is positive. Then k becomes a positive number? But then we are going to the left and we require that the next element (to the left) is less than that positive number? Then we would set the left element to a negative value? \n\nBut observe: the left part is going from t1 to the leftmost. We start at t1 with value 0? Actually, the left part starts at t1 and moves to the left. The initial k for the left part is 0. Then for the element at t1-1, we compute:\n\n    moves = (0 // a[t1-1] + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1\n    then k becomes a[t1-1] * 1 = a[t1-1] (positive)\n\nBut then we require that b_{t1-1] < b_{t1] = 0? So we must set b_{t1-1] to a negative value. The code sets it to -a[t1-1]? Because we subtract once? Then the value is -a[t1-1]. Then for the next element (t1-2), we require that b_{t1-2] < b_{t1-1] = -a[t1-1]. So we set it to a multiple of a[t1-2] that is less than -a[t1-1]. The code does:\n\n    k = -a[t1-1]   (but wait, in the code k is set to a[t1-1] * (0//a[t1-1]+1) = a[t1-1] (positive) -> that doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the left part is actually building the array in the negative direction? Or the code is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is symmetric: we can do positive or negative moves. The key is that we want the left element to be less than the current element. The code for the left part is:\n\n    t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n    k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n\nBut wait: if k is positive, then we are setting the left element to a positive multiple? That would be greater than the current element? That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, we want the left element to be less than the current element. So if the current element is k, then we want the left element to be at most k-1. The code is actually setting the left element to a value that is negative? How?\n\nLet me reexamine: the expression (k // a[t2-1] + 1) is the number of moves? And the sign is negative? The problem says we can subtract. So we subtract (multiple) * a[t2-1] to set the left element to a negative value? \n\nBut note: the code does not use negative numbers. The expression k // a[t2-1] for positive k is nonnegative. Then we add 1, so we get a positive number. Then we set k to a[t2-1] * (that positive number). Then we use that k for the next left element? But then we require that the next left element (t2-2) is less than this positive k? That would be positive? Then we are building positive values to the left? But that would be increasing to the right? Actually, we want the entire array to be increasing: so the leftmost should be the smallest.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be building the array backwards: from the fixed point to the left, we are setting the values to be negative and decreasing? \n\nBut note: the example: \n    Input: n=5, a = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n    We do: \n        t1=0: then left part: t2=0, then we go to the left? t2>0 -> false, so skip. Then right part: we start at t1=0, then we go to the right? \n    Then the example solution: subtract a1 (which is 1) from b1 -> so b0 becomes -1. Then for b2, b3, b4 we add: so they become 1,1,1 -> but then the array is [-1,0,1,1,1] -> but wait, the example says [-1,0,3,4,5]? \n\nActually, the example says: subtract a1 from b1 -> that would be the first element? Then the array becomes [-1,0,0,0,0]. Then they add a3 to b3: so b3 becomes 1, then a4 to b4: becomes 1, then a5 to b5: becomes 1 -> that gives [-1,0,1,1,1] which is not strictly increasing because 1 is not greater than 1. \n\nBut the example says: [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> so they must have added a3 three times? So 3 moves for a3? Then one for a4 and one for a5? That would be 1 (for the first) + 3+1+1 = 6? But the example says 4 moves.\n\nActually, the example says: subtract a1 (one move) and then add a3, a4, a5 (three moves) -> total 4.\n\nSo the array becomes:\n    b0 = -a0 = -1\n    b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> but wait, the problem says we can choose an integer i and then add or subtract a_i to b_i. So we can do multiple moves on the same index? \n\nYes, we can. So for the third element (index2) we did one move? Then the value becomes 1? But then the example says 3? \n\nWait, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" -> so each one move? Then b3 becomes 1, b4 becomes 1, b5 becomes 1? That is not [ -1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nActually, the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. So for the third element (index2) they must have added 3 times? So 3 moves? Then for the fourth, 4 moves? and fifth, 5 moves? That would be 1 (for the first) + 3+4+5 = 13 moves? \n\nBut the example says 4 moves. \n\nI see: the array a is [1,2,1,1,1]. So a3 is 1 (the third element is the one at index2). Then adding a3 three times: 3 moves -> value becomes 3. Then a4: one move? -> value becomes 1? but they want 4? So they must have added 4 times? Then 4 moves? Then a5: 5 moves? \n\nBut that would be 1+3+4+5 = 13 moves.\n\nAlternatively, the example might have a different a. The problem says: \"Example 1: ...\". The input for example1 is not provided. \n\nBut the note says: \"Example 1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. The final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves.\"\n\nSo a1 is subtracted once: so b1 becomes -1? But the array a has a1 as the first element? Then the array b is:\n    b0 = -1 (if we subtract a0, which is a1 in 1-indexing? but the problem says a1, so index0? Then b0=-1)\n    b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> but then we skip b1? Then we add a3: which is the third element? so a2 (0-indexed) is 1? then we add it 3 times? so b2=3? then a3 (index3) is 1, add 4 times? -> 4? then a4 (index4) is 1, add 5 times? -> 5? Then the array is [-1,0,3,4,5] and moves: 1 (for b0) + 3+4+5 = 13? \n\nBut the example says 4 moves. \n\nI see: the example says \"add a3, a4, and a5\" meaning one move for each? Then how do they get 3,4,5? \n\nUnless the array a is [1,1,3,4,5]? But the problem does not specify the array a for example1.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the input for example1 is not given. We must rely on the code structure.\n\nGiven the complexity, let me look for known solutions.\n\nKnown solution for the problem (from known codeforces problems) for the first problem (making b increasing) is:\n\nWe note that we can set b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (positive or negative). We require:\n    c_0 * a_0 < c_1 * a_1 < ... < c_{n-1} * a_{n-1]\n\nWe want to minimize |c_0|+|c_1|+...+|c_{n-1}|.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to do multiple moves on the same index? Actually, the problem says: in one move we choose an integer i and add OR subtract a_i. So multiple moves on the same index are allowed, and the total moves for index i is |c_i|.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: choose integers c_i such that the sequence (c_i * a_i) is strictly increasing and minimize the sum of |c_i|.\n\nThis is a non-trivial problem.\n\nA known solution is to fix one element to be 0 (or not changed) and then propagate to the left and right. The provided code does that: it iterates t1 from 0 to m-1, and for each t1, it sets the element at t1 to 0? Then it adjusts the left and right.\n\nBut the example: for the first element we set to -1 (so c0=-1) and the second element is 0 (so c1=0) and then the third element is 3 (so c2=3) and so on. \n\nThe code for the left part (which is provided) is:\n\n    t2 = t1\n    k = 0\n    while(t2>0):\n        t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n        t2 -= 1\n\nBut if we set the current element (at t1) to 0, then k=0. Then for the element to the left (t1-1), we do:\n    moves = (0 // a[t1-1] + 1) = 1\n    then k = a[t1-1] * 1 = a[t1-1] (positive)\n\nBut then we require that the element at t1-1 is less than the element at t1 (which is 0). So we set the element at t1-1 to -a[t1-1]? Then for the next left element (t1-2), we require that it is less than -a[t1-1]. So we set it to a value that is at most -a[t1-1]-1. How many moves? \n\nWe have k = a[t1-1] (positive). Then for the next element (t1-2), we do:\n\n    moves = (k // a[t1-2] + 1)   [but note: k is positive, so this is positive]\n    then k = a[t1-2] * (k // a[t1-2] + 1)\n\nBut we want the value at t1-2 to be negative? So we are actually setting the value to - (that positive multiple)? \n\nThe code does not store the sign. It is accumulating the absolute value of moves? And the k in the code is the absolute value of the gap we need to overcome? \n\nAlternatively, the known solution for the left part is to set the left element to be - (multiple) * a[i] such that it is less than the next element. The multiple is the smallest integer such that: \n    - (multiple) * a[i] < next_value\n\nBut note: next_value is the value at the right, which in the left propagation is the current k? and k is positive? Then we require:\n    - (multiple) * a[i] < k   -> but this is always true if multiple is nonnegative? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother interpretation: the variable k in the left part is the value that the current element (at t2) must be greater than? And we are setting the left element to a value that is k' such that k' < current_element. Then we set the left element to the largest multiple of a[t2-1] (in absolute value) that is less than the current element? But we want to minimize moves, so we set it to the closest multiple below the current element.\n\nBut the code does:\n\n    moves = (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n\nand then sets k = a[t2-1] * (k // a[t2-1] + 1)\n\nThis is for the right part? \n\nWait, the provided code has two parts: one for the right and one for the left. The left part is provided, the right part is missing.\n\nThe left part is for indices < t1, and the right part for indices > t1.\n\nThe left part is already implemented. The right part is missing.\n\nFor the right part, we start at t1 and go to the end. We want b_{t1} < b_{t1+1} < ... < b_{m-1}. We start with b_{t1}=0. Then for the next element (t1+1), we require b_{t1+1] > 0. The minimal moves for b_{t1+1] is to set it to a_{t1+1] (one move) because then it becomes 1 * a_{t1+1] which is >0. Then for the next, we require b_{t1+2] > b_{t1+1]. So we set it to at least b_{t1+1]+1. The minimal moves is to set it to the smallest multiple of a_{t1+2] that is greater than b_{t1+1]. \n\nThe number of moves for index j (to the right) is the multiple (which is positive) and the value we set is that multiple * a_j.\n\nThe code for the right part should be symmetric to the left part? But the left part uses negative multiples and the right part positive.\n\nIn the left part, the variable k is the value that the next element (to the left) must be less than. And we set the left element to a negative value: - (multiple) * a[i]. The multiple is computed as: ceil(k / a[i])? But the left part does:\n\n    moves = (k // a[i] + 1)\n\nThis is for positive k? \n\nExample: k=0, then moves = 1 -> then we set the left element to -1 * a[i]. Then for the next, k = a[i] (positive). Then for the next left element, we compute: (a[i] // a[j] + 1). \n\nBut if a[j] is 1, then (a[i] // 1 + 1) = a[i]+1, then we set the next left element to - (a[i]+1) * a[j] = - (a[i]+1). Then the moves for that element is a[i]+1.\n\nThis matches: we want the element at j to be less than the element at j+1 which is -a[i]. So we set it to - (a[i]+1) (if a[j]=1) and that requires a[i]+1 moves.\n\nNow for the right part: we start at t1 with value 0. Then for the next element (t1+1), we want a value greater than 0. The minimal positive multiple is 1, so we set it to a[t1+1] (if we do one move). Then the value is a[t1+1]. Then for the next (t1+2), we want a value greater than a[t1+1]. The minimal multiple is ceil(a[t1+1] / a[t1+2])? But then the value would be ceil(a[t1+1] / a[t1+2]) * a[t1+2]. The number of moves is ceil(a[t1+1] / a[t1+2]).\n\nBut note: we might have to set it to a value that is more than the minimal? Actually, we want to minimize the total moves. So we take the minimal positive multiple that is greater than the previous element.\n\nSo the recurrence for the right part:\n\n    Let k = 0 at t1.\n    For j from t1+1 to m-1:\n        We require the value at j to be at least k+1 (if the previous value is k, then we require > k).\n        The minimal multiple for a[j] that is > k is: \n            multiple = (k // a[j]) + 1   [if k is nonnegative?]\n        But if k is negative? then we can set it to 0? but we require positive? Actually, we start at 0 and then we go to positive, so k is nonnegative.\n\n        However, note: the previous element might be negative? but in the right part we start at 0 and then go to the right, so the values are positive? \n\n        Actually, the entire array might have negative values? but the right part is after the fixed point. The fixed point is set to 0, and then we require the next to be positive.\n\n        So for the right part, k is nonnegative.\n\n        Then the number of moves for j is: multiple = (k // a[j]) + 1\n        Then the value at j is: multiple * a[j] = a[j] * ( (k // a[j]) + 1 )\n\n        Then we set k = that value for the next.\n\n    But note: the example: \n        n=5, a = [1,2,1,1,1]\n        Fix t1=1 (the second element, index1) to 0.\n        Then for the right part: \n            j=2: a[2]=1, k=0 -> multiple = 0//1+1 = 1, moves=1, value=1.\n            j=3: a[3]=1, k=1 -> multiple = 1//1+1 = 1+1=2, moves=2, value=2.\n            j=4: a[4]=1, k=2 -> multiple = 2//1+1=3, moves=3, value=3.\n        Total moves for the right part: 1+2+3=6.\n\n        Then for the left part: \n            j=1: we set to 0? then we go left: \n                at index0: k=0 (from the fixed point) -> moves = 0//a[0]+1 = 1, then k = a[0]*1 = 1.\n            Then the left part cost=1.\n        Total cost for t1=1: 1 (left) + 6 (right) = 7.\n\n        But the example solution for the entire array is 4 moves? \n\n        Alternatively, if we fix t1=0: \n            left part: none (since t1=0, no left element)\n            right part: \n                j=1: a[1]=2, k=0 -> multiple=0//2+1=1, moves=1, value=2.\n                j=2: a[2]=1, k=2 -> multiple=2//1+1=3, moves=3, value=3.\n                j=3: a[3]=1, k=3 -> multiple=3//1+1=4, moves=4, value=4.\n                j=4: a[4]=1, k=4 -> multiple=4//1+1=5, moves=5, value=5.\n            total moves=1+3+4+5=13.\n\n        Fix t1=2 (index2):\n            left part: \n                j=2: fixed to 0.\n                then j=1: k=0 -> moves = 0//a[1]+1 = 0//2+1=1, then k=2*1=2.\n                then j=0: k=2 -> moves = 2//a[0]+1 = 2//1+1=3, then k=1*3=3.\n                left cost=1+3=4.\n            right part:\n                j=3: a[3]=1, k=0 -> moves=1, value=1.\n                j=4: a[4]=1, k=1 -> moves=2, value=2.\n                right cost=1+2=3.\n            total=7.\n\n        Fix t1=3:\n            left: \n                j=3:0\n                j=2: k=0 -> moves=0//a[2]+1=1, k=1 -> then j=1: k=1 -> moves=1//2+1 = 0+1=1, k=2*1=2 -> then j=0: k=2 -> moves=2//1+1=3, k=3.\n                left cost=1+1+3=5.\n            right: j=4: moves=1, value=1.\n            total=6.\n\n        Fix t1=4:\n            left: \n                j=4:0\n                j=3: moves=1, k=1\n                j=2: moves= (1//1+1)=2, k=2\n                j=1: moves= (2//2+1)=1+1=2, k=2*2=4\n                j=0: moves= (4//1+1)=5, k=5\n                total=1+2+2+5=10.\n\n        The minimum is 6? but the example says 4.\n\n        How do we get 4? \n        The example solution: \n            b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0)\n            b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> so we did nothing on b1? that is 0 moves.\n            b2 = 3 (three moves: add a2 three times) -> 3 moves.\n            b3 = 4 (one move: add a3 once) -> 1 move? but then 4? \n            b4 = 5 (one move: add a4 once) -> 1 move? \n            total = 1+0+3+1+1 = 6.\n\n        But the example says 4 moves.\n\n        The example says: \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that would be the first element? so b0 becomes -1. Then \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> so one move for each of the last three. Total 4 moves.\n\n        So the moves are only on indices0,2,3,4. \n\n        And the values:\n            b0 = -1\n            b1 = 0 (unchanged) -> but initially 0, so we did nothing.\n            b2 = 1? but they got 3 -> so they did three moves on index2: so b2=3? \n            b3 = 1? but they got 4 -> so they did four moves? \n            b4 = 1? but they got 5 -> five moves? \n\n        But then total moves = 1+3+4+5=13.\n\n        Or: the array a is [1,1,3,4,5]? Then:\n            b0 = -1 (one move: subtract a0=1)\n            b1 = 0 (unchanged)\n            b2 = 3 (one move: add a2=3) -> then b2=3\n            b3 = 4 (one move: add a3=4) -> b3=4\n            b4 = 5 (one move: add a4=5) -> b4=5\n            total moves=4.\n\n        So the array a is [1,1,3,4,5]. \n\n        Then if we fix t1=1 (index1) to 0:\n            left: \n                index0: k=0 -> moves = 0//a0+1 = 0//1+1=1, then k=1.\n            right:\n                index2: a2=3, k=0 -> moves=0//3+1=1, value=3.\n                index3: a3=4, k=3 -> moves=3//4+1 = 0+1=1, value=4.\n                index4: a4=5, k=4 -> moves=4//5+1=0+1=1, value=5.\n            total moves=1 (left) + 1+1+1 (right)=4.\n\n        So the code for the right part should be:\n\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                # We are at index t2, and we have a value k (which is the value of the previous element? but we start at the fixed point which is 0)\n                # Actually, we start at t1, and then we go to the right: from t1 to m-1.\n                # The next element is t2+1.\n\n                # We require that the next element (at t2+1) is at least k+1? \n                # But note: the fixed point is 0, and then we set the next to a positive value. The minimal positive value is a[t2+1]? \n                # However, we require strictly greater than the previous element. The previous element is the value at t2, which is stored in k.\n\n                # How many moves for a[t2+1]? \n                # We need to set b_{t2+1] = c * a[t2+1] such that c>=1 and c * a[t2+1] > k.\n                # The minimal c is: c0 = floor(k / a[t2+1]) + 1   [if k is nonnegative]\n\n                # Then the number of moves is c0.\n                # Then the value at t2+1 is c0 * a[t2+1].\n\n                # Then we set k = c0 * a[t2+1] for the next.\n\n                # So:\n                c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\n                t += c0\n                k = c0 * a[t2+1]\n                t2 += 1\n\n        But note: the fixed point is at t1, and we are starting the right part at t1. We set t2 = t1 initially. Then we do:\n\n            while(t2 < m-1):   # because we go from t1 to m-2? then we process t2+1 from t1 to m-1? \n                # we process the next element: t2+1.\n\n        However, the left part in the provided code does not use negative values explicitly. It uses positive k and then sets the left element to a negative value implicitly by the accumulation of moves? But the value k in the left part is the absolute value of the gap? \n\n        In the right part, we only need positive multiples.\n\n        So the missing code for the right part is:\n\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\n                t += c0\n                k = c0 * a[t2+1]\n                t2 += 1\n\n        But note: the variable k in the right part is initially 0 (because before the right part, we set k=0). Then we start the while loop.\n\n        However, in the provided code, the right part is the first while loop (which is currently empty) and then the left part is the second while loop. And after the right part, we do the left part? \n\n        The code:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k, t = 0, 0\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k = 0\n            while(t2>0):\n                ... # left part\n\n        Then the total moves for this fixed point t1 is t (from the right part) plus the left part.\n\n        But note: the left part also uses a variable k and t. We have to be careful: the right part uses k and t, then we reset k=0 for the left part? but the left part then does:\n\n            k=0\n            while(t2>0): ...\n\n        So the two are independent.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for the right part is:\n\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                # We are at index t2 (starting at t1) and we want to set the next element (t2+1) to be greater than the current value (which is stored in k, initially 0 for the fixed point)\n                # The next element is a[t2+1]\n                # We need the smallest integer c0>=1 such that c0 * a[t2+1] > k.\n                # c0 = (k // a[t2+1]) + 1   [because if k is divisible by a[t2+1], then we need at least k//a[t2+1]+1, and if not, then also we need floor(k/a[t2+1])+1?]\n\n                # Example: k=3, a[t2+1]=2 -> then 3//2=1, then c0=2 -> 2*2=4>3 -> works.\n\n                c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\n                t += c0\n                k = c0 * a[t2+1]\n                t2 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition for the while loop: t2 < m-1 -> meaning we can go to t2 = m-2? then we process the last element? \n\n        However, the array has indices from 0 to m-1. The fixed point is at t1. The right part should go from t1 to the last element (m-1). But the while loop condition is t2 < m-1, so we stop at t2 = m-2, and then we process the element at t2+1 = m-1. That is correct.\n\n        Let me test with the example: a = [1,1,3,4,5], n=5, fix at t1=1 (index1).\n\n        Right part: \n            t2 = 1, k=0, t=0.\n            First iteration: t2<4 (m-1=4? but m=5, so m-1=4 -> condition: t2<4 -> true for t2=1)\n                c0 = 0 // a[2] + 1 = 0//3+1 = 1.\n                t = 1.\n                k = 1*3 = 3.\n                t2 becomes 2.\n            Next: t2=2 <4 -> true.\n                c0 = 3 // a[3] + 1 = 3//4+1 = 0+1=1.\n                t=2.\n                k=1*4=4.\n                t2=3.\n            Next: t2=3<4 -> true.\n                c0 = 4//5+1 = 0+1=1.\n                t=3.\n                k=5.\n                t2=4 -> then condition: 4<4 -> false, so break.\n            So the right part cost=3.\n\n        Then the left part: \n            t2=1, k=0.\n            while(t2>0): \n                index0: \n                    moves = (0 // a[0] + 1) = 1.\n                    k = 1 * a[0] = 1.\n                t2 becomes 0 -> break.\n            left cost=1.\n\n        Total t (from right and left) = 3 (right) + 1 (left) = 4? but the variable t in the right part is 3, and then the left part adds 1 to the same t? \n\n        The code:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k, t = 0, 0   # here t is initialized to 0 for the right part.\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                ... # this adds to t\n\n            # Then we do the left part: \n            t2 = t1\n            k = 0   # reset k for the left part, but t is not reset? \n            while(t2>0):\n                t += (k // a[t2-1] + 1)   # so we are adding to the same t that was used in the right part.\n\n        So the total t is the sum of the right and left moves.\n\n        Then we compare min = min(min, t)\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for the right part is:\n\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\n                t += c0\n                k = c0 * a[t2+1]\n                t2 += 1\n\n        But note: the variable k in the right part is updated and used for the next element. And we start with k=0.\n\n        We must be cautious: integer division in Python for nonnegative numbers is floor division.\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n        However, what if k is negative? In the right part, we start at the fixed point which is 0, and then we set the next to a positive value, so k becomes positive. Then the next element will be set to a positive value. So k is always nonnegative in the right part.\n\n        Therefore, we can use floor division.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is the while loop for the right part.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the function inv(x) that returns the modular inverse of x modulo MOD.\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nWe can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut the problem says: n can be up to 200000, and we are precomputing factorials up to MAX=10**6. The function inv(x) is called only for the factorial at the end of the precomputation? \n\nThe code:\n\n    invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\nSo we need an efficient inv function. We can use pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nSo:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function might be called with x=0? but in our precomputation, we are computing factorials, and fact[MAX-1] is non-zero modulo MOD? and also when we do comb, we assume x>=y and nonnegative. So we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the inverses for all numbers in the range [1, MAX] using a loop? But the problem only requires the inv function for factorials? and the factorials are large. But the function inv is defined for any x.\n\nThe problem says: the function is called for fact[MAX-1] and then for others? But the function is general.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer can be huge, modulo 998244353.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the function inv.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the body of the while loop for the right part.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the body of the function inv.\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has a while loop that is currently empty. We must fill the entire body of the while loop? \n\nThe while loop in program1.py is:\n\n    while(t2 < m-1):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n        c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\n        t += c0\n        k = c0 * a[t2+1]\n        t2 += 1\n\nBut note: the variable names must be consistent. The array is called 'a'. The variables k and t are already defined.\n\nWe write the code exactly as above.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: we must be careful with the modulus. The pow function with three arguments is efficient.\n\nNow, output in JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        c0 = k // a[t2+1] + 1\\n        t += c0\\n        k = c0 * a[t2+1]\\n        t2 += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has 4 spaces for indentation. The function body should be indented. The current function is:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with the return statement, indented by 4 more spaces? The current code has 4 spaces for the function body. So we should indent the return by 8 spaces? But the provided code in the example uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nLooking at the rest of the code: the function modmul is defined with 4 spaces for the body. So we do:\n\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire function.\n\nSo for program2, the missing code is the body of the function (without the function definition). But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\nIn program2, the missing block is the body of the function inv. We are replacing the line \"# TODO: Your code here\" with \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nBut note: the function might be called with x=0? but the factorial array is built for indices from 1 to MAX-1? and the last element is fact[MAX-1] which is non-zero. However, to be safe, we should avoid x=0. The problem says the input n>=3 and odd, and we are precomputing factorials for numbers up to 10**6, so x will be at least 1? \n\nBut the function is called with fact[MAX-1] which is non-zero. Then in the loop for invfact, we call invfact for indices from MAX-2 down to 0. But when i=0, we do:\n\n    invfact[0] = modmul(1, invfact[1])   -> because i=0: modmul(0+1, invfact[0+1]) = modmul(1, invfact[1])\n\nBut we never call inv(0). So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
