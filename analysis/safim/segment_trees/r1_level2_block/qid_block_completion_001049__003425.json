    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length of the subarray if the sum is positive, negative of the length if the sum is negative, and 0 if the sum is zero.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum value. The dynamic programming state dp[i] represents the maximum value we can get for the prefix ending at i.\n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n:\n    dp[i] = max( \n        i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), \n        nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, \n        dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) \n    )\n\nThen we update the Fenwick trees and the dictionary dmx.\n\nThe TODO in program1.py is at the end of the loop: we need to update dmx for the current prefix sum.\n\nWe note that the dictionary dmx is used to store the best dp value for a given prefix sum. So after computing dp[i], we should update dmx[pref[i]] to be the maximum between the current value (if any) and dp[i].\n\nSo the missing line is:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so we can update the dictionary.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about watering trees to make them the same height. We are to compute the minimum number of days. The approach is to try two target heights: m (the current maximum) and m+1. The function mm(m) computes the days needed for target m.\n\nIn the function mm(m), we iterate over each tree and compute the deficits (m - h_i). Then we need to determine the number of days. Note that on odd days we add 1, on even days we add 2. Alternatively, we can think in terms of the number of 1-adds and 2-adds.\n\nHowever, note that we can also skip days. The problem allows skipping.\n\nThe current function mm(m) uses two variables: n1 and n2. What do they represent?\n\nLooking at the return statement:\n    return (n1*2-1) if n2<n1 else ((n2*2+n1)//3*2+(n2*2+n1)%3)\n\nThis suggests that n1 and n2 are related to the number of operations of type 1 and type 2? Actually, we have two types of operations: we can assign some days as type 1 (odd days) and some as type 2 (even days). But note: the day parity is fixed by the day number. We cannot change the parity of a day arbitrarily. However, we can skip days arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: let x be the number of days we water a tree on an odd day (so they add 1) and y be the number of days we water a tree on an even day (so they add 2). Then the total growth for a tree is x + 2*y.\n\nBut note: we can water the same tree multiple times. However, the problem does not restrict watering the same tree multiple times. But we are free to choose which tree to water on which day.\n\nWe want to cover the deficits for each tree. For a tree i, we need to achieve a total growth of (m - h_i). So we need nonnegative integers x_i, y_i (for each tree) such that x_i + 2*y_i >= (m - h_i) and the total days is the maximum over the days assigned to each tree? Actually, no: because we can water multiple trees on different days. The total days is the total number of days we water (which is the total number of watering operations) but note that we can skip days arbitrarily so the total days is at least the total watering operations? Actually, the total days is the last day we water. Since we can skip arbitrarily, we can arrange the watering days arbitrarily. The constraint is that the day numbers (which are consecutive) and the parity of the day.\n\nBut note: we can interleave the watering arbitrarily. The key is that the same day cannot be used for two trees. So the total days must be at least the total number of watering operations? Actually, no: because we can skip days arbitrarily, the total days is the maximum day index we use. We can choose the days arbitrarily (by skipping) so we can assign the watering operations to any set of days. The only constraint is that on an odd-indexed day (like day 1,3,5,...) we add 1, and on an even-indexed day we add 2.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: we need to assign to each tree i a set of watering operations (which are days) such that the total growth for tree i is at least (m - h_i). The goal is to minimize the last day used.\n\nAlternatively, we can use binary search on the total days. But the problem says the total n over test cases is 300000, and we have to answer t test cases (with t up to 20000) but the sum of n is 300000, so we can do a solution that is O(n) per test case.\n\nHowever, the provided function mm(m) is trying to compute the days without binary search. Let's analyze:\n\nWe are iterating over each tree. For each tree, we have deficit = m - h_i. We need to cover this deficit with some operations of 1 and 2. But note: we can use multiple operations on the same tree.\n\nBut the problem does not require that we assign the operations to trees arbitrarily? Actually, we can water the same tree multiple times. So the total growth for tree i must be at least deficit_i.\n\nHowever, the total days must be such that the last day is minimized. But note: we are free to assign the operations arbitrarily to trees. The constraint is that on day j, if j is odd we add 1 to one tree, if even we add 2 to one tree.\n\nWe can formulate: let T be the total days (the last day). Then the total number of odd days is (T+1)//2 and the total number of even days is T//2.\n\nNow, we need to assign to each tree i a nonnegative integer x_i (number of 1's) and y_i (number of 2's) such that:\n    x_i + 2*y_i >= deficit_i\n    and the total x_i <= (T+1)//2, total y_i <= T//2.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use all the days. We can skip arbitrarily. So we can use at most (T+1)//2 ones and T//2 twos.\n\nBut the problem is: we want the minimum T such that we can cover all deficits.\n\nHowever, the provided code does not use binary search. Instead, it uses a direct formula. The function mm(m) computes two variables: n1 and n2. What are n1 and n2?\n\nLooking at the example: \n    t = [1,2,4] -> m=4.\n    deficits: [3,2,0]\n\nHow does the function compute n1 and n2?\n\nIn the example, the return value is 4. The function mm(4) should return 4.\n\nThe return statement: \n    if n2 < n1: return n1*2-1\n    else: return ((n2*2+n1)//3*2 + (n2*2+n1)%3)\n\nBut what are n1 and n2?\n\nOne common approach for this problem is to note that we can represent the problem in terms of the total number of 1's and 2's needed. However, we have multiple trees. We can set:\n    Let total_ones = (T+1)//2\n    Let total_twos = T//2\n\nWe require:\n    For each tree i: we need to cover deficit_i. We can use at least ceil((deficit_i)/2) two's? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n    Let x = total number of 1's used (across all trees)\n    Let y = total number of 2's used (across all trees)\n\nThen we have:\n    x <= total_ones\n    y <= total_twos\n    and for each tree i: we have x_i + 2*y_i >= deficit_i, and x_i, y_i >=0.\n\nBut note: we are free to assign arbitrarily. The minimal T for which there exists nonnegative integers x_i, y_i such that:\n    sum_i x_i = x, sum_i y_i = y\n    and for each i: x_i + 2*y_i >= deficit_i\n    and x <= (T+1)//2, y <= T//2.\n\nThis is complex. \n\nAnother known solution for this problem:\n\nWe know that the total growth for all trees must be at least the total deficit. But also, we have constraints per tree.\n\nWe can set:\n    Let s = sum_i deficit_i\n    Then we have: x + 2*y >= s.\n\nBut also, for each tree i, we have: x_i + 2*y_i >= deficit_i.\n\nMoreover, note that we cannot use more than T//2 two's and (T+1)//2 one's.\n\nBut there is a known solution that uses:\n    Let one = (T+1)//2, two = T//2.\n    We require:\n        one + 2*two >= s\n        and for each tree i: deficit_i <= one + 2*two? -> that is automatically satisfied if the total is enough? Not necessarily: because we might assign the ones and twos arbitrarily.\n\nActually, we need to satisfy the per-tree constraint. The minimal T must satisfy:\n    one + 2*two >= max_i deficit_i   ??? -> no, because we can use multiple operations per tree.\n\nBut note: we can assign arbitrarily. The key is that we can use at most one one per tree? Actually, no: we can use multiple ones and twos on the same tree.\n\nHowever, we must cover each deficit individually. The minimal T must be such that:\n    one + 2*two >= s   (but this is not sufficient: because we might assign in a way that one tree gets too many ones and twos and leaves others short) -> no, we are free to assign arbitrarily, so the total condition is sufficient? Actually, no: we also need to satisfy the per-tree constraint. But note: we can always assign all the waterings to one tree? So the condition one+2*two >= max_i deficit_i is necessary? Actually, yes: because the tree with the maximum deficit must be covered by at most one+2*two.\n\nBut is that sufficient? Not exactly: consider two trees: [1, 3] and target 3: deficits [2,0]. We have s=2. But we cannot cover the deficit of 2 with one=1 and two=1? Actually, we can: use one 2 on the first tree? But wait: we have one= (T+1)//2 and two=T//2. For T=2: one=1, two=1. Then we can assign the two (from the even day) to the first tree: then the first tree gets 2, which is enough. The second tree doesn't need any. So it works.\n\nBut consider: deficits [3, 3] and T=3: one=2, two=1. Then we have 2 ones and 1 two. We can assign to the first tree: 1 one and 1 two -> 1+2=3. Then the second tree: 1 one and 0 two -> 1, which is not enough. Alternatively, we can assign the two to the second tree: then the first tree gets 2 ones -> 2, which is not enough. So we need T=4: one=2, two=2. Then we can do: first tree: 1 one and 1 two -> 3, second tree: 1 one and 1 two -> 3.\n\nSo the condition is not only the total and the maximum deficit. We need to ensure that we can cover each deficit without exceeding the available ones and twos.\n\nKnown solution for this problem (from known problems like \"C. Water the Trees\", which is similar):\n\nWe can set:\n    Let mx = max(deficit_i)\n    Then we need T such that:\n        total_ones = (T+1)//2\n        total_twos = T//2\n        and we require:\n            total_ones + 2 * total_twos >= s   (where s = sum(deficit_i))\n        and also: for each tree, we can cover deficit_i with the available ones and twos? \n\nBut note: we are free to assign arbitrarily. The key is that we can use at most total_ones ones and total_twos twos. We need to cover all deficits.\n\nWe can also note that the two operations can be thought of as: we can use a two to cover 2, and a one to cover 1. But we can also use two ones to cover 2. However, using a two is more efficient (covers 2 in one operation) but uses an even day.\n\nA known approach is to compute:\n    Let ones_needed = 0\n    Let twos_needed = 0\n    for deficit in deficits:\n        # We can use as many twos as possible, then ones.\n        twos_needed += deficit // 2\n        ones_needed += deficit % 2\n\nBut then we have to assign the operations to days. However, note that a two operation must be done on an even day and a one operation on an odd day.\n\nBut we can also use a two to cover two ones? Actually, we can use a two in place of two ones? But that would use one even day to cover two units, which is the same as two ones (which would use two odd days). However, we cannot break a two into two ones arbitrarily? Actually, we can: because we can skip days arbitrarily. So we can use an even day to cover two ones? But note: the operation on an even day adds 2 to one tree. We cannot split that 2 between two trees. So we cannot use a two to cover two ones that are on two different trees.\n\nTherefore, we must cover each deficit individually. The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n    total = 0\n    max_ = 0\n    for h in t:\n        d = m - h\n        total += d\n        # We need to represent d as x + 2*y, and we want to minimize the total days? \n        # Actually, we are going to count the total ones and twos required? \n        # But note: we are going to use the same set of days for all trees.\n\n    Then we do binary search on T? \n\nBut the provided code does not use binary search. It uses a direct formula with two variables n1 and n2.\n\nLooking at the function mm(m) in the code:\n\n    n1 = 0\n    n2 = 0\n    tot = 0\n    for i in t:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    return (n1*2-1) if n2<n1 else ((n2*2+n1)//3*2+(n2*2+n1)%3)\n\nWhat are n1 and n2? \n\nFrom the return expression, we can deduce:\n\nIf n2 < n1, then we return n1*2-1. This looks like: if we have n1 ones, then we can arrange the days so that the last day is odd? The total days would be 2*n1 - 1? Because the ones must be on odd days, and we can skip the even days in between? Actually, the last day is the last operation. If we have n1 ones and n2 twos, and n2 < n1, then we can interleave: we can put a one on day 1, then a two on day 2, then a one on day 3, ... until we run out of twos. Then we put the remaining ones on the following odd days. The last operation (which is a one) would be on day (n2*2 + (n1 - n2)*2 - 1) = 2*n1 - 1.\n\nBut wait: if we have n1 ones and n2 twos, and n2 < n1, then we can do:\n    Start with ones and twos interleaved until we run out of twos: that takes 2*n2 days (with n2 ones and n2 twos). Then we have n1 - n2 ones left. We put each of these ones on the next odd days: the next odd day after 2*n2 is 2*n2+1, then 2*n2+3, ... so the last one is at 2*n2 + 2*(n1-n2) - 1 = 2*n1 - 1.\n\nSo that part is clear.\n\nNow, if n2 >= n1, then we return: ((n2*2+n1)//3*2 + (n2*2+n1)%3)\n\nWhat is (n2*2+n1)? It is the total number of operations? Not exactly: because we have n1 ones and n2 twos, so total operations = n1 + n2. But the expression is n2*2+n1. That is: total units? Actually, no: because each two is 2 units? But we are not summing the units.\n\nAlternatively, we are trying to minimize the total days. We have n1 ones and n2 twos. We can arrange them arbitrarily (with skipping). We want the minimal T such that we can schedule n1 ones and n2 twos without conflict. The constraint is that the ones must be on odd days and the twos on even days.\n\nWe can use a greedy scheduling: we can put the operations in any order? Actually, no: because the day parity is fixed. But we can skip arbitrarily. So we can put a one on any odd day and a two on any even day. The minimal T is the minimal day index such that there are at least n1 odd days and n2 even days in [1, T]. \n\nThe number of odd days in [1, T] is (T+1)//2, and even days is T//2.\n\nSo we require:\n    (T+1)//2 >= n1\n    T//2 >= n2\n\nBut also, we can interleave arbitrarily. The minimal T must be at least max(2*n1-1, 2*n2) [if n1>0 then the last one might be at 2*n1-1, but if we have both, we might be able to do better?]\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n    We want the smallest T such that:\n        (T+1)//2 >= n1\n        T//2 >= n2\n\n    Then T_min = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2)   ??? \n\nBut consider: n1=2, n2=2: \n        Condition: (T+1)//2>=2 -> T>=3 (because (3+1)//2=2) and T//2>=2 -> T>=4. So T_min=4.\n\nBut the formula for n2>=n1: \n    ((n2*2+n1)//3*2 + (n2*2+n1)%3) \n    for n1=2, n2=2: (2*2+2)=6 -> 6//3=2 -> 2*2=4, and 6%3=0 -> 4.\n\nSo it returns 4.\n\nBut why is that formula? \n\nWe can think: we want to cover n1 ones and n2 twos. We can use a day to do one operation. The total operations is n1+n2. But we cannot do two operations on the same day. The days are consecutive. We want to assign the operations to days such that the ones are on odd days and the twos on even days. We want the minimal T.\n\nWe can use a greedy: we want to assign the operations to the earliest possible day. But note: we can skip arbitrarily. So we can simulate:\n\n    We have two types: we need to assign n1 ones and n2 twos. The ones must be assigned to odd days, the twos to even days.\n\n    The minimal T must satisfy:\n        T >= n1 + n2   (if we could assign without skipping, but we might have to skip because of parity) -> not necessarily.\n\n    Actually, we can assign the ones to the first n1 odd days and the twos to the first n2 even days. Then the total days is max(2*n1-1, 2*n2). But if n1 and n2 are large, we might be able to interleave more efficiently.\n\n    However, consider: we can use the same day for one operation. The ones and twos are independent. The minimal T is the minimal day that has at least n1 odd days and at least n2 even days. So:\n        T_min = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2)\n\n    But wait: what if n1=3, n2=2? \n        Then 2*n1-1 = 5, 2*n2=4 -> T_min=5.\n        But we can also check: \n            odd days in [1,5]: 3 (days 1,3,5) -> enough for 3 ones.\n            even days in [1,5]: 2 (days 2,4) -> enough for 2 twos.\n\n        So T_min=5.\n\n    Now, what if n1=1, n2=2? \n        Then 2*n1-1=1, 2*n2=4 -> T_min=4.\n        But we can do: \n            day1: one (for the one)\n            day2: two\n            day4: two   -> so we need day4.\n\n    Now, what if n1=2, n2=3?\n        Then 2*n1-1=3, 2*n2=6 -> T_min=6.\n        But we can do:\n            We need 2 ones: so we need two odd days: at least day1 and day3.\n            We need 3 twos: so we need three even days: day2,4,6.\n            So T_min=6.\n\n    But wait: can we do better? \n        We cannot: because we need 3 even days, so T must be at least 6.\n\n    However, the formula for n2>=n1: \n        n1=2, n2=3: \n            total = 2*3+2 = 8\n            8//3 = 2, so 2*2=4, and 8%3=2 -> 4+2=6.\n\n    So it returns 6.\n\n    How about n1=1, n2=1? \n        Then n2>=n1 -> total = 1*2+1=3 -> 3//3=1 -> 1*2=2, 3%3=0 -> 2.\n        But we can do: day1: one, day2: two -> so T=2.\n\n    How about n1=0, n2=1? \n        Then n2>=n1 -> total=1*2+0=2 -> 2//3=0 -> 0*2=0, 2%3=2 -> 0+2=2.\n\n    How about n1=0, n2=0? -> 0.\n\n    How about n1=3, n2=4?\n        total = 4*2+3 = 11\n        11//3 = 3 -> 3*2=6, 11%3=2 -> 6+2=8.\n\n    But we can check: \n        We need 3 ones: so we need 3 odd days -> the last odd day is 5 (if we use days 1,3,5) -> so T_min must be at least 5? \n        But we also need 4 even days -> the last even day is 8 (days 2,4,6,8). So T_min=8.\n\n    So the formula works.\n\n    But why? \n\n    We are trying to cover the operations. We can think of the days as a linear sequence. We want to assign the ones and twos. The minimal T is the smallest T such that:\n        (T+1)//2 >= n1   and   T//2 >= n2.\n\n    But we can also write:\n        T >= 2*n1 - 1\n        T >= 2*n2\n\n    However, that is not sufficient: because if we have both, we might be able to share the same days? Actually, no: because the ones and twos require different parities.\n\n    But note: we can also use the same day for only one operation. So the minimal T is the minimal number that satisfies:\n        (T+1)//2 >= n1\n        T//2 >= n2\n\n    We can solve for T:\n\n        T_min = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2, ...) but we can combine the constraints.\n\n    We can set T_min = min { T in [0, infinity) such that (T+1)//2>=n1 and T//2>=n2 }.\n\n    We can write:\n        T_min = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2)   -> but that does not always work: \n            Example: n1=1, n2=1: max(1,2)=2 -> works.\n            n1=2, n2=2: max(3,4)=4 -> works.\n            n1=3, n2=4: max(5,8)=8 -> works.\n\n    But wait: what about n1=2, n2=3: \n        max(3,6)=6 -> works.\n\n    And n1=1, n2=0: max(1,0)=1 -> but we don't need any two, so we only need one odd day -> day1 -> T=1 -> works.\n\n    However, what about n1=0, n2=1: max(-1,2)=2 -> works.\n\n    But what about n1=3, n2=1: \n        Then we are in the first branch (n2<n1) -> returns 2*3-1=5.\n        But we can do: \n            ones: we need 3 -> days 1,3,5 -> T=5.\n            twos: we need 1 -> day2 -> so T=5 is enough.\n\n        So the condition for the first branch is n2<n1, and then we return 2*n1-1.\n\n    But is 2*n1-1 always sufficient? \n        We need to check: \n            The number of even days in [1, 2*n1-1] is (2*n1-1)//2 = n1-1.\n            We have n2 < n1, so n2 <= n1-1 -> so we have enough even days.\n\n        Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n    So the minimal T is:\n        if n2 < n1: T = 2*n1-1\n        else: T = 2*n2   ??? -> but wait, in the else branch we have n2>=n1, but then we use a different formula: ((n2*2+n1)//3*2+(n2*2+n1)%3)\n\n    Why not just T = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2) for both? \n\n    Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) uses:\n        T = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2, ...) but that is not the whole story.\n\n    But note: the example in the problem: \n        [1,2,4] -> deficits [3,2,0] for target 4.\n\n        How do we compute n1 and n2 for this example?\n\n        For the tree with deficit 3: \n            We can cover 3 by: 1 one and 1 two -> because 1+2=3. \n            Alternatively: 3 ones -> but that would be more ones.\n\n        For the tree with deficit 2: \n            We can cover by 1 two or 2 ones.\n\n        For the tree with deficit 0: nothing.\n\n        We want to minimize the total days. We can assign the operations arbitrarily to trees.\n\n        How do we compute n1 and n2? \n\n        We are iterating over the trees. The variables n1 and n2 are being updated per tree? \n\n        Actually, the known solution (from known submissions) for this problem is:\n\n            n1 = 0\n            n2 = 0\n            for i in t:\n                d = m - i\n                # We are going to count the total number of ones and twos required? \n                # But note: we can share the operations arbitrarily. We are not forced to cover each tree independently? \n                # Actually, we are: each tree must be covered individually.\n\n            Then we set:\n                # We need to cover the deficits. We can use a two to cover 2, and a one to cover 1. But we can also use two ones to cover 2.\n\n            However, the minimal total days is not simply the sum of the operations? because we can do operations on the same day for different trees? no, we can only do one per day.\n\n            Actually, we are free to assign the operations arbitrarily to trees. So the total number of ones we use is the sum over trees of the ones we use for that tree, and similarly for twos.\n\n            We want to minimize T such that:\n                (T+1)//2 >= (total ones used)\n                T//2 >= (total twos used)\n\n            and for each tree i: the ones and twos assigned to tree i must cover deficit_i.\n\n            We can choose the assignment arbitrarily. So we want to minimize T by choosing the assignment that minimizes T.\n\n            How to compute the minimal T? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                Let ones = 0\n                Let twos = 0\n                for d in deficits:\n                    # We can use as many twos as possible for this tree to minimize the ones? \n                    # But note: we want to minimize the total ones and twos? Actually, we want to minimize T, which is determined by the maximum between 2*(ones)-1 and 2*(twos) if we use the above formula? \n\n                But we are free to choose the representation for each tree.\n\n            We can represent d = 2*k + r, where r in {0,1}. Then we must use at least r ones for this tree. And we can use k twos. But we can also use more ones: for example, we can use (k-1) twos and 2 ones for the last 2? \n\n            The minimal T is the minimal value over the choices of representations? \n\n            This is complex.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use binary search on T. But the constraints on the deficits (up to 1e9) and the total n up to 300000 (but the sum of n over test cases is 300000) so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n        However, the provided code does not use binary search. It uses a direct formula.\n\n        Known solution from Codeforces submissions for \"C.

But that would use two days (one odd and one even) and cover the same 2 units. But then we are using two operations to cover what one two operation covered. This might be beneficial if we have extra days? \n\n                    # However, we are free to choose the representation? Actually, we are: because we can always use ones to cover what we would cover with a two. But we are not forced to use the minimal representation per tree. We can use more ones and fewer twos.\n\n                    # But note: the representation we did (diff//2 and diff%2) is the minimal ones required.

Therefore, the total growth must be exactly the sum of the deficits. \n\n                    #        And the condition a+2*b = total must hold. \n\n                    #        The formula (total//3)*2+total%3 is the minimal T such that there exists a and b with a+2*b>=total, a<=(T+1)//2, b<=T//2. \n\n                    #        But we need a+2*b = total. \n\n                    #        However, if we have a+2*b>=total, and we can always reduce b to floor(total/2) and a=total-2*floor(total/2) (which is the minimal representation) within the days if T is at least the minimal for that representation, then we can achieve exactly total. \n\n                    #        Therefore, the minimal T is the minimal T such that there exists a and b with a+2*b>=total and the day constraints, and then we can always use the exact amount by reducing b (by not using some waterings) or by skipping.\n\n                    #        So the formula is valid.\n\n                    #        Therefore, the function mm(m) should be:\n\n                    #            n1 = 0\n                    #            n2 = 0\n                    #            for i in t:\n                    #                d = m - i\n                    #                n1 += d % 2       # This is the ones in the minimal representation\n                    #                n2 += d // 2       # This is the twos in the minimal representation\n                    #            total = n1 + 2*n2\n                    #            # But note: we can also use a representation that is not minimal by trading.\n                    #            # The minimal T is the minimal among:\n                    #            #   T1 = max(2*n1-1, 2*n2)   [using the minimal representation]\n                    #            #   T2 = ceil(2*total/3) = (total//3)*2 + (total%3 ? but the formula is (total+2)//3 * 2 - something? -> we have the closed form: (total//3)*2 + total%3   for the minimal T that has growth>=total)\n                    #            # However, the code does:\n                    #            if n2 < n1:\n                    #                return 2*n1-1\n                    #            else:\n                    #                return ( (2*n2+n1) // 3 ) * 2 + (2*n2+n1) % 3\n\n                    #        But wait, total = n1+2*n2, and 2*n2+n1 = n1+2*n2 = total.\n\n                    #        So the else branch is: (total//3)*2 + total%3.\n\n                    #        And the if branch is 2*n1-1.\n\n                    #        Why not always use the else branch formula? \n\n                    #        Because the if branch might yield a smaller T.

However, the ones are not necessarily available for the trees that require an odd number of units. \n\n                    #        Actually, the ones are fungible. We can assign arbitrarily. So the only constraint is that the total number of ones we use (across all trees) is at least the sum of the ones in the representation for each tree.

We can remove it or leave it. Since the problem says to output only the missing code, and the missing code is the TODO part, we output these three lines.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n In program1.py, the missing line is one line.\n\n In program2.py, the missing block is three lines.\n\n But note: in program1.py, the TODO is in a comment, and we are to replace the TODO with the code.\n\n In program2.py, the TODO is in a comment, and we are to replace the comment with the code.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   program1: \"dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\"\n\n   program2: \n        \"d = m - i\\n        n1 += d % 2\\n        n2 += d // 2\"\n\n But note: the code in program2.py has an indentation of 8 spaces for the for loop body. We must preserve the indentation.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON format.\n\n We output as a string with embedded newlines for program2.\n\n Alternatively, we can output as a single string with the three lines.\n\n But note: the original program2.py has:\n\n        for i in t:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace the TODO comment with three lines, each with 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the for loop is indented by 4, and the body should be 8.\n\n In the provided code, the for loop is:\n\n    for i in t:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n So we output the three lines with the same indentation as the comment. Since the comment is at 8 spaces, we output each line with 8 spaces.\n\n But in the JSON string, we can use \\n and spaces.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we should match the surrounding.\n\n Since the surrounding code uses 4 spaces per level, and the for loop body is one level (4 spaces) and the comment is at 8 spaces (two levels), we output:\n\n        \"d = m - i\\n        n1 += d % 2\\n        n2 += d // 2\"\n\n This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line (if we count the 8 spaces in the string as the indentation).\n\n But note: in the provided code for program2.py, the line after the for is at 8 spaces.\n\n Alternatively, we can output without specifying the indentation and hope that the surrounding code has the same. But the problem says to output only the missing code.\n\n Since the missing code in program2.py is three lines, and they should be at the same indentation as the TODO comment, we output them with the same indentation as the surrounding. In the example, the surrounding uses 8 spaces.\n\n But in the JSON string, we can write the three lines as a string with embedded newline and spaces.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n We output in the specified JSON.\n\n Let's write the JSON:\n\n {\n   \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\",\n   \"program2\": \"d = m - i\\n        n1 += d % 2\\n        n2 += d // 2\"\n }\n\n But wait, in program1.py, the line we output is exactly one line. In program2.py, it is three lines.\n\n However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so a block of three lines is acceptable.\n\n But note: in program2.py, the variable `d` might be very large, and we are doing integer arithmetic. This is acceptable.\n\n One more thing: in program1.py, the line we output is at the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is in a block that is indented by 8 spaces.\n\n In program1.py:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n We replace the TODO with the line.\n\n Therefore, the final answer."
