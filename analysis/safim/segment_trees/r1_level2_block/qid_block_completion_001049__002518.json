    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is its length if the sum is positive, negative of its length if the sum is negative, and 0 if the sum is zero.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum value. The key part that is missing is updating the dictionary `dmx` which stores the best dp value for a given prefix sum.\n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n:\n    dp[i] is computed as the maximum of three possibilities:\n        1. i + pfen.max(ordpos[i])   [for the case where the current segment has positive sum?]\n        2. nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i [for the case where the current segment has negative sum?]\n        3. dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)   [for the case where the current segment has zero sum?]\n\nAfter computing dp[i], we update the Fenwick trees and then we are supposed to update `dmx` for the prefix sum at index i.\n\nThe note says: \n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should update `dmx[pref[i]]` to be at least dp[i]. Since we are trying to maximize, we set it to the maximum value we have seen for that prefix.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: it is possible that we have seen the same prefix sum before and we want the maximum dp value for that prefix. So we update only if we have a new maximum.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nHowever, note that the code already checks if dp[i] is greater than the current value for that prefix (if any). So we simply assign.\n\nBut wait: what if we have the same prefix sum at two different indices? We want the best dp value for that prefix. The code already uses a dictionary and we are updating it only when we see a better dp[i]. So we do:\n\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the dictionary `dmx` is initially set with {0:0} (for index0). Then for each i, we update.\n\nSo the missing line is: \n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so updating a dictionary is efficient.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about a grid with 1 and -1, and we want to know if there is a path from (1,1) to (n,m) with total sum 0.\n\nThe provided code uses a bitmask DP. The grid is transposed if necessary to make the number of rows at most the number of columns (so that we have at most 1000 rows and 1000 columns, but the total grid cells over test cases is at most 10^6).\n\nThe DP state is stored in a 2D array `B` of integers. Each integer is a bitset that represents the possible sums we can have at cell (i, j). The note says that the total sum can be negative or positive, so we shift the sum by (n+m) to make it non-negative. The function `get(sum)` returns `sum + N + M`.\n\nAt the start, we set B[0][0] to have a bit set at position `get(A[0][0])` (which is 1 << (A[0][0] + N + M)).\n\nThen we iterate over the grid. For each cell (i, j), we:\n   - If it's not the start, we set B[i][j] to the bitwise OR of the states from the top (if i>0) and from the left (if j>0). This propagates the possible sums.\n   - Then we shift the bitset: if the current cell has a 1, we shift left by 1 (which corresponds to adding 1 to the sum). If the current cell has a -1, we shift right by 1 (which corresponds to subtracting 1, i.e., adding -1).\n\nBut the code has:\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo for a negative value, we should shift right by 1? However, note that shifting right by 1 would lose the least significant bit. Instead, we can shift the entire bitset to the right? But that would be for subtracting. Alternatively, we can think: \n   When we have a positive, we do: \n        B[i][j] = B[i][j] << 1   [because the sum increases by 1, so we shift the bits to the right in the bitset representation? Actually, we are representing the sum as a bit at position (current_sum + shift). \n\nBut note: the function `get(sum)` returns `sum + N + M`. So the shift we are doing must account for the change in the current cell.\n\nActually, the idea is:\n   We have a bitset that has 1 at position (s + base) for each possible sum s. Then when we add 1, the new sum becomes s+1, so we shift the bitset left by 1 (so that the bit at position k moves to k+1). Similarly, when we add -1, we shift right by 1.\n\nTherefore, for a negative value, we do:\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut note: the problem says the grid has only 1 and -1.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: shifting right by 1 might drop the least significant bit. But that is acceptable because if we have a negative value, we are reducing the sum by 1, so the state for the smallest sum (which was at the low end) might be lost? Actually, we are representing a fixed range? The problem says the path has exactly (n+m-1) steps. The minimum possible sum is -(n+m-1) and the maximum is (n+m-1). So the total range is 2*(n+m-1)+1, which is about 4000. But we are using a bitset that is an integer (which in Python can be big, but we are only storing one integer per cell). However, the constraints say that the total grid cells is at most 10^6, so we can do this.\n\nBut note: the shift operations are O(1) in the number of bits? Actually, the integers in Python are arbitrary precision, but the number of bits we are shifting is fixed (at most 2000) and the total grid cells is 10^6, so worst-case we have 10^6 * 2000 operations? That is 2e9, which is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, we note that the range of the sum is from - (n+m-1) to (n+m-1). So we can use a bitset of fixed size? The code uses a single integer for the bitset. The shift operations are efficient because the integer has about 2*(n+m) bits? And the total n+m is at most 2000, so the integer has about 4000 bits. Shifting 4000 bits 10^6 times is 4e9 operations, which is too slow in Python.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total grid cells (n*m) over test cases is at most 10^6. So the total number of shifts is 10^6. And each shift is on an integer with at most 4000 bits? Then 10^6 * 4000 = 4e9, which might be borderline in C++ but in Python it might be too slow.\n\nHowever, the problem constraints say that the total grid cells is 10^6, so we can try to optimize by using a fixed-size bitset? But the provided code does not do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a different approach? But the problem says the total grid cells is 10^6, so we can use a 2D DP with a bitset per row? Actually, the provided code already uses a 2D array of integers (bitsets). And we are iterating row by row and freeing the previous row (by setting B[i-1] to None).\n\nBut the shift operation: for a positive we shift left by 1, for a negative we shift right by 1.\n\nSo the missing line for the negative case is:\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut let me test with a small example.\n\nExample: 1x2 grid: [1, -1]\nWe start at (0,0): \n   B[0][0] = 1 << get(1) = 1 << (1 + 1+2) = 1<<4? Actually, the function get(sum) returns sum + n + m. For a 1x2 grid, n=1, m=2, so base = 3. Then:\n   Initially: A[0][0]=1 -> get(1)=1+3=4 -> so B[0][0] = 1<<4.\n\nThen for (0,1): \n   We come from the left (B[0][0]).\n   Then since A[0][1] = -1, we do: B[0][1] = B[0][0] (which is 1<<4) and then shift right by 1 -> becomes 1<<3.\n\nNow, the total sum is 1 + (-1) = 0. We want to check if the bit at position get(0)=0+3=3 is set. So we check if (B[0][1] & (1<<3)) is non-zero. It is, so we output \"YES\".\n\nSo the code for the negative case is: \n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut note: the code also has a line that frees the previous row: \n        if i: B[i-1] = None\n\nThat is already there.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut note: the code for the positive case is shifting left, and for negative we shift right.\n\nSo the answer for program1.py is: \n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nAnd for program2.py is:\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nNow, we output in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: The problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and \"NOT as markdown code\". We output a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", and the value is the string of the missing code.\n\nBut note: the missing code in program1.py is a single line, and in program2.py is also a single line.\n\nHowever, in program1.py, the missing code is inside a for-loop and an if-statement. We are only replacing the TODO line. Similarly in program2.py.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code. In program1.py, the line is indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside two loops: the for-loop for i and then the if). In the provided code, the TODO is at 16 spaces? Actually, the code for the for-loop is:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = ... \n            ... \n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at the same indentation as the body of the if. So we write 16 spaces? Actually, the provided code uses 4 spaces per indent. The for-loop is 8, then the if is 12, then the TODO is 16? But the code we are writing is the replacement for the TODO, so we must use the same indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact line that replaces the TODO.\n\nIn program1.py, the missing line is at the same indentation level as the comment, so 16 spaces? Actually, the code we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace that with:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the line above is at 16 spaces. So we output exactly that.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the missing code is at the same indentation as the positive shift. The positive shift is:\n\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n\nand the negative case is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut wait, the positive case does the shift in the same line. We can do the same for the negative. However, the TODO is on the same line as the else. We are replacing the entire line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the comment with a shift operation.\n\nBut note: the code for the positive case is:\n\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n\nand the negative case is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe want to replace the negative case with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that is one line. However, the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the missing code in program2.py is the expression for the else branch.\n\nAlternatively, if we are only to output the code that goes after the else, then we output \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", but then we must also note that the else and the colon are already there. Actually, the TODO is a comment in the else branch. We are to replace the comment with the code. So we can write:\n\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut note: the else is already there. So the missing code is the body of the else. The body is one statement: \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", and it must be indented by 12 spaces? The current line has the else and then a comment. We are replacing the entire line? Actually, we are only replacing the comment. We can write:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that would be replacing the entire line. However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the missing part. Since the else is already there, we only need to put the shift operation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So for program2.py, the missing code is the shift operation and the necessary indentation? Actually, the code we are writing is the body of the else. The else is already present. So we write the body.\n\nBut the body must be at the same indentation as the body of the if. The if has \"B[i][j] <<= 1\" on the same line. We can do the same for the else. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nwith 8 spaces? Actually, the code block for the for-loop is at 8 spaces. The if-else is at 12 spaces? The current code:\n\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe want to replace the else line with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that is one line. Alternatively, we can break it:\n\n            else:\n                B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut the if is written in one line. We can do the same for the else.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is: \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", but we must write it as a complete line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines\", so we can write:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only to output the missing part. Since the else is already there, we only need to output the code that comes after the else (without the else). However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the else is missing. We are replacing the entire else branch.\n\nBut the provided code has:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire line with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that would be the entire line. So the missing code for program2.py is the string: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that goes in the place of the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we only output the part that is missing in the block. Since the else is already there, we only output the shift operation. But the shift operation must be at the correct indentation.\n\nLooking at the positive case: it is written as \"B[i][j] <<= 1\" at the same line as the if. So we do the same for the else.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", but we must include the same indentation as the if branch? Actually, the if branch is written without an extra indent. So we write:\n\n        B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that would be at 8 spaces? The current else is at 12 spaces? Actually, the entire line is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe \"else\" is at 12 spaces. We want to write:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nSo the entire line is 12 spaces for the else and then the code. But the problem says to output only the missing code. The missing code is the expression and assignment. However, the problem says \"missing lines\", so we output the entire line that replaces the current else line? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing one line with one line. So we output the entire line: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut that would be 12 spaces? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent. The for-loop is at 8 (two indents: 4 for the function, 4 for the for-loop). Then the if-else is at 12 (three indents). So 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we must match the existing code. The existing code for the positive case is:\n\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n\nSo we write the negative case similarly.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only outputting the one line that is missing.\n\nAlternatively, if we are only to output the code that goes in the else branch (without the else keyword), then we output \"B[i][j] >>= 1\" at the same indentation as the positive branch? But the positive branch is written in the same line as the if. So we cannot do that.\n\nAfter careful thought, I think the intended missing code for program2.py is the shift operation and the necessary else is already there. But the problem says the TODO is in the else branch. So we replace the comment with the shift. We can write:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut that is the entire line. Alternatively, we can break it:\n\n            else:\n                B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nBut the positive case is written in one line. So we do the same for the else.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nFor program1.py: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\nFor program2.py: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut wait, in program1.py, the line we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSo the indentation is 16 spaces? The existing line has 16 spaces (the comment). So we write 16 spaces and then the code? Actually, the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact string that replaces the TODO line.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has the else and the colon already. We are replacing the entire line? Actually, the current line is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire line with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the entire line: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nAlternatively, if we are only to output the expression for the else branch, then we output \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", but then we must also account for the indentation. The else branch is at the same level as the if branch, so we output the same as the if branch: \"B[i][j] <<= 1\" for positive, so for negative we output \"B[i][j] >>= 1\", without any extra indentation.\n\nBut the problem says \"missing lines\", so we output the entire line that is missing? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the else is one line. So we output that one line.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will output the entire line for program2.py because the TODO is on the same line as the else. So we replace the entire line.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n}\n\nBut wait, in program1.py, the line we are replacing is at 16 spaces? The existing code:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nis at 16 spaces. So we write 16 spaces and then the code. But the code we are writing is 16 spaces plus the code. So the string is 16 spaces and then \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\".\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the existing line is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nwhich is at 12 spaces. We replace it with:\n\n            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\n\nwhich is 12 spaces and then the code.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that should be placed in the program. So we output the entire line that is missing.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects only the expression (without the else and without the indentation) then we would output only the shift. But the problem says \"missing lines\", so we output the entire line.\n\nI think the intended output is the entire line for both.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the line we are replacing is a comment. We are replacing that comment with an assignment. The assignment must be at the same indentation. So we output the assignment with the same indentation.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, we are replacing the entire else line.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n}\n\nBut let me count the spaces:\n\nIn program1.py: \n   The for-loop: for i in range(1, n+1): -> 8 spaces\n   The if: if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF): -> 12 spaces\n   Then the body of the if: 16 spaces.\n\nSo the missing line is 16 spaces and then the assignment.\n\nIn program2.py:\n   The for-loop: for i in range(N): -> 8 spaces\n   Then the inner for-loop: for j in range(M): -> 12 spaces\n   Then the if-else: at 16 spaces? Actually, the code we see is:\n\n            if i == 0 and j == 0: continue\n            if i: B[i][j] |= B[i - 1][j]\n            if j: B[i][j] |= B[i][j - 1]\n            if A[i][j] > 0: B[i][j] <<= 1\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nEach of these lines is at 12 spaces? Because the inner for-loop is 12, and these are the body.\n\nSo the else line is at 12 spaces. Therefore, the replacement line should be at 12 spaces: \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\" (which is 12 spaces).\n\nBut the example I wrote above for program2.py used 12 spaces? Actually, the code in the problem for the else line is:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nand that is at 12 spaces? How many spaces? The problem does not specify, but we can count the existing code.\n\nIn the provided code for program2.py, the line after the inner for-loop is:\n\n        if i: B[i - 1] = None\n\nThat is at 8 spaces? Actually, the inner for-loop body is at 12 spaces. So the else line is at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is a string of 12 spaces and then \"else: B[i][j] >>= 1\", so 12+5 (for \"else:\") and then the shift? Actually, the entire line is 12 spaces and then the code.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the entire line that is missing, including the same indentation.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\nprogram1: 16 spaces + \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\nprogram2: 12 spaces + \"else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the missing lines.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the code without the leading spaces? But the problem says \"so that ... runs correctly\", so we must include the indentation.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\"\n}\n\nBut to be safe, let me count the spaces in the provided code for program1.py:\n\nThe code for the if statement is:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe first line of the if is at 12 spaces? Actually, the for-loop is at 8, then the if is at 12, and the body of the if is at 16. So the comment is at 16 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the else line is at 12 spaces.\n\nSo we write 16 spaces for program1 and 12 for program2.\n\nBut the string for program1 is 16 spaces and then the code, and for program2 is 12 spaces and then the code.\n\nTherefore, the JSON string for program1 is \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" (16 spaces) and for program2 is \"            else: B[i][j] >>= 1\" (12 spaces).\n\nBut note: the problem says the total grid cells is 10^6, so the shift operation in program2.py is efficient enough.\n\nWe output the JSON."
