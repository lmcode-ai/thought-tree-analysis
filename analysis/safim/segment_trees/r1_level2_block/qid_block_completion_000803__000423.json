But in our algorithm: \n  When i=2 and j=3: \n      Alice: indices0,1,2 -> 3 candies. Bob: indices3,4,5 -> 3 candies. So total=6. But how do we get that? Step0: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=2, then we move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=3, rsum=3 -> best=4, then we move both: i=2, j=3 -> lsum=6, rsum=6 -> best= (i+1)+(n-j) = 3 + (6-3) = 3+3=6.

But wait, we are moving both, so the total candies increases by 2? But we are also updating the sums. But the problem: we are looking for the maximum. So we update best every time we have an equality. But what if we have an equality at an earlier stage and then we don't get another? Then we have the best from the last equality? So we should record the maximum best? But note: the code currently sets best=0 initially. Then when we get an equality, we set best = ... and then we move. But we might get a larger best later? For example, in [1,1,1,1,1]: \n  First equality: at i=0, j=4: best=2. Then we move to i=1, j=3: then we get an equality: best=4. Then we move to i=2, j=2: break. So we output 4. But what if we have [1,2,3,3,2,1]? First: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=2. Then we move to i=1, j=4: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> best=4. Then we move to i=2, j=3: lsum=6, rsum=6 -> best=6. Then we break. So we output 6. But what if we have [1,2,3,4,5,6]? \n  i=0, j=5: 1<6 -> move i: i=1, lsum=1+2=3 -> 3<6 -> move i: i=2, lsum=3+3=6 -> now 6==6 -> best = 3 (from left: indices0,1,2) + 1 (from right: index5) = 4. Then we move both: i=3, j=4 -> then we add arr[3]=4 to lsum -> 10, and arr[4]=5 to rsum -> 6+5=11 -> then 10<11 -> move i: i=4, lsum=10+5=15 -> now 15>11 -> move j: j=3 -> but j becomes 3 and i=4 -> i>j -> break. But is there a better partition? Alice: [1,2,3] (6) and Bob: [6] (6) -> total 4 candies. Or Alice: [1,2,3,4] (10) and Bob: [5,6] (11) -> not equal. Or Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [6] (6) -> not equal. So 4 is the maximum. Therefore, the algorithm is: \n  We start with i=0, j=n-1, lsum=arr[0], rsum=arr[n-1], best=0. While i<j:\n      if lsum < rsum: \n          i += 1\n          if i < j: lsum += arr[i]   [but note: we must break if i>=j?",

But that would be the same as above? But wait: the array: [1,0,1]. Alice: [1] (left) and Bob: [1] (right) -> total 2 candies. Or Alice: [1,0] (1) and Bob: [1] (1) -> total 3 candies? But wait, Bob can only take contiguous from the right? So Bob would have to take [0,1]? Then that's 0+1=1. So that matches Alice's 1. Then total candies: 2 (Alice) + 2 (Bob) = 4?

Then: left=1, right=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we do: \n        ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we add arr[1] to lsum -> lsum=1+0=1, left=2. Then left=2, right=1 -> break. Then we check: if lsum==rsum (1==1) -> then ans = 2 + (3-1-1)=2+1=3. But how does this work? The state after the loop: \n      Alice has eaten [0,1] -> left=2 means she has eaten up to index1? Bob has eaten [2] -> right=1 means he has eaten from index2? Then the candies eaten: Alice: 2, Bob: 1 -> total 3. The formula: left = 2 -> number of candies Alice ate = left = 2? Bob: the candies he ate: from index=right+1 to n-1? But right=1, so from index2 to n-1? which is 1 candy? So total = 2+1=3. But in our provided code, we are not using that formula. We are using: \n      best = (i+1) + (n - j) This means: \n      Alice: from 0 to i -> i+1 candies. Bob: from j to n-1 -> n - j candies. But in the known solution, they use: \n      ans = left + (n-1 - right) \n  which is: \n      Alice: from 0 to left-1 -> left candies. Bob: from right+1 to n-1 -> n-1 - right candies. So the two are different. In our provided code, we are starting with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]. So we have already taken the first and last candy. In the known solution, they start with lsum=0 and rsum=0, and then they add the first/last candy and then move the pointer.",

But the formula: \n        Alice: has eaten i candies (from 0 to i-1) -> i candies. Bob: has eaten from j+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1-j candies. total = i + (n-1-j)\n\n  This is valid even after the loop.

It works. But note: the known solution in the example above did not have the condition for the while loop as i<=j and then after the loop an extra check.

For [2,-1,-1,0]: \n              sum=0, then we remove the trailing zeros -> becomes [2,-1,-1]\n              then prefix sums: \n                  i0:2 -> valid\n                  i1:2-1=1 -> valid\n                  i2:1-1=0 -> valid\n              then we say 'Yes'. But the example says: \n              One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below. So it should be \"Yes\". However, the example also says: \n              \"For the first test case: ... and the pointer won't be on the first element\" -> so it's \"No\". The first test case in the example is: \n              \"The first test case\" -> array not given, but the example input has t test cases. The sample input might be:\n\n             4\n             2\n             1 -1\n             4\n             2 -1 -1 0\n             3\n             1 2 3\n             4\n             0 0 0 0\n\n          For the first: [1,-1]: \n              sum=0, then remove trailing zeros: becomes [1,-1]\n              prefix: \n                 i0:1 -> valid\n                 i1:0 -> valid\n              then we say 'Yes'. But the example note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so it should be \"No\". There is a disconnect.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right).\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers, one starting at the left (i) and one at the right (j). We maintain two sums: lsum (for Alice) and rsum (for Bob). We move the pointers until they meet. The idea is:\n- If lsum < rsum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the candy's weight to lsum.\n- If rsum < lsum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the candy's weight to rsum.\n- When lsum == rsum, we have a candidate for the total candies eaten: (i+1) from the left and (n - j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n - j). We record this in 'best' and then we try to see if we can extend by moving both pointers? But note: the problem says they cannot skip, so we have to be cautious.\n\nHowever, note the note: in the fourth test case, the answer is 7. The example: \n  Alice: [7, 3, 20] (from the left) and Bob: [10, 8, 11, 1] (from the right). They each eat 30. The total candies is 3+4=7.\n\nBut observe: the array is [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]. \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> left part, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> right part. The middle candy (5) is not eaten.\n\nIn the code, when lsum == rsum, we record the total candies as (i+1) + (n - j) and then we try to move both pointers? But note the condition: we are in a while loop with i<j.\n\nThe provided code has a TODO in the else block (when lsum == rsum). We must update best and then how to proceed? We can then move both pointers to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note: if we move both, we break the current equality. However, we can try to move both and then check again. But note: we are allowed to have non-overlapping segments. We can update best and then move both pointers to see if we can get a larger total.\n\nSo in the else block:\n  best = (i+1) + (n - j)   [because Alice has eaten i+1 candies (from 0 to i) and Bob has eaten n - j candies (from j to n-1)]\n  Then we move both pointers: i += 1 and j -= 1, and update lsum and rsum? But note: we must add the new candy to lsum and rsum? However, we are moving both at the same time? But what if moving one breaks the equality? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total weight must be equal. We are currently equal. Then we move the left pointer to the next candy (so we add arr[i+1] to lsum) and move the right pointer to the next candy to the left (so we add arr[j-1] to rsum). Then we continue the while loop.\n\nBut caution: we must check that i < j after moving? Also, we are going to add the new candies. However, what if we move i and j and then the sums become unequal? Then we will adjust by moving one of the pointers until they become equal again? But note: we are only updating best when they are equal. We can do:\n\n  best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because we have a valid partition\n  Then we move both: i += 1, j -= 1, and then update lsum and rsum? But wait, we are going to add the next candy to lsum and the next candy to rsum? Actually, we are going to add the candy at i (which is the new i) to lsum? But note: we are at a state where we have lsum = rsum. Then we move i to i+1 and j to j-1. Then we add arr[i] to lsum and arr[j] to rsum? But that might break the equality. However, we are going to continue the while loop which will adjust until the next time they are equal.\n\nBut note: we must update best only when we have an equality. And we are going to record the maximum total candies.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do a two-pointer that runs in O(n) per test case? But note: the while loop condition is i<j, and we move at least one pointer each time, so it's O(n).\n\nBut what if we don't move both? Actually, we can update best and then move both? Why move both? Because we want to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note: the segments must be contiguous from the left and from the right. If we have a current equality, we can try to extend by one on the left and one on the right? But that might lead to a new equality? \n\nHowever, consider: \n  [1,1,1,1,1] \n  Initially: i=0, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best = 1 (from left) + 1 (from right) = 2.\n  Then we move both: i=1, j=3. Then lsum = 1+1=2, rsum=1+1=2 -> best = 2+2 = 4.\n  Then we move both: i=2, j=2 -> but now i==j, we break. Then we output 4? But the answer should be 4? Actually, we can have Alice take the first two and Bob take the last two? That's 4.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,3,3,2,1]? \n  i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=2, then move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> best= 2+2=4, then move both: i=2, j=3 -> lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> best= 3+2=5? Wait: \n      Alice: [1,2,3] -> 3 candies, Bob: [1,2,3] (from the right: the last three: [3,2,1] but note: the array is [1,2,3,3,2,1] so Bob would take [1,2,3] from the right? Actually, Bob takes the last three: [3,2,1] -> which is the same as [1,2,3] in reverse? But the weights: 3+2+1=6. So total candies: 3+3=6? But we have 6 candies? But the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So the middle two (the two 3's) are adjacent? Actually, the array: \n        index0:1, index1:2, index2:3, index3:3, index4:2, index5:1.\n      Alice: [1,2,3] (indices0,1,2) -> weight=6.\n      Bob: [1,2,3] (indices5,4,3) -> weight=1+2+3=6? But wait: the candy at index3 is 3, and index4 is 2, index5 is 1. So Bob's candies: [1,2,3] in the order of eating? But the problem says from the right: so he eats the candy at index5 first? Then index4, then index3. So the weights in the order he eats: 1, then 2, then 3. So total 6. \n      So total candies: 3 (Alice) + 3 (Bob) = 6.\n\nBut in our algorithm: \n  When i=2 and j=3: \n      Alice: indices0,1,2 -> 3 candies.\n      Bob: indices3,4,5 -> 3 candies.\n      So total=6.\n\nBut how do we get that? \n  Step0: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=2, then we move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=3, rsum=3 -> best=4, then we move both: i=2, j=3 -> lsum=6, rsum=6 -> best= (i+1)+(n-j) = 3 + (6-3) = 3+3=6.\n\nSo we update best to 6. Then we move both: i=3, j=2 -> now i>=j, so we break.\n\nSo the algorithm: \n  When lsum==rsum:\n      best = (i+1) + (n - j)   [because Alice has eaten i+1 candies (from 0 to i) and Bob has eaten n - j candies (from j to n-1)]\n      Then we move both: i += 1, j -= 1, and then update lsum and rsum? But wait, we are going to add the next candy? Actually, we are going to add the candy at the new i to lsum? But we haven't added it yet. In the current state, we are at i and j. We then update: \n          i = i+1\n          j = j-1\n          and then we add arr[i] to lsum? But note: we are at the next step. However, we must be cautious: we are in a while loop that checks i<j. Also, we must update lsum and rsum only if we move the pointers? \n\nBut in the current code, when we are in the else block, we do:\n  best = ... \n  then we do:\n      i += 1\n      lsum += arr[i]   -> but wait, if i was 0 and we do i=1, then we add arr[1]? But we already had lsum including arr[0]. Now we are going to add arr[1]? But we haven't processed arr[1] yet? \n\nActually, the code structure is: \n  We start with i=0, j=n-1, lsum=arr[0], rsum=arr[n-1].\n  Then we enter the while loop (i<j).\n\n  In the else block (lsum==rsum), we set best = (i+1)+(n-j). Then we do:\n      i += 1\n      j -= 1\n      But then we must update lsum and rsum? However, if we move i, we have to add the new candy? But note: we are moving both. But what if i becomes >= j? Then we break. Otherwise, we add the new candy to lsum and the new candy to rsum? \n\nBut wait: we are at a state where we have lsum and rsum equal. Then we move i to i+1 and j to j-1. Then we must add arr[i] to lsum and arr[j] to rsum? But that is the next candy for Alice and the next candy for Bob? \n\nBut note: we are not skipping: we are including the next candy for Alice and the next candy for Bob. \n\nHowever, what if after moving, i becomes j? Then we break and we don't add. But if i < j, then we add both. \n\nBut what if we don't move both? The problem says they can choose any number from the left and right, but contiguous. So we are free to stop at any time. We are looking for the maximum total candies. \n\nSo the else block should be:\n\n    else:\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total candies\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        # If we have moved beyond the array, break? But we have the condition i<j at the top of the loop.\n        # But if i becomes >= j, we break. Otherwise, we update the sums?\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            break   # actually, we break because the while condition will break, but we break explicitly to avoid adding out of bounds? \n\nBut wait, we don't break the loop, we just update the sums and then the while loop condition will check again. However, if i>=j, we break the loop. But we can avoid the update if i>=j? Actually, we can do:\n\n    else:\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut what if i==j? Then we break. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    else:\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n            rsum += arr[j]\n        # else: we break in the next condition of the while loop.\n\nBut note: if i==j, we break the while loop. If i>j, we break. So we can simply update the sums only if i<j? But if i==j, we break without updating. \n\nBut what if we have an odd number of candies and we meet in the middle? Then we break. \n\nBut what if we have an even number? Then we update and then continue.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious: if we update the sums and then the next iteration we might have lsum and rsum not equal? Then we adjust. \n\nHowever, there is a problem: what if after updating, we break the condition? Then we break. But we have updated best only when we had an equality. \n\nBut what if we have a sequence that has multiple equalities? For example, [1,2,1,2,1,2]? \n  We start: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> so we move j? No, wait: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> so lsum < rsum -> we move i to 1: lsum=1+2=3, then compare: 3>2 -> then we move j to 4: rsum=2+1=3 -> now equal: best = (1+1) + (6-4) = 2+2=4. Then we move both: i=2, j=3. Then we add arr[2]=1 to lsum -> lsum=4, and arr[3]=2 to rsum -> rsum=5. Then we have 4<5 -> move i to 3: but wait, i is now 2, we add arr[2]? Actually, we already added arr[2] when we updated? \n\nWait, in the else block we did:\n  best = 4\n  i becomes 1+1=2, j becomes 4-1=3.\n  Then we check i(2)<j(3) -> true, so we add arr[2] to lsum -> lsum=3+1=4, and arr[3] to rsum -> rsum=3+2=5.\n\nThen we are in the while loop: \n  Now 4<5 -> so we move i to 3: lsum=4+arr[3]=4+2=6. Then i=3, j=3 -> break? \n  Then we don't get the next equality? \n\nBut note: the array: [1,2,1,2,1,2]. \n  We have an equality at: \n      Alice: [1,2] (from the left: indices0,1) -> 3\n      Bob: [1,2] (from the right: indices5,4) -> 3 -> total 4 candies.\n  Then we try to extend: \n      Alice: [1,2,1] -> 4, Bob: [1,2,2] -> 5 -> not equal.\n      Then we extend Alice: [1,2,1,2] -> 6, Bob: [1,2] -> 3 -> not equal? \n      Then we extend Bob? But we can't because we are at the same pointer? \n\nActually, the next step: after we moved to i=2 and j=3, we have:\n  Alice: [1,2,1] (indices0,1,2) -> 4\n  Bob: [2,1,2] (indices3,4,5) -> 5? But wait, Bob eats from the right: so he eats the last two: [2,1] (which we already had) and then we added the next one to the left? Actually, Bob's segment is from j to n-1. Initially, Bob had [2] (at index5) and then we added the next to the left: index4 (1) -> so Bob has [1,2] (from index5 and index4). Then when we moved j to 3, we added the candy at index3 (which is 2) to Bob? So Bob now has [2,1,2]? But that's not contiguous from the right? Actually, Bob's segment is contiguous from the right: indices5,4,3. So the weights: 2 (index5), 1 (index4), 2 (index3) -> total 5.\n\nBut we don't have an equality at 4 and 5. Then we move i to 3: so Alice: [1,2,1,2] -> 6, and Bob: [2,1,2] -> 5 -> then we move j? j is already 3, so we can't move j to the left? Then we break. \n\nSo the maximum is 4. But is there a better partition? \n  What if Alice takes [1,2,1] (weight=4) and Bob takes [2] (weight=2)? -> not equal.\n  What if Alice takes [1,2] (3) and Bob takes [2] (2)? -> not equal.\n  What if Alice takes [1] (1) and Bob takes [2] (2)? -> not equal.\n  What if Alice takes [1,2,1,2] (6) and Bob takes [2,1,2] (5)? -> not equal.\n\nBut wait: what if we do not take the entire contiguous block? The problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (contiguous from the left) and Bob from the right (contiguous from the right). They cannot skip. \n\nSo the only possibility for equality is the one we found: 3 and 3? \n\nBut note: the example in the problem: the fourth test case: \n  [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] -> Alice: [7,3,20] (30) and Bob: [10,8,11,1] (30). That's 3 and 4.\n\nSo we must update best only when we have an equality. \n\nBut what if we have multiple equalities? We want the maximum total candies. So we update best every time we have an equality. The last equality we get might be the largest? \n\nBut note: as we move the pointers, the total candies we have recorded is (i+1)+(n-j). This is increasing? Actually, as we move both pointers, we are adding one candy to Alice and one candy to Bob? But wait, we are moving both, so the total candies increases by 2? But we are also updating the sums. \n\nBut the problem: we are looking for the maximum. So we update best every time we have an equality. \n\nBut what if we have an equality at an earlier stage and then we don't get another? Then we have the best from the last equality? \n\nSo we should record the maximum best? \n\nBut note: the code currently sets best=0 initially. Then when we get an equality, we set best = ... and then we move. But we might get a larger best later? \n\nFor example, in [1,1,1,1,1]: \n  First equality: at i=0, j=4: best=2.\n  Then we move to i=1, j=3: then we get an equality: best=4.\n  Then we move to i=2, j=2: break. So we output 4.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,3,3,2,1]? \n  First: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=2.\n  Then we move to i=1, j=4: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> best=4.\n  Then we move to i=2, j=3: lsum=6, rsum=6 -> best=6.\n  Then we break.\n\nSo we output 6.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,3,4,5,6]? \n  i=0, j=5: 1<6 -> move i: i=1, lsum=1+2=3 -> 3<6 -> move i: i=2, lsum=3+3=6 -> now 6==6 -> best = 3 (from left: indices0,1,2) + 1 (from right: index5) = 4.\n  Then we move both: i=3, j=4 -> then we add arr[3]=4 to lsum -> 10, and arr[4]=5 to rsum -> 6+5=11 -> then 10<11 -> move i: i=4, lsum=10+5=15 -> now 15>11 -> move j: j=3 -> but j becomes 3 and i=4 -> i>j -> break.\n\nBut is there a better partition? \n  Alice: [1,2,3] (6) and Bob: [6] (6) -> total 4 candies.\n  Or Alice: [1,2,3,4] (10) and Bob: [5,6] (11) -> not equal.\n  Or Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [6] (6) -> not equal.\n\nSo 4 is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is: \n  We start with i=0, j=n-1, lsum=arr[0], rsum=arr[n-1], best=0.\n  While i<j:\n      if lsum < rsum: \n          i += 1\n          if i < j: lsum += arr[i]   [but note: we must break if i>=j? Actually, we break the loop condition, but we update only if i<j? But if i==j, we break and don't update. But if i<j, we update and then continue?]\n      elif rsum < lsum:\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j: rsum += arr[j]   [similarly]\n      else: \n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total\n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break   # or we can break because the while condition will break? \n\n  Then we print best.\n\nBut note: what if we never have an equality? Then best remains 0? But the problem says: if they cannot eat the same non-zero weight, the answer is 0. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if we have an equality at the last step? For example, [1,1]: \n  i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2.\n  Then we move i to 1, j to 0 -> then i>j -> break. Then we output 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,0,1]? \n  i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best= (0+1)+(3-2)=1+1=2.\n  Then we move i to 1, j to 1 -> then we break. But note: we can also have Alice take [1,0] and Bob take [0,1]? But that would be the same as above? \n\nBut wait: the array: [1,0,1]. \n  Alice: [1] (left) and Bob: [1] (right) -> total 2 candies.\n  Or Alice: [1,0] (1) and Bob: [1] (1) -> total 3 candies? But wait, Bob can only take contiguous from the right? So Bob would have to take [0,1]? Then that's 0+1=1. So that matches Alice's 1. Then total candies: 2 (Alice) + 2 (Bob) = 4? But the array has only 3 candies. \n\nActually, Bob's segment: from the right, contiguous: he can take [1] (the last candy) or [0,1] (the last two) or [1,0,1] (the entire array). But if Alice takes the first two, then Bob can only take the last one? Because the middle candy (0) is taken by Alice? \n\nSo the condition: they cannot eat the same candy. So if Alice takes [1,0] (indices0 and 1), then Bob can only take the last candy (index2) -> weight=1. Then Alice=1, Bob=1 -> total candies=3? \n\nBut the problem: the total candies they eat is the number of candies. Alice ate 2, Bob ate 1 -> total 3? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total\". So 3.\n\nBut our algorithm: \n  We start: i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best = 1 (from left) + 1 (from right) = 2.\n  Then we move both: i=1, j=1 -> then we break. \n\nBut we missed the possibility that Alice can take two candies and Bob one? \n\nBut note: the algorithm: \n  When we have an equality at i=0 and j=2, we record 2. Then we move both to i=1 and j=1. Then we break. \n\nBut we did not consider that we can stop at the current state? The problem: they can choose any number. So we don't have to extend? But we are trying to maximize the total candies. \n\nHowever, the algorithm continues to try to extend? But in this case, we extended and then we broke? \n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to stop at any time. So the state at i=0 and j=2 is valid and we recorded 2. But there is a state with 3 candies: \n  Alice: [1,0] -> weight=1, Bob: [1] -> weight=1 -> total 3 candies.\n\nHow do we capture that? \n\nIn our algorithm, we are moving the pointers until we get an equality. But when we get an equality, we record the total candies at that state. Then we move both pointers to see if we can get a larger total? But we are not considering that we might have a valid state that is not extended? \n\nBut note: the problem: they eat in a row from the left and from the right. The segments are contiguous and non-overlapping. The state we consider is: \n  Alice has taken [0..i] and Bob has taken [j..n-1]. \n\nThe state (i=0, j=2) is: Alice has taken [0] and Bob has taken [2]. \nThe state (i=1, j=2) is: Alice has taken [0,1] and Bob has taken [2]. \nBut wait, we never consider state (i=1, j=2) because we moved both pointers after the first equality? \n\nSo we must not move both pointers? We must consider that we can have multiple possibilities? \n\nBut note: the two pointers are independent. The problem is asking for the maximum total candies. We are using a two-pointer method that starts at the ends and moves inward. The standard solution for this problem (which is known) is:\n\n  i = -1, j = n\n  lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n  best = 0\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because Alice has eaten i+1 candies (from 0 to i) and Bob has eaten n - j candies (from j to n-1)\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      elif lsum < rsum:\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      else:\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\n  But note: this might go beyond? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  i = 0, j = n-1\n  lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n  best = 0\n  while i <= j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = i + (n - 1 - j)   # but wait, we haven't taken the current candy? \n\nActually, the known solution for \"Candies\" (Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) C) is:\n\n  int t;\n  cin >> t;\n  while (t--) {\n      int n;\n      cin >> n;\n      vector<int> a(n);\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          cin >> a[i];\n      }\n      long long lsum = 0, rsum = 0;\n      int i = 0, j = n-1;\n      int ans = 0;\n      while (i <= j) {\n          if (lsum < rsum) {\n              lsum += a[i];\n              i++;\n          } else if (rsum < lsum) {\n              rsum += a[j];\n              j--;\n          } else {\n              ans = i + (n - 1 - j);\n              lsum += a[i];\n              i++;\n          }\n      }\n      if (lsum == rsum) {\n          ans = i + (n - 1 - j);\n      }\n      cout << ans << endl;\n  }\n\nBut wait, that doesn't work for the example [1,0,1]? \n\nAlternatively, a known solution:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      left = 0\n      right = n-1\n      lsum = 0\n      rsum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while left <= right:\n          if lsum < rsum:\n              lsum += arr[left]\n              left += 1\n          elif rsum < lsum:\n              rsum += arr[right]\n              right -= 1\n          else:\n              # When they are equal, we record the number of candies eaten so far: left + (n-1-right)\n              ans = left + (n-1-right)\n              lsum += arr[left]\n              left += 1\n      # After the loop, if we broke because of left>right, we might have an equality at the end?\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          ans = left + (n-1-right)\n      print(ans)\n\nBut let's test [1,0,1]:\n  left=0, right=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal -> ans = 0 + (3-1-2)=0+0=0? Then we add arr[0] to lsum -> lsum=1, left=1.\n  Then: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> so we do: rsum += arr[2]=1, right=1.\n  Then: left=1, right=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2? Then we add arr[1] to lsum -> lsum=1+0=1, left=2.\n  Then left=2, right=1 -> break. Then we check: if lsum==rsum? 1==1 -> then ans = 2 + (3-1-1)=2+1=3? \n  Then we output 3.\n\nBut wait, the state when we set ans=2 was when left=1, right=1: that means Alice has taken [0] (index0) and Bob has taken [2] (index2) -> total 2 candies. Then we set ans=2. Then we add the middle candy to Alice? Then we break and then we check: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we set ans=3. \n\nSo we output 3.\n\nTherefore, we must do:\n\n  We record an equality whenever we see one, and then we continue. And after the loop, we check again.\n\nBut the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a single pass.\n\nBut the provided code in program1.py does not have the after-loop check. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  while i < j:   # note: we are using i<j, not i<=j\n      ... \n\n  and then after the loop, we don't check? \n\nBut in the known solution, they use i<=j. \n\nLet me check with [1,0,1] in the provided code structure:\n\n  We start: i=0, j=2, lsum=arr[0]=1, rsum=arr[2]=1 -> then we enter the else block: \n        best = (0+1) + (3-2) = 1+1=2.\n        Then we move i to 1, j to 1 -> then we break because i==j -> so we output 2.\n\n  But the expected answer is 3.\n\nSo we must record the state when we have an equality even if we are at the last step? \n\nBut in the else block, we record and then move. But then we break. \n\nWe need to record the state when we have an equality at the last step? \n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition to i<=j? But then we might have i==j and we update? \n\nBut the problem: if i==j, then the candy at i is not eaten by either? Because Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy. So we cannot eat the middle candy? \n\nBut in [1,0,1]: \n  We want to assign the middle candy to Alice? Then Alice: [1,0] and Bob: [1]. Then the middle candy (0) is eaten by Alice. \n\nBut in our two-pointer method, we are not assigning the middle candy to anyone? \n\nIn the known solution that uses i<=j, they do:\n\n  while left<=right:\n      if lsum==rsum:\n          ans = left + (n-1 - right)   # because Alice has eaten [0..left-1] and Bob has eaten [right+1..n-1]\n          lsum += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n      ...\n\n  Then after the loop, if lsum==rsum, they update ans again.\n\nIn our state: \n  Initially: left=0, right=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> then we do the else block: \n        ans = 0 + (3-1-2)=0 -> then we add arr[0] to lsum -> lsum=1, left=1.\n  Then: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do: rsum += arr[2]=1, right=1.\n  Then: left=1, right=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we do: \n        ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we add arr[1] to lsum -> lsum=1+0=1, left=2.\n  Then left=2, right=1 -> break. Then we check: if lsum==rsum (1==1) -> then ans = 2 + (3-1-1)=2+1=3.\n\nBut how does this work? \n  The state after the loop: \n      Alice has eaten [0,1] -> left=2 means she has eaten up to index1? \n      Bob has eaten [2] -> right=1 means he has eaten from index2? \n      Then the candies eaten: Alice: 2, Bob: 1 -> total 3.\n\n  The formula: left = 2 -> number of candies Alice ate = left = 2? \n      Bob: the candies he ate: from index=right+1 to n-1? But right=1, so from index2 to n-1? which is 1 candy? \n      So total = 2+1=3.\n\nBut in our provided code, we are not using that formula. We are using: \n      best = (i+1) + (n - j) \n  This means: \n      Alice: from 0 to i -> i+1 candies.\n      Bob: from j to n-1 -> n - j candies.\n\nBut in the known solution, they use: \n      ans = left + (n-1 - right) \n  which is: \n      Alice: from 0 to left-1 -> left candies.\n      Bob: from right+1 to n-1 -> n-1 - right candies.\n\nSo the two are different. \n\nIn our provided code, we are starting with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]. So we have already taken the first and last candy. \n\nIn the known solution, they start with lsum=0 and rsum=0, and then they add the first/last candy and then move the pointer. \n\nWe must decide which one to use. \n\nGiven the provided code structure, we have:\n\n  i=0, j=n-1\n  lsum = arr[0]\n  rsum = arr[n-1]\n\n  while i<j:\n      if lsum < rsum:\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      elif rsum < lsum:\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n      else:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break\n\n  print(best)\n\nThis does not work for [1,0,1] because it outputs 2 instead of 3.\n\nWe need to fix it. \n\nWe can change the approach to start with no candies and then expand. But the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are guaranteed the sum of n is 200000, so we can change the approach.\n\nBut the provided code is already started. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  best = 0\n  i = -1\n  j = n\n  lsum = 0\n  rsum = 0\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because Alice has eaten [0..i] (i+1 candies) and Bob has eaten [j..n-1] (n-j candies)\n          # We can try to extend: move both\n          i += 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n          else:\n              break\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break\n      elif lsum < rsum:\n          i += 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n          else:\n              break\n      else:\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break\n\n  print(best)\n\nBut let's test [1,0,1]:\n  i=-1, j=3 (n=3), lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equal: \n        best = (0) + (3-3)=0.\n        i becomes 0, then lsum=1.\n        j becomes 2, then rsum=arr[2]=1.\n        Then i=0, j=2 -> i<j -> true, so we continue.\n  Then: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal: \n        best = (0+1) + (3-2)=1+1=2.\n        i becomes 1, then lsum=1+0=1.\n        j becomes 1, then rsum=1+arr[1]? But wait, we are at j=2, then we do j=1, and then we add arr[1] to rsum? But that would be 1+0=1.\n        Then i=1, j=1 -> i>=j -> break.\n  Then we output 2.\n\nBut we want 3. \n\nThe state at the end: \n  Alice: [0,1] -> indices0 and 1 -> lsum=1.\n  Bob: [1,2] -> indices1 and 2? But wait, we added arr[1] to Bob? But index1 is the middle candy. We cannot give it to both. \n\nThis is the problem: we are moving the pointers and adding the candy at the new pointer. But when we move the left pointer to 1, we add arr[1] to Alice. When we move the right pointer to 1, we add arr[1] to Bob. That's the same candy.\n\nSo we must not move both at the same time? \n\nThe known solution that works for [1,0,1] is the one that does not move both at the same time. It moves one at a time and then checks. \n\nGiven the constraints, we can change the approach. But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a single pass.\n\nLet me implement the known solution in the provided code structure:\n\n  We'll use:\n      i = 0\n      j = n-1\n      lsum = 0\n      rsum = 0\n      best = 0\n      while i <= j:\n          if lsum == rsum:\n              best = i + (n-1 - j)   # because Alice has eaten i candies (from 0 to i-1) and Bob has eaten n-1-j candies (from j+1 to n-1)\n          if lsum <= rsum:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              i += 1\n          else:\n              rsum += arr[j]\n              j -= 1\n\n      if lsum == rsum and i<=j+1:   # but wait, after the loop, we might have an equality?\n          best = i + (n-1 - j)\n\n      print(best)\n\nBut let's test [1,0,1]:\n  i=0, j=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> then we do: \n        if lsum==rsum: best=0+ (3-1-2)=0.\n        then since lsum<=rsum, we do: lsum=0+1=1, i=1.\n  Then: i=1, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then we do: else: rsum=0+1=1, j=1.\n  Then: i=1, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we do: \n        if lsum==rsum: best=1+(3-1-1)=1+1=2.\n        then lsum<=rsum: true, so lsum=1+0=1, i=2.\n  Then: i=2, j=1: break.\n  Then we check: if lsum==rsum and i<=j+1: 1==1 and 2<=2 -> true, then best=2+(3-1-1)=2+1=3.\n  Then output 3.\n\nBut what about [1,1,1,1,1]? \n  i=0, j=4: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> best=0, then lsum=1, i=1.\n  i=1, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=0 -> then rsum=1, j=3.\n  i=1, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=1+(5-1-3)=1+1=2, then lsum=1+1=2, i=2.\n  i=2, j=3: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> then rsum=1+1=2, j=2.\n  i=2, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> best=2+(5-1-2)=2+2=4, then lsum<=rsum: true, lsum=2+1=3, i=3.\n  i=3, j=2: break.\n  Then check: lsum=3, rsum=2 -> not equal, so best remains 4.\n\n  But the answer should be 4? because they can eat 4 candies: Alice two and Bob two? \n  But wait, the entire array is 5 candies. They can eat 4 candies: \n        Alice: [1,1] (2) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> total 4.\n  Or can they eat more? \n        Alice: [1,1,1] (3) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n        Alice: [1,1] (2) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> not equal.\n        Alice: [1,1,1,1] (4) and Bob: [1] (1) -> not equal.\n  So 4 is the maximum.\n\n  But the known solution outputs 4.\n\n  However, the example in the problem: the second test case: \n        n=4, [1,1,1,1] -> the example says answer=6? \n        But wait, the example says: \n            \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n        But wait, the second test case is not [1,1,1,1]! It is a different array.\n\n  The second test case: \n        n=4, but the array is not given in the example? Actually, the example says: \n            \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n        And the fourth test case: \n            n=8, [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\n  Let me test the known solution on the fourth test case:\n\n        arr = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n        We want: Alice: [7,3,20] (30), Bob: [10,8,11,1] (30) -> total candies=3+4=7.\n\n        How does the known solution work?\n\n        i=0, j=7: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> best=0, then lsum<=rsum -> true, so lsum=7, i=1.\n        i=1, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=0 -> then rsum=1, j=6.\n        i=1, j=6: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> then lsum=7+3=10, i=2.\n        i=2, j=6: lsum=10, rsum=1 -> then rsum=1+11=12, j=5.\n        i=2, j=5: lsum=10, rsum=12 -> then lsum=10+20=30, i=3.\n        i=3, j=5: lsum=30, rsum=12 -> then rsum=12+8=20, j=4.\n        i=3, j=4: lsum=30, rsum=20 -> then rsum=20+10=30, j=3.\n        i=3, j=3: lsum=30, rsum=30 -> best=3 + (8-1-3)=3+4=7, then since lsum<=rsum, we do: lsum=30+5=35, i=4.\n        i=4, j=3: break.\n        Then we check: lsum=35, rsum=30 -> not equal, so best=7.\n\n        So it outputs 7.\n\n  Therefore, we can change the code to this known solution.\n\n  But the provided code structure is different. We are given:\n\n      i = input()\n      inp = []\n      for a in range(0,int(i)):\n          inp += [[input(), input()]]\n\n      def maxx(arr):\n          if arr == []:\n              return 0\n          else:\n              return max(arr)\n\n      for s in inp:\n          n = int(s[0])\n          arr = [int(x) for x in s[1].split()]\n\n          i = 0\n          j = n-1\n          lsum = 0   # we start with 0\n          rsum = 0\n\n          best = 0\n          while i <= j:   # we change to i<=j\n              if lsum == rsum:\n                  best = i + (n - 1 - j)   # because Alice has eaten i candies (indices0..i-1), Bob has eaten n-1-j candies (indices j+1..n-1)\n              if lsum <= rsum:\n                  lsum += arr[i]\n                  i += 1\n              else:\n                  rsum += arr[j]\n                  j -= 1\n\n          if lsum == rsum:   # after the loop, check again\n              best = i + (n - 1 - j)\n\n          print(best)\n\n  But note: the condition after the loop: we don't need the i<=j+1? because after the loop, i has been incremented and j decremented, and we have i>j. But the formula: \n        Alice: has eaten i candies (from 0 to i-1) -> i candies.\n        Bob: has eaten from j+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1-j candies.\n        total = i + (n-1-j)\n\n  This is valid even after the loop.\n\n  Let me test [1,0,1] in this code:\n\n      n=3, arr=[1,0,1]\n      i=0, j=2: \n          lsum=0, rsum=0 -> best=0 (because i=0, n-1-j = 3-1-2=0) -> then lsum<=rsum -> true, so lsum=1, i=1.\n      i=1, j=2:\n          lsum=1, rsum=0 -> not equal, then since lsum>rsum, we do: rsum=1, j=1.\n      i=1, j=1:\n          lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2, then lsum<=rsum -> true, so lsum=1+0=1, i=2.\n      then i=2, j=1: break the loop.\n      then check: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then best=2 + (3-1-1)=2+1=3.\n      output 3.\n\n  It works.\n\n  But note: the known solution in the example above did not have the condition for the while loop as i<=j and then after the loop an extra check. \n\n  So we will change the code in program1.py to this.\n\n  However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and this while loop runs at most n steps per test case, and the sum of n is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, we will replace the while loop and the initialization of lsum and rsum.\n\n  But note: the provided code has a function maxx that is not used. We can remove it? But the problem says to output only the missing code. We are to complete the TODO, but the TODO is in the else block. However, the current structure is not working. \n\n  Given the instructions: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n  But the TODO is in the else block. However, we are changing the entire approach. \n\n  But the instructions: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n  We are allowed to change the code as long as we fill in the missing parts? \n\n  However, the TODO is only in the else block. But the current code has a while loop that is not working for the sample [1,0,1]. \n\n  Since the problem is to output only the missing code, and the TODO is only in the else block, but the else block is not sufficient, we might need to change more. \n\n  But the instructions: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n  And the provided code has:\n\n      while i < j:\n          if lsum < rsum:\n              i += 1\n              lsum += arr[i]\n          elif rsum < lsum:\n              j -= 1\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to complete the TODO. But we see that the entire while loop approach is flawed. \n\n  Given the complexity, and the fact that the known solution is different, we might need to change the while loop condition and add an after-loop check. \n\n  But the instructions: we are to fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\n  However, the TODO is only in the else block. But the else block is not the only issue. \n\n  We have two options:\n  1. Output the else block and also change the while loop condition and add the after-loop check? But that might be more than the TODO.\n  2. Realize that the provided while loop can be fixed by not moving both pointers in the else block, but only one, and then we might get the correct answer? \n\n  Let me try to fix the provided while loop for [1,0,1]:\n\n  We start: i=0, j=2, lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else block: \n        best = (0+1)+(3-2)=2.\n        Now, instead of moving both, we move only one? But which one? \n        We can try moving the left pointer: \n            i=1, lsum=1+0=1.\n        Then we are in the state: i=1, j=2, lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else block: \n            best = (1+1)+(3-2)=2+1=3.\n        Then we move the left pointer again: i=2, lsum=1+1=2 -> then i=2, j=2: break.\n        Then output 3.\n\n  But what if we move the right pointer in the else block? \n        first else: best=2, then move j: j=1, rsum=1+0=1.\n        then state: i=0, j=1, lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else block: best = (0+1)+(3-1)=1+2=3.\n        then move j: j=0, rsum=1+? -> but then i=0, j=0: break.\n\n  So we can do in the else block: \n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        # We can move either pointer? But we want to continue. \n        # Let's move the left pointer.\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But then for [1,0,1]:\n        first else: best=2, then i=1, lsum=1+0=1.\n        then we are in the while loop: i=1, j=2, lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else block: best= (1+1)+(3-2)=2+1=3.\n        then i=2, and then we break because i>=j? \n        output 3.\n\n  But what about [1,1,1,1,1]? \n        i=0, j=4: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else: best= (0+1)+(5-4)=1+1=2, then move i: i=1, lsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=4: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> then we move j: j=3, rsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=3: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> else: best= (1+1)+(5-3)=2+2=4, then move i: i=2, lsum=2+1=3.\n        then i=2, j=3: lsum=3, rsum=2 -> move j: j=2, rsum=2+? -> but then i=2, j=2: break.\n        output 4.\n\n  And the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]:\n        We want to achieve 7.\n\n        Start: i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> not equal.\n        then since 7>1, move j: j=6, rsum=1+11=12.\n        then i=0, j=6: 7<12 -> move i: i=1, lsum=7+3=10.\n        then i=1, j=6: 10<12 -> move i: i=2, lsum=10+20=30.\n        then i=2, j=6: 30>12 -> move j: j=5, rsum=12+8=20.\n        then i=2, j=5: 30>20 -> move j: j=4, rsum=20+10=30.\n        then i=2, j=4: 30==30 -> else: best = (2+1)+(8-4)=3+4=7.\n        then we move i: i=3, lsum=30+5=35.\n        then i=3, j=4: 35>30 -> move j: j=3, rsum=30+5=35? -> but wait, we are at j=4, then we move j to 3, and then add arr[3] to rsum? \n        But the array: index3 is 5. So rsum=30+5=35.\n        then i=3, j=3: break.\n        output 7.\n\n  But note: in the else block, we only move the left pointer. In the fourth test case, after the else block, we moved i to 3, then in the next iteration we have i=3, j=4: then we have to move j because lsum=35> rsum=30. Then we move j to 3 and add arr[3] to rsum, making it 35. Then we break. But we don't get another else block. \n\n  So the best is 7.\n\n  Therefore, we can do in the else block:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: we might also move the right pointer in the else block? Why not move the right pointer? \n\n  The known solution moves only one pointer in the equality case, but it doesn't matter which one? \n\n  But if we move the right pointer, then for [1,0,1]:\n\n        first else: best=2, then move j: j=1, rsum=1+0=1.\n        then state: i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else: best= (0+1)+(3-1)=1+2=3.\n        then move j: j=0, then break.\n\n  also outputs 3.\n\n  So we can move either. But the problem: we might miss a larger total if we move only one? \n\n  Consider [1,1,1,1]: \n        i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> else: best= (0+1)+(4-3)=1+1=2.\n        then we move i: i=1, lsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=3: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> move j: j=2, rsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> else: best= (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4.\n        then move i: i=2, then i>=j -> break.\n        output 4.\n\n  But the entire array is eaten? Alice: [1,1] and Bob: [1,1] -> total 4.\n\n  If in the first else block we move the right pointer:\n        i=0, j=3: best=2, then move j: j=2, rsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> move i: i=1, lsum=1+1=2.\n        then i=1, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> best= (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4.\n        then move j: j=1, then break.\n        output 4.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  Therefore, we can do in the else block: move either the left or the right. But to be safe, we can move the left pointer.\n\n  So the else block:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # record the current total candies\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: after we move the left pointer, it is possible that i becomes j, then we break. \n\n  However, what if we have an array with an even length and we are at the middle? \n\n  But the while loop condition is i<j, so if i becomes j, we break. \n\n  But what if after moving i, we have i<j, then we continue. \n\n  This should work.\n\n  But note: in the provided code, in the if and elif blocks, we are moving the pointer and then adding the candy. But in the else block, we are moving the pointer and then adding the candy only if i<j. \n\n  This is consistent.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else block is:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: the problem says they might move the right pointer in the else block as well. But the sample [1,0,1] works if we move the left pointer. \n\n  However, the problem does not specify which pointer to move. We can move either. \n\n  But to be safe, we can move the left pointer.\n\n  Let me test the fourth test case with moving the left pointer in the else block: \n        [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n        We as before: \n            ... until i=2, j=4: lsum=30, rsum=30 -> else block: \n                best = (2+1)+(8-4)=3+4=7.\n                i becomes 3.\n                then we add arr[3]=5 to lsum -> lsum=35.\n            then i=3, j=4: 35>30 -> we do the elif: \n                j -= 1 -> j=3.\n                then rsum += arr[3] -> rsum=30+5=35.\n            then i=3, j=3: break.\n        output 7.\n\n  It works.\n\n  But note: in the next iteration after the else block, we have i=3, j=4. Then we do the elif: \n        j -= 1 -> j=3, and then we do rsum += arr[3] (which is 5) -> rsum=35.\n\n  Then the next iteration: i=3, j=3 -> break.\n\n  So we output 7.\n\n  Therefore, we fill the else block with:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: the code after the else block is the end of the while loop. \n\n  However, we have to be cautious: the while loop condition is i<j. After we do i+=1, if i>=j, we break. Otherwise, we update lsum and then the next iteration starts.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  So for program1.py, the completion for the else block is:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        else:\n            break\n\n  But note: the code has an indentation. We must indent properly.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  We have:\n\n      def solve():\n          n = int(input())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          if sum(arr)!=0:\n              return 0\n\n          psum = 0\n          f = 0\n\n          for i in range(len(arr)):\n              psum += arr[i]\n              if psum < 0:\n                  return 0\n              if psum==0:\n                  f = 1\n              elif f:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          return 1\n\n  The problem: determine if we can obtain the array a with the operations.\n\n  The known conditions:\n      1. The total sum must be 0. (because every time we move right we add 1 and every time we move left we subtract 1, and we start and end at the first element. The net effect is 0.)\n      2. The prefix sums must be non-negative. (because we can't go below 0 in the middle? But note: the operations: \n            - When we are not on the last element, we can do: increase by 1 and move right.\n            - When we are not on the first element, we can do: decrease by 1 and move left.\n          The catch: we can revisit indices.

\n\n          Let me simulate [1,-1] with the operations:\n\n              start: [0,0], pointer0.\n              operation1: [1,0], pointer1.\n              then we want to get to [1,-1]: \n                  at pointer1: do operation2: \n                      a[1] = 0-1 = -1, then move to0.\n                  then we have [1,-1] and pointer0.\n\n          So it is valid.\n\n          Therefore, the example note might have a typo.\n\n          The known solution that passed in Codeforces for the problem \"Collecting Coins\" (which is not this problem) might not apply.\n\n          A solution from a recent contest for the exact problem (I recall) is:\n\n              t = int(input())\n              for _ in range(t):\n                  n = int(input())\n                  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                  if a[0] < 0:\n                      print(\"No\")\n                      continue\n                  total = sum(a)\n                  if total != 0:\n                      print(\"No\")\n                      continue\n                  # We also require that the prefix sums are non-negative.\n                  s = 0\n                  for i in range(n):\n                      s += a[i]\n                      if s < 0:\n                          print(\"No\")\n                          break\n                  else:\n                      # We require that the first time the prefix becomes zero, the rest must be zero.\n                      # But note: we can have zeros at the end, but in the middle if the prefix becomes zero, then the rest must be zero? \n                      # Example: [1, -1, 1, -1] is valid, but the prefix becomes zero at index1 and then becomes 1 at index2, which is not zero.\n                      # So that condition is not needed.\n                      # However, the sample [0,0,0,0] is valid.\n                      # But the sample [1, -1, 1, -1] is valid.\n                      # The known solution: \n                      #   We also require that after the first time the prefix becomes zero, the rest must be zero? \n                      #   But [1,-1,1,-1] has prefix: [1,0,1,0] -> the first zero is at index1, then at index2 it becomes 1 (non-zero) -> should be invalid? \n                      #   But we know it's valid.\n                      #   Therefore, that condition is not needed.\n\n                      # Actually, the only conditions are:\n                      #   a[0]>=0, total=0, and prefix sums>=0.\n                      #   and additionally, if the prefix sum becomes zero at some index i, then we are at the first element at that moment, and then the rest of the moves must not leave the first element? \n                      #   But the problem: we can leave and come back.\n\n                      #   However, consider: \n                      #       [1, -1, 1, -1] is valid.\n                      #   So we only need the above.\n\n                      print(\"Yes\")\n\n          But then why is the sample [0,0,0,0] valid? \n              a[0]=0>=0, total=0, prefix sums=[0,0,0,0] (non-negative) -> valid.\n\n          However, the example in the problem note: \n              \"For the first test case\" (which is not specified) is not valid because the pointer is not on the first element.\n\n          Given the provided code in program2.py:\n\n              if sum(arr)!=0:\n                  return 0\n\n              psum = 0\n              f = 0\n\n              for i in range(len(arr)):\n                  psum += arr[i]\n                  if psum < 0:\n                      return 0\n                  if psum==0:\n                      f = 1\n                  elif f:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n          What should we put in the TODO?
