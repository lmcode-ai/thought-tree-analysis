    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\nThe provided code sets up a loop for each test case. The input is read in a way that skips the first two lines (the first line is t, then the next line is n, then the next line is the list of weights). The code then processes each test case.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py:\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        if a==b:\n            f=len(n)-r+l-1\n    print(f)\n\nWe note that the code initializes a (Alice's total), b (Bob's total), l (left pointer) and f (which will store the total number of candies eaten when they have equal weight) to 0. Also, r is set to the last index.\n\nThe while loop runs while l<=r. The condition currently has:\n- If a<=b, then we add the left candy to Alice and move l to the right.\n- Else if b<a, we have a missing block.\n\nWe also see that whenever a==b, we update f to (len(n) - r + l - 1). Why?\nThe total candies eaten would be: \n  (l) candies from the left (because l is the next index to take, so the number of left candies eaten is l) \n  plus (len(n)-1 - r) candies from the right (because r is the next index to take from the right, so the number of right candies eaten is len(n)-1 - r). \nBut note: the current state: \n  l points to the next candy to take on the left (so the number of left candies taken is l, because we started at 0 and now l is the next index after the last taken).\n  Similarly, r points to the next candy to take on the right (so the number of right candies taken is (len(n)-1 - r) because we started at len(n)-1 and now r is the next index from the right that hasn't been taken? Actually, the code currently doesn't update r in the first condition. \n\nLooking at the condition for the left: we do a+=n[l] and then l+=1. So after that, l is the next left index to take.\n\nBut for the right, we are missing the code. We need to add the right candy to Bob and move r to the left.\n\nSo in the missing block for the right, we should do:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nAlso note: the condition for the right is when b < a (so we are adding to Bob to try to catch up).\n\nAdditionally, we must consider that after updating either side, we check if a==b and then update f.\n\nBut note: the current code has the check for a==b inside the loop after the conditionals. However, the missing block for the right is in an elif. We must make sure that after updating the right, we also check for a==b.\n\nBut the code already has the check for a==b after the conditionals? Actually, the check is at the same indentation as the conditionals, so it is inside the while loop and after the conditionals.\n\nHowever, the current code for the right is missing. We must fill in the missing block.\n\nBut note: the current code for the left does:\n    a += n[l]\n    l += 1\n\nSimilarly, for the right we should do:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut wait: what if after adding to the right, we break the condition l<=r? Then we break the loop. But the check for a==b is done at the end of the loop iteration.\n\nAlso note: the variable f is initially 0. We update f only when a==b. The problem says that if they can't be fair, then we output 0. But note that the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". So if we never have a==b, then f remains 0 and we output 0.\n\nBut note: the initial state: a=0, b=0, and then we haven't taken any candy. Then a==b? Yes, but then we set f = len(n)-r+l-1. \nAt the start: l=0, r=len(n)-1, so len(n)-r+l-1 = len(n) - (len(n)-1) + 0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0? \nBut that's 0. However, we haven't taken any candy. So we don't want to count that. \n\nBut note: the problem says they eat candies. They must eat at least one candy? The note for the third test case says \"non-zero weight\", so they must have positive weight. Therefore, we don't want to count the state when no candy is eaten.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"For the fourth test case, ... answer is 7\". So we are counting the total candies eaten.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\".\n\nSo we must not count the initial state (0,0) because they haven't eaten any candy. Therefore, we should update f only when we have actually eaten some candies? But note: the update to f happens after we have updated a or b. \n\nIn the first test case: \n  n = [1,1] (probably, because the note says one candy from left and one from right).\n  Initially: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=1, f=0.\n  Then: since a<=b (0<=0), we add n[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1.\n        Then we check: a==b? 1==0 -> no.\n  Then: now l=1, r=1 -> l<=r -> true.\n        Now a=1, b=0 -> so b<a -> we do the right: add n[1]=1 -> b=1, r=0.\n        Then we check: a==b? 1==1 -> yes -> then f = len(n) - r + l - 1 = 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2.\n  Then we break the loop because l=1 and r=0 -> l>r -> break.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut what if we have an odd number of candies? We must update both sides until we meet.\n\nHowever, note that the condition for the right is only when b < a. But what if we have a==b? Then we update f, but we don't update either side? Actually, the condition for the left is a<=b, which includes a==b? But note: the condition is \"if a<=b\" and then \"elif b<a\". So when a==b, we go into the left branch? \n\nBut that might not be optimal? For example, if we have [1,1,1]: \n  We start: a=0, b=0 -> left: a=1, l=1 -> then a=1, b=0 -> then right: b=1, r=1 -> then a==b -> f = 3 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 2? \n  But then we have l=1, r=1 -> we enter the loop again. \n      Now a=1, b=1 -> we go to the left: add n[1]=1 -> a=2, l=2 -> then check a==b? 2!=1 -> then we break because l=2, r=1 -> l>r -> break.\n  So we output f=2.\n\nBut the problem says: they want to eat the same total weight. They can eat two candies: Alice eats the first two? But then Bob eats none? That doesn't work. Actually, in the state when we had a=1 and b=1, we had Alice eating the first candy and Bob eating the last candy. That is two candies. Then we don't eat the middle one. So that is valid.\n\nBut what if we try to eat the middle one? Then we break the contiguous condition. So we cannot.\n\nSo the code for program1.py missing part is:\n    b += n[r]\n    r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code has an \"elif b<a:\" and then we need to put the block. We must be careful with the indentation.\n\nNow, what about the rest? The code prints f at the end of the test case.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total number of candies they eat is the sum of the candies from the left and the candies from the right. And we are storing that in f. And we update f every time we have a==b. We want the maximum total number of candies. So we update f whenever we have a==b and then we continue? Because we might have a larger total later? \n\nFor example, in the fourth test case: \n  Weights: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n  The note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). So total candies = 3+4 = 7.\n\nBut how does the algorithm work?\n  We start: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=7.\n  Then: a<=b -> a=7, l=1 -> then a=7, b=0 -> then b<a -> so b=1, r=6 -> then a!=b -> then next iteration.\n  Then: a=7, b=1 -> a<=b? no -> then b<a -> so b=1+11=12, r=5 -> then a!=b -> next.\n  Then: a=7, b=12 -> a<=b -> a=7+3=10, l=2 -> then a=10, b=12 -> a<=b -> a=10+20=30, l=3 -> then a=30, b=12 -> then b<a -> so b=12+8=20, r=4 -> then a!=b -> next.\n  Then: a=30, b=20 -> b<a -> so b=20+10=30, r=3 -> then a==b -> update f: \n        f = len(n) - r + l - 1 = 8 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 7 -> which is the answer.\n\nBut note: we break the loop when l>r? Now l=3, r=3 -> we enter the loop? \n        Then a=30, b=30 -> a<=b -> so we add n[3]=5 -> a=35, l=4 -> then we break the loop? \n        Then we output 7.\n\nBut wait, we updated f to 7 at the previous step. Then we do one more step? But then we don't update f again because after adding the 5, a=35 and b=30 -> not equal. Then we break.\n\nSo we output 7.\n\nBut what if we have a later state where a==b again? We want the maximum total candies. The algorithm updates f every time a==b. Since we are traversing from both ends, and we are increasing the total candies as we go (because we are adding more), the last time we have a==b might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies eaten at the time of update is (l + (n-1 - r)). And as we move, l increases and r decreases, so the total candies (l + (n-1 - r)) increases. Therefore, the last time we have a==b gives the maximum total.\n\nBut note: we update f every time we have a==b. Then we continue. So we are storing the last time we had a==b? But what if we have multiple equalities? The problem says \"maximum number of candies\", so we want the one with the largest total candies. And as we move, the total candies (l + (n-1 - r)) is increasing. Therefore, the last one is the largest.\n\nBut note: the total candies is l (from the left) plus (n-1 - r) from the right. And l is increasing and r is decreasing, so the total is increasing. Therefore, the last time we have a==b is the one with the most candies.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code has an \"elif b<a:\" and then the block. We must write two lines with proper indentation.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\nWe are to complete the code that, for each test case, reads an integer rating and outputs the division.\n\nThe code:\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must read the rating and then output one of:\n  \"Division 1\"\n  \"Division 2\"\n  \"Division 3\"\n  \"Division 4\"\n\nThe divisions:\n  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nBut note: the problem says:\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 1: 1900 <= rating\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  rating = int(input().strip())\n  if rating >= 1900:\n      print(\"Division 1\")\n  elif rating >= 1600:\n      print(\"Division 2\")\n  elif rating >= 1400:\n      print(\"Division 3\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the conditions are non-overlapping and cover all integers.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  rating = int(input().strip())\n  if rating >= 1900:\n      print(\"Division 1\")\n  elif 1600 <= rating <= 1899:\n      print(\"Division 2\")\n  elif 1400 <= rating <= 1599:\n      print(\"Division 3\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut the problem says the rating can be from -5000 to 5000, and the divisions are defined as above. The else part covers rating <= 1399, which includes negative numbers and numbers below 1400.\n\nWe can write it in a compact way.\n\nBut note: the problem says the first line of input is t, then t lines each with one integer.\n\nSo the code for program2.py:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the condition for Division 2 is 1600 to 1899. The condition \"r>=1600\" in the elif will catch ratings from 1600 to 5000, but we have already checked for >=1900 above. So the next condition (r>=1600) will only be for ratings from 1600 to 1899? Actually, because if r>=1900 we already took it, so the next condition is for 1600<=r<1900. Similarly, the next condition is for 1400<=r<1600, and then else for the rest.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code for both programs in a JSON object.\n\nThe structure:\n{\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nFor program1, the completion is the two lines that are missing, with the same indentation as the surrounding code. But note: the missing block is in the elif block. The existing code has:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with two lines of code. We must write:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop and then 12 spaces for the if/elif. So we must preserve the indentation.\n\nFor program2, the completion is the entire block for the for loop, which is:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the for loop is already there. We are only replacing the TODO with the above block.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". For program1, the missing code is the two lines. For program2, the missing code is the entire block that goes inside the for loop.\n\nBut note: the existing code for program2 has:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with the block. So we must write the block with the same indentation (one level in, which is 4 spaces).\n\nBut the example output for program2 should be the code that replaces the TODO, which is:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the existing for loop has the colon and the next line is a comment. We are replacing that comment with the above block. The block must be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nTherefore, for program1, the missing code is two lines (with the same indentation as the surrounding code). For program2, the missing code is the entire block that goes in the for loop (with 4 space indentation).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in JSON.\n\nSo we will write:\n\nFor program1: the string \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\nBut wait: the existing code in program1 has 8 spaces for the while, then 12 for the if and elif. So the missing block should be at 12 spaces of indentation? Actually, the elif is at the same level as the if, which is 8 spaces? Then the block inside the elif should be 12.\n\nBut the provided code for program1 has:\n\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe while loop is at 4 spaces (because the for loop is at 0, then the next lines are 4). Then the while loop body is 8. Then the if and elif are at 8, and the blocks inside the if and elif are at 12.\n\nSo the two lines we write must be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the string for program1 is \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\" (each line has 12 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the existing code for the if block has 12 spaces: \"a+=n[l]\" and \"l+=1\" are at 12. So we do the same.\n\nBut note: the existing code for the if block is:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo we write the same for the elif block.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But the problem says to output the missing code as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the two lines that are missing, with the same indentation as the existing code in the if block.\n\nSo we output:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the existing code uses no spaces around operators? Actually, the existing code has \"a+=n[l]\" and \"l+=1\". So we can write \"b+=n[r]\" and \"r-=1\" to be consistent? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we can write exactly as the existing style.\n\nBut the problem does not require specific variable names? We are using the same variable names as the context.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is two lines:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut wait, the existing code in the if block uses no spaces: \"a+=n[l]\". So we should write without spaces? \n\nActually, the existing code: \n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo we should write:\n\n            b+=n[r]\n            r-=1\n\nBut the problem does not require consistency in style? However, to be safe, we can write without spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that would be inserted.\n\nSo we write without spaces for the operators.\n\nTherefore, for program1: \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\"\n\nFor program2: we write the block with 4 space indentation? Actually, the for loop is at 0, then the next line is indented by 4. The block we write must be at 4 spaces. But the block we are writing has multiple lines, each indented by 4 more? Actually, the entire block is inside the for loop. So:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the existing for loop has:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with the above block. The block has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the entire block is at the same level as the TODO comment. So each line of the block must be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\nBut the for loop is at 0, so the block must be at 4 spaces. However, the block we wrote above has 4 spaces for the first line? Actually, in the example above, we wrote:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n\nBut that is 4 spaces? Then the if statements are 4 spaces? Actually, no: the if statements should be indented one more level? \n\nWait, the structure:\n\nfor ...:\n    [block]\n\nThe [block] is one level in (4 spaces). Then inside the block, we have an if-else. The if-else is part of the same block. So the entire block we write is at 4 spaces. But the if-else has inner blocks? They must be indented by 8 spaces.\n\nSo:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the first line is at 4 spaces, and the if, elif, else are at 4 spaces, and the print statements are at 8 spaces.\n\nSo the entire block for program2 is:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the existing code for program2 has the for loop and then a line with 4 spaces and a comment. We are replacing that one line with the above 7 lines.\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nWe must escape newlines and quotes? The problem says to output the string as is. But in JSON, we must use \\n for newlines and escape quotes if any. However, the code we are outputting does not have quotes? It has double quotes in the print statements? \n\nFor example, in program2, we have: print(\"Division 1\") -> this has double quotes. In JSON, we are writing a string that contains double quotes, so we must escape them.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and then we are to output in JSON. So we must format the JSON string properly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a raw string? But the problem does not specify.\n\nWe can do:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(input().strip())\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has double quotes that we must escape.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the print statements? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says the output should be in the format \"Division X\", which uses double quotes? But in Python, we can use single quotes for the string.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact same quotes? We can use single quotes to avoid escaping? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\" as it would appear. The existing code in the problem statements uses double quotes? Actually, the problem statement for program2 does not show any quotes in the code. The example output is in double quotes? But in Python, we can use either.\n\nBut the problem says: \"print the correct division in the format 'Division X'\", meaning the output should be without quotes? Actually, the output is the string without quotes? But the code uses print, so the output is without quotes.\n\nBut the code we write for program2 must use print with a string. We can use either single or double quotes. To avoid escaping in JSON, we can use single quotes in the code? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the example in the problem statement for program2 uses double quotes? The note says: \"For test cases 1-4, ... division 4\". But the output is without quotes.\n\nSo the code we write for program2 must output without quotes? Actually, the print statement outputs without quotes. The issue is the code we write: we are writing a string in the print statement. We can write:\n\n    print('Division 1')\n\nwith single quotes. Then we don't have to escape in the JSON.\n\nAlternatively, we can escape the double quotes in the JSON string.\n\nI choose to use single quotes in the print statements to avoid escaping.\n\nSo for program2, we write:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print('Division 1')\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print('Division 2')\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print('Division 3')\n    else:\n        print('Division 4')\n\nThen the JSON string for program2 will not have double quotes that need escaping.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(input().strip())\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the entire block is at 4 spaces relative to the for loop. The for loop is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    [this part]\n\nSo the block we are inserting is 7 lines, each starting with 4 spaces? Actually, the first line is 4 spaces, then the next lines: the if, elif, else are at 4 spaces, and the prints are at 8. But in the string we are writing, we are including the indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: the existing code has the for loop and then a line with a comment at 4 spaces. We are replacing that one line with the 7 lines. So we write the 7 lines with the same indentation as the comment.\n\nTherefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n    r = int(input().strip())\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print('Division 1')\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print('Division 2')\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print('Division 3')\n    else:\n        print('Division 4')\n\nBut note: the last line of the block is the else and the print. We write it as above.\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and then the format.\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\", \"program2\": \"    r = int(input().strip())\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nBut note: the program2 string has newlines. We represent them as \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the JSON in a compact form without extra spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the JSON formatting. We can write without extra spaces.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"program1\":\"            b+=n[r]\\n            r-=1\",\"program2\":\"    r = int(input().strip())\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nThis should be acceptable."
