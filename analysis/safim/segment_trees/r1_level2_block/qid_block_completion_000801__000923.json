Actually, when p1=2, we did not update the left again? Because after the first if, we updated the left to p1=1? Then we did the right update? Then we broke the next iteration? The problem is in the [1,2] example: after the first if, we updated the left to p1=1. Then we did the right update? Then we had p1=1, p2=0. Then we entered the loop: condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true. Then we did the TODO: s1 < s2 -> true, then we did s1 += l[1] -> valid? Then p1 becomes 2. Then we did the next if: s2 < s1 -> true, then we did s2 += l[0] -> valid? Then p2 becomes -1. Then we break next iteration. So we never accessed l[2]? But what if we have a test case that causes p1 to become n? Example: n=1: \n        p1=0, p2=0: \n            s1==s2: record, then update: s1=l[0], p1=1. then s1 (l[0]) and s2 (0): then we do the right update: s2 += l[0] -> s2=l[0], p2=-1. then break. Then we never accessed l[1]? So it seems safe? Why? Because the condition p1-1<=p2: \n        After updating the left in the first if, we have p1 increased by one. Then we check the next conditions? Then we update the right? Then we break the next iteration? But what if we have a test case that after the first update (when s1==s2) we have s1 < s2? Then we do the TODO: update the left again? Example: n=3, [1,1,1]\n\n        p1=0, p2=2: \n            s1==s2: record total=0. Then update: s1=1, p1=1. then s1(1) < s2(0)? false. then s2(0) < s1(1): true -> update right: s2=1, p2=1. Then next iteration: p1-1=0<=1 -> true. s1==s2: record total = 1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2. Then update: s1=1+l[1]=2, p1=2. then s1(2) < s2(1)? false. then s2(1) < s1(2): true -> update right: but p2=1, so we do s2=1+l[1]=2, p2=0. Then next iteration: p1-1=2-1=1<=0? false -> break. Then we print 2? But the answer should be 3? How? Alice takes [1,1] (weight=2) and Bob takes [1] (weight=1) -> not equal? Or Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [1,1] -> then Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal.

Then in the next iteration: \n                p1=3, p2=3: condition: 3-1=2<=3 -> true. then we do the first if: s1==s2: record 3 + (8-1-3)=3+4=7. then we update left: s1=30+5=35, p1=4. then we do the next if: s1< s2? 35<30? false. then s2< s1: true -> update right: s2=30+l[3]=30+5=35, p2=2. then next iteration: p1=4, p2=2: condition: 4-1=3<=2 -> false. break.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses two pointers (p1 starting at the left, p2 at the right) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob). The idea is to move the pointers and update the sums until the pointers cross.\n\n The current code has:\n   while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition seems off. We want to run while p1 <= p2? But note: we are updating p1 and p2 inside.\n        if s1 == s2: \n            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # This records the total candies eaten: p1 (from left) and (n-1-p2) from right? Actually, the number of candies Alice ate is p1 (because she started at 0 and now has p1, meaning she ate indices 0 to p1-1 -> count = p1). Bob ate from the right: from n-1 down to p2+1 -> count = n-1 - p2. So total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = p1 + n - 1 - p2.\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        if s1 < s2:   # TODO: Your code here\n        if s2 < s1: \n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n However, note that after the first if, we update s1 and p1. Then we check the next conditions. But what if after updating s1 we have s1 < s2? Then we do the next if. But then we don't break the loop? Also, the condition for the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> initially p1=0, so condition is -1<=p2 (which is true). Then after p1 becomes 1, condition is 0<=p2. Then when p1 becomes 2, condition is 1<=p2, etc.\n\n The problem: we have a TODO for the case when s1 < s2.\n\n What should we do when s1 < s2? We need to increase s1. So we should take the next candy from the left (i.e., at p1) and add it to s1, then move p1 forward.\n\n But note: the code already did that in the first if when s1==s2? Actually, no: the first if condition is only for when they are equal. Then we update s1 and p1. Then we check the next conditions.\n\n However, after updating s1, we might have s1 < s2 or s1 > s2? Then we do the corresponding if.\n\n But wait: what if we have s1 < s2? Then we should add a candy from the left? But we just did that in the first if? Actually, the first if condition is independent. We have three separate ifs.\n\n However, the problem is that after the first if, we have updated s1 and p1. Then we check the next two conditions. But if we are in the case s1 < s2, we do:\n        if s1 < s2: \n            ...   # we need to add from the left? But we just added from the left? Actually, we might have to add again? \n\n But note: the first if condition is only triggered when s1==s2. Then we add one from the left. Then we check: if now s1 < s2, then we would add from the left again? But that would be the same as having two consecutive left additions? \n\n Alternatively, we might have to add from the right when s1 < s2? Actually, no: because if s1 is less than s2, then we need to increase s1 to catch up? So we should take from the left.\n\n However, the code for s2 < s1 is adding from the right. So by symmetry, for s1 < s2 we should add from the left.\n\n But note: we just added from the left in the first if? Then we check again. So we have:\n\n   if s1 == s2: \n        record the current total (which is the number of candies eaten so far: p1 (from left) and n-1-p2 (from right) -> total = p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        then we add the next left candy (at index p1) and move p1.\n\n   Then we check: if s1 (which now is the updated s1) is less than s2? Then we need to add more from the left? \n\n However, we cannot add from the left arbitrarily? Because we just added one and now we are going to add another? That is acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if we have s1 < s2 and we are going to add from the left? Then we do:\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n But note: we already did p1+=1 in the first if? Then we are going to use the same p1? That would be the next candy? Actually, after the first if, p1 has been incremented. So the current p1 points to the next candy that hasn't been taken.\n\n However, the condition in the while loop: p1-1<=p2. After we do p1+=1 in the first if, then we have p1 (which is now one more). Then we check the condition: p1-1 (which is the old p1) is <= p2? Actually, the condition is about the next step? \n\n But note: we are going to use the same p1 in the next if? So if we do:\n\n   if s1 < s2:\n        s1 += l[p1]   # p1 is the next available left candy\n        p1 += 1\n\n Then we are moving p1 again.\n\n However, the condition in the while loop: we are using p1-1<=p2. Why? \n\n Let me reexamine: \n   Initially, p1=0, p2=n-1.\n   Condition: p1-1 = -1 <= p2 (which is n-1) -> true.\n\n   After the first if: we do p1 becomes 1. Then condition for next iteration: p1-1 = 0 <= p2? \n\n   We want to continue as long as we have candies to take? Actually, we can take from the left until p1 reaches n, and from the right until p2 reaches -1? But we must not cross.\n\n   The condition p1-1<=p2: \n        The left pointer has taken candies from 0 to p1-1 -> so the next left candy is at p1 (which is in the range [0, n-1] as long as p1 <= p2? Actually, we can have p1==p2 and then we take the last candy? But note: we are taking from left and right and they cannot take the same candy.\n\n   However, the condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This allows p1 to be p2+1? Then we break.\n\n   So the loop runs while p1-1 <= p2, meaning p1 <= p2+1.\n\n   But when p1 == p2+1, we break? Actually, we break at the beginning of the loop? Then we don't process that.\n\n   Now, what if we have s1 < s2 and we are at the state where p1 is already beyond p2? Then we break. Otherwise, we add from the left.\n\n So the missing part for program1.py is:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n But wait: what if we have s1 < s2 and we have no more left candies? Then we break? Actually, the condition of the while loop will break if p1-1>p2. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: we have three if conditions. After the first if, we might have updated and then we check the next two. But what if we do the first if and then the second if? Then we update twice? That is acceptable.\n\n But what if we do the first if, then the second if, and then the third if? That would be three updates? We must avoid updating the same candy twice? Actually, the pointers are moving: the left pointer moves only when we take from the left, and the right pointer moves only when we take from the right.\n\n However, the problem: the condition s1==s2 is independent of the other two. But note: after we update in the first if, we then check the next two conditions. We should use elif? Or we should break the update into one per iteration? \n\n Actually, the current structure is:\n\n   while condition:\n        if s1==s2: ...   # update left\n        if s1 < s2: ...   # update left again? \n        if s2 < s1: ...   # update right\n\n This might do two updates in one iteration? For example, if after the first if we have s1==s2, we update left and then if the new s1 is less than s2, we update left again? Then we have two left updates in one iteration.\n\n That is acceptable? The problem says: we can take any number of candies from the left (in a row) and any from the right. So we are free to take as many as we want.\n\n However, the algorithm is designed to take one candy at a time. So we can do multiple updates per iteration? Actually, the while loop condition is set to run until the pointers cross. And we update one candy per update.\n\n But note: the condition for the while loop: we are updating p1 and p2 inside. So we might overshoot? \n\n Alternatively, we can restructure the loop to do one update per iteration? But the current code does at most two updates? \n\n However, the problem: the condition s1==s2 is the only one that records the total candies eaten (l2.append(...)). We record only when they are equal? Then we update the left. Then we check if we can update again? \n\n But the problem: we want the maximum total candies. So we record every time the sums are equal? Then we take the last recorded value? Actually, the code prints l2[-1] at the end.\n\n However, we are appending every time the sums are equal? Then we take the last one? But the last one might not be the maximum? Actually, we are moving the pointers and the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 (from left) + (n-1-p2) (from right). As we move the pointers, p1 increases and p2 decreases, so the total candies eaten increases? But wait: when we add from the left, p1 increases -> total increases. When we add from the right, p2 decreases -> total increases? Actually, the total is p1 + (n-1-p2). When p1 increases by 1, total increases by 1. When p2 decreases by 1, total increases by 1? \n\n But note: when we add from the left, we do p1+=1 -> total increases by 1. When we add from the right, we do p2-=1 -> then (n-1-p2) becomes (n-1 - (p2-1)) = (n-1-p2) + 1 -> so total increases by 1.\n\n So the total candies eaten is increasing? Then the last time we recorded (when the sums are equal) is the maximum? \n\n However, what if we have multiple equalities? The last one is the maximum? \n\n But note: we are updating the pointers until they cross. The last recorded equality might be the one with the most candies? \n\n However, consider: we record when we have an equality. Then we update the left. Then we might break the equality? Then we update until we get another equality? Then we record again? So we record every time the sums become equal? And the last one is the one with the most candies? \n\n But the problem: the total candies eaten is increasing as we move the pointers. So the last recorded equality is the one with the highest total? \n\n However, what if we have an equality at total = x, then we update and break the equality, and then we update and get another equality at total = x+2? Then we record that. So the last one is the maximum.\n\n But note: we are updating one candy at a time? So the total increases by one each time we update? Then the next equality must be at a higher total? \n\n Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing by one each time we update (whether left or right). So the next time we have an equality, the total is higher.\n\n Therefore, we can record every time we have an equality and then take the last one? \n\n However, the problem: the code prints l2[-1]. So that is the last recorded equality.\n\n But what if we never have an equality? Then l2 is empty? Then we get an error? \n\n The problem says: if they cannot eat the same non-zero weight, the answer is 0. But note: they can both eat 0 candies? Then the total is 0. So we should record at the beginning? \n\n Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> they are equal. Then we record: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we update: we add the first left candy? Then s1 becomes l[0], p1 becomes 1.\n\n Then we check: if s1 < s2? (s2 is 0) -> then we do the missing code: add from the left? Then we add l[1] to s1 and p1 becomes 2? Then we check again? \n\n But note: we are not recording again until we have an equality? \n\n However, the problem: we must output 0 for the third test case? \n\n How do we handle that? \n\n The initial state: s1=0, s2=0 -> we record 0. Then we update. Then we might never get an equality again? Then we break the loop and print l2[-1] which is 0? That matches.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n But note: we must be cautious: what if p1 is already beyond the array? The while condition: p1-1<=p2 -> meaning p1 <= p2+1. When p1==p2+1, we break. So when we are about to update, we have p1 <= p2? Actually, the condition at the beginning of the loop is p1-1<=p2. Then we update p1: we set p1 to p1+1. Then the next time we check the condition, we have (p1+1)-1 = p1 <= p2? But we just updated p1 to p1+1, so we are now at p1+1? \n\n Actually, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So if we are at the last step: p1=5, p2=5, then condition: 5-1=4<=5 -> true. Then we do the update. Then we update p1 to 6. Then we check the next if: if s1 < s2? Then we do s1 += l[6] -> but 6 is beyond the array? \n\n But note: the condition in the while loop: we break at the beginning of the next iteration? But we are still in the same iteration? \n\n We must avoid accessing l[p1] when p1>=n? Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1 is at most p2+1. But when p1==p2+1, we break at the beginning of the next iteration. However, in the current iteration, we might have updated p1 to p2+1? Then we are about to access l[p1] when p1==p2+1? That is beyond the array? \n\n Actually, the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. So if p1 becomes n, then we are accessing l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n How to fix? \n\n We should not update if p1 is beyond the array? But the while condition is p1-1<=p2. When p1-1==p2, then p1 = p2+1. Then we are about to update? Then we break at the next iteration? But we are still in the loop. \n\n Actually, the condition for the while loop is at the beginning. We are in the loop as long as p1-1<=p2. Then we do:\n\n   if s1==s2: \n        we record, then we do s1 += l[p1] and p1+=1 -> now p1 becomes p1+1. Then we check the next if: if s1 < s2? Then we do s1 += l[p1] (which is l[p1+1])? But if p1+1 is beyond p2? \n\n Actually, after the first update, p1 becomes p1+1. Then we are going to do the next if? But we must check the bounds? \n\n Alternatively, we can break the update into one per iteration? \n\n Actually, the intended solution is to use two pointers and update one pointer per iteration? \n\n We can restructure the loop to:\n\n   while p1 <= p2:\n        if s1 == s2:\n            # record the current total: p1 (candies from left) and (n-1-p2) from right -> total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            best = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            # then we can choose to add from the left? But we must update to avoid infinite loop?\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        elif s1 < s2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n   Then after the loop, we also need to check if s1==s2? Then we can update best? \n\n But note: the problem says the total of the last recorded equality is the answer? \n\n However, the provided code does:\n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); \n                s1+=l[p1]; \n                p1+=1\n            if s1 < s2: ... \n            if s2 < s1: ...\n\n We are going to change the structure? \n\n But the problem says: output only the missing code. So we cannot change the existing code? \n\n Therefore, we must fill the TODO without changing the existing structure.\n\n How about we do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n But then we must worry about p1 going out of bounds? \n\n The condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When we are about to update, we have p1 (current) such that p1-1<=p2 -> meaning p1 <= p2+1. \n\n But if p1 == p2+1, then we are going to do:\n        s1 += l[p1]   -> p1 is p2+1, which is beyond the last index? \n\n Actually, the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. p2 is at least 0. So p1 <= p2+1 -> p1 can be at most n? Because p2 is at least 0, then p2+1 is at most n? But if p1==n, then l[p1] is out of bounds.\n\n How to avoid? \n\n We note that the condition p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. When p1==p2+1, we are at the boundary. Then we break the loop? But we are in the loop. \n\n Actually, we can check: if p1 <= p2? Then we can update? \n\n But the problem: we are not allowed to change the existing code? Only fill the TODO.\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the condition of the while loop is checked at the beginning of each iteration. So if we are at p1 = p2+1, we break at the next iteration? But we are in the current iteration and we are going to update? \n\n We must avoid accessing l[p1] when p1>=n? \n\n But the condition p1-1<=p2 implies that p1<=p2+1. And p2 is at least 0, so p1<=n? But when p1==n, then we are accessing l[n] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n Therefore, we must break the loop when p1>=n? But we cannot change the condition? \n\n Alternatively, we can check in the TODO: if p1 <= p2? Then we update? But the problem: the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2, which is true for p1<=p2+1. So when p1==p2+1, we are in the loop. Then we do the if s1 < s2: and then we try to update? But p1 is already beyond the last index? \n\n How about we change the condition? But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n Actually, the problem says: the total of n over all test cases is at most 200000. So we can hope that the pointers do not go out of bounds? \n\n But the condition p1-1<=p2 is set to avoid going too far? \n\n Let me simulate with n=1:\n\n   t=1, n=1, l=[10]\n\n   p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: 0-1 = -1 <=0 -> true.\n\n   s1=0, s2=0 -> so we do the first if: \n        l2.append(0 + 1-1-0) = 0+0=0 -> append 0.\n        then s1 += l[0] -> s1=10, p1=1.\n\n   Then we check: if s1 (10) < s2 (0)? -> false.\n        if s2 (0) < s1 (10)? -> true: then s2 += l[0] -> s2=10, p2=-1.\n\n   Then next iteration: condition: p1-1 = 1-1=0 <= p2=-1? -> false. Break.\n\n   Then we print l2[-1] = 0.\n\n   But the answer should be 0? Because they cannot eat the same non-zero weight? \n\n   However, the problem: they both ate 0? Then total is 0? That is acceptable? \n\n   But the problem says: they want to be fair -> same total weight. They can both eat 0? Then the total candies eaten is 0? \n\n   So the answer is 0? Correct.\n\n   Now, what if we have n=2: [1,1]\n\n   p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: -1<=1 -> true.\n        s1==s2 (0==0): record: total = 0 + (2-1-1)=0. Then update: s1=1, p1=1.\n        then check: s1(1) < s2(0)? false.\n        then check: s2(0) < s1(1)? true: then s2 += l[1] -> s2=1, p2=0.\n\n   Then next iteration: condition: p1-1 = 1-1=0 <= p2=0 -> true.\n        s1==s2 (1==1): record: total = 1 + (2-1-0)= 1+1=2. Then update: s1 += l[1] -> s1=2, p1=2.\n        then check: s1(2) < s2(1)? false.\n        then check: s2(1) < s1(2)? true: then s2 += l[0] -> but p2=0, so we do s2=1+l[0]=1+1=2? Then p2=-1.\n\n   Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=2-1=1 <= p2=-1? false. Break.\n\n   Then we print 2? Correct.\n\n   Now, what if we have n=2: [1,2]\n\n   p1=0, p2=1 -> condition true.\n        s1==s2: record 0. Then update: s1=1, p1=1.\n        then s1(1)<s2(0)? false.\n        then s2(0)<s1(1): true -> s2 += l[1]=2, p2=0.\n\n   Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n        s1(1) != s2(2): skip first if.\n        then s1(1)<s2(2): true -> then we do: s1 += l[1] -> but p1 is 1, so l[1]=2 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n        then s2(2)<s1(3): true -> s2 += l[0] -> l[0]=1 -> s2=3, p2=-1.\n\n   Then break. Then we print l2[-1] = 0? But the answer should be 0? Because they cannot have the same total? \n\n   But wait: we never recorded an equality after the initial one? So we output 0? Correct.\n\n   However, what if we have [1,2] and we want to have Alice take the first candy (1) and Bob take the first candy from the right? But Bob takes the last candy (2) -> then Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal. Then Bob takes the next? But there is no next? Then they cannot have the same total? \n\n   So the answer is 0? Correct.\n\n   Now, the problem: when we do the TODO: we update the left when s1 < s2. But what if p1 is already beyond the array? Actually, the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When p1 becomes n, then p1-1 = n-1. Then we break at the next iteration? But in the current iteration, we are updating? \n\n   How about we do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            if p1 < n:   # but we are not allowed to change the existing code? We can only fill the TODO line? \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n   But the problem says: only fill the missing line? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1 is at most p2+1. And p2 is at least -1? But when p2 is -1, then p1-1<=-1 -> p1<=0. So if p1 is 0, then we can update? \n\n   But if p1 is 0 and p2 is -1, then we are going to update: s1 += l[0] -> that is valid? \n\n   However, the problem: the condition of the while loop is checked at the beginning. So if we are in the loop, then p1-1<=p2. Then p1 is at most p2+1. And p2 is at least 0? Actually, p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. So when p2 becomes -1, we break at the next iteration? \n\n   But in the current iteration, we are updating? \n\n   Actually, in the [1,1] example, we updated the right when p2 was 0? Then we set p2 to -1. Then we break the next iteration.\n\n   But in the [1,2] example, we updated the left when p1=1 (which is the last index) and then set p1=2. Then we updated the right: p2 was 0, then we set to -1. Then we break.\n\n   The problem: when p1=2, then we try to access l[2]? That is out of bounds.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n   How? We note that the condition p1-1<=p2 is true at the beginning of the loop. Then we update. But after updating, p1 might become p2+2? Then we break next time? \n\n   But we are updating the left: we do p1 +=1. Then we break the condition for the next iteration? \n\n   However, we are still in the same iteration? Then we do the next if? \n\n   We must not update if p1 is beyond the last index? \n\n   But the problem: we are only allowed to output the missing code? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2 and p1 < n: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But wait: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> which means p1<=p2+1. And p2 is at least -1? But when p2 is -1, then p1<=0. So if p1 is 0, then we can update? \n\n   But if p1 is 0 and p2 is -1, then we are in the loop? Then we do the update? But p1=0 is valid? \n\n   However, the condition p1-1<=p2: when p2=-1, then p1-1<=-1 -> p1<=0. So p1 can be 0? Then we update: s1 += l[0] -> valid. Then p1 becomes 1. Then we break the next iteration.\n\n   But what if p1 is already n? Then we cannot update? \n\n   Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2: if p1=n, then n-1<=p2? But p2 is at most n-1? So n-1<=p2 -> then p2 must be n-1? Then we are updating the left? But we are at p1=n, which is beyond? \n\n   How can we get p1=n? \n\n   We start at p1=0. Then we update until p1 becomes n. Then the condition: p1-1 = n-1 <= p2? Then p2 must be at least n-1? But p2 starts at n-1 and we update it by decreasing? So p2 can be n-1? \n\n   Then we are in the loop: p1=n, p2=n-1? \n\n   Then we do the update: \n        if s1==s2? \n        then if s1 < s2: \n            we do: s1 += l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n   Since we are only allowed to output the missing code, and we cannot change the condition of the while loop, we must do:\n\n        if s1 < s2 and p1 < n: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but the array l has n elements? So p1 must be in [0, n-1] to be valid? \n\n   However, the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1<=p2+1. And p2 is in [-1, n-1]. So p1 can be at most n? But we cannot access l[n]. \n\n   Therefore, we must check p1 < n.\n\n   But the existing code in the first if does not check? \n\n   Actually, the first if: \n        s1 += l[p1]   -> if p1 is n? Then we get an error.\n\n   So we must fix both? But we are only allowed to fix the TODO? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the condition p1-1<=p2 and the fact that p2 is at most n-1 implies that p1<=n. But when p1==n, then we cannot update? \n\n   How about we change the condition of the while loop? But we are not allowed.\n\n   Since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are not allowed to change the existing code, we must hope that the test cases do not cause an out of bounds? \n\n   But the [1,1] example: we updated p1 to 2? Then we tried to update the right: we did s2 += l[0] -> which is valid? \n\n   But in the [1,1] example, we did not get an out of bounds? \n\n   Actually, when p1=2, we did not update the left again? Because after the first if, we updated the left to p1=1? Then we did the right update? Then we broke the next iteration? \n\n   The problem is in the [1,2] example: after the first if, we updated the left to p1=1. Then we did the right update? Then we had p1=1, p2=0. Then we entered the loop: condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true. Then we did the TODO: s1 < s2 -> true, then we did s1 += l[1] -> valid? Then p1 becomes 2. Then we did the next if: s2 < s1 -> true, then we did s2 += l[0] -> valid? Then p2 becomes -1. Then we break next iteration.\n\n   So we never accessed l[2]? \n\n   But what if we have a test case that causes p1 to become n? \n\n   Example: n=1: \n        p1=0, p2=0: \n            s1==s2: record, then update: s1=l[0], p1=1.\n            then s1 (l[0]) and s2 (0): then we do the right update: s2 += l[0] -> s2=l[0], p2=-1.\n        then break.\n\n   Then we never accessed l[1]? \n\n   So it seems safe? \n\n   Why? Because the condition p1-1<=p2: \n        After updating the left in the first if, we have p1 increased by one. Then we check the next conditions? Then we update the right? Then we break the next iteration? \n\n   But what if we have a test case that after the first update (when s1==s2) we have s1 < s2? Then we do the TODO: update the left again? \n\n   Example: n=3, [1,1,1]\n\n        p1=0, p2=2: \n            s1==s2: record total=0. Then update: s1=1, p1=1.\n            then s1(1) < s2(0)? false.\n            then s2(0) < s1(1): true -> update right: s2=1, p2=1.\n\n        Then next iteration: p1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n            s1==s2: record total = 1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2. Then update: s1=1+l[1]=2, p1=2.\n            then s1(2) < s2(1)? false.\n            then s2(1) < s1(2): true -> update right: but p2=1, so we do s2=1+l[1]=2, p2=0.\n\n        Then next iteration: p1-1=2-1=1<=0? false -> break.\n\n        Then we print 2? But the answer should be 3? \n\n        How? Alice takes [1,1] (weight=2) and Bob takes [1] (weight=1) -> not equal? \n        Or Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [1,1] -> then Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal.\n\n        But wait: the problem: Alice can only take from the left in a row? Bob from the right in a row? \n\n        They can take: \n            Alice: take the first two: [1,1] -> weight=2.\n            Bob: take the last one: [1] -> weight=1 -> not equal.\n\n        Or Alice: take the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n        Bob: take the last two: [1,1] -> weight=2.\n\n        Or Alice: take the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n        Bob: take the last one: [1] -> weight=1 -> total=2.\n\n        Or Alice: take the first three: [1,1,1] -> weight=3.\n        Bob: take nothing -> weight=0.\n\n        Or Alice: take nothing, Bob: take nothing -> total=0.\n\n        Or Alice: take nothing, Bob: take the last one: [1] -> weight=1.\n\n        The only fair is when both have 1: then total candies=2.\n\n        But the problem says: they want to eat the same total weight. The maximum total candies they can eat? \n\n        They can also do: \n            Alice: take the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n            Bob: take the last one: [1] -> weight=1 -> total=2.\n\n        Or: \n            Alice: take the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n            Bob: take the last two: [1,1] -> weight=2 -> not fair.\n\n        Or: \n            Alice: take the first two: [1,1] -> weight=2.\n            Bob: take the last two: [1,1] -> but they overlap? The middle candy? \n\n        The problem: if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So Bob can only eat the last one? Then the middle candy is not eaten? \n\n        So the maximum total candies is 2.\n\n        But the example in the problem: \n            For the second test case: [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6] -> answer=6? \n            How? \n                Alice: first three: 3+1+4=8? \n                Bob: last three: 2+6+9=17? -> not 8.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] and Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> each 30? \n            But the input is not provided.\n\n        The sample test cases:\n\n        Test case 1: n=3, [1,1,1] -> answer=2? \n\n        But the problem says: for the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\n        How? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30.\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30.\n            Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n        So the algorithm must work for that.\n\n        Now, in our algorithm for [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] (n=8):\n\n            We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0.\n            Then update: s1=7, p1=1.\n            Then s1(7)<s2(0)? false -> then s2(0)<s1(7): true -> s2=1, p2=7.\n\n            Then: p1=1, p2=7: condition: 1-1=0<=7 -> true.\n                s1=7, s2=1 -> not equal.\n                s1(7)>s2(1): so we do the right update: s2=1+l[7]=1+11=12? -> wait, the array: \n                    l = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> index 7 is 1? Then we did s2=1? Then we update: s2=1+1=2? p2=6.\n\n            Then: p1=1, p2=6: \n                s1=7, s2=2 -> update right: s2=2+l[6]=2+11=13, p2=5.\n\n            Then: p1=1, p2=5: \n                s1=7, s2=13 -> update left: s1=7+l[1]=7+3=10, p1=2.\n\n            Then: p1=2, p2=5: \n                s1=10, s2=13 -> update left: s1=10+l[2]=10+20=30, p1=3.\n\n            Then: p1=3, p2=5: \n                s1=30, s2=13 -> update right: s2=13+l[5]=13+8=21, p2=4.\n\n            Then: p1=3, p2=4: \n                s1=30, s2=21 -> update right: s2=21+l[4]=21+10=31, p2=3.\n\n            Then: p1=3, p2=3: \n                condition: 3-1=2<=3 -> true.\n                s1=30, s2=31 -> update left: s1=30+l[3]=30+5=35, p1=4.\n\n            Then break: because next iteration: p1=4, p2=3 -> 4-1=3<=3 -> true.\n                s1=35, s2=31 -> update left: s1=35+l[4]=35+10=45, p1=5.\n                then update: s1< s2? false -> s2< s1: true -> s2=31+l[3] -> but p2=3, so l[3]=5 -> s2=36, p2=2.\n\n            Then break next iteration.\n\n            Then we print the last recorded value? The last recorded value was 0? \n\n            But we never recorded any equality after the initial one? \n\n            How do we record the equality at 30? \n\n            We had an equality at the beginning? Then we updated. Then we never had s1==s2 again? \n\n            But the example says they both have 30? \n\n            How do we record that? \n\n            We record when s1==s2. But in the example, when s1=30 and s2=13, we did not record because they are not equal? \n\n            Then when we update the right: s2 becomes 21, then we update the left? Then we never had 30 again? \n\n            But note: the example: \n                Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30.\n                Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30.\n\n            How do we get that? \n                We start: \n                    Alice: 7 -> s1=7, Bob: 1 -> s2=1.\n                    Alice: 7+3=10, Bob: 1+11=12 -> then Alice: 10+20=30, Bob: 12+8=20? -> not 30.\n\n            Actually, Bob's candies: from the right: \n                first from the right: 1, then next is 11, then next is 8, then next is 10? \n                So Bob: 1+11+8+10 = 30.\n\n            In the array: \n                l[7]=1, l[6]=11, l[5]=8, l[4]=10.\n\n            So in the algorithm:\n\n                s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0.\n                then update left: s1=7, p1=1.\n                then s2 < s1: update right: s2=1, p2=6.\n                then s1=7, s2=1 -> update right: s2=1+11=12, p2=5.\n                then s1=7, s2=12 -> update left: s1=7+3=10, p1=2.\n                then s1=10, s2=12 -> update left: s1=10+20=30, p1=3.\n                then s1=30, s2=12 -> update right: s2=12+8=20, p2=4.\n                then s1=30, s2=20 -> update right: s2=20+10=30, p2=3.\n                then s1=30, s2=30 -> record: total = p1 (3) + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (7-3)=3+4=7.\n                then update left: s1=30+l[3]=30+5=35, p1=4.\n                then break next iteration? \n\n            So we recorded 7.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm should work.\n\n            But in our simulation above for [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1], we did not have the step where we record 7? \n\n            Why? Because after the last right update (p2=3), we have s1=30, s2=30? Then in the next iteration: \n                p1=3, p2=3: condition: 3-1=2<=3 -> true.\n                then we do the first if: s1==s2: record 3 + (8-1-3)=3+4=7.\n                then we update left: s1=30+5=35, p1=4.\n                then we do the next if: s1< s2? 35<30? false.\n                then s2< s1: true -> update right: s2=30+l[3]=30+5=35, p2=2.\n                then next iteration: p1=4, p2=2: condition: 4-1=3<=2 -> false. break.\n\n            Then we print 7.\n\n            So the algorithm works.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n            But we must ensure that p1 is within bounds? \n\n            In the example, when we update the left in the TODO, p1 is always within [0, n-1] because the condition p1-1<=p2 ensures that p1<=p2+1, and p2 is at least 0? \n\n            But when p2 becomes -1, then p1-1<=-1 -> p1<=0. Then p1=0, and we update? Then we do s1 += l[0] -> valid.\n\n            And then p1 becomes 1, and then we break next iteration.\n\n            So we never access out of bounds? \n\n            Let me test with n=1: [10]\n\n                p1=0, p2=0: \n                    s1==s2: record 0.\n                    then update left: s1=10, p1=1.\n                    then s1< s2? false.\n                    then s2< s1: true -> update right: s2=10, p2=-1.\n                next iteration: condition: p1-1=0<=-1? false -> break.\n                print 0.\n\n            And we never accessed l[1]? \n\n            Therefore, the TODO is simply:\n\n                if s1 < s2: \n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n   But note: the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2. When p1 becomes p2+2, then we break next iteration? But we are updating the left: we set p1 to p1+1. Then we are still in the loop? Then we might do the next if? \n\n   But the condition is checked at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n   But we must write it in one line? Or two lines? The existing code for the other if is on one line? \n\n   The existing code for the first if is: \n        l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n\n   And for the third if: \n        s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n   But the TODO has a comment: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace that comment with:\n\n        s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n   But note: the existing code has the third if as:\n\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   So we do similarly.\n\n   However, the TODO is on a separate line? \n\n   The code:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We can write:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But the existing code for the third if is written in one line? \n\n   We can write in one line? \n\n   But the problem: the code is given as:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We can replace the whole line? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output the block? \n\n   But the output format is: only the missing code? \n\n   We output for program1: the string: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   But note: the existing line has a comment at the end. We can remove it? \n\n   Or we can output:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n   But to be safe, we output exactly what is missing: the two lines of the block? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n   And the TODO is at the line:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We need to replace that line with two lines? \n\n   Or we can do one line? \n\n   Since the existing code for the third if is one line, we do one line.\n\n   So:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n   But note: the next line is:\n\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   So we want:\n\n        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   But wait: the existing code has the first if and then two separate ifs. We are not changing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the two lines as:\n\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   But then we would be missing the condition? \n\n   The condition is already in the existing line.\n\n   The problem: the existing line is:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must complete the block under this condition.\n\n   So we output two lines: \n\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   But then the code becomes:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   That is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem: the next line is an if statement? We must not break the structure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output one line that includes the condition? \n\n   But the problem says: we are given program1.py with missing lines or blocks. We are to fill in.\n\n   Since the condition is already there, we only need to fill the body.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, we output the two lines of the body? \n\n   But the output format is a string for \"program1\". We can output:\n\n        \"        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n   But note: the existing line has the condition and a comment. We are replacing the entire line? \n\n   The problem: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output the block that is missing, which is the two lines.\n\n   However, the TODO is on the same line as the condition. We cannot remove the condition? \n\n   We are to output only the missing part? The missing part is the body of the if.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   But then the code would be:\n\n        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   That is not what we want? The body must be indented.\n\n   Therefore, we output the two lines with indentation.\n\n   The existing code has 8 spaces for the block? \n\n   We see: \n\n        while (p1-1<=p2):\n            if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n   The body of the while is indented by 4 spaces. The if statements are indented by 4 more (so 8 in total).\n\n   So we output for the body of the second if:\n\n        \"        s1 += l[p1]\"\n        \"        p1 += 1\"\n\n   But as a string with newline? \n\n   We can output: \"        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n   But note: the next line is already there: the third if. So we must not remove it.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the completion is: \"        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n   But wait: the existing line with TODO is still there? We are only outputting the missing block? \n\n   The problem: the TODO is on the condition line. We are to replace that line? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output the corrected line? \n\n   We can output for program1.py: \n\n        \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   This replaces the TODO line.\n\n   Or we can output two lines:\n\n        \"        if s1 < s2:\"\n        \"            s1 += l[p1]\"\n        \"            p1 += 1\"\n\n   But that would be three lines? And we already have the condition? \n\n   I think the intended solution is to output the two lines of the body, with the same indentation as the existing if bodies.\n\n   But the first if has a one-line body. The third if has a one-line body. The second if will have a two-line body? \n\n   We can do one line? \n\n   We output for program1.py: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   This replaces the TODO line.\n\n   This is consistent with the other if statements.\n\n   Therefore, we choose that.\n\n   So for program1.py: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   But note: the existing TODO line is: \"        if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n   We are replacing it with: \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\"\n\n   And then the next line is the third if.\n\n   That is acceptable.\n\n   Now, for program2.py:\n\n   The problem: stamping. We are given a string s of length n, consisting of 'W', 'R', 'B'. We start with all 'W'. We can use a stamp that covers two adjacent cells and colors them as either \"BR\" or \"RB\". We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. We can also stamp overlapping. \n\n   We need to determine if it is possible to achieve the string s.\n\n   The provided code:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   This reads the test cases: \n        [*open(0)] is a list of lines.\n        [2::2] means starting from index 2 (the third line) and then every other line: so we get the second line of each test case (which is the string s).\n\n   But the first line of each test case is the integer n, and we are skipping it? \n\n   Actually, the input:\n\n        t\n        then for each test case:\n            n\n            s\n\n        So [2::2] gives: \n            index0: t\n            index1: n for test1\n            index2: s for test1\n            index3: n for test2\n            index4: s for test2\n            ...\n\n        Then [2::2] gives: index2, index4, index6, ... -> which are the strings.\n\n   But we also need n? \n\n   The problem: the first line of each test case is n, and the second is s. \n\n   The code: \n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   This iterates over the strings. But we lost n? \n\n   However, n is the length of the string? So we can do len(s.strip())? \n\n   But the string s includes the newline? \n\n   We can do: \n\n        s = s.strip()\n\n   Then n = len(s)\n\n   The problem: the total length of all strings is at most 100000, so we can do.\n\n   Approach for the problem:\n\n   We note that the stamping operation is reversible? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy or DP? \n\n   But note: the constraints: total n<=100000.\n\n   Insight:\n\n   The stamping operation always changes two adjacent cells. Also, note that the stamp can be applied in any order and multiple times.\n\n   We can think of the following:\n\n   - A white cell 'W' means no stamp has been applied that covers it? But note: we can stamp multiple times. However, the initial is white. And the stamp always changes the color: \n        If a cell is white and we stamp it with a stamp that covers it and its neighbor, then it becomes either 'R' or 'B'. \n\n   But note: the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So isolated stamps are not allowed? \n\n   Also, the operation is reversible: we can remove the last stamp? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:\n\n   We split the string by 'W'. Why? Because 'W' acts as a separator. Between two 'W's, we have a segment of non-white cells.\n\n   Then, for each segment (which is a string of 'R' and 'B'), we must be able to form it with the stamp.\n\n   Conditions for a segment:\n\n        - The segment must be non-empty? But if the segment is empty, skip.\n\n        - In a segment, we can only have an even number of operations? But note: each stamp covers two cells. However, a cell can be covered multiple times.\n\n   Actually, known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems):\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if the entire string is white -> YES.\n\n            Split the string by 'W'. For each segment in segments:\n                if the segment is of length 1 -> NO.\n                if the segment has only one color? -> NO.\n\n            Otherwise, YES.\n\n   Why?\n\n        - If a segment has length 1: then we have one cell that is not white. But the stamp always covers two cells. So we cannot have a single non-white cell? -> NO.\n\n        - If a segment has only one color, say all 'R': then how to achieve it? \n                We start with white. We must apply a stamp that covers two cells. But if we apply a stamp that covers two cells in this segment, we get one 'R' and one 'B'? Then we have a 'B' that we don't want? \n                We can try to cover it again? But then we would change the 'B' to something else? \n                Actually, if we have a segment \"RR\", we can do:\n                    stamp on the two: \n                         if we use BR: then we get BR? \n                         if we use RB: then we get RB? \n                    but we want RR? \n                How? \n                    Start: WW\n                    Stamp on the two: BR or RB? \n                    Then we have one B. Then we stamp again on the same two: \n                         if we use RB on the BR: \n                             first cell: R (because the stamp: R then B? but the stamp is applied: \n                                first cell: if it was B and we stamp with RB: \n                                    The stamp says: the first cell becomes R, the second becomes B? \n                                    But then we have RB? \n                         or if we use BR: \n                                first cell becomes B, second becomes R? -> then we have BB? \n                    It seems we cannot get RR.\n\n                Therefore, a segment of all the same color is impossible.\n\n        - If a segment has at least two and has both colors, then we can form it.\n\n   But what about a segment of length 2: \"RB\" or \"BR\" -> we can do one stamp.\n\n   A segment of length 3: \"RBB\" -> \n        We can do:\n            Step1: stamp on the first two: RB -> then we have RBW\n            Step2: stamp on the second and third: then the second is already R? and we stamp with ? \n                We want the second to become B? and the third to become B? \n                But the stamp: \n                    if we use BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R? -> then we have R R? \n                Or if we use RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R R? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            Step1: stamp on the last two: then we have W and then the last two become BR? -> then we have WBR.\n            Step2: stamp on the first two: then the first becomes ? and the second becomes ? \n                We want the first to become R? \n                If we use RB: then first becomes R, second becomes B -> then we have R B R? -> not RBB.\n\n        How about:\n            Step1: stamp on the first two: RB -> R B W\n            Step2: stamp on the second and third: we want to change the second to B and the third to B? \n                But the stamp always produces one R and one B? \n\n        Then we cannot have two B's in a row? \n\n        But wait: we can stamp multiple times. \n\n        Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2: \n            if we use BR: then we get B at 1 and R at 2? -> then we have B R W\n        Step2: stamp on positions 2 and 3: \n            if we use BR: then we get B at 2 and R at 3? -> then we have B B R.\n        Step3: stamp on positions 1 and 2 again: \n            if we use RB: then we get R at 1 and B at 2? -> then we have R B R? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R B W\n            Step2: positions 1 and 2 again: if we use RB: \n                The first cell: was R, then we apply RB: \n                    The stamp: first becomes R? or B? \n                The operation: the stamp sets the two cells to the colors of the stamp. \n                So if we apply RB on the first two, we get RB? \n            Then we have R B -> becomes RB? \n            Then we have RB and the third is W.\n\n            Then Step3: positions 2 and 3: \n                if we use BR: then we get B at 2 and R at 3? -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n        How to get RBB? \n\n        Known solution: we split by 'W'. For a segment, we require that it has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n        In the segment \"RBB\", we have one 'R' and two 'B's -> so it has both. Then it is valid.\n\n        But how to form it? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Start: W W W\n            Step1: stamp on positions 1 and 2 with RB: -> R B W\n            Step2: stamp on positions 2 and 3 with BR: -> then the second cell: was B, becomes B again? \n                    The stamp BR: \n                        position2: becomes B? \n                        position3: becomes R? \n                    Then we have R, B, R.\n\n            Step2: use RB on positions 2 and 3: \n                    then position2: B becomes R? \n                    position3: becomes B? \n                    Then we have R, R, B.\n\n            Step2: use BR on positions 1 and 2: \n                    then position1: R becomes B? \n                    position2: B becomes R? \n                    Then we have B, R, W.\n\n            Then we are stuck.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step1: positions 2 and 3: use BR -> then we have W, B, R.\n            Step2: positions 1 and 2: use RB -> then position1: W becomes R? \n                    position2: B becomes B? (if we use RB: then first becomes R, second becomes B) -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n        How about three stamps:\n\n            Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W\n            Step2: positions 1 and 2: BR -> then we get: \n                    first: R becomes B? \n                    second: B becomes R? \n                    -> B, R, W\n            Step3: positions 2 and 3: RB -> then second: R becomes R? (if we use RB: then second becomes R? but we want B) -> no.\n\n        It seems difficult.\n\n        Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #727 (Div. 2), problem C): \n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if s.count('R') == 0 and s.count('B') == 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    return\n                arr = s.split('W')\n                for a in arr:\n                    if a == \"\":\n                        continue\n                    if 'R' not in a or 'B' not in a:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        This matches: \n            - If the entire string is white, then we have no non-white -> then we skip the segments? Actually, the split will give empty segments? Then we skip and print YES.\n\n            - For a segment, if it does not contain 'R' or does not contain 'B', then NO.\n\n        Why is \"RBB\" valid? \n            It contains 'R' and 'B'. \n\n        Why is \"RR\" invalid? \n            It does not contain 'B'.\n\n        Why is \"BB\" invalid? \n            It does not contain 'R'.\n\n        Why is \"R\" invalid? \n            It has length 1? and also it doesn't have 'B'? \n\n        But the condition: if 'R' not in a or 'B' not in a -> then NO.\n\n        For \"R\": 'B' not in a -> NO.\n\n        For \"RR\": 'B' not in a -> NO.\n\n        For \"RBB\": has 'R' and 'B' -> YES.\n\n        But we couldn't construct \"RBB\" manually? \n\n        However, known problems: \n            Example: \"RR\" -> NO, \"R\"->NO, \"RBB\"->YES.\n\n        The sample test cases in the problem:\n\n            Example 1: \"BRB\" -> is that valid? \n                It has both -> YES.\n\n            Example 2: \"B\" -> NO.\n\n            Example 3: \"W\" -> YES.\n\n            Example 4: \"R\" -> NO.\n\n            Example 5: \"WW\" -> YES.\n\n            Example 6: \"RB\" -> YES.\n\n            Example 7: \"BRB\" -> YES.\n\n            Example 8: \"RRR\" -> NO.\n\n            Example 9: \"RBW\" -> \n                Split: ['RB', ''] -> the first segment has both -> YES.\n\n            Example 10: \"RRBW\" -> \n                Segment1: \"RRB\" -> has both -> YES.\n\n            Example 11: \"RRBB\" -> has both -> YES.\n\n        How to form \"RRBB\"? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W, W\n                Step2: positions 3 and 4: RB -> R, B, R, B\n                Step3: positions 2 and 3: BR -> \n                    position2: B becomes B? \n                    position3: R becomes R? \n                    -> no change? \n\n            Alternatively:\n\n                Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W, W\n                Step2: positions 2 and 3: BR -> \n                    position2: B becomes R? \n                    position3: W becomes B? \n                    -> R, R, B, W\n                Step3: positions 3 and 4: RB -> \n                    position3: B becomes R? \n                    position4: W becomes B? \n                    -> R, R, R, B -> not RRBB.\n\n            How about:\n\n                Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W, W\n                Step2: positions 1 and 2 again: BR -> \n                    position1: R becomes B? \n                    position2: B becomes R? \n                    -> B, R, W, W\n                Step3: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W, W -> back.\n\n            Another try:\n\n                Step1: positions 2 and 3: RB -> W, R, B, W\n                Step2: positions 3 and 4: BR -> W, R, B, R -> not RRBB.\n\n            Step1: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, W, W\n            Step2: positions 1 and 2: BR -> B, R, W, W\n            Step3: positions 3 and 4: RB -> B, R, R, B\n            Step4: positions 1 and 2: RB -> R, B, R, B\n            Step5: positions 2 and 3: BR -> R, R, B, B -> RRBB.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n        Therefore, the solution: \n            Split the string by 'W' and for each segment, if the segment is non-empty, then it must contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n        Code:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if n==0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                # If the entire string is white, then we are done.\n                # Split by 'W'\n                segments = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for seg in segments:\n                    if seg == '': \n                        continue\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the input has the total length of strings <= 100000, and we are splitting, and each character is processed once? Then it is efficient.\n\n        Now, we are to complete program2.py:\n\n            The code: \n\n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            This iterates over the strings of the test cases. But we lost t? \n\n            Actually, the first line is t, then the next lines are pairs (n, s). \n\n            The code [*open(0)][2::2] gives every second line starting from index2, which are the strings.\n\n            But we don't have n? But we can get n = len(s.strip())\n\n            However, the string s might have a newline? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n\n            Then n = len(s)\n\n            But note: the problem says the first line of each test case is n, and the second is the string. \n\n            We are only given the string. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                t = number of test cases? We don't need it? because we are iterating over the strings.\n\n            Code:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == \"\": \n                        # then n=0\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        segments = s.split('W')\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in segments:\n                            if seg == '':\n                                continue\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But what if the string is all white? \n\n                s = \"WWW\" -> split: ['','','',''] -> then we skip, valid remains True -> YES.\n\n            What if the string is \"W\"? -> split: ['',''] -> valid.\n\n            What if the string is \"R\"? -> split: ['R'] -> then we check: 'R' has no 'B' -> valid=False -> NO.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total length of the strings is at most 100000, and we are doing a split and then for each segment we do a membership test? The total length of all segments is the total length of the strings? So it is O(n) per test case? And the sum of n is 100000, so it is acceptable.\n\n            However, we are iterating over the test cases. The total length of the strings is 100000, so we are safe.\n\n            But the input: the first line is t, then the next lines are the test cases. The code [*open(0)][2::2] gives the strings. \n\n            But what if t=0? Then [2::2] would be empty? \n\n            We don't care.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, we output:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n                if s == \"\":\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    flag = True\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg == '':\n                            continue\n                        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                            flag = False\n                            break\n                    print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n            But we must write it in the for loop? \n\n            The for loop is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n            Then we do the above.\n\n            We can write:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n                segs = s.split('W')\n                for seg in segs:\n                    if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n            But note: we have multiple test cases. We must print for each test case.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == \"\":\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                        continue\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg != '' and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            We can also do without the if s==\"\": because if s is empty, then segs = ['']? Then we check: '' is skipped, and then we don't set valid to false -> valid remains True.\n\n            But if s is empty string, then segs = ['']? Then we do: \n                for seg in [['']]: \n                    seg is '' -> skip? \n                then valid remains True -> YES.\n\n            But if s is \"W\", then segs = ['',''] -> then we skip both -> valid remains True.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg != '':   # non-empty\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But note: we must reset valid for each test case? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg:   # non-empty\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But what if there are multiple segments that are invalid? We break at the first.\n\n            This is efficient.\n\n            However, we can use the for-else:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg:   # non-empty\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                break\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n\n            But note: if we break, we print \"NO\", and then we move to the next test case? \n\n            But what if we don't break? then we print \"YES\".\n\n            This is acceptable.\n\n            But what if one test case has multiple segments and the first segment is valid, but the second is invalid? \n\n                We break at the first invalid segment? Then we print \"NO\", and then the next segments of the same test case? \n\n            But we break the inner for loop, then we move to the next test case? \n\n            Actually, the structure:\n\n                for s in ...:   # for each test case\n                    ... \n                    for seg in segs: \n                        if ...: \n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n\n            This is per test case.\n\n            So we can do.\n\n            But note: we must not print more than one answer per test case.\n\n            Therefore, we choose:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == \"\": \n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        segs = s.split('W')\n                        for seg in segs:\n                            if seg != '':\n                                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                    print(\"NO\")\n                                    break\n                        else:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n\n            But we can combine the empty string: \n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg): \n                            # Note: if the segment is non-empty and (it doesn't have R or it doesn't have B) -> then it's invalid.\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n\n            This works for the empty string: \n                if s is empty -> segs = [''] -> then the for loop: seg is '' -> skip -> then we do the else: print \"YES\".\n\n            And for \"R\": segs = ['','',''] and also ['R']? \n                Actually, split by 'W': \"R\".split('W') -> ['','','']? \n                No: \"R\".split('W') -> ['R'].\n\n            So for \"R\": \n                segs = ['R'] -> then we do: \n                    seg = 'R' -> non-empty -> then check: 'R' not in 'R'? false. 'B' not in 'R'? true -> so condition: true -> then we print \"NO\" and break.\n\n            For \"RB\": \n                segs = ['RB'] -> then we check: \n                    'R' in 'RB' -> true, 'B' in 'RB' -> true -> condition: false -> skip.\n\n                Then we do the else: print \"YES\".\n\n            For \"R\": condition: \n                'R' not in 'R' -> false, 'B' not in 'R' -> true -> so (false or true) = true.\n\n            So condition: if seg and (('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg)):\n\n            But we want: if the segment is non-empty and (does not contain 'R' OR does not contain 'B') -> then invalid.\n\n            So we print \"NO\".\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, we output:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n                segs = s.split('W')\n                for seg in segs:\n                    if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                        print('NO')\n                        break\n                else:\n                    print('YES')\n\n            But note: the for loop is over the test cases. We must do this for each test case.\n\n            We write it as:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    segs = s.split('W')\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                            print('NO')\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        print('YES')\n\n            But we must be careful: the variable name 's' is reused. The outer s is the string of the test case. The inner seg is the segment.\n\n            This is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem: the input might have multiple test cases. We are printing for each test case.\n\n   But the code: \n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            ... \n\n   Then we do the above.\n\n   Therefore, the completion for program2.py is the entire block? \n\n   But the TODO is at the end of the for loop line. We are to complete the body of the for loop.\n\n   We output:\n\n        \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\\n            print('NO')\\n            break\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n   But note: the for loop in the given code is: \n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the comment with the body.\n\n   We output the body as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n   The given for loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n   We do:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                    print('NO')\n                    break\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n   But the body of the outer for loop is 5 lines? \n\n   We output for program2.py: \n\n        \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\\n            print('NO')\\n            break\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n\n   But note: the inner for loop has an else, which is aligned with the for.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write without the inner for-else:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n   This is also acceptable.\n\n   We choose the for-else because it is shorter.\n\n   But the problem: the total length of the string is at most 100000, and the number of test cases is at most 10000, but the total length is 100000, so the number of test cases might be up to 10000? But the total length is 100000, so the maximum number of test cases is 100000? \n\n   Actually, the total length of the strings is 100000, and each test case has at least one character? Then the maximum number of test cases is 100000? But the first line says the total n over test cases is 100000.\n\n   So we can do.\n\n   We output for program2.py: the block.\n\n   Now, the output format is a JSON with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n   We output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        if s1 < s2: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\\n            print('NO')\\n            break\\n    else:\\n        print('YES')\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 block: the first line is \"    s = s.strip()\", which is 4 spaces? \n\n   The outer for loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces. Then the inner for loop is 8 spaces, and the if is 8 spaces, and the print is 12 spaces.\n\n   But the given code for program2.py: \n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with the body. The body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n   We output the body as a multi-line string with 4-space indentation for the outer body, and then 8, 12 for the inner.\n\n   But the example: \n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n                    print('NO')\n                    break\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the inner condition: \n\n        if seg and ('R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n\n   This is equivalent to: if the segment is non-empty and (it does not contain 'R' OR it does not contain 'B') -> then invalid.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer."
