But wait: the middle cell was stamped twice: first set to R (if we did the right two as RB: then the middle becomes R and the right becomes B) and then when we stamp the left two, we set the left to B and the middle to R? Then we have B, R, B.\n\n          So we can have \"B\", \"R\", \"B\". How about \"RRB\"? We can do:\n            Start: WWW\n            Step1: stamp the left two: RB -> then we have R, B, W.\n            Step2: stamp the middle two: set the middle and right to BR -> then the middle becomes B (from the first stamp) then set to R? and the right becomes B?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs that are identical. The problem is about determining if a given string of 'R', 'B', and 'W' can be formed by stamping adjacent pairs (with stamp patterns \"RB\" or \"BR\") multiple times, possibly overlapping.\n\nThe key idea is to note:\n1. The entire string must be partitioned into segments separated by 'W'. Each segment (which is non-white) must be independently stampable.\n2. In a segment (with no white), we can only form patterns that have an even number of consecutive same colors? Actually, note that the stamp always places one red and one blue. However, because of overlapping, we can get sequences of multiple same colors? But observe:\n\nImportant observations:\n- The stamp operation is linear in the sense of operations modulo 2? Actually, each stamp flips the colors in two adjacent cells. But note: initially white, and each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) sets them to either (R,B) or (B,R). However, if we stamp again on the same pair, it will flip again: (R,B) becomes (B,R) and vice versa. Also, if we stamp overlapping, for example on (1,2) then (2,3), then cell 2 gets stamped twice.\n\nBut note: the problem allows multiple stamps on the same cell. However, the initial state is white. How do we model?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the following:\n- The entire process must satisfy that in any contiguous non-white segment:\n   a) The segment must have at least two cells (because you cannot stamp a single cell). But note: if the segment is of length 1, then it's impossible? However, the problem states that for a single cell it's impossible. So any segment of length 1 is invalid.\n\n   b) Also, note that the operations are reversible? We can consider the necessary conditions:\n\nAnother known solution for this problem (from known problems like Codeforces Global Round 18, Problem A) is:\n   - Split the string by 'W'\n   - For each contiguous segment of non-white (only 'R' and 'B'):\n        * If the segment is empty, skip.\n        * The segment must have at least one red and one blue? Actually, no: consider \"RR\" -> is that possible?\n          How to form \"RR\"? \n          We can do: \n            Start: WWW (for two cells: WW)\n            Step1: Stamp the two cells: becomes RB or BR. \n            Then if we stamp again on the same two cells, it becomes BR (if first was RB) or RB? Actually, stamping again on the same two cells flips both: \n                RB -> becomes BR? \n                But wait: the stamp sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So if we stamp twice on the same pair, we get:\n                    first stamp: RB\n                    second stamp: BR (if we use the same stamp pattern) or RB (if we use the opposite)? Actually, the stamp is reversible: \n                    If we use the same stamp again on the same two cells, we get back to white? \n                    But note: the stamp operation is defined as setting the two cells to the pattern. So if we stamp with the same pattern again, we set the same pattern again? \n\n          Actually, the problem states: \"Each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So it doesn't flip, it sets. \n\n          However, note: the example shows that the same cell can be stamped multiple times. But the stamp always sets the two cells to one red and one blue. So if we have a segment of two cells that are both red, that is impossible? Because the stamp would set one to red and the other to blue. \n\n          Therefore, in a segment of two cells, the only possibilities are \"RB\", \"BR\", but not \"RR\" or \"BB\".\n\n          How about three cells? \n          Possibilities: \n            We can do:\n              Step1: stamp on the middle and right: so the right two become (say) RB -> so we have W, R, B -> then stamp on the left two: set the left two to (say) BR -> then we have B, R, B? \n              But wait: the middle cell was stamped twice: first set to R (if we did the right two as RB: then the middle becomes R and the right becomes B) and then when we stamp the left two, we set the left to B and the middle to R? Then we have B, R, B.\n\n          So we can have \"B\", \"R\", \"B\". \n\n          How about \"RRB\"? \n          We can do:\n            Start: WWW\n            Step1: stamp the left two: RB -> then we have R, B, W.\n            Step2: stamp the middle two: set the middle and right to BR -> then the middle becomes B (from the first stamp) then set to R? and the right becomes B? \n            So we get: R, R, B? \n\n          So \"RRB\" is possible.\n\n          But note: in \"RRB\", we have two reds and one blue. \n\n          What is the invariant? \n          Since each stamp adds one red and one blue, the entire picture must have the same number of reds and blues? \n          However, note that we can stamp the same cell multiple times. For example, if we stamp a cell twice, then that cell gets set twice: so the net effect might be that it becomes red then blue? \n\n          Actually, the operations are not additive. The stamp sets the two cells to a pattern. \n\n          Alternate invariant: \n          Consider the positions: \n            Let the cells be indexed 0 to n-1.\n            We can represent the color as a variable: \n                Let R = 1, B = 0 (or modulo 2). \n            But note: the stamp sets two adjacent cells to (1,0) or (0,1). \n\n          However, observe that the parity of the number of stamps that cover a cell might matter? \n\n          Known solution from Codeforces: \n            We can solve by:\n              - Removing all white cells and then check that the remaining string is non-empty and has an even length? \n            But the example \"RRB\" (which is of length 3) is possible.\n\n          Actually, known solution from Codeforces Global Round 18, problem A: \n            We split by 'W'\n            For each segment in the split:\n                if the segment is empty: continue.\n                if the segment has length 1: then impossible.\n                Also, we can check: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n          Why? \n          Because if a segment is all R's, then how was it formed? \n          Consider: \n            The stamp always sets two adjacent cells to one R and one B. \n            If we have a segment of all R's, then every time we stamped we must have set a B somewhere? But then that B must have been covered by a later stamp to turn it into R? \n          However, note: if we stamp a cell multiple times, we can change it. \n\n          But note: the stamp always sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. Therefore, in the entire segment, we cannot have a monochromatic segment? \n\n          Actually, the known solution is: \n            for each contiguous segment of non-white:\n                if the segment is of length 1 -> invalid.\n                if the segment has only R's or only B's -> invalid.\n\n          Why? \n          Because the stamp always produces at least one R and one B in the two cells. \n          Then, if we have a segment that is entirely R, then we must have had a B at some point that was turned into R by a later stamp? \n          But when we stamp over a pair that includes a B, we set that B to either R or B? Actually, we set both cells at the same time. \n\n          However, consider: \n            We have a segment of two cells: \"RR\" -> is that possible? \n            We start with WW. \n            We stamp once: we get either RB or BR. \n            Then we stamp again on the same two cells: \n                If we stamp with the same pattern, we get the same? \n                But if we stamp with the opposite pattern? \n            Actually, the stamp can be rotated arbitrarily. So we can choose either pattern each time. \n            But if we stamp twice on the same two cells: \n                First: RB\n                Second: if we use the same pattern (RB) then we set RB again -> same as first.\n                If we use the opposite pattern (BR) then we set BR -> which is the same as RB? \n            Actually, no: the pattern is fixed: \n                The stamp has two forms: \n                  Form1: left becomes R, right becomes B -> RB\n                  Form2: left becomes B, right becomes R -> BR\n            So if we stamp twice on the same two cells, we can choose the pattern arbitrarily each time. \n            But note: if we choose the same pattern twice, we get the same result. \n            If we choose different patterns, then:\n                First: RB -> then second: BR: so we get BR? \n            So we cannot get RR? \n\n          Therefore, we cannot have two adjacent cells both R? \n\n          But wait: what if we stamp overlapping? \n          Example for three cells: \n            We want \"RRB\"\n            Step1: stamp on [0,1]: set to RB -> state: R, B, W\n            Step2: stamp on [1,2]: set to BR -> then cell1 becomes R (because we set the pair (1,2) to BR: so cell1 (which was B) becomes R? and cell2 becomes B? \n            Then we have: R, R, B -> which is \"RRB\"\n\n          So we can have two R's together. \n\n          However, note that in the entire segment of three cells, we have two R's and one B. \n\n          The invariant: \n            In any contiguous segment (without white), the entire segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n          Why? \n          Because the stamp always introduces one R and one B. And if we cover a cell multiple times, the last stamp that covers it sets its color. But note: we can choose the pattern arbitrarily each time. \n\n          However, consider a segment that is all R's: \n            We must have an even number of cells? \n            But we saw that two cells cannot be both R? \n\n          Actually, we can form a segment of two R's? \n            Step1: stamp on the two: set to RB -> then we have R and B.\n            Step2: stamp again on the same two: set to BR -> then we have B and R -> not two R's.\n            Step3: stamp again: set to RB -> then we have R and B.\n\n          So we cannot get two R's? \n\n          But wait: what if we use overlapping? \n          For two cells, we cannot use overlapping because there is no third cell. \n\n          Therefore, for a segment of two cells, the only possibilities are RB and BR. \n\n          For a segment of three cells: \n            We can get \"RRB\", \"RBB\", \"BRR\", \"BBR\", etc. but note: we cannot get \"RRR\" because:\n              We start: WWW\n              Step1: stamp on [0,1]: set to RB -> R, B, W\n              Step2: stamp on [0,1] again: set to BR -> B, R, W -> then we have B, R, W -> not RRR.\n              Step3: stamp on [1,2]: set to RB -> then we have B, R, B -> not RRR.\n\n          How to get RRR? \n          We would need to have three R's. \n          But note: each stamp operation sets one R and one B. So the total number of R's and B's in the entire segment must be equal? \n          However, because of overlapping, the counts are not additive. \n\n          Actually, the entire segment must have the property that the number of R's and B's are not independent? \n\n          Known solution from Codeforces (from accepted solutions) is:\n            Split the string by 'W'\n            For each segment:\n                if the segment is empty: skip.\n                if the segment has length 1: return \"NO\"\n                if the segment has only one color (either all R or all B): return \"NO\"\n\n          Why is that? \n          Because if a segment has both R and B, then we can form it? \n          And if it has only one color, then we cannot? \n\n          Let's test with the examples:\n            Example 1: \"RR\" -> only R -> invalid -> output NO -> but the problem says for the second, third, and fourth test cases: \n                The second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> answer NO.\n                The third test case: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> answer NO.\n                The fourth test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> answer YES? but wait, the problem says the second, third, and fourth are NO? \n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          The test cases are:\n            Input: \n                7\n                5\n                BRBBW\n                1\n                B\n                2\n                WB\n                2\n                RW\n                3\n                BRB\n                3\n                RBB\n                7\n                WWWWWWW\n\n          So:\n            second test case: n=1 -> string \"B\" -> invalid because we cannot stamp a single cell -> so we output NO.\n            third test case: n=2, string \"WB\" -> meaning [W, B] -> the non-white segment is \"B\" (length=1) -> invalid -> NO.\n            fourth test case: n=2, string \"RW\" -> non-white segment is \"R\" (length=1) -> invalid -> NO.\n\n          The fifth: n=3, \"BRB\" -> valid? \n            Split by 'W': we get [\"BRB\"] -> segment \"BRB\": \n                length=3 -> valid? \n                It has both R and B -> valid -> YES.\n\n          The sixth: n=3, \"RBB\" -> valid? \n            Split: [\"RBB\"] -> has both R and B -> YES.\n\n          The seventh: all white -> split: we get multiple empty segments? -> valid.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n            s = the string (without the newline)\n            segments = s.split('W')\n            for seg in segments:\n                if seg == '': continue\n                if len(seg) == 1: \n                    return \"NO\"\n                if seg contains only 'R' or only 'B': \n                    return \"NO\"\n            If we pass all segments, return \"YES\"\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so we can do this.\n\n          But note: the program1.py and program2.py are identical? Actually, the problem says we have two programs that are missing code and we must fill in the missing code for both.\n\n          The given code for both programs is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          The variable 'b' is initially 0. Then we do something in the loop. Then we print: \n            If b is 0, then we print 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> which is 'YES'? \n            Actually: \n                'YNEOS ' is a string: \n                b=0: [0::2] -> starts at index0 and step2: 'Y'\n                b=1: [1::2] -> starts at index1: 'N'\n                b=2: [2::2] -> 'E' -> but we don't want that.\n\n          Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' (with a space at the end) -> \n            indices: \n                0: 'Y'\n                1: 'N'\n                2: 'E'\n                3: 'O'\n                4: 'S'\n                5: ' '\n\n          Then [b::2] for b=0: [0::2] -> Y, E, S -> \"YES\"?\n          But wait: \n            s = 'YNEOS '\n            s[0::2] = 'YES ' -> but we don't want the space.\n\n          Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' (6 characters) -> \n            s[0::2] = 'Y' (index0), then index2 -> 'E', then index4 -> 'S' -> \"YES\"\n\n          And for b=1: \n            s[1::2] = s[1], s[3], s[5] -> 'N','O',' ' -> \"NO \"? \n\n          But note: the problem says we can output in any case, but the example says \"YES\" and \"NO\". \n\n          However, the code uses: \n            print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          We want: \n            if the picture is possible: print \"YES\" -> which is when b=0? \n            if not: print \"NO\" -> when b=1? \n\n          But the problem: \n            We are iterating over segments. We want to set b=1 if we find any segment that is invalid.\n\n          So the plan for the loop:\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': continue\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b = 1   # invalid, so we break and output NO?\n                    break\n                # Check if the segment has both R and B?\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n            But wait: what if there are multiple segments? We must check all? \n            Actually, if one segment is invalid, the entire picture is invalid.\n\n          However, note: we can break early? \n\n          But the problem: the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, and we are splitting by 'W'. The segments are non-overlapping. We can break as soon as we find one invalid segment.\n\n          But what if we don't break? Then we might set b=1 for the first invalid, then later we might set b=0 again? \n\n          So we should break or set a flag and then break.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            b = 0\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is equivalent to: the segment is entirely one color? \n\n          However, if the segment has at least one R and at least one B, then we skip. Otherwise, we set b=1.\n\n          But note: if the segment is of length>=2 and has both colors, we are good.\n\n          However, what if the segment is of length>=2 and has both colors? Then we do nothing? \n\n          But what if we have multiple segments? We must check all segments. We break only when we find an invalid one. \n\n          But if we break, then we skip the rest? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, note: if the segment is of length 1, we break. \n          If the segment is of length>=2 but has only one color, we break.\n\n          But what if we have a segment that is of length>=2 and has both colors? Then we don't set b to 1 and we continue to the next segment.\n\n          Then, after the loop, if we never set b=1, then we leave b=0 and print \"YES\".\n\n          However, what if we have two segments: the first is valid, the second is invalid? Then we break at the second and set b=1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: the condition \"if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i\" is equivalent to: \n            if the segment does not contain 'R' OR the segment does not contain 'B' -> then invalid.\n\n          This is the same as: the segment is entirely one color? \n\n          Example: \n            i = \"RR\" -> then 'B' not in i -> condition true -> invalid.\n            i = \"BB\" -> then 'R' not in i -> condition true -> invalid.\n            i = \"RB\" -> has 'R' and has 'B' -> condition false -> valid.\n\n          But what about \"RBRB\"? -> has both -> valid.\n\n          However, note: the condition is: \n            if ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i): \n          This is true if either one is missing. \n\n          So we are good.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is empty? We skip.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for both program1.py and program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, note: the condition can be written as:\n            if len(i)==1 or (set(i) != {'R','B'})? \n          But wait: the segment might be \"RRB\", then set(i) is {'R','B'} -> that's okay. \n          But the condition we have: \n            if the segment has at least one R and at least one B -> then we don't enter. \n          But if the segment is \"RRB\", then 'R' is in i and 'B' is in i -> so we don't set b=1.\n\n          But the condition for setting b=1 is: \n            if (len(i)==1) OR (('R' not in i) OR ('B' not in i))\n\n          This is equivalent to: \n            if (len(i)==1) OR (the segment does not have both R and B)\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n\n          However, note: if the segment is of length 1, then it automatically doesn't have both? But we don't care: we break because of the length.\n\n          But what if the segment is of length 1 and has both? -> impossible because it has only one character.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n          But that is the same as:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or not (has both) -> which is the same as the condition above.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or set(i)=={'R'} or set(i)=={'B'}:\n\n          But that might be less efficient.\n\n          Since the total length is 10^5, and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, we can do the 'in' check. The worst-case segment might be long, but the total length of all segments is <= 10^5.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for both programs is:\n\n            if i != '' and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: we already skip if i==''. So we can do:\n\n            if i:   # non-empty\n                if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, the condition: \n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ... \n\n          But note: the condition 'if i' is true for non-empty string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n          But wait: the condition \"if i\" is redundant because we skip empty? Actually, we don't skip: we have \"if i=='': continue\", so we skip the empty ones. Then we only get non-empty i. So we can do:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          However, note: if the segment is non-empty and of length>=2, but if it doesn't have both R and B, then we break.\n\n          But what if the segment is of length>=2 and has both? Then we do nothing and continue.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for both program1.py and program2.py is:\n\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition is evaluated as: \n            if (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\n          This is true if any of the three is true.\n\n          However, if the segment is of length 1, we break. \n          If the segment is of length>=2 but missing R (so it's all B) -> then we break.\n          If the segment is of length>=2 but missing B (so it's all R) -> then we break.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is of length 1? Then we break. \n          What if the segment is of length>=2 and has both? Then we do nothing.\n\n          So we write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, note: the condition 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i' is true if at least one of them is missing. \n\n          This is exactly what we want.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for both programs is the same.\n\n          We output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"if i == '': continue\\n        if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b = 1\\n            break\", \n             \"program2\": \"if i == '': continue\\n        if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n            b = 1\\n            break\"}\n\n          But note: the code must be exactly the missing part. The existing code has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with 4 lines.\n\n          However, we can write it in one line? But the problem does not require one line.\n\n          But note: the existing code has an indentation of 4 spaces per level.\n\n          We write:\n\n            if i == '': \n                continue\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But the existing code already has the for-loop and the variable i. \n\n          Alternatively, we can write without the continue? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: if i is empty, we skip the condition. \n\n          However, the condition \"if i\" is true for non-empty. Then:\n\n            if non-empty and (invalid) -> then break.\n\n          So:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          But wait: what if we have an empty string? Then we skip. \n\n          This is equivalent.\n\n          And it's two lines.\n\n          But note: the condition: \n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n          However, the condition is evaluated as: \n            if (i is non-empty) and (either the length is 1 or the segment is missing R or missing B)\n\n          This is what we want.\n\n          But note: the condition \"or\" has lower precedence than \"and\", so we need parentheses? \n\n          Actually, without parentheses:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n\n          That would be: \n            (i and (len(i)==1)) or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\n          That is not what we want.\n\n          So we must use parentheses.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But wait: the condition inside the parentheses: \n            (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n          This is true if at least one of the three is true. But if i is non-empty, then we check the condition. \n\n          However, if i is empty, we skip.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is the same as \"if i != ''\", so we can avoid the continue.\n\n          So the code becomes:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          This is two lines.\n\n          But we can write it as one line? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if i != '' and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          This is also two lines.\n\n          We'll choose the two-line version without the continue.\n\n          However, note: the existing code has the for-loop and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is redundant? Because the split by 'W' might produce empty strings, but we want to skip them. \n\n          This condition skips the empty string.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: what if the segment is non-empty and valid? Then we do nothing and continue.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, there is a catch: what if we have a segment that is non-empty and invalid, but we break and set b=1. Then we break the loop and skip the remaining segments? \n\n          This is acceptable because we only need to know if there is at least one invalid segment.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for both programs is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary to skip the empty strings? Actually, the split might produce empty strings. We want to skip them. \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the condition by using:\n\n            segments = s[:-1].split(\"W\")\n            and then the for-loop will iterate over empty strings. We want to skip the empty ones? \n\n          But our condition: \n            if i and ... \n\n          This will skip the empty string because empty string is falsy.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          However, note: the condition \"if i\" is the same as \"if i != ''\", and it's efficient.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\", \n             \"program2\": \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"}\n\n          But note: the existing code has an indentation level of 4 for the for-loop body. We are adding two more levels? \n\n          Actually, the existing code:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          The indentation: \n            The for-loop body is indented by 4. Then the if statement should be indented by 4 (relative to the for) and the break by 8? \n\n          But the existing code uses spaces. We are writing:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces (from the for) then the if condition (with 4 more? no, we are at the same level as the for's body)\n\n          Actually, the code we are inserting is at the same indentation level as the for-loop body. \n\n          The existing code has:\n\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO\n\n          So the for-loop body is already indented by 8 (relative to the outer for). \n\n          We are going to write:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n          The if is at the same level as the for (so 8 spaces from the outer for, but 12 from the beginning?).\n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the existing.\n\n          However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n          We'll write:\n\n            The first line: 8 spaces (from the outer for) then the if condition -> that is 8 spaces from the outer for, which is 4 spaces from the inner for? \n\n          Actually, the outer for is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          The inner for-loop body is currently:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          The indentation: \n            The inner for-loop body is indented by 12 spaces (because the outer for is 4, then the inner for is 8, then the body is 12). \n\n          But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? It just requires the code to run.\n\n          We can write:\n\n            program1: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n            program2: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n          But note: the existing code has 4 spaces for the inner for-loop body? \n\n          Actually, the code we are given:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The inner for-loop body (the TODO) is at the same indentation as the outer for-loop body? \n\n          The outer for-loop body has:\n                b = 0\n                for ...:\n\n          So the inner for-loop is at 8 spaces (if the outer body is 4). Then the inner for-loop body should be 12? \n\n          But the TODO is written at 12? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify. We can use 4 spaces for the inner body? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that goes in the TODO, and we must use the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n          The surrounding code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n          We see: \n                for s in ...:\n                b = 0\n                for i in ...:\n\n          The line \"b=0\" is at 4 spaces. The inner for is at 4 spaces? Actually, no: \n\n          The outer for: \n            for s in ...: \n                b = 0   -> 4 spaces\n                for i in ...:   -> 4 spaces? \n\n          Then the body of the inner for should be 8 spaces? \n\n          But the TODO is written at 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the given code:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for) -> that is 4 more than the inner for.\n\n          So we should write:\n\n            for i in ...:\n                if ...:   # at 8 spaces\n                    b = 1   # at 12 spaces\n                    break   # at 12 spaces\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n            program2: \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n          This means:\n            Line1: 8 spaces (4 from the outer for, then 4 more for the inner for body) for the if condition.\n            Line2: 12 spaces for the assignment and break.\n\n          But note: the existing code has the TODO at 8 spaces? \n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          The first line: 8 spaces, then the if condition.\n          The next two lines: 12 spaces.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, we can also write without the parentheses? \n\n          But the condition without parentheses is:\n\n            if i and len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n\n          That is wrong.\n\n          So we keep the parentheses.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer.\n\n          But note: the condition can be optimized by checking the set? But the problem constraints are acceptable.\n\n          We'll output the code as described.\n\n          However, note: the condition \"if i\" is necessary to skip empty strings. \n\n          But what if the segment is non-empty? Then we check the condition. \n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for both programs is:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          We output in the JSON:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\", \n             \"program2\": \"    if i and (len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"}\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the block that replaces the TODO.\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with three lines: \n            Line1: if ... \n            Line2: b = 1\n            Line3: break\n\n          And we use the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n          We are done."
