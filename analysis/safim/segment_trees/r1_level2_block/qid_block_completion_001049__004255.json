The dmx is for the zero case: when we have the same prefix, then we can do dp[i] = dmx[pref[i]] (if we extend from a previous j with the same prefix). But then we update dmx[pref[i]] to be the maximum of the existing value and dp[i]. So the TODO is: if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the code currently does not have that. So that is the missing line. Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the TODO is inside the if block. So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i] But we must be cautious: the variable is `pref[i]` (the prefix at index i).

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code in a JSON object with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values. The value of a subarray is the length of the subarray if the sum is positive, negative of the length if the sum is negative, and 0 if the sum is zero.\n\nWe are provided with a code that uses a Fenwick tree (or segment tree) and coordinate compression for the prefix sums. The main idea is to use dynamic programming.\n\nThe provided code does:\n- Reads multiple test cases.\n- For each test case, reads n and an array `da`.\n- Computes the prefix sum array `pref` (0-indexed, with `pref[0]=0` and `pref[i]` for i from 1 to n).\n- Then it creates two sorted lists: \n   `spos`: sorted by `pref[i]` and then by `-i` (so that for the same prefix, larger indices come first? Actually, note: when we do `(pref[i], -i)`, then for the same `pref[i]`, we want the largest index to be first? Actually, in sorted order, if we have the same `pref[i]`, then `-i` will be sorted in increasing order of `i`? Actually, no: if i1 < i2, then -i1 > -i2. So when we sort, for the same `pref[i]`, the one with larger i will have a more negative `-i`? Actually, no: because if i is larger, then `-i` is more negative. So in sorted order by `(pref[i], -i)`, for the same `pref[i]`, the indices are sorted in descending order? Actually, no: the tuple is compared lexicographically. So if `pref[i]` is the same, then we compare `-i`. Since `-i` is negative and we are sorting in increasing order, the one with a larger `i` (which becomes more negative) will come later? \n\nBut then we assign:\n   `ordpos[-spos[i][-1]] = i` \nNote: `spos[i]` is a tuple `(pref_value, -index)`. So `spos[i][-1]` is `-index`. Then `-spos[i][-1]` is `index`. So `ordpos[index] = i` (the rank in the sorted list `spos`).\n\nSimilarly, for `sneg` we have `(pref[i], i)` and then `ordneg[sneg[i][-1]] = i` -> `sneg[i][-1]` is `i` (the index) and then `ordneg[i] = i` (the rank in `sneg`).\n\nThen we have:\n   dp[0] = 0 (implicitly, because we set `dmx[0]=0` and then for i from 1 to n)\n   For each i from 1 to n:\n        dp[i] = max( \n            i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), \n            nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, \n            dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) \n        )\n\nThen we update the Fenwick trees and `dmx`.\n\nThe idea is that we consider three cases for the last segment ending at i:\n\n1. The segment from j+1 to i has positive sum: then the value is (i - j). Then we have:\n      dp[i] = dp[j] + (i - j)   => dp[i] = dp[j] - j + i\n   So we want to maximize (dp[j] - j) for j such that the segment (j+1, i) has positive sum. The condition for positive sum is: pref[i] - pref[j] > 0  => pref[i] > pref[j].\n\n2. The segment has negative sum: then the value is -(i - j) => dp[i] = dp[j] - (i - j) = dp[j] + j - i.\n   Condition: pref[i] < pref[j].\n\n3. The segment has zero sum: then the value is 0 => dp[i] = dp[j]. Condition: pref[i] == pref[j].\n\nThe Fenwick trees are used to handle the first two cases (with coordinate compression). The third case is handled by `dmx` (a dictionary that maps a prefix sum to the maximum dp value for that prefix).\n\nBut note: the condition for positive sum is pref[i] > pref[j]. In the Fenwick tree for positive (pfen) we are storing for indices j (with j from 0 to i-1) the value (dp[j] - j) at the position corresponding to the rank of (pref[j], -j) in `spos`. However, when we query `pfen` for `ordpos[i]`, we are actually querying for all indices j that have a rank less than the rank of i? \n\nBut note: the sorted list `spos` is sorted by (pref[j], -j). We want to consider j such that pref[j] < pref[i] OR (pref[j] == pref[i] and j < i? Actually, the condition for positive is strictly greater? Actually, positive: pref[i] > pref[j]. So we want j such that pref[j] < pref[i]. But note: in `spos` we have sorted by pref[j] increasing. So the rank of j in `spos` is the position of (pref[j], -j). For a given i, we want to consider all j with pref[j] < pref[i]. But note: if there are multiple j with the same pref[j], then we have to be careful: we want the entire set of j with pref[j] < pref[i]. \n\nHowever, the Fenwick tree `pfen` is built on the ranks of `spos`. The query `pfen.max(ordpos[i])` is for the range [0, ordpos[i]-1]? Actually, the Fenwick tree is 1-indexed? The Fenwick tree implementation:\n\n    def max(self, x):\n        res = -INF\n        while x>0:\n            res = max(res, self._da[x])\n            x = (x&(x+1))-1\n        return res\n\nThis is a Fenwick tree for maximum that supports point updates and prefix maximum. The update is:\n\n    def modify(self, p, x):\n        while p < self._mx:\n            self._da[p] = max(self._da[p], x)\n            p |= p+1\n\nBut note: the Fenwick tree for maximum is not standard. Actually, the update is: we set `p` to the next power of two? Actually, the update is: while p < self._mx, we update `self._da[p]` and then set `p = p | (p+1)`. This is a known structure for a Fenwick tree for maximum? Actually, it's more common for sums. For maximum, we usually use a segment tree. But the problem constraints are 500000, so a Fenwick tree for maximum might be acceptable if we do coordinate compression.\n\nBut the issue: the Fenwick tree `pfen` is built for the entire array of n+1 elements? And we are updating at `ordpos[i]` (which is the rank of the prefix at index i) with the value `dp[i]-i`.\n\nSimilarly, for the negative case: we have a Fenwick tree `nfen` that we update at `n+1 - ordneg[i]` (so that we can do a prefix query for the negative condition: we want j such that pref[j] > pref[i]. How do we get that? \n\nThe sorted list `sneg` is sorted by (pref[i], i). So the rank of j in `sneg` is the position of (pref[j], j). We want j with pref[j] > pref[i]. This is equivalent to the complement of the prefix in the sorted order? Actually, we can do: if we reverse the order, then we can use a Fenwick tree for the suffix. The code does:\n\n   nfen.modify(n+1 - ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n\nand then for query:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])\n\nBut note: the query in `nfen` for `n+1 - ordneg[i]` will give the maximum for indices from 1 to `n+1 - ordneg[i]`? But we want j such that pref[j] > pref[i]. In the sorted list `sneg` (which is increasing), the indices j with pref[j] > pref[i] have a rank (in `sneg`) greater than the rank of i. So if we reverse the order (by using `n+1 - rank`), then the condition becomes: we want the ranks in the reversed array to be less than `n+1 - (rank_of_i+1)`. Actually, the code does:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])\n\nThis will query the prefix of the reversed array up to the position `n+1 - ordneg[i]`. But note: the reversed array has the largest original rank (which is n) at position 1 and the smallest at position n+1? Actually, we are doing:\n\n   nfen.modify(n+1 - ordneg[i], value)\n\nand then querying for `n+1 - ordneg[i]`? That doesn't seem to cover the entire suffix? \n\nAlternatively, we can note: if we set the position for j in `nfen` at `n+1 - ordneg[j]`, then the condition for j with a higher rank (in `sneg`) will have a lower value in `n+1 - ordneg[j]` (because ordneg[j] is larger). So to get all j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i] (which corresponds to pref[j] > pref[i] or (pref[j]==pref[i] and j>i? because `sneg` is sorted by pref then by j increasing)), we would need to query the range [1, n+1 - (ordneg[i]+1)]? But the Fenwick tree only supports prefix queries. \n\nActually, the code does:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])\n\nThis will get the maximum for positions from 1 to `n+1 - ordneg[i]` in the Fenwick tree. But note: the positions we have stored for j are at `n+1 - ordneg[j]`. For j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i], we have `n+1 - ordneg[j]` < `n+1 - ordneg[i]`. So the query `nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])` will include all j with `n+1 - ordneg[j]` <= `n+1 - ordneg[i]`, which corresponds to ordneg[j] >= ordneg[i]. But we want j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]. \n\nSo we should be querying for `n+1 - (ordneg[i]+1)`? \n\nBut the code does:\n\n   dp[i] = max( ... , nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, ... )\n\nThis is not correct for the negative case? \n\nAlternatively, we can adjust the coordinate compression for the negative case to put the higher ranks (in `sneg`) at lower positions in the Fenwick tree. Then a prefix query for a position k would get the maximum for all j with rank in `sneg` greater than or equal to the threshold? \n\nBut the current setup does:\n\n   We assign for index j: position = n+1 - ordneg[j]\n\nThen the Fenwick tree for `nfen` is built on positions from 1 to n+1.\n\nWe want to get the maximum for j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]. That is, we want j that appear after i in the sorted `sneg` (because `sneg` is sorted by pref increasing, then by j increasing). Then the position for j in `nfen` is n+1 - ordneg[j]. Since ordneg[j] > ordneg[i], then n+1 - ordneg[j] < n+1 - ordneg[i]. So we want to query the prefix [1, n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1]? \n\nBut the Fenwick tree `nfen` only supports prefix queries. The function `nfen.max(x)` returns the maximum in the prefix [1, x]. So to get the maximum for positions < n+1 - ordneg[i] (which corresponds to j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]), we should query the prefix [1, n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1]. However, the code does:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])\n\nThis includes the position n+1 - ordneg[i] (which corresponds to j with ordneg[j] = ordneg[i]). We don't want that because the condition is strict: pref[j] > pref[i] (so we don't want equality). Also, even if we get equality, we have to be careful: in the negative case, the condition is pref[j] > pref[i]. \n\nBut note: in the sorted list `sneg`, if two indices have the same pref, then they are sorted by j (increasing). So if we have j0 and j1 with the same pref, then they have the same value? Actually, no: the tuple is (pref, j). So if pref[j0] = pref[j1] and j0 < j1, then in `sneg` j0 comes before j1. Then ordneg[j0] < ordneg[j1]. \n\nBut for the negative case, we require pref[j] > pref[i]. So we don't include j with pref[j] == pref[i]. \n\nTherefore, we should be querying for the prefix [1, n+1 - (ordneg[i]+1)]? \n\nBut the code does:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])\n\nThis is including the position n+1 - ordneg[i] (which is the position for i). We don't want that. Also, we haven't updated the Fenwick tree for i at this point (we update after computing dp[i]). So the Fenwick tree at the time of querying for i does not include i. But it includes j from 0 to i-1.\n\nSo the problem: the query for the negative case is including j with ordneg[j] >= ordneg[i]? We want only j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]. \n\nWe can fix by querying for n+1 - (ordneg[i]+1). But the code currently does not do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can adjust the coordinate compression for the negative case so that we assign a rank that is the total number of elements with pref less than or equal to pref[i] (and then subtract to get the ones strictly greater). \n\nBut note: the problem constraints are high (500000) and the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can use a Fenwick tree that supports range queries? Actually, the Fenwick tree we have only supports prefix maximum. \n\nAlternatively, we can change the way we assign the positions for the negative case: we want to assign a position that is the rank in the sorted list of `sneg` but then we want to invert the order so that higher pref becomes lower index. We can do:\n\n   position = n - ordneg[i]   (if we use 0-indexed ranks) but then we have to adjust the Fenwick tree.\n\nBut the current code uses:\n\n   ordneg[i] = the rank of i in `sneg` (which is from 0 to n, because there are n+1 elements? Actually, the list `sneg` has n+1 elements. So the ranks are from 0 to n? Then the Fenwick tree has size n+2.\n\nWe are doing:\n\n   nfen.modify(n+1 - ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n\nand then querying:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])\n\nBut to exclude the current rank, we note that we haven't updated i yet. So the Fenwick tree does not contain i. But we want to exclude j with the same pref? Actually, the condition is strict: pref[j] > pref[i]. So we want j that have a rank in `sneg` greater than the rank of i. \n\nSo the position for j that we want are those with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]. Then the position in the Fenwick tree for j is n+1 - ordneg[j]. Since ordneg[j] > ordneg[i], then n+1 - ordneg[j] < n+1 - ordneg[i]. So we want to query the prefix [1, n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1]. \n\nBut the Fenwick tree function `max` does a prefix query [1, x] (if we interpret the Fenwick tree as 1-indexed). So we should call:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1)\n\nBut note: the Fenwick tree indices must be positive. Since `n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1` might be 0? Then we skip.\n\nAlternatively, we can adjust the Fenwick tree to be 1-indexed and then we do:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1)\n\nBut the current Fenwick tree implementation for `max` uses:\n\n   while x>0: ... and then x = (x&(x+1))-1\n\nThis is a bit unusual. Actually, it's a Fenwick tree for maximum that uses a trick for the next index? \n\nAlternatively, we can change the coordinate compression for the negative case: we assign the position as the rank in the sorted list of `sneg` but in descending order. Then the condition pref[j] > pref[i] becomes a lower rank in the descending order. Then we can do a prefix query for the rank of i (in the descending order) minus one? \n\nBut the code is already written. And the problem says: the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can use a segment tree? But the provided code uses Fenwick trees.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the current query for the negative case is not correct. We should change the query to:\n\n   nfen.max(n - ordneg[i])   # if we use 0-indexed ranks? \n\nBut the code uses 0-indexed ranks? The list `sneg` is sorted and then we assign:\n\n   for i in range(n+1):\n        ordneg[sneg[i][1]] = i   # because sneg[i] is (pref, index) and we assign ordneg[index] = i.\n\nSo the rank `ordneg[i]` is from 0 to n (inclusive). Then the position in `nfen` is `n+1 - ordneg[i]` (so that the smallest rank in `sneg` (0) becomes n+1, and the largest (n) becomes 1). \n\nThen to get j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i] (i.e., rank in `sneg` greater than `ordneg[i]`), we need positions in `nfen` that are less than `n+1 - ordneg[i]`. So we want to query the prefix [1, n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1]. \n\nBut the Fenwick tree `nfen` has:\n\n   nfen.max(x) returns the maximum in the range [1, x] (if we consider 1-indexed).\n\nSo we should do:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1)\n\nBut note: if `n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1` is 0, then we skip. \n\nBut the Fenwick tree `nfen` is built with indices from 1 to n+2? The size is n+2. So we can do:\n\n   pos = n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1\n   if pos > 0:\n        candidate = nfen.max(pos) - i\n   else:\n        candidate = -INF\n\nBut the code currently does:\n\n   nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])\n\nSo we must change that.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can do a segment tree? But the provided code uses Fenwick trees and we are only allowed to fill in the missing parts.\n\nLooking at the provided code, there is a TODO in the loop for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut actually, the TODO is in the middle of the dp recurrence. The code has:\n\n        dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n\nBut we suspect the negative part is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the negative Fenwick tree to store the values in the natural order of `sneg` and then do a suffix maximum? But the Fenwick tree we have only does prefix maximum.\n\nBut note: the provided Fenwick tree for maximum is not standard. The update is:\n\n   p |= p+1\n\nThis is for a Fenwick tree that supports point updates and prefix maximum? Actually, the standard Fenwick tree for maximum is not as straightforward as for sums. \n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that the problem is known to be solved with a segment tree or Fenwick tree for maximum, and the provided code already has the structure, we must assume that the original author intended:\n\n   For the positive case: we query for all j with rank < ordpos[i] in `spos` (which corresponds to pref[j] < pref[i] OR (pref[j] == pref[i] and j>i? because in `spos` we have (pref[j], -j) and for the same pref, j with larger j has a more negative -j, so comes later in the sorted list). But note: we want j with pref[j] < pref[i]. The condition in `spos` is: if pref[j] < pref[i], then it comes before. If pref[j] == pref[i], then we have to be careful: we don't want to include j with pref[j]==pref[i] in the positive case (because the condition is strict). But in `spos`, the tuple for j with pref[j]==pref[i] and j>i will have a more negative -j, so they come after the tuple for i? \n\nActually, for i, we have (pref[i], -i). For j with the same pref and j>i, we have (pref[i], -j) and -j < -i (because j>i) so (pref[i], -j) is less than (pref[i], -i) in the tuple comparison? Then in `spos`, j with the same pref and j>i will come after i. So when we query the prefix up to the rank of i, we get j with pref[j] < pref[i] and also j with pref[j]==pref[i] and j<i? \n\nBut we don't want j with pref[j]==pref[i] in the positive case. So the positive case query includes j with pref[j] < pref[i] and also j with pref[j]==pref[i] and j<i? That is not desired.\n\nSo the positive case should also be adjusted: we want only j with pref[j] < pref[i]. So we should query the prefix up to the first occurrence of pref[i] (i.e., the rank of the first tuple with pref[j] = pref[i] and j as large as possible? Actually, we want to exclude all j with pref[j] >= pref[i]). \n\nTherefore, both Fenwick tree queries are flawed.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   For the positive case: we want j with pref[j] < pref[i]. We can do a coordinate compression of the prefix sums and then use the rank of pref[i]-1? But we don't have the exact value. We can use the rank of the largest prefix that is < pref[i]. \n\nBut the provided code does not do that.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that the problem is known and there are known solutions, we can look for a known solution for \"partition array to maximize sum of values\" with the given conditions.\n\nKnown solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) uses:\n\n   dp[i] = max( dp[i-1] + sign(a[i]) , max_{j} { dp[j] + (i-j) } for j with prefix[i]-prefix[j]>0, ... )\n\nBut the known solution uses a segment tree or Fenwick tree for the three cases.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree that stores the maximum value of dp[j]-j for a given prefix value, and then query for all prefix values less than pref[i]. Similarly for greater.\n\nBut the provided code already has a Fenwick tree for the ranks.\n\nAfter reevaluating, I see that the known solution for this problem (e.g., from Codeforces Round #700) is to use a segment tree with coordinate compression. The provided code is on the right track.\n\nBut the TODO in the provided code is actually in the initialization of the Fenwick trees? Or in the dp recurrence? \n\nLooking at the provided code, there is no TODO in the dp recurrence. The TODO is in the comments at the top? Actually, no, the TODO is in the code:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut in the provided program1.py, the TODO is inside the loop for i in range(1, n+1) but after the assignment of dp[i]? Actually, no, the TODO is in the middle of the dp recurrence? \n\nWait, the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n        dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n        pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n        nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is in the update of dmx.\n\nThe dmx is for the zero case: when we have the same prefix, then we can do dp[i] = dmx[pref[i]] (if we extend from a previous j with the same prefix). But then we update dmx[pref[i]] to be the maximum of the existing value and dp[i]. \n\nSo the TODO is:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the code currently does not have that. So that is the missing line.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the TODO is inside the if block.\n\nSo the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut we must be cautious: the variable is `pref[i]` (the prefix at index i).\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is about transforming a 2xn binary matrix into another with minimal swaps (adjacent swaps). The provided code has:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   a, b, x, y = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n   s0 = s1 = ans = 0\n   for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n        s0 += m\n        s0 -= p\n        s1 += n\n        s1 -= q\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n        ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n   print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)\n\nThe idea is to consider the difference in the number of 1's in the two rows. But note: the matrix has two rows. The current arrangement is given by `a` (first row) and `b` (second row). The desired arrangement is `x` (first row) and `y` (second row).\n\nThe variables:\n   s0: the net difference in the first row? (current - desired) for the entire matrix? Actually, in the loop we are iterating column by column.\n\nFor each column, we have:\n   m: current first row\n   n: current second row (but note: the variable n is already used for the number of columns, so this is bad)\n   p: desired first row\n   q: desired second row\n\nThen we do:\n   s0 += m - p\n   s1 += n - q   (but n is the current second row element, and we are using n for the number of columns)\n\nThis is a problem: the variable n is the number of columns, and then we use n for the second row element. This will cause the variable n to be overwritten.\n\nBut the code has:\n\n   for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\nThis is iterating over:\n   m from a, n from b, p from x, q from y.\n\nBut then we have:\n\n   s0 += m\n   s0 -= p\n   s1 += n   # but n is the element from b (the current second row) and then we subtract q? \n   s1 -= q\n\nSo s0 is the cumulative difference in the first row (current - desired) and s1 is the cumulative difference in the second row (current - desired).\n\nThe goal is to have both s0 and s1 become 0 at the end.\n\nThe operations: we can swap adjacent cells. How does a swap affect s0 and s1?\n\nConsider swapping two adjacent cells in the same row: \n   (i, j) and (i, j+1): \n      This doesn't change the total number of ones in the first row or the second row? So it doesn't change s0 or s1? \n\nBut wait: the problem allows swapping any two neighboring cells. This includes vertical swaps (between the two rows in the same column) and horizontal swaps (within the same row in adjacent columns).\n\nVertical swap: between (1,j) and (2,j). This swap will:\n   If we swap a and b (at column j), then:\n        a_j, b_j becomes b_j, a_j.\n        Then the first row: we lose a_j and gain b_j -> change: b_j - a_j.\n        The second row: we lose b_j and gain a_j -> change: a_j - b_j.\n\n        So net: \n            s0 becomes s0 + (b_j - a_j) - (a_j - b_j)? Actually, we are tracking the cumulative difference (current - desired). \n\n        Actually, we are in the middle of processing columns. But note: the vertical swap at column j will affect the cumulative difference at column j and beyond? \n\n        However, the approach in the code is to process column by column and try to fix the cumulative difference.\n\n        The known solution for this problem is to note that the total number of ones in the entire matrix must be the same. And then we can use a greedy approach: \n\n        Let d0[i] = a[i] - x[i]   (difference in the first row at column i)\n        Let d1[i] = b[i] - y[i]   (difference in the second row at column i)\n\n        Then we have two accumulators s0 and s1 (for the first and second row) that start at 0.\n\n        Then we iterate i from 0 to n-1:\n            s0 += d0[i]\n            s1 += d1[i]\n\n            Now, we can use vertical swaps in the same column to transfer between the rows? But note: a vertical swap at column i will:\n                s0 becomes s0 - 1 (if we move a 1 from row0 to row1) and s1 becomes s1+1? Actually, if we swap, then we are effectively moving a unit from row0 to row1. \n\n            But the differences are in counts. We can use vertical swaps to adjust s0 and s1 as long as the total s0+s1 remains the same? \n\n            Actually, a vertical swap at column i will change:\n                s0 = s0 - 1, s1 = s1 + 1   (if we move a 1 from row0 to row1) \n                or the reverse.\n\n            Then we have two while loops:\n\n            while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                we can do a vertical swap at the current column? But note: we are processing column by column. We can do a vertical swap at any column? Actually, the swap can be done anywhere. But the greedy approach: we can simulate the effect of a vertical swap by transferring one unit from s0 to s1 (which reduces s0 by 1 and increases s1 by 1) and count one operation.\n\n            Similarly, while s0<0 and s1>0: \n                we do the reverse.\n\n            Then we add the absolute values of s0 and s1? But note: after the vertical swaps, we still have to fix the remaining difference by horizontal swaps? \n\n            However, the known solution is:\n\n                ans = 0\n                s0 = s1 = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n                    s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n                    while s0>0 and s1<0:\n                        # we can fix one unit by a vertical swap? \n                        s0 -= 1\n                        s1 += 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    while s0<0 and s1>0:\n                        s0 += 1\n                        s1 -= 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n                if s0 != 0 or s1 != 0:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    print(ans)\n\n            But this is not correct because the horizontal swaps are not accounted for by the absolute values? \n\n            Actually, the absolute values of s0 and s1 represent the need to shift ones horizontally? But a horizontal swap within a row will push the excess to the next column. \n\n            The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to use:\n\n                s = 0\n                t = 0\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i] - x[i]\n                    t += b[i] - y[i]\n                    if s > 0 and t < 0:\n                        # then we can do a vertical swap to reduce s and increase t\n                        s -= 1\n                        t += 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    elif s < 0 and t > 0:\n                        s += 1\n                        t -= 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    ans += abs(s) + abs(t)\n\n                if s != 0 or t != 0:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    print(ans)\n\n            But this is not minimal? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                s = 0\n                t = 0\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i]\n                    t += b[i]\n                    # desired: x[i] and y[i]\n                    # but we are allowed to push excess to the next column? \n\n            The intended solution is to use two accumulators for the first row and second row, and then at each column, we can use vertical swaps to balance between the rows, and then the horizontal excess is pushed to the next column. The horizontal push is counted as the absolute value of the accumulators.\n\n            But note: the absolute value of s0 and s1 at the end of the column is the number of horizontal moves needed to push the excess to the next column. \n\n            However, the known solution (from an AC code) is:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n                if sum(a1) + sum(a2) != sum(b1) + sum(b2):\n                    print(-1)\n                    exit(0)\n\n                s1 = 0\n                s2 = 0\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s1 += a1[i] - b1[i]\n                    s2 += a2[i] - b2[i]\n                    while s1 > 0 and s2 < 0:\n                        s1 -= 1\n                        s2 += 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    while s1 < 0 and s2 > 0:\n                        s1 += 1\n                        s2 -= 1\n                        ans += 1\n                    ans += abs(s1) + abs(s2)\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But this is not minimal? It might be. \n\n            However, the sample: \n                Input: \n                    5\n                    1 0 0 1 0\n                    0 1 0 0 0\n                    0 0 1 1 0\n                    1 0 0 0 1\n                Output: 5\n\n            But the sample in the note is 5 moves.\n\n            So the code for program2.py is almost complete, but the TODO is in the first while loop:\n\n                while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We should do:\n\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n                ans += 1\n\n            And then the second while loop is already implemented.\n\n            But note: the variables in the for loop are named m, n, p, q. But we are using n for the second row element, which is bad because n is the number of columns. This will cause the loop to break. We must change the variable name for the second row element.\n\n            However, the problem says: we are only to output the missing code. The missing code is only inside the TODO. And the TODO is in the first while loop.\n\n            So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                ans += 1\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n\n            But note: the order? We first do the operation, then update the accumulators.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n                ans += 1\n\n            But the second while loop is:\n\n                while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    s0 += 1\n                    s1 -= 1\n\n            So for consistency, we do:\n\n                while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                    s0 -= 1\n                    s1 += 1\n                    ans += 1\n\n            This matches the second while loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                    s0 -= 1\n                    s1 += 1\n                    ans += 1\n\nBut note: the code already has the variable `ans` defined and initialized to 0.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\nFor program1.py: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\nFor program2.py: \n        s0 -= 1\n        s1 += 1\n        ans += 1\n\nBut we must output in JSON format.\n\nHowever, note that in program1.py, the TODO is at the same indentation level as the if statement. The if statement is:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code should be indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent. The if is indented by 8 spaces (two levels) and the TODO is at 12 spaces. So the code we fill should be at 12 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside a while loop that is inside a for loop. The while loop is indented by 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8 spaces. We should fill with 8 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\nSo for program1.py: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\nFor program2.py: \n        \"        s0 -= 1\\n        s1 += 1\\n        ans += 1\"\n\nBut note: the second while loop in program2.py is already implemented with:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\nSo we do the same for the first while loop.\n\nBut the code for program2.py has a variable name conflict: we use `n` for the second row element. This will cause the loop to break because `n` is the number of columns. But the problem says we are only to output the missing code. The missing code is only the TODO block. We are not allowed to change the rest.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"        s0 -= 1\\n        s1 += 1\\n        ans += 1\"}\n\nBut note: the program2.py code has a bug with the variable `n` being reused. However, the problem says to output only the missing code. So we assume that the variable name conflict is not present in the original problem statement? Or the author intended to use a different variable. But the provided code has:\n\n   for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n\nThis is a mistake. But we are not allowed to change that. The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to use different variable names. But the TODO is only in the while loop.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut let me check the sample: \n   First sample in the note: \n        n=5\n        current: \n            [1,0,0,1,0]\n            [0,1,0,0,0]\n        desired:\n            [0,0,1,1,0]\n            [1,0,0,0,1]\n\n   We compute column by column:\n\n        col0: \n            m=1, n=0, p=0, q=1\n            s0 = 1-0 = 1 -> s0=1\n            s1 = 0-1 = -1 -> s1=-1\n            Then we see s0>0 and s1<0 -> do the while: \n                s0 becomes 0, s1 becomes 0, ans=1.\n\n        col1:\n            m=0, n=1, p=0, q=0\n            s0 = 0+0=0, then 0-0=0 -> s0=0\n            s1 = 0+1=1, then 1-0=1 -> s1=1\n            Then we do: while s0<0 and s1>0? no.\n            Then ans += abs(0)+abs(1) = 1 -> ans=2.\n\n        col2:\n            m=0, n=0, p=1, q=0\n            s0 = 0+0=0, then 0-1=-1 -> s0=-1\n            s1 = 1+0=1, then 1-0=1 -> s1=1\n            Then we do: while s0<0 and s1>0: \n                s0 becomes 0, s1 becomes 0, ans=3.\n            Then ans += abs(0)+abs(0)=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col3:\n            m=1, n=0, p=1, q=0\n            s0 = 0+1=1, then 1-1=0 -> s0=0\n            s1 = 0+0=0, then 0-0=0 -> s1=0\n            ans +=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col4:\n            m=0, n=0, p=0, q=1\n            s0 = 0+0=0, then 0-0=0 -> s0=0\n            s1 = 0+0=0, then 0-1=-1 -> s1=-1\n            Then we do: while s0>0 and s1<0? no.\n            Then ans += abs(0)+abs(1)=1 -> ans=4.\n\n        Total ans=4, but expected is 5.\n\n    So the above simulation does not yield 5.\n\n    What's the intended minimal moves? The note says 5.\n\n    The known solution that passes is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        b1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        b2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        if sum(a1) + sum(a2) != sum(b1) + sum(b2):\n            print(-1)\n            exit(0)\n\n        s1 = 0\n        s2 = 0\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            s1 += a1[i] - b1[i]\n            s2 += a2[i] - b2[i]\n            while s1 > 0 and s2 < 0:\n                s1 -= 1\n                s2 += 1\n                ans += 1\n            while s1 < 0 and s2 > 0:\n                s1 += 1\n                s2 -= 1\n                ans += 1\n            ans += abs(s1) + abs(s2)\n\n        print(ans)\n\n    Let's simulate with this:\n\n        col0: \n            s1 = 1-0 = 1\n            s2 = 0-1 = -1\n            then we do the first while: \n                s1 becomes 0, s2 becomes 0, ans=1.\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(0)=0 -> ans=1.\n\n        col1:\n            s1 = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            s2 = 0 + (1-0)=1\n            then we do the second while: no (s1=0, not <0)\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(1)=1 -> ans=2.\n\n        col2:\n            s1 = 0 + (0-1) = -1\n            s2 = 1 + (0-0)=1\n            then we do the second while: \n                s1 becomes 0, s2 becomes 0, ans=3.\n            then ans +=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col3:\n            s1 = 0 + (1-1)=0\n            s2 = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            ans +=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col4:\n            s1 = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            s2 = 0 + (0-1)=-1\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(1)=1 -> ans=4.\n\n        Total 4.\n\n    Why is the sample answer 5? \n\n    The sample moves:\n\n        (2,1), (1,1)  -> swap (2,1) and (1,1): \n            becomes:\n                row0: [1, ...] -> [0, ...]  -> at col0: 1 becomes 0, and row1 col0 becomes 1? \n            actually, after swap:\n                row0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n                row1: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        Then (1,2) and (1,3): swap col2 and col3 in row0? \n            row0: [0,0,0,1,0] -> [0,0,1,0,0]\n        Then (2,2) and (2,3): swap col2 and col3 in row1? \n            row1: [1,1,0,0,0] -> [1,0,1,0,0]\n        Then (1,4) and (1,5): swap col4 and col5 in row0? \n            row0: [0,0,1,0,0] -> [0,0,1,0,0] (no change? because both 0)\n        Then (2,5) and (2,4): swap col4 and col5 in row1? \n            row1: [1,0,1,0,0] -> [1,0,1,0,0] (no change)\n\n        This doesn't yield the desired.\n\n    The sample desired is:\n        0 0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 0 1\n\n    The known minimal answer is 5.\n\n    The known solution that passed in Codeforces for the first sample is 5.\n\n    The intended solution is to use:\n\n        s = 0   # the difference in the first row (excess that needs to be pushed to the right)\n        t = 0   # the difference in the second row\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            s += a1[i] - b1[i]\n            t += a2[i] - b2[i]\n            if s > 0 and t < 0:\n                # we can do a vertical swap at this column\n                s -= 1\n                t += 1\n                ans += 1\n            elif s < 0 and t > 0:\n                s += 1\n                t -= 1\n                ans += 1\n            ans += abs(s) + abs(t)\n\n        print(ans)\n\n    But this yields 4 for the first sample.\n\n    Another known solution is to use:\n\n        s = 0\n        t = 0\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            s += a1[i] - b1[i]\n            t += a2[i] - b2[i]\n            if s > 0 and t < 0:\n                # we can do a vertical swap to transfer from first row to second\n                # but we can only transfer if there is a one in the first row and a zero in the second?\n                # but the accumulators are the net.\n                # we do:\n                s -= 1\n                t += 1\n                ans += 1\n            elif s < 0 and t > 0:\n                s += 1\n                t -= 1\n                ans += 1\n            ans += abs(s) + abs(t)\n\n        if s==0 and t==0:\n            print(ans)\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n\n    This also yields 4.\n\n    After checking, the sample provided in the note is:\n\n        Input:\n            5\n            1 0 0 1 0\n            0 1 0 0 0\n            0 0 1 1 0\n            1 0 0 0 1\n\n        Output: 5\n\n    The known solution that got AC in Codeforces for the problem \"Puzzle\" (or similar) is:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        typedef long long ll;\n\n        int main() {\n            ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);\n            int n;\n            cin >> n;\n            vector<int> a1(n), a2(n), b1(n), b2(n);\n            for (int& x : a1) cin >> x;\n            for (int& x : a2) cin >> x;\n            for (int& x : b1) cin >> x;\n            for (int& x : b2) cin >> x;\n\n            ll ans = 0, f=0, s=0;\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                f += a1[i] - b1[i];\n                s += a2[i] - b2[i];\n                while (f>0 && s<0) {\n                    f--;\n                    s++;\n                    ans++;\n                }\n                while (f<0 && s>0) {\n                    f++;\n                    s--;\n                    ans++;\n                }\n                ans += abs(f) + abs(s);\n            }\n\n            if (f || s) cout << -1;\n            else cout << ans;\n        }\n\n    This yields 5 for the sample? Let me simulate:\n\n        col0: \n            f = 1-0 = 1\n            s = 0-1 = -1\n            then we do the first while: \n                f becomes 0, s becomes 0, ans=1.\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(0)=0 -> ans=1.\n\n        col1:\n            f = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            s = 0 + (1-0)=1\n            then we do the second while: \n                f<0 and s>0? no.\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(1)=1 -> ans=2.\n\n        col2:\n            f = 0 + (0-1) = -1\n            s = 1 + (0-0)=1\n            then we do the second while: \n                f becomes 0, s becomes 0, ans=3.\n            then ans +=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col3:\n            f = 0 + (1-1)=0\n            s = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            ans +=0 -> ans=3.\n\n        col4:\n            f = 0 + (0-0)=0\n            s = 0 + (0-1)=-1\n            then ans += abs(0)+abs(1)=1 -> ans=4.\n\n    This is 4.\n\n    But the sample answer is 5.\n\n    I see the sample in the problem note is different:\n\n        In the first example the following sequence of swaps will suffice: \n            (2,1), (1,1)\n            (1,2), (1,3)\n            (2,2), (2,3)\n            (1,4), (1,5)\n            (2,5), (2,4)\n\n        This is 5 swaps.\n\n    The input for the first example is:\n\n        n=5\n        current:\n            1 0 0 1 0\n            0 1 0 0 0\n        desired:\n            0 0 1 1 0\n            1 0 0 0 1\n\n    So the known solution might be 5.\n\n    How to get 5 with the intended method? \n\n    The intended method is to use two accumulators and push the excess. But the simulation of the known code gives 4.\n\n    After checking, the intended solution is to not reset the vertical swaps to 0 immediately, but to allow them to accumulate and then push horizontally. \n\n    The known solution that got AC in Codeforces for the problem \"Puzzle From the Future\" (but this is a different problem) or \"Swapping Puzzle\" might be different.\n\n    Alternatively, the problem might be that the vertical swap can only be done if there is a 1 in the first row and a 0 in the second row in the current arrangement? But the accumulators are for the cumulative difference. \n\n    Given the time, and since the problem says to output only the missing code, and the TODO is in the while loop, and the second while loop is implemented as:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n    then for consistency, the first while loop should be:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n    So we output that.\n\n    The sample might be not 5 with this code, but the problem says the first sample in the note is 5, and the code in the note is the one we are completing.\n\n    Therefore, we output the code for the TODO in program2.py as above.\n\n    For program1.py, the missing code is \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\".\n\n    So the final answer in JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        ans += 1\\n        s0 -= 1\\n        s1 += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2.py, the second while loop has the update of the accumulators and then the ans. In the first while loop, we do the same order: first update accumulators then ans? or first ans then accumulators? \n\nIn the second while loop, it is:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n So for consistency, we do in the first while loop:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n But the TODO is in the first while loop, and the code we are to output is the body of the while loop.\n\n Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        s0 -= 1\n        s1 += 1\n        ans += 1\n\n or \n\n        ans += 1\n        s0 -= 1\n        s1 += 1\n\n Both are acceptable. But to match the second while loop, we do the latter.\n\n However, the second while loop does ans+=1 first. So we do the same.\n\n Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        ans += 1\n        s0 -= 1\n        s1 += 1\n\n But note: the second while loop has three lines: two for the accumulators and one for ans. We have three lines.\n\n So the final answer."
