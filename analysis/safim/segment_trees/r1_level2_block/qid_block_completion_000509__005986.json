Let me count:\n\n          def solve(sn):   # 0\n            t = int(sn)    # 4\n            s, e = ... # 4\n            while s < e:   # 4\n                m = ... # 8\n                if ...:    # 8\n                    e = m  # 12\n                else:      # 8\n                    ... # 12 So the body of the if and the body of the else are both at 12.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the prices in descending order and compute the prefix sum array.\nFor each query (x, y): \n  The customer must purchase at least x items, and then the y cheapest of those purchased are free.\n  To maximize the free value, the customer would choose to purchase exactly x items (because if they purchase more, the free items would be the cheapest among the entire purchase, which might be even cheaper than if they had only taken x, but note: we are allowed to choose which items to purchase). However, note that we can choose any set of items. The strategy is to choose x items such that the y cheapest among them are as expensive as possible.\n\n  How?\n  Since we can choose any x items, we want to avoid including very cheap items that would be given for free. Instead, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. However, note that the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. Therefore, we want the entire set of purchased items to have the largest possible y smallest items.\n\n  One way: \n  We sort the prices in descending order. Then, consider that we are going to pick x items. The free items will be the smallest y items in our chosen set. To maximize the free value, we want the smallest y items in our chosen set to be as large as possible.\n\n  How to choose the set?\n  We can try to take the largest x items. Then the y smallest in that set would be the last y items in the sorted (descending) array? Actually, if we sort in descending order, the set of the top x items would be a[0] ... a[x-1]. The smallest in this set would be a[x-1], then a[x-2], ...? Actually, the set of x items in descending order: the smallest is the last one. So the y smallest would be the last y of these x. But note: we are taking the largest x items, so the set is the top x. The y smallest in this set are the last y of the top x, which are the smallest in the set.\n\n  However, we can also consider including some items that are not in the top x? But if we include an item that is not in the top x, then that item would be one of the free ones (because it is cheaper than the top x) and we would have to remove one of the top x to include it. Then the free value would be the sum of the y smallest, which would include that cheaper item. So that would reduce the free value.\n\n  Therefore, the optimal is to take the top x items. Then the free value is the sum of the smallest y items in that set. But note: in our descending sorted array, the top x items are a[0] ... a[x-1]. The smallest y items in this set are the last y: a[x-y] to a[x-1]? Actually, in descending order, the last y are the smallest. But we have the prefix sum array for the descending array.\n\n  Let the array be sorted in descending order: a[0] is the largest, a[1] next, ... a[n-1] smallest.\n\n  We have computed the prefix sum array p, where:\n      p[0] = 0\n      p[1] = a[0]\n      p[2] = a[0]+a[1]\n      ...\n      p[i] = a[0]+...+a[i-1]\n\n  Then the set of top x items: indices 0 to x-1.\n  The y smallest in this set: the last y, which are a[x-y] to a[x-1]. The sum of these is: \n        p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n  But note: our prefix sum p is defined for the descending array. So the sum of the top x is p[x]. The sum of the top (x-y) is p[x-y]. Then the free items are the last y of the top x, so we subtract the top (x-y) from the top x: \n        free = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n  However, wait: \n      p[x] = a[0] + ... + a[x-1]\n      p[x-y] = a[0] + ... + a[x-y-1]\n      Then p[x] - p[x-y] = a[x-y] + ... + a[x-1] -> which is the last y of the top x.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"y cheapest\" meaning the smallest. In our descending array, the smallest in the set are the last ones. So this is correct.\n\n  Therefore, for a query (x, y): \n        free = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"at least x\", but we are taking exactly x. Why is that optimal? Because if we take more than x, then the free items are the y cheapest in the entire purchase. The y cheapest in a larger set might be even cheaper than the y cheapest in the top x. So it is better to take exactly x.\n\n  Therefore, the missing line in program1.py is:\n        print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the variables in the for loop are named x_i and y_i. We read them as:\n        x, y = R()   # but the current code uses R for reading, and we are in a loop for q times.\n\n  The current code has:\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  However, note: the prefix array p has length n+1 (from 0 to n). And x is at most n, and x-y is at least 0 (since y<=x). So it is safe.\n\n  But note: the array a is sorted in descending order, and we built the prefix sum on that.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n        x, y = R()\n        print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the format. We must output the missing code for program1.py as a string.\n\n  But note: the existing code has:\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the specified JSON format.\n\n  So for program1.py, the missing code is two lines: \n        x, y = R()\n        print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  However, note that the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n  But note: the existing code uses R to read two integers. We are using R again.\n\n  Also, note: the problem says that the output of program1.py is piped to program2.py. But program1.py is printing integers for each query, one per line.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  The problem: We are adding straight lines (parallel to the edges of the hexagons) and each set of three directions (because the hexagon has three directions) can form triangles.\n\n  The note says: after adding the first line, no triangle is created. After the second line, two triangles are created. Then with three lines, we get more.\n\n  The provided code builds an array `cnt` such that `cnt[k]` is the number of triangles created when we have added k lines. But note: the problem says that we are allowed to add lines in three directions (like the three sets of parallel lines in a hex grid). The code initializes:\n\n        ctr = [0, 0, 0]   # counts the number of lines in each of the three directions\n        cnt = [0]          # cnt[0] = 0 (with 0 lines, 0 triangles)\n\n  Then it builds the array until the number of triangles is at least 10^9.\n\n  How does it build?\n        while cnt[-1] < 10**9:\n            i = ctr.index(min(ctr))   # choose the direction that currently has the fewest lines\n            cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n            ctr[i] += 1\n\n  Explanation: \n      When we add a line in direction i, we are going to form new triangles. How? \n      The new line will form triangles with every pair of lines from the other two directions? Actually, note: the grid has three directions. A triangle is formed by three lines: one from each direction? Actually, no: an equilateral triangle in a hex grid is formed by three lines: one from each direction? But note the example: two lines created two triangles. \n\n      Actually, the note says: \"Adding two red lines results in two new yellow equilateral triangles\". So two lines (in two different directions) form two triangles? \n\n      How? \n        When we have two lines in two different directions, they form two triangles? Actually, the two lines alone don't form a triangle. But when we have two lines in two different directions, they intersect and form a parallelogram? However, the problem says they form two triangles. \n\n      Actually, the formula: \n        When we add a new line in direction i, then the number of new triangles is: \n          2 * (the total number of lines in the other two directions)   [because each existing line in the other two directions will form two triangles with the new line?]\n\n      Why two? Because the two lines from the other two directions, together with the new line, form two triangles? \n\n      Actually, the recurrence: \n        Let the counts in the three directions be (a, b, c). Then the total number of triangles is: 2*(a*b + b*c + c*a). \n        But wait: that would be symmetric. However, the code does: \n            cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n\n        Here, sum(ctr) = a+b+c, and then subtract ctr[i] (which is the count in direction i) -> that gives the sum of the counts in the other two directions.\n\n        So the new triangles = 2 * (the sum of the counts in the other two directions).\n\n      Why? \n        When we add a new line in direction i, we are going to form new triangles with every line in the other two directions. But each pair (one line from direction j and one from direction k) will form two triangles? Actually, the two triangles are the two sides of the intersection.\n\n      Therefore, the recurrence is: \n          new_triangles = 2 * ( (number of lines in direction j) + (number of lines in direction k) ) \n          = 2 * ( (a+b+c) - ctr[i] )   [if i is the direction we are adding, then the other two directions have (a+b+c - ctr[i]) lines?]\n\n      But wait: the other two directions together have (a+b+c) minus the count in direction i? Actually, no: because the counts are stored in ctr, and the other two directions are the ones that are not i. The sum of the other two is: (total lines) - (lines in direction i) = (a+b+c) - a_i.\n\n      However, note: the new line is being added, so the current state has counts (a, b, c) and we are about to add one to direction i. Then the new triangles are formed with the existing lines in the other two directions. The existing lines in the other two directions are (a+b+c) - a_i.\n\n      Therefore, the formula is: 2 * ( (a+b+c) - a_i )\n\n      Then we update: ctr[i] becomes a_i+1.\n\n      The array `cnt` is built so that `cnt[k]` is the total number of triangles after k lines.\n\n  Then, the function `solve(sn)` is defined to handle a test case. It converts the string `sn` to integer `t` (the required n). Then it does a binary search over the `cnt` array to find the minimum number of lines k such that `cnt[k] >= t`.\n\n  The binary search is set up as:\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s+e)>>1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We need to set the next state when `cnt[m] < t`. Then we want to look in the right half. So we set:\n        s = m+1\n\n  But note: the binary search is set to find the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t. \n      - If cnt[m] >= t, then we set e = m (so we are looking for an index in [s, m]).\n      - If cnt[m] < t, then we know that the answer must be at least m+1, so we set s = m+1.\n\n  Therefore, the missing line is:\n        s = m+1\n\n  However, note: the variable `s` is the lower bound and `e` is the upper bound. The loop condition is `s < e`. \n\n  So the code for the TODO in program2.py is:\n        s = m+1\n\n  Then after the loop, we return `str(s)`.\n\n  But note: the binary search returns the index `s` (which is the number of lines). The array `cnt` is built for k from 0 to ... and the index in the array is the number of lines. So the answer for a test case is the index `s`.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is one line: \n        s = m+1\n\n  Now, we output the JSON:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n    \"program2\": \"  s = m+1\"\n  }\n\n  But note: the indentation in the existing code.\n\n  In program1.py, the for loop is:\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with two lines. The existing code uses 4-space indentation? The problem does not specify, but the existing code in program1.py has the for loop at the same level as the previous lines. We'll use the same indentation as the for loop (which is one level). The existing code uses 4 spaces per level? But the example uses 1 space? Actually, the example:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO line is indented by two spaces? Actually, the example code we are given for program1.py has:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We'll use two spaces for the inner block? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We can output the two lines with the same indentation as the comment.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside the while loop and the function. The existing code has:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with one line: \"s = m+1\", and we must indent it appropriately. The existing code uses 4 spaces per level? The example code uses 4 spaces for the function body? Actually, the example code:\n\n        def solve(sn):\n            t = int(sn)\n            s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We'll use 8 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the function body is indented by 4, the while loop by 8, the if-else by 12. So the TODO is at 12, and then the next line should be at 12. But the problem says \"Output the missing code\", so we output the line with the same indentation as the comment.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\n  We'll output:\n\n      program1: two lines: \n          \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n      program2: one line:\n          \"  s = m+1\"\n\n  But note: the existing code in program2.py has the else block at the same level as the if. The if block has \"e = m\" at 12 spaces. Then the else block has the comment at 12 spaces. So we output \"s = m+1\" at 12 spaces? Actually, we can output with 12 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we are replacing the TODO comment. We can output the code that would replace the comment, including the same indentation.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON string.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      \"program1\": \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n      \"program2\": \"    s = m+1\"\n\n  Wait, let me count the indentation in the example:\n\n      program1.py: \n          for _ in range(q):\n          # ... the TODO is at the same level as the for body, which is two spaces? Actually, the example code we are given for program1.py uses:\n\n          n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n          for _ in range(q):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The for loop body is indented by two spaces? Actually, the example code is written in a compact way. The original code uses two spaces for the inner block? We'll use two spaces per level.\n\n      program2.py: \n          The function solve has:\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The if and else are at the same level (which is 8 spaces from the function start? or 4 from the while?). Actually, the code is:\n\n          def solve(sn):\n              t = int(sn)\n              s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n              while s < e:\n                  m = (s + e) >> 1\n                  if cnt[m] >= t:\n                      e = m\n                  else:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The function body is indented by 4 spaces. The while body by 8, the if and else by 12. So the TODO is at 12 spaces. Therefore, the code we put in the else block should be at 12 spaces.\n\n          So we output for program2: \"    s = m+1\" (which is 4 more spaces? but actually the existing code uses 4 per level, so 12 spaces total? But we are replacing the comment, so we output the code that would be at the same indentation as the comment. The comment is at 12 spaces? Actually, the example code we are given does not show the exact indentation. However, the problem says \"missing lines\", so we can output the code without worrying about the exact number of spaces? But we must run.\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the comment with a line of code. The existing code has the else block with the comment at the same indentation as the if block's \"e = m\". So we can output:\n\n          \"s = m+1\"   with the same indentation as the \"e = m\" in the if branch? That would be 12 spaces? But the example code we are given for program2.py uses 4 spaces per level. So:\n\n          if ...:\n              e = m   # this is 8 spaces from the function start? Actually, the function is 4, the while is 8, the if is 12? \n\n          Actually, the code we are given for program2.py is:\n\n          def solve(sn):\n            t = int(sn)\n            s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          This uses 4 spaces for the function, 8 for the while, 12 for the if and else. So the else block should have 12 spaces. Therefore, the missing line should be indented by 12 spaces? But the problem does not require the exact indentation? Actually, the problem says the code must run. We must output the code with the correct indentation.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and we are to fill in the block. We can output:\n\n          for program2: \"    s = m+1\"   (which is 4 spaces) but that would be 4 spaces relative to the else? Actually, the else is at 12, and then the body of the else should be at 16? \n\n          But the example code in the if branch has \"e = m\" at the same level as the condition? Actually, the example code in the if branch is at 12? Then the body of the if is at 16? \n\n          Actually, the example code we are given for program2.py does not show the exact indentation of the body of the if. It shows:\n\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n\n          This suggests that the body of the if is indented by 4 more spaces (so 12+4=16). But the else block we are replacing the TODO with should also be at 16? \n\n          However, the TODO comment is at the same level as the condition? Actually, the example code:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The comment is at the same level as the condition? Then the body of the else should be at the same level as the body of the if? \n\n          Therefore, we should output for program2: 4 spaces at the beginning of the line? But the existing code in the if branch has 4 extra spaces? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify. But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would replace the TODO. We are replacing the comment with a line of code that should be at the same indentation as the body of the if. So we output:\n\n          \"    s = m+1\"   (which is 4 spaces) but that would be 4 spaces relative to the else? Actually, the else is at 12, then the body should be at 16? So 4 more spaces? \n\n          How about we output 4 spaces? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. However, the example code we are given for program2.py uses:\n\n          def solve(sn):\n            ...   [4 spaces for the function body?]\n\n          Actually, the code we are given:\n\n          def solve(sn):\n            t = int(sn)\n            s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          This uses 4 spaces for the function body, 8 for the while, 12 for the if/else, and then the body of the if is at 16? Actually, the body of the if is at 16? Then we should output 4 more spaces for the body of the else? \n\n          But the problem says: the code must run. We can assume that the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. Then:\n\n          - The function: 0\n          - The while: 4\n          - The if/else: 8\n          - The body of the if/else: 12\n\n          Actually, the example code we are given for program2.py does not have the body of the if at 12? It has:\n\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n\n          The \"e = m\" is at 12? Then the else body should be at 12? But the else body is the same as the if body? \n\n          Actually, the example code we are given for program2.py has:\n\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"e = m\" is aligned with the condition? Then it is at the same level? That would be 8? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n          def solve(sn):   # 0\n            t = int(sn)    # 4\n            s, e = ...     # 4\n            while s < e:   # 4\n                m = ...    # 8\n                if ...:    # 8\n                    e = m  # 12\n                else:      # 8\n                    ...    # 12\n\n          So the body of the if and the body of the else are both at 12. Therefore, the missing line should be at 12 spaces? But we are outputting a string. We can output:\n\n          for program2: \"    s = m+1\"   (which is 4 spaces) but that would be 4 spaces from the current level? Actually, the current level (the else) is at 8, so 4 more would be 12? \n\n          How do we represent 12 spaces? We can use 4 spaces? because the existing code uses 4 per indent. So:\n\n          - The function: 0\n          - The while: 4 (one indent: 4 spaces)\n          - The if/else: 8 (two indents: 8 spaces)\n          - The body: 12 (three indents: 12 spaces) -> but we output the code for the body as 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, we are replacing the comment. The comment is at 12 spaces? Then we output the same 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be inserted. We are to output the code that would replace the TODO. The TODO is a comment at 12 spaces. We replace it with a line of code at 12 spaces? \n\n          However, the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? It only requires that the code runs. And the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. So we output:\n\n          for program2: \"    s = m+1\"   (which is 4 spaces) but that would be 4 spaces relative to the else? Actually, the else is at 8, so 4 more is 12. \n\n          But note: the existing code in the if branch has \"e = m\" at 4 spaces relative to the if? So we output 4 spaces for the else body.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without any leading spaces? and let the existing indentation take care? But the existing code has the else block, and we are replacing the comment with a line that must be in the else block. The else block is already indented. We only need to output the line with the same indentation as the body of the if.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify, and the example code we are given for program2.py does not show the exact indentation of the body, we'll assume that the body of the else should be indented one level more than the else. In Python, that is typically 4 spaces. So we output 4 spaces.\n\n          But the example code we are given for program2.py has:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The comment is at 4 spaces relative to the else? Then we output the same: 4 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n          program2: \"    s = m+1\"   (which is 4 spaces)\n\n  However, to be safe, we can look at the existing code in the if branch: it has \"e = m\" at 4 spaces relative to the if. So we do the same for the else.\n\n  But note: the problem says the code must run. We are replacing:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  with:\n\n        else:\n            s = m+1\n\n  So the missing code is the line \"s = m+1\", and it should be at the same indentation as the \"e = m\" in the if branch.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n      program2:\n          \"    s = m+1\"\n\n  But wait: in program1, the for loop body is currently two lines: the comment. We are replacing the comment with two lines. The existing code uses two spaces for the inner block? Actually, the example code we are given for program1.py:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for loop body is one line (the comment) and it is indented by two spaces? Then we output two lines each with two spaces? \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the two spaces? But the problem says: the code must run. We must match the existing indentation.\n\n  How about we output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"x, y = R()\\nprint(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n  without any extra spaces? Then the existing for loop would become:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n        x, y = R()\n        print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  That would be an error because the body of the for loop must be indented.\n\n  Therefore, we must output the same indentation as the existing comment. The comment is at two spaces? Then we output two spaces for each line.\n\n  So:\n\n      program1: \n          \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n  This will be:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  That should be correct.\n\n  Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n    \"program2\": \"    s = m+1\"\n  }\n\n  But note: the problem says the output of program1.py is piped to program2.py. The program1.py prints integers (one per query) and program2.py reads the first integer t (the number of test cases) and then the next t integers? Actually, program2.py reads:\n\n        inp = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        inp.pop(0)   # removes the first token? which is the number of test cases? \n\n        Then it maps the rest to solve.\n\n  But wait: the input to program2.py is the output of program1.py. The output of program1.py is a sequence of integers (one per query) each on a separate line. Then program2.py reads the entire input and splits by whitespace. Then it removes the first token? \n\n  Actually, the first token is the first integer in the input. But the input to program2.py is the output of program1.py, which does not start with the number of test cases. It starts with the answer for the first query.\n\n  How does program2.py know how many test cases? \n\n  The problem says: the input to program2.py is:\n\n        The first line contains a single integer t (the number of test cases). Then t test cases follow.\n\n  But the output of program1.py is not in that format. It is the answers for the q queries (each on a separate line). \n\n  This suggests that the two programs are independent. We are only to complete the missing parts.\n\n  We are not changing the input/output of the entire programs, only the missing parts.\n\n  Therefore, we output the JSON as above.\n\n  Let me write the JSON string:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"    s = m+1\"}\n\n  But note: the quotes must be escaped? Actually, the problem says to output the JSON. We are writing a string. The inner strings use double quotes, so we use double quotes for the JSON keys and values, and we escape the inner quotes? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the example output format uses straight double quotes.\n\n  We output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"  x, y = R()\\n  print(p[x] - p[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"    s = m+1\"}\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified JSON structure.\n\n  We'll output that.\n\n  But note: in program1, the array p is built for the descending sorted array. The query uses x and y. We assume x is at most n, and x-y is nonnegative. This matches the constraints.\n\n  In program2, the binary search is set to find the minimal k such that cnt[k] >= n. The array cnt is built for k from 0 to ... and the index is the number of lines. The binary search is standard.\n\n  Therefore, we are done."
