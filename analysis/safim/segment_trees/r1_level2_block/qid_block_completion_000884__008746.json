In the example, s[0]=0, s[1]=1, s[2]=3, s[3]=3, s[4]=7.\n\n  Explanation for s[i]: \n        s[i] is the sum of (index+1) for every index j in [0, i-1] where a[j] is 1. Why is this correct?",

So we can use a[-1] as our s_val.\n\n  Steps for the TODO block: if i==0:\n            # then we set a[0] = 1 if c[0]>0 else 0\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0   # because x is c[0] at i=0\n            # and then update a[-1] (which is our s_val) for the next iteration: \n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1   # because s_val for next index (i=1) should be 1 (since the weight for index0 is 1)\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0   # remains 0\n        else:\n            # x is c[i]\n            # s_val = a[-1] (which is the s_val for the current i, i.e., s[i] in the known solution)\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            # then update a[-1] for the next iteration: \n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] = a[-1] + (i+1)   # add the weight for index i: i+1\n            # else, a[-1] remains\n\n  But note: the known solution for i=0 does not use s[0] (which is 0) to decide a[0]. It uses c[0]>0. And then updates s[1] = s[0] + (0+1) if a[0]==1, else s[0]. In our TODO, for i=0, we set a[0] and then update a[-1] to either 1 or 0. Then for i=1, we use a[-1] (which is 1 if a[0]==1, or 0 if a[0]==0) as s_val for i=1. This matches: for i=1, s_val = s[1] in the known solution. Therefore, the TODO code is:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  But note: the initial a is set to [1 if x else 0 for x in c] + [1].",

Let's test with the example: c = [2,4,2,4] -> n=4\n        initial a = [1,1,1,1,1]   (because 2,4,2,4 are non-zero -> 1, and then append 1)\n\n        i=0, x=2:\n            a[0] = 1 (because 2>0) -> then set a[-1] = 1. Now a = [1,1,1,1,1] -> but we set a[0] to 1 (already 1) and a[-1] to 1 (already 1) -> no change? i=1, x=4:\n            compare 4 > a[-1] (which is 1) -> true, so a[1]=1. then a[-1] = 1 + (1+1) = 3. Now a = [1,1,1,1,3] \n        i=2, x=2:\n            compare 2 > a[-1] (3) -> false, so a[2]=0. then since a[2]=0, we do not update a[-1]. a = [1,1,0,1,3]\n        i=3, x=4:\n            compare 4 > a[-1] (3) -> true, so a[3]=1. then a[-1] = 3 + (3+1) = 7. a = [1,1,0,1,7]\n\n        Then we output a[:-1] = [1,1,0,1] -> correct. But what if there is a test case with c[0]=0? \n        i=0: a[0] = 0, and then a[-1] = 0. Then for i=1: if c[1] > 0 -> then a[1]=1, and then a[-1] = 0 + (1+1)=2.\n        ... This matches. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  But note: the initial a has an extra element at the end (index n) that we use as storage for s_val. We are done. Summary:\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is: `answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]`\n\n  For program2.py: the missing code is the block above. Now output in JSON format.

Then the number of k from 1 to n with no zero in the first k is L (because for k=1 to L, the first k are all ones). So c0 = n - L.\n\n        But L is at least 1. And we don't know L yet. So from a0=1, we have c0 = n - L, so L = n - c0. But L is the length of the prefix of ones starting at a0. So the first L = n - c0 elements are ones. Then at index L (0-indexed, so the L-th element) we have the first zero. Therefore, we can recover the entire prefix of ones of length L = n - c0. Then for indices from 0 to L-1: a_i = 1.\n  Then for the index L: a_L = 0. Then we can move to index L.\n\n  But what about the next? Let's try with the example: \n        n=4, c=[2,4,2,4]\n        j=0: c0=2. If we assume a0=0, then c0 should be n=4 -> but 2!=4, so a0 must be 1. Then L = n - c0 = 4-2 = 2. So the first 2 elements are ones: a0=1, a1=1. Then a2=0 (the first zero at index2). Now for j=2: we are at the first zero. How to recover a2 and beyond? We then consider c2=2. The formula for j=2: \n        c2 = 2 * a2 + T, where T = number of k from 3 to 4 such that Z_k > 2. But a2=0, so c2 = 0 + T = 2 -> T=2. What is T? T = number of k in {3,4} such that Z_k > 2.\n\n  Z_k: the number of zeros in the first k elements. k=3: the first 3 elements: [1,1,0] -> Z_3=1 -> not >2.\n        k=4: the first 4 elements: [1,1,0,?] -> we haven't set a3 yet. But we are at j=2, and we are setting a2=0. We haven't set a3.",

So c0 = n - (t0 - 1) [if there is a zero at index t0 (0-indexed), then for k=1 to t0-1: no zero, so that's t0-1 values; for k>=t0: at least one zero]\n\n  But if there is no zero at all, then t0 = infinity, and c0 = n - n = 0. But we don't know t0. However, we can recover a0:\n\n        if c0 = n, then a0 must be 0? if c0 < n, then a0 must be 1? Why? If a0=0, then for k=1, we have Z_1=1, so for k=1: condition holds. And for every k>=1, we have at least one zero (at a0). So c0 = n. If a0=1, then for k=1: Z_1=0 -> does not hold. For k>=2: it may or may not hold.

The value T for j is the number of k>=j+1 such that the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1. But note: the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1 if and only if the (j+1)-th zero occurs at or before position k.\n\n  Let F(j) = the position of the (j+1)-th zero (0-indexed). Then the condition Z_k >= j+1 is equivalent to k >= F(j). Then T = the number of k in [j+1, n] such that k>=F(j) = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) ? Actually, the number of k from j+1 to n that are >= F(j) is: if F(j) <= j+1, then all n - j values of k (from j+1 to n) satisfy the condition -> T = n - j.\n        if F(j) > n, then T = 0.\n        else, T = n - F(j) + 1? But note: k runs from j+1 to n. The condition is k>=F(j). So T = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) if F(j) >= j+1? Actually, if F(j) is in the range [j+1, n], then T = n - F(j) + 1? But wait: k from j+1 to n, and k>=F(j). The smallest k that satisfies is F(j) (if F(j)>=j+1). Then the count is n - F(j) + 1? Example: n=5, j=1, F(1)=3 (meaning the second zero is at index 3). Then k from 2 to 5: k>=3 -> k=3,4,5 -> count=3 = 5-3+1? -> 3. So T = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) if F(j) >= j+1, and if F(j) < j+1, then T = n - j? But if F(j) < j+1, then the (j+1)-th zero occurs at a position < j+1, which is impossible because we only have j+1 zeros and the last one is at F(j) which is at most j. Then for any k>=j+1, we have at least j+1 zeros? So T = n - j.\n\n  Therefore, T = \n        if F(j) <= j: then n - j [because then for every k>=j+1, we have Z_k>=j+1]\n        else: n - F(j) + 1 [if F(j) is between j+1 and n]\n        and if F(j) is infinity (meaning there is no (j+1)-th zero) then T=0. But we don't know F(j) until we know the positions of zeros. This seems complicated.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe current code uses a 2D array `data` of size 11x11 (since letters from 'a' to 'k' are 11 letters) to count the frequency of each string.\nThe current loop counts pairs that have the same second character and different first characters (by iterating j and l for the first character, and same k for the second). But note: the condition `if j != l` and then we do `data[j][k] * data[l][k]` counts every pair of strings that have the same second character and different first characters. However, note that this counts each pair twice (because (j,l) and (l,j) are both considered) and then we do `answer//2` to fix.\n\nWe also need to count pairs that have the same first character and different second characters. This is the symmetric case. So we should do:\n    for each j (first character) and for each k (second character) and for each l (which will be the second character of the other string) such that k != l, we add `data[j][k] * data[j][l]`.\n\nBut note: the current code has a triple nested loop (j, k, l) and inside we have two conditions: one for the same second character (which we already did) and then we have a TODO for the same first character.\n\nSo the TODO part should be:\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nHowever, note that this will also count each pair twice? Because for a fixed j (first character) and two distinct second characters k and l, we count the pair (k, l) and (l, k). But actually, we are iterating over k and then over l. For each k, we consider every l (with k != l) and then we multiply the count of (j,k) with the count of (j,l). This counts each unordered pair twice: once when k is the first and l the second, and once when l is the first and k the second.\n\nTherefore, the entire answer is computed by:\n  - For same second character and different first: we add for every distinct first character pair (j, l) the product of counts for (j,k) and (l,k). This counts each unordered pair twice.\n  - For same first character and different second: we add for every distinct second character pair (k, l) the product of counts for (j,k) and (j,l). This also counts each unordered pair twice.\n\nThen we do `answer//2` at the end to account for double counting.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total pairs that differ in exactly one position. Each pair that differs in the first character only (and same second) is counted in the first part. Each pair that differs in the second character only (and same first) is counted in the second part. And pairs that differ in both positions are not counted (because we require exactly one).\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the current code structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[l][k]\n                if k != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis inner loop runs 11*11*11 = 1331 times per test case, which is acceptable because 11 is small.\n\nSo we write in the TODO part: `answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]`\n\nBut wait: the inner loop variable `l` is being used for two different purposes? Actually, in the first condition `j != l` (where `l` is an index for the first character) and in the second condition `k != l` (where `l` is an index for the second character). This is because the inner loop is over `l` from 0 to 10. However, in the first condition we are using `l` as a first character index, and in the second condition we are using `l` as a second character index? That is not consistent.\n\nActually, the current loop structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):   # j: first character index\n        for k in range(11):   # k: second character index\n            for l in range(11):   # l: this is being used for two different things? \n\nWe are using `l` in the first condition as an index for the first character (to compare with j) and in the second condition as an index for the second character (to compare with k). This is incorrect.\n\nWe need to separate the two counts. Actually, the two conditions are independent: one for same second character (varying first) and one for same first character (varying second). But the inner loop variable `l` is being used for both? That is a bug.\n\nWe should restructure the loops? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO part. However, the current code is flawed.\n\nLooking at the original code: the first condition uses `l` as a first character index? Because we are iterating `l` from 0 to 10 and then we do `data[l][k]` meaning `l` is the first character and `k` is the second. Then the second condition uses `l` as a second character index? Because we do `data[j][l]` meaning `j` is the first and `l` is the second.\n\nBut note: the inner loop variable `l` is being used for two different purposes in the same iteration? That is not what we want.\n\nWe should instead have two separate inner loops? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO part.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the variable name for the second condition? But we cannot.\n\nActually, the current code is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[l][k]\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut this uses the same `l` for both. That is, in the same iteration, `l` is used as a first character index in the first condition and as a second character index in the second condition. This is incorrect.\n\nWe must instead use two separate loops? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO part. However, the original code structure is given and we are only to complete the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, note that the two conditions are independent. The first condition (j != l) is for the same second character (k) and different first character (j and l). The second condition (k != l) is for the same first character (j) and different second character (k and l). So we can do:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            # For same second character (k) and different first: we can loop over l (for first character) from 0 to 10, excluding j.\n            # But the current loop does that in the inner loop over l? Actually, the inner loop over l is from 0 to 10, and we check j != l.\n\n            # Similarly, for same first character (j) and different second: we can loop over m (for second character) from 0 to 10, excluding k.\n\nBut the current code only has one inner loop (over l). So we cannot do both in the same inner loop without confusion.\n\nGiven the constraints (11 is small) we can do two separate triple loops? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the variable in the TODO to use a different variable? But we cannot because the problem says we are only to fill the TODO.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are allowed to change the structure? But the instructions say: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and we are only to output the missing code.\n\nBut note: the TODO is only the line under the condition `if k != l:`. However, the current structure is flawed. We must fix the entire approach.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we must only output the line that goes in the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the current inner loop variable `l` is being used for the second character in the TODO. But the first condition uses `l` for the first character. This is a bug. However, the problem states that the original code is given and we are to complete it. But the original code might be flawed.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the example test case has n=5 and the answer is 5. With the current code (without the TODO) we are only counting the pairs that have the same second character and different first. For the first test case:\n\nStrings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"cc\", \"db\", \"aa\"\n\nWe have:\n  ab: (0,1) -> index: a->0, b->1\n  cb: (2,1)\n  cc: (2,2)\n  db: (3,1)\n  aa: (0,0)\n\nThe pairs that have same second character and different first:\n  For second character 'b' (index1): we have \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\". The pairs: (ab,cb), (ab,db), (cb,db) -> 3 pairs.\n  For second character 'c' (index2): we have \"cc\" -> no pair.\n  For second character 'a' (index0): we have \"aa\" -> no pair.\n\nBut the example says there are 5 pairs. The other pairs are: (\"ab\", \"aa\") and (\"cb\",\"cc\"). \n- (\"ab\",\"aa\"): same first character? No, they have the same first character? Actually, both start with 'a'. So they have the same first character and different second: 'b' vs 'a'. \n- (\"cb\",\"cc\"): same first character? Yes, both start with 'c'. Then second character: 'b' vs 'c'. \n\nSo we need to count the same first character pairs: \n  For first character 'a': we have \"ab\" and \"aa\" -> 1 pair.\n  For first character 'c': we have \"cb\" and \"cc\" -> 1 pair.\n  For first character 'd': only one -> 0.\n\nSo total same first character pairs: 2.\n\nTherefore, total pairs = 3 (from same second) + 2 (from same first) = 5.\n\nBut the current code without the TODO only counts 3. Then we add the same first character pairs. How to count same first character pairs? We need to iterate for each first character j, and for each second character k, and then for each other second character l (l != k) we add the product of data[j][k] and data[j][l]. \n\nBut in the current inner loop, we are iterating l from 0 to 10. We are using l as the index for the first character in the first condition. We cannot use l for the second character in the same loop? \n\nWe must change the loop structure? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            # For same second character: we can do without the inner loop? \n            # Actually, we can precompute the total for each second character? \n            # But the problem says we are to fill the TODO.\n\nGiven the constraints (11 is small) we can do two separate inner loops? But the current code has one inner loop.\n\nActually, the intended solution is to use two separate double loops? But the current code uses a triple loop.\n\nWe can restructure the entire solution to avoid triple loops? But the problem says we are only to fill the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same inner loop variable `l` for the second character in the TODO. But then the first condition uses `l` for the first character and the second condition uses `l` for the second character. This is incorrect because in the same iteration, `l` is the same number. \n\nFor example, when l=0: \n  Condition1: if j != 0 -> then we add data[j][k] * data[0][k] (which is for first character 0 and second character k) -> this is for same second character k and first character j and 0.\n  Condition2: if k != 0 -> then we add data[j][k] * data[j][0] (which is for first character j and second character 0) -> this is for same first character j and second character k and 0.\n\nBut note: the two conditions are independent and we are using the same `l` for two different meanings. This will work? Actually, we are iterating `l` from 0 to 10, and we are using it in two different contexts. The two conditions are independent. The first condition uses `l` as a first character index and the second condition uses `l` as a second character index. This is acceptable because the two conditions are independent. \n\nBut the counts will be:\n\n  For same second character: we are iterating over all first characters l (from 0 to 10) and if j != l, we add data[j][k] * data[l][k]. This is correct.\n\n  For same first character: we are iterating over all second characters l (from 0 to 10) and if k != l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This is also correct.\n\nSo the same variable `l` is being used for two different loops? Actually, it is one loop but we are using the same index variable for two different purposes. But note: the two conditions are independent and the variable `l` is just an integer. We are not using it to index the same dimension. In the first condition we use it for the first dimension, and in the second condition we use it for the second dimension. This is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the entire loop will run 11*11*11 = 1331 times per test case, and the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so 1331 * (number of test cases) might be up to 1331 * 100 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: `answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]`\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given the array C (of length n) which is the element-wise sum of the arrays B_1, B_2, ..., B_n, where B_k is the array obtained by sorting the first k elements of A.\n\nWe are to recover the binary array A.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        c=[*map(int,s.split())]\n        a=[1 if x else 0 for x in c]+[1]\n        for i,x in enumerate(c):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print(*a[:-1])\n\nWe note that the array `a` is initialized as: for each element in `c`, if x (the element of c) is non-zero then 1, else 0, and then we append an extra 1 at the end. Then we do a loop and then remove the last element when printing.\n\nBut the example: \n  Input: n=4, c=[2,4,2,4] -> then a = [1,1,1,1,1] initially? because all are non-zero? Then we do a loop and then output a[:-1] = [1,1,1,1]. But the expected A is [1,1,0,1] for the example.\n\nSo the initialization is not correct.\n\nWe must design an algorithm.\n\nObservation:\n\nLet A = [a1, a2, ..., an]. Then for each k from 1 to n, we form B_k by sorting the first k elements. Note that the sorting will put all zeros first and then ones.\n\nLet Z_k = number of zeros in the first k elements of A.\nThen in B_k, the first Z_k elements are 0 and the next k - Z_k elements are 1.\n\nNow, the element-wise sum C = [c1, c2, ..., cn] is the sum of the j-th element of B_1, B_2, ... , B_n.\n\nBut note: for a fixed j (0-indexed), the j-th element is included in B_k only when k > j (because for k<=j, the j-th element is not part of the first k? Actually, the array B_k has length n, but only the first k are sorted and the rest remain as in A? Actually, the problem says: \"the result of sorting the first k elements of A\" and the rest remains? \n\nBut the example: \n  A = [0,1,0,1] \n  B_1: sort first 1: [0,1,0,1] -> the first element is sorted, the rest unchanged? \n  B_2: sort first 2: [0,1,0,1] -> the first two are sorted? \n  B_3: sort first 3: [0,0,1,1] -> the first three are sorted, the last one remains? \n  B_4: sort first 4: [0,0,1,1]\n\nBut note the example output: \n  B_1: [0,1,0,1] -> actually, the problem says: \"the result of sorting the first k elements of A\" and the rest are the same? \n\nBut the example: \n  For k=3: the first three are [0,1,0] -> sorted to [0,0,1] and then the last element is the original last element? But the example output for B_3 is [0,0,1,1]. The last element is 1? But the original last element is 1. So the rest are unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the array B_k is defined as:\n  The first k elements are sorted (non-decreasing) and the elements from k+1 to n are the same as in A.\n\nNow, the j-th element of B_k (for j from 0 to n-1) is:\n  If j < k: then the j-th element of B_k is 0 if j < Z_k, and 1 if j >= Z_k (where Z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements of A).\n  If j >= k: then the j-th element of B_k is a_j (the original element).\n\nTherefore, the j-th element of C (c_j) is the sum over k:\n\n  c_j = [for k from 1 to j] (the value at j in B_k) + [for k from j+1 to n] (the value at j in B_k)\n\nBut note: for k from 1 to j: in B_k, the j-th element is not in the sorted part? Actually, j is the index (0-indexed) and k is the number of elements sorted. So when k <= j, then the j-th element is not sorted? Actually, when k <= j, the j-th element is beyond the first k, so it remains as a_j? \n\nWait, no: the j-th element is at index j. The first k elements are indices 0 to k-1. So for k <= j, the j-th element is beyond the sorted part? Then it remains as a_j.\n\nFor k > j: then the j-th element is within the sorted part? Then it becomes 0 if the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1? Actually, in the sorted part, the first Z_k elements are 0 and the rest are 1. So the j-th element (which is at index j) is 0 if j < Z_k, and 1 if j >= Z_k.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  c_j = [for k=1 to j] a_j   +   [for k=j+1 to n] (0 if j < Z_k else 1)\n\nBut note: the first term: for k from 1 to j, the j-th element is always a_j? So that's j * a_j.\n\nThe second term: for k from j+1 to n, the j-th element is 0 if the number of zeros in the first k elements (Z_k) is at least j+1? Actually, no: the j-th element is at position j. In the sorted array of the first k elements (with k>j), the j-th element is the (j+1)-th element (if we count from 0). So it is 0 if the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1? Actually, if Z_k >= j+1, then the j-th element is 0? But note: the sorted array: the first Z_k are zeros, so the element at index j is 0 if j < Z_k, and 1 if j >= Z_k.\n\nSo:\n\n  c_j = j * a_j + (number of k from j+1 to n such that Z_k > j)   [because if Z_k > j then the element at j is 0? Actually, if Z_k > j then the j-th element is 0? But note: if Z_k = j+1, then the j-th element is the (j+1)-th element and that would be the last zero? Then the element at j is 0? Actually, the condition is: the element at j is 0 if and only if Z_k > j? \n\nWait: the sorted array: indices 0 to Z_k-1 are zeros. So the element at index j is 0 if j < Z_k, i.e., if Z_k >= j+1? So we can say: the element at j is 0 if Z_k >= j+1, and 1 if Z_k <= j.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  c_j = j * a_j + (number of k from j+1 to n such that Z_k >= j+1)\n\nBut note: Z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nWe can rearrange:\n\n  c_j = j * a_j + (n - j) - (number of k from j+1 to n such that Z_k < j+1)\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to recover A from left to right.\n\nLet d_j = c_j - c_{j-1} (for j>=1) and d0 = c0.\n\nBut the example: \n  A = [1,1,0,1] -> c = [2,4,2,4]\n  d0 = 2\n  d1 = 4-2 = 2\n  d2 = 2-4 = -2\n  d3 = 4-2 = 2\n\nHow to interpret?\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following:\n\n  Consider the entire array C. We know that the last element of A: \n    c_{n-1} = (n-1)*a_{n-1} + (number of k from n to n? none) -> actually k from j+1 to n: when j=n-1, there is no k from n to n? so the second term is 0? \n    So c_{n-1} = (n-1)*a_{n-1} -> so a_{n-1} = 1 if c_{n-1} >= n-1? But note: a_{n-1} is either 0 or 1. \n    Actually: \n        if a_{n-1}=0, then c_{n-1} = (n-1)*0 = 0.\n        if a_{n-1}=1, then c_{n-1} = (n-1)*1 = n-1.\n\nBut the example: last element c3=4, and n-1=3 -> 4 != 0 and 4 != 3 -> so this does not hold.\n\nWait, we must be careful: the index j is 0-indexed. For j = n-1 (the last element), the formula is:\n\n  c_{n-1} = (n-1) * a_{n-1} + [for k from n to n] ... but k from j+1 to n: j+1 = n, so k from n to n: that is one value k=n? \n\nBut k runs from 1 to n. So for j = n-1, k from j+1 to n: that is k from n to n -> k=n.\n\nFor k=n: we sort the entire array. Then the element at j=n-1 is 0 if Z_n >= n? which is impossible because Z_n is the number of zeros and the array has n elements. So if Z_n = n, then the entire array is zeros, so the last element is 0. But then the condition: the element at j=n-1 is 0 if Z_n >= n? which is only if Z_n = n. Otherwise, it is 1.\n\nBut note: the element at j=n-1 in B_n is 0 if the number of zeros in the entire array is at least n? which only happens if the entire array is zeros. Otherwise, it is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n  c_{n-1} = (n-1)*a_{n-1} + (1 if a_{n-1}=1 and the entire array is not all zeros? Actually, no: the term for k=n: the element at j=n-1 is 0 if Z_n >= n, i.e., if the entire array is zeros, then 0; else 1? But note: if the entire array is zeros, then a_{n-1}=0, and then the term for k=n is 0. If the entire array is not zeros, then the element at j=n-1 is 1? \n\nBut wait: if the entire array is zeros, then Z_n = n, so the element at j=n-1 is 0. \nIf the entire array is not zeros, then the element at j=n-1 is 1? But not necessarily: it could be 0 if there are enough zeros? \n\nActually, the element at j=n-1 in B_n is 0 if the number of zeros in the entire array is at least n? which is only when the entire array is zeros. Otherwise, it is 1? Because the sorted array: the last element is 1 if there is at least one 1.\n\nBut note: the entire array is sorted in B_n. So the last element is 1 if there is at least one 1. \n\nTherefore, the term for k=n is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the entire array, and 0 if the entire array is zeros.\n\nBut we have:\n\n  c_{n-1} = (n-1)*a_{n-1} + (1 if the entire array is not all zeros? but note: if the entire array is zeros, then a_{n-1}=0 and the term for k=n is 0. If the entire array has at least one 1, then the term for k=n is 1, and a_{n-1} might be 0 or 1.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe know that the array C is non-decreasing? Not necessarily: the example [2,4,2,4] is not.\n\nBut note: the problem says there is a solution.\n\nAnother idea:\n\nLet F(k) = the array B_k. We know that the array C is the sum of F(1), F(2), ... , F(n).\n\nConsider the difference between consecutive C's? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\nInsight:\n\n  Let Z_k = number of zeros in the first k elements.\n\n  Then the array B_k has the first Z_k elements as 0 and the next k - Z_k as 1, and the rest (from k to n-1) as the original A.\n\n  Therefore, the j-th element of B_k is:\n      if j < Z_k: 0\n      else if j < k: 1   [because j is in the sorted part and j>=Z_k]\n      else: a_j\n\n  But note: the sorted part is only the first k elements. The rest (from k to n-1) are unchanged.\n\n  So for j < k: \n        the j-th element is 0 if j < Z_k, and 1 if j >= Z_k.\n  For j >= k: \n        the j-th element is a_j.\n\nTherefore, the j-th element of C is:\n\n  c_j = [for k=1 to j] (a_j)   +   [for k=j+1 to n] (0 if j < Z_k else 1 if j < k, but note for k>j, j<k is always true, so then it is 0 if j < Z_k, 1 if j >= Z_k) \n\nBut wait, for k>j, the j-th element is in the sorted part? Actually, for k>j, the j-th element is within the first k elements? So it is sorted. Therefore, for k>j, the j-th element is 0 if Z_k > j, and 1 if Z_k <= j.\n\nBut note: Z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. And Z_k is non-decreasing in k? \n\nActually, Z_k is the prefix sum of zeros? So Z_k is non-decreasing.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  c_j = (number of k from 1 to j for which the j-th element is a_j) + (number of k from j+1 to n for which Z_k > j)\n\nBut for k from 1 to j: the j-th element is not sorted? Actually, for k<=j, the j-th element is beyond the sorted part? So it is always a_j. Therefore, the first term is j * a_j.\n\nThe second term: the number of k from j+1 to n such that Z_k > j.\n\nBut note: Z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. And k>=j+1. \n\nLet T = the number of k in the range [j+1, n] such that Z_k > j.\n\nThen: c_j = j * a_j + T.\n\nWe can rearrange: \n  T = c_j - j * a_j.\n\nBut T is the number of k in [j+1, n] with Z_k > j.\n\nNote: Z_k is non-decreasing. So if we know a_j, then we can compute T. But we don't know a_j.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the possibility for a_j:\n\n  If a_j = 0, then T = c_j.\n  If a_j = 1, then T = c_j - j.\n\nBut T must be between 0 and n - j.\n\nSo we can decide a_j by:\n\n  If c_j - j is between 0 and n-j (inclusive), then it is possible that a_j=1? But also we must consider the possibility a_j=0: then T = c_j, which must be between 0 and n-j.\n\nBut note: the problem guarantees that a solution exists.\n\nHow can we compute Z_k? \n\nWe are recovering A from left to right. When we are at index j, we know a_0, a_1, ... , a_{j-1}. Then we can compute Z_j = Z_{j-1} + (1 if a_j==0 then 0? no: Z_j = Z_{j-1} + (1 if a_j==0 else 0))\n\nBut we are at index j, and we need to know Z_k for k>j? Not exactly, but we need to know for future k whether Z_k>j. \n\nBut note: Z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. Since we are recovering from left to right, we don't know the future.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n  We know that T = the number of k in [j+1, n] such that Z_k > j.\n\n  But Z_k is non-decreasing. So the condition Z_k > j is equivalent to: the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1.\n\n  How many zeros are there in the entire array? We don't know. But note: as we move j from 0 to n-1, we can maintain the current number of zeros.\n\n  However, we need to know for future k. \n\nAnother idea:\n\n  Consider the entire array. The value T for j is the number of k>=j+1 such that the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1.\n\n  But note: the number of zeros in the first k elements is at least j+1 if and only if the (j+1)-th zero occurs at or before position k.\n\n  Let F(j) = the position of the (j+1)-th zero (0-indexed). Then the condition Z_k >= j+1 is equivalent to k >= F(j). \n\n  Then T = the number of k in [j+1, n] such that k>=F(j) = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) ? Actually, the number of k from j+1 to n that are >= F(j) is: \n        if F(j) <= j+1, then all n - j values of k (from j+1 to n) satisfy the condition -> T = n - j.\n        if F(j) > n, then T = 0.\n        else, T = n - F(j) + 1? \n\n  But note: k runs from j+1 to n. The condition is k>=F(j). So T = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) if F(j) >= j+1? Actually, if F(j) is in the range [j+1, n], then T = n - F(j) + 1? \n\n  But wait: k from j+1 to n, and k>=F(j). The smallest k that satisfies is F(j) (if F(j)>=j+1). Then the count is n - F(j) + 1? \n\n  Example: n=5, j=1, F(1)=3 (meaning the second zero is at index 3). Then k from 2 to 5: k>=3 -> k=3,4,5 -> count=3 = 5-3+1? -> 3.\n\n  So T = max(0, n - F(j) + 1) if F(j) >= j+1, and if F(j) < j+1, then T = n - j? But if F(j) < j+1, then the (j+1)-th zero occurs at a position < j+1, which is impossible because we only have j+1 zeros and the last one is at F(j) which is at most j. Then for any k>=j+1, we have at least j+1 zeros? So T = n - j.\n\n  Therefore, T = \n        if F(j) <= j: then n - j   [because then for every k>=j+1, we have Z_k>=j+1]\n        else: n - F(j) + 1   [if F(j) is between j+1 and n]\n        and if F(j) is infinity (meaning there is no (j+1)-th zero) then T=0.\n\nBut we don't know F(j) until we know the positions of zeros.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy method:\n\n  We know that the array C is given. We want to recover A.\n\n  We also know that the value of c_0 = 0 * a0 + (number of k from 1 to n such that Z_k >= 1) \n        = (number of k from 1 to n such that the first k elements contain at least one zero)\n\n  But note: k from 1 to n: for k=1, we have Z_1 = 1 if a0=0, or 0 if a0=1. \n        So if a0=0, then for every k>=1, Z_k>=1 -> so c0 = n.\n        if a0=1, then for k=1, Z_1=0 -> then for k>=2, we have Z_k>=1 only if there is at least one zero in the first k elements (which might happen later). But we don't know.\n\n  But we can use the formula: \n        c0 = n - (number of k from 1 to n such that Z_k = 0) \n        = n - (number of k from 1 to n such that the first k elements have no zero)\n\n  The first k elements have no zero if and only if the first k elements are all ones. And since the array is binary, the first k elements are all ones for k from 1 to the first zero. \n\n  Let t0 = the index of the first zero (if any), then for k=1 to t0-1, the first k elements are all ones. For k>=t0, there is at least one zero.\n\n  So c0 = n - (t0 - 1)   [if there is a zero at index t0 (0-indexed), then for k=1 to t0-1: no zero, so that's t0-1 values; for k>=t0: at least one zero]\n\n  But if there is no zero at all, then t0 = infinity, and c0 = n - n = 0.\n\n  But we don't know t0.\n\n  However, we can recover a0:\n\n        if c0 = n, then a0 must be 0? \n        if c0 < n, then a0 must be 1? \n\n  Why? \n        If a0=0, then for k=1, we have Z_1=1, so for k=1: condition holds. And for every k>=1, we have at least one zero (at a0). So c0 = n.\n        If a0=1, then for k=1: Z_1=0 -> does not hold. For k>=2: it may or may not hold. But c0 = n - (number of k from 1 to n with no zero in the first k). The number of such k is the length of the prefix of ones. Let the prefix of ones has length L (including a0). Then the number of k from 1 to n with no zero in the first k is L (because for k=1 to L, the first k are all ones). So c0 = n - L.\n\n        But L is at least 1. And we don't know L yet.\n\n  So from a0=1, we have c0 = n - L, so L = n - c0.\n\n  But L is the length of the prefix of ones starting at a0. So the first L = n - c0 elements are ones. Then at index L (0-indexed, so the L-th element) we have the first zero.\n\n  Therefore, we can recover the entire prefix of ones of length L = n - c0.\n\n  Then for indices from 0 to L-1: a_i = 1.\n  Then for the index L: a_L = 0.\n\n  Then we can move to index L.\n\n  But what about the next? \n\n  Let's try with the example: \n        n=4, c=[2,4,2,4]\n        j=0: c0=2. \n        If we assume a0=0, then c0 should be n=4 -> but 2!=4, so a0 must be 1.\n        Then L = n - c0 = 4-2 = 2.\n        So the first 2 elements are ones: a0=1, a1=1.\n        Then a2=0 (the first zero at index2).\n\n        Now for j=2: we are at the first zero. \n        How to recover a2 and beyond?\n\n  We then consider c2=2.\n\n  The formula for j=2: \n        c2 = 2 * a2 + T, where T = number of k from 3 to 4 such that Z_k > 2.\n\n  But a2=0, so c2 = 0 + T = 2 -> T=2.\n\n  What is T? T = number of k in {3,4} such that Z_k > 2.\n\n  Z_k: the number of zeros in the first k elements.\n        k=3: the first 3 elements: [1,1,0] -> Z_3=1 -> not >2.\n        k=4: the first 4 elements: [1,1,0,?] -> we haven't set a3 yet.\n\n  But we are at j=2, and we are setting a2=0. We haven't set a3.\n\n  This approach only recovers the first zero and the ones before it.\n\n  We need to recover the entire array.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        We know the entire array has to have a certain number of zeros. Let total_zeros = Z_n.\n\n  But we don't know Z_n.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a segment tree or Fenwick tree to count the number of zeros up to k? But the problem has constraints and we are to do in O(n).\n\n  Another idea from known solutions to this problem:\n\n        We can use a stack or a greedy from right to left? \n\n  Known solution in C++ for this problem:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        void solve() {\n            int n;\n            cin >> n;\n            vector<long long> c(n);\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                cin >> c[i];\n            }\n            vector<int> ans;\n            int one = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                if (ans.size() <= 0) {\n                    if (c[i] == 0) {\n                        ans.push_back(0);\n                    } else {\n                        ans.push_back(1);\n                        one = 1;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    if (c[i] == 0) {\n                        ans.push_back(0);\n                    } else if (c[i] >= one + (int)ans.size() + 1) {\n                        ans.push_back(1);\n                        one++;\n                    } else {\n                        ans.push_back(0);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                cout << ans[i] << \" \";\n            }\n            cout << '\\n';\n        }\n        int main() {\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                solve();\n            }\n        }\n\n  But this doesn't match the example.\n\n  Another known solution:\n\n        #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n        using namespace std;\n        int main() {\n            ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n            cin.tie(NULL);\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            while (t--) {\n                int n;\n                cin >> n;\n                vector<long long> c(n);\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    cin >> c[i];\n                }\n                vector<int> a(n);\n                // How to compute a?\n                // Let's try: \n                //   We know that the first element: \n                //        c0 = 0 * a0 + (# of k>=1 such that the sorted part in B_k has at least 1 zero at position 0) \n                //   But if a0=0, then for every k>=1, the sorted part will have at least one zero (at index0) so c0 = n.\n                //   If a0=1, then for k=1: the sorted part has no zero at index0, for k>=2: it might have if there is a zero in the first k elements.\n                //   But we can use: \n                //        Let d = [0] * (n+1)\n                //        d[0] = n - c0   // the number of ones in the prefix until the first zero?

\n\n  In the example, s[0]=0, s[1]=1, s[2]=3, s[3]=3, s[4]=7.\n\n  Explanation for s[i]: \n        s[i] is the sum of (index+1) for every index j in [0, i-1] where a[j] is 1.\n\n  Why is this correct?\n\n  Recall the formula for c_i: \n        c_i = i * a_i + T, where T = number of k in [i+1, n] such that Z_k > i.\n\n  But note: the known solution uses a completely different approach.\n\n  Alternatively, we can derive:\n\n  Consider the difference between c_i and the next. \n\n  But the known solution works on the example.\n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n        s = [0]*(n+1)\n        a = [0]*n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i==0:\n                a[0] = 1 if c[0] > 0 else 0\n            else:\n                a[i] = 1 if c[i] > s[i] else 0\n            if a[i]==1:\n                s[i+1] = s[i] + (i+1)\n            else:\n                s[i+1] = s[i]\n\n  But the provided code in program2.py is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            c=[*map(int,s.split())]\n            a=[1 if x else 0 for x in c]+[1]\n            for i,x in enumerate(c):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(*a[:-1])\n\n  We need to integrate the known solution into this structure.\n\n  The provided code initializes `a` as [1 if x else 0 for x in c] and then appends 1, so `a` has length n+1.\n\n  Then it does a loop over i,x in enumerate(c), and then prints a[:-1].\n\n  We can do:\n\n        We are not using the initial a (because it is not correct). We should not use that initialization.\n\n  But the problem says: only output the missing code for the TODO.\n\n  We are allowed to change the initialization? The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n  So we must only write the code for the TODO. \n\n  The TODO is inside the loop: for i,x in enumerate(c).\n\n  We also have the array `a` already defined. We are to update `a` in the loop.\n\n  We also need to maintain the array `s`? But the known solution uses a separate array `s` of length n+1.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        We'll maintain a variable `s_val` that is the current s[i] (which is the sum of (index+1) for indices j in [0, i-1] where a[j] is 1).\n\n        But note: in the known solution, s[0]=0.\n\n        Then for i=0 to n-1:\n            if i==0: \n                a[0] = 1 if c[0]>0 else 0\n            else:\n                a[i] = 1 if c[i] > s_val else 0\n            then update: \n                if a[i]==1:\n                    s_val += (i+1)   # because the index is i, and the weight is i+1? \n                # else, s_val remains\n\n        But the known solution uses the index+1 (i+1) for the current i.\n\n  However, the provided code has already initialized `a` to [1 if x else 0 for x in c] + [1]. We are to update `a` in the loop.\n\n  We can do in the TODO:\n\n        We'll maintain s_val outside the loop? But the TODO is inside the loop.\n\n  We can initialize s_val before the loop. But the problem says only to output the TODO block.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a list for s and then in the TODO we can do for i>=0.\n\n  But the provided code does not have s_val defined.\n\n  We must only write the code for the TODO, and we can assume that we can use variables if we define them? But the instructions are to only output the missing code.\n\n  Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n        We'll use a list `s` of length n+1, and we can define it before the loop? But the TODO is inside the loop.\n\n  Since the problem says to only output the TODO block, we must do everything inside the TODO block for each i.\n\n  But then how to maintain state between iterations? \n\n  We can use the last element of `a` (which is a[-1]) to store s_val? But a is of length n+1, and we are to output a[:-1]. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a variable that we initialize before the loop. But the problem says only to output the TODO block.\n\n  We are allowed to add code before the loop? The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n  But the TODO is only the block under the for loop. \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s_val = 0   # we can add this before the loop? but we are only to output the TODO.\n\n  Given the instructions, we must only output the code for the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, we must do the following within the TODO block:\n\n        We can use the first element of `a` to store s_val? But that would destroy a[0].\n\n  Another idea: use the last element of `a` (which is a[-1]) to store s_val. Because a has an extra element at the end (initialized to 1) and we are going to output a[:-1]. \n\n  So we can use a[-1] as our s_val.\n\n  Steps for the TODO block:\n\n        if i==0:\n            # then we set a[0] = 1 if c[0]>0 else 0\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0   # because x is c[0] at i=0\n            # and then update a[-1] (which is our s_val) for the next iteration: \n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1   # because s_val for next index (i=1) should be 1 (since the weight for index0 is 1)\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0   # remains 0\n        else:\n            # x is c[i]\n            # s_val = a[-1] (which is the s_val for the current i, i.e., s[i] in the known solution)\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            # then update a[-1] for the next iteration: \n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] = a[-1] + (i+1)   # add the weight for index i: i+1\n            # else, a[-1] remains\n\n  But note: the known solution for i=0 does not use s[0] (which is 0) to decide a[0]. It uses c[0]>0. And then updates s[1] = s[0] + (0+1) if a[0]==1, else s[0]. \n\n  In our TODO, for i=0, we set a[0] and then update a[-1] to either 1 or 0. Then for i=1, we use a[-1] (which is 1 if a[0]==1, or 0 if a[0]==0) as s_val for i=1.\n\n  This matches: for i=1, s_val = s[1] in the known solution.\n\n  Therefore, the TODO code is:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  But note: the initial a is set to [1 if x else 0 for x in c] + [1]. We are overwriting a[0] and a[i] and a[-1]. That is acceptable.\n\n  Let's test with the example: \n        c = [2,4,2,4] -> n=4\n        initial a = [1,1,1,1,1]   (because 2,4,2,4 are non-zero -> 1, and then append 1)\n\n        i=0, x=2:\n            a[0] = 1 (because 2>0) -> then set a[-1] = 1. Now a = [1,1,1,1,1] -> but we set a[0] to 1 (already 1) and a[-1] to 1 (already 1) -> no change? \n        i=1, x=4:\n            compare 4 > a[-1] (which is 1) -> true, so a[1]=1.\n            then a[-1] = 1 + (1+1) = 3. Now a = [1,1,1,1,3] \n        i=2, x=2:\n            compare 2 > a[-1] (3) -> false, so a[2]=0.\n            then since a[2]=0, we do not update a[-1]. a = [1,1,0,1,3]\n        i=3, x=4:\n            compare 4 > a[-1] (3) -> true, so a[3]=1.\n            then a[-1] = 3 + (3+1) = 7. a = [1,1,0,1,7]\n\n        Then we output a[:-1] = [1,1,0,1] -> correct.\n\n  But what if there is a test case with c[0]=0? \n        i=0: a[0] = 0, and then a[-1] = 0.\n        Then for i=1: \n            if c[1] > 0 -> then a[1]=1, and then a[-1] = 0 + (1+1)=2.\n        ...\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  But note: the initial a has an extra element at the end (index n) that we use as storage for s_val.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Summary:\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is: `answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]`\n\n  For program2.py: the missing code is the block above.\n\n  Now output in JSON format.\n\n  Note: the JSON must be valid. We must escape any quotes if needed, but here we don't have quotes.\n\n  Format: \n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  For program1, the completion is a single line: `answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]`\n\n  For program2, the completion is a block of code. We must format it as a string that can be placed in the JSON.\n\n  We can write:\n\n        program1: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\"\n        program2: a multi-line string.\n\n  We must be careful with newlines and indentation.\n\n  For program2, the code block is:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  We can represent this as a string with newlines.\n\n  But note: the original code in program2.py has an indentation of 4 spaces for the TODO block. We must preserve the same level of indentation? The TODO is inside a for loop and an if condition? \n\n  Actually, the provided code:\n\n        for i,x in enumerate(c):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with the block. The block should be indented by 8 spaces? (since the for loop is 4, and the block inside for is 8). But in the JSON string, we can write the code with the necessary indentation.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without extra indentation? But the code must be runnable.\n\n  We'll write the code block with 8 spaces of indentation for each line.\n\n  But in the JSON string, we can use \\n to separate lines.\n\n  Example for program2:\n\n        \"if i == 0:\\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\\n            if a[0] == 1:\\n                a[-1] = 1\\n            else:\\n                a[-1] = 0\\n        else:\\n            if x > a[-1]:\\n                a[i] = 1\\n            else:\\n                a[i] = 0\\n            if a[i] == 1:\\n                a[-1] += i+1\"\n\n  But this is hard to read. Alternatively, we can use triple quotes in the JSON? But the specification says to output a string.\n\n  We'll do it with \\n and with the same level of indentation as in the program.\n\n  The original TODO is at an indentation level of 4 (from the for) and then 4 more for the block? Actually, the for loop is at 4, and the TODO comment is at 8. So the block should be at 8.\n\n  We'll write each line of the block with 8 spaces at the beginning? But the entire program is provided with a specific indentation. We must match.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must output runnable code.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n        Line1: 8 spaces: \"        if i == 0:\"\n        Line2: 12 spaces: \"            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\"\n        etc.\n\n  But the initial code in program2.py has:\n\n        for i,x in enumerate(c):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO comment with:\n\n        if i == 0:\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\n            if a[0] == 1:\n                a[-1] = 1\n            else:\n                a[-1] = 0\n        else:\n            if x > a[-1]:\n                a[i] = 1\n            else:\n                a[i] = 0\n            if a[i] == 1:\n                a[-1] += i+1\n\n  And the indentation: \n        The entire block is at the same level as the TODO comment, which is 8 spaces (one level of 4 and then the for block adds 4 more).\n\n  In the JSON string, we can write:\n\n        \"        if i == 0:\\n            a[0] = 1 if x > 0 else 0\\n            if a[0] == 1:\\n                a[-1] = 1\\n            else:\\n                a[-1] = 0\\n        else:\\n            if x > a[-1]:\\n                a[i] = 1\\n            else:\\n                a[i] = 0\\n            if a[i] == 1:\\n                a[-1] += i+1\"\n\n  But note: the initial a[0] assignment: we are setting a[0] to either 0 or 1. The initial a[0] was set to 1 if c[0] is non-zero. But we are overwriting it. That is correct.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Let's output the JSON."
