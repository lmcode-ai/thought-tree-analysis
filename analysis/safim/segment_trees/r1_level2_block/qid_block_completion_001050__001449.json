Actually, yes: a bad key at j (j<l) will halve the entire segment [l, r] (because j<l<=r). So the entire segment [l, r] is halved by every bad key that occurs at j<l and also by the bad keys that occur at j in [l, r]. Therefore, the value of the segment [l, r] is:\n\n            s = (sum_{k=l}^{r} a_k) / (2^{b_{l-1} + c}) [but note: the bad keys that occur at j<l are b_{l-1} (the total bad keys in [0, l-1]), and the bad keys that occur in [l, r] are c. Then the total halvings for each chest k in [l, r] is b_{l-1} + (number of bad keys in [l, k]). But note: the bad keys in [l, k] only affect chests from their position to the end. So the chest at l is halved by the bad keys at j<l and also by the bad keys at j in [l, l] (if any), the chest at l+1 is halved by bad keys at j<l and j in [l, l+1], etc. Therefore, the value of the chest at k is: a_k / (2^{b_{l-1} + c_{k}}), where c_{k} is the number of bad keys in [l, k].

But that is not sufficient because the positions matter. Another known solution: \n\n        We can use a state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for the prefix ending at i, and j is the number of bad keys that have been used in the current segment, but we cap j at 30. Then the value of the current segment (if we end it at i) is determined by the sum of the current segment, which is the sum of the chests in the segment, each chest k in the segment is halved by the number of bad keys that occur from k to i (within the segment) and also by the bad keys that occurred before the segment (which have already reduced the chests to 0 if the segment is long enough). Specifically, if the current segment has length L and we have used j bad keys in the current segment, then the chest at position i-L+1 (the start) has been halved by the bad keys that occurred from the start to i. But the bad keys that occurred before the segment have already reduced it to 0 if the segment is long enough (>=31), so only the last 31 chests might be non-zero. Therefore, we can try to have the state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for the prefix ending at i, and the current segment has not been closed, and j is the number of bad keys used in the current segment (capped at 30). But then how do we close the segment?",

Then chest2: a2=-3 -> has been halved twice: -3/4 = -0.75 -> floor is -1. good key: -1-5 = -6, bad key: floor(-1/2) = -1 -> choose bad key: -1. Total = 0+0-1 = -1. But the optimal is 1.",

Then for i=n-1, we only compute j in [0,29]. j=30 is not computed and remains 0. For i=n-2, we use d[i+1][30] which is 0. But for a chest i, if j=30, we should compute it. We should change the inner loop to j in range(ndivs) and use next_j = min(j+1, ndivs-1). However, the provided code has:\n\n            for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n\n        which is j in [0, 30-1) = [0,29]. To fix, we can do:\n\n            for j in range(ndivs):\n                next_j = j+1\n                if next_j >= ndivs:\n                    next_j = ndivs-1\n                # then the recurrence\n\n        But the provided code only has a loop for j in range(ndivs-1). Since the total n over test cases is 10^5, and ndivs=31, we can do 31*n which is 3.1e6 per test case, and the total n is 10^5, so total states 10^5 * 31 = 3.1e6, which is acceptable. Therefore, we will change the loop to j in range(ndivs) and use next_j = min(j+1, ndivs-1). But the provided code in the problem is:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n                    d[i][j] = max((a[i] >> j) + d[i + 1][j] - k, (a[i] >> (j + 1)) + d[i + 1][j + 1]) We need to also do for j=ndivs-1? For j=ndivs-1 (30), we do:\n\n            option1 = (a[i] >> 30) - k + d[i+1][30]\n            option2 = (a[i] >> 31) + d[i+1][31]   # but d has only 31 columns, index 0..30, so d[i+1][31] is out of bounds. So we should change the recurrence for j=ndivs-1 to use d[i+1][ndivs-1] for the bad key option. We can do:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs):\n                    # For the bad key option: next state is min(j+1, ndivs-1)\n                    next_j = j+1\n                    if next_j >= ndivs:\n                        next_j = ndivs-1\n                    option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k\n                    option1 += d[i+1][j]\n                    option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + d[i+1][next_j]\n                    d[i][j] = max(option1, option2) But the provided code already has a class Seg that initializes _da and _op to [-INF] * (n*5).

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\n We are guaranteed that the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do an O(n * constant) solution.\n The problem: we have two types of keys. Good key costs k and gives the full value of the chest. Bad key is free but halves (and rounds down) all the remaining chests (including the current one) and also affects future bad keys (since they halve again).\n\n Important: the halving is applied in sequence. If we use a bad key at position i, then the chest i becomes floor(a_i/2), chest i+1 becomes floor(a_i+1/2), ... and then if we use another bad key at i+1, then chest i+1 becomes floor(floor(a_i+1/2)/2) = floor(a_i+1/4), and so on.\n\n However, note that after about 30 halvings, any number becomes 0 (since 2^30 > 1e9). So we can limit the halving steps to about 31.\n\n We are going to use dynamic programming.\n\n Let dp[i][j] = maximum total coins we can get from the first i chests (i.e. we have processed chests 0 to i-1) and we have used j bad keys in a row at the end (so the next chest will be halved j times? Actually, note: the bad keys have a cumulative effect. But note: we are processing from left to right. However, the problem: the bad key at position i affects all chests from i to n. But if we use a bad key at i, then at i+1 we can use another bad key which will halve the already halved chests again.\n\n Actually, we can think: the effect of a bad key at position i is that it will halve the chests i, i+1, ... n. Then if we use a bad key at i+1, it will halve the chests i+1, ... n (which are already halved once). So the chest i+1 is halved twice, chest i+2 is halved twice, etc.\n\n But note: the problem does not require contiguous bad keys? Actually, we can mix. However, once we use a bad key, it affects all the following chests. And if we use a bad key again, it affects the already halved chests.\n\n However, an important observation: the effect of a sequence of keys is that if we use a bad key at position i, then the chest j (j>=i) will be halved (floor division) a number of times equal to the number of bad keys from i to j (inclusive? note: the bad key at j also affects chest j). Actually, the bad key at j will halve the chest j at the moment we open it. But note: if we use a bad key at i, then at j (j>i) the chest j has been halved by the bad key at i, and then if we use a good key at j, we get floor(a_j / 2). If we use a bad key at j, we get floor( floor(a_j/2) / 2 ) = floor(a_j/4). \n\n Actually, the halving is applied in the order of the keys. So if we have a sequence of keys (good or bad) for chests 1 to n, then the value we get for chest j is:\n   a_j divided by (2^(number of bad keys from the first key that affects j to j, inclusive)).\n\n But note: a bad key at position i (i<=j) will affect j. So the number of bad keys from i=1 to j (if we are at j) that have been used? Actually, the bad keys that occur at or before j? But note: after a bad key, all subsequent chests are halved (including j). So if we have a bad key at any position i (with i<=j), then j is halved. And if we have multiple bad keys at i1, i2, ... im (all <= j), then j is halved m times.\n\n Therefore, the value of chest j is: floor( a_j / (2^m) ), where m is the number of bad keys used from the first chest up to and including the chest j? Actually, note: the bad keys that occur after j do not affect j. So m is the number of bad keys in the prefix ending at j.\n\n However, note: the bad key at j also affects j. So m is the total number of bad keys from the start up to j (inclusive).\n\n But here's a catch: if we use a bad key at j, then at the moment we open j, we halve j (and the rest). So the value we get for j is after the halving by the bad key at j. And if we had previous bad keys, then the value of j has already been halved by the previous bad keys? Actually, no: the bad keys are applied in order. The bad key at i (i<j) will halve j at the time of the bad key at i. Then the bad key at j will halve j again. So the total halvings for j is the number of bad keys from i=1 to j.\n\n Therefore, the value of chest j is: floor( a_j / (2^{b_j}) ), where b_j is the number of bad keys in the prefix [1, j] (if we index from 1).\n\n However, note: the problem says that when we use a bad key at chest i, it sets a_i = floor(a_i/2), a_{i+1}=floor(a_{i+1}/2), ... a_n=floor(a_n/2). This operation is done at the time of opening chest i. So if we have two bad keys: at i and j (with i<j), then at time i we set a_j to floor(a_j/2). Then at time j, we set a_j to floor( (floor(a_j/2)) / 2 ) = floor(a_j/4). So indeed, the total halvings for j is the number of bad keys from i=1 to j.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use contiguous bad keys. We can have a good key in between? Then the halvings are only from the bad keys that occur at or before j.\n\n Therefore, we can design a DP that tracks the number of bad keys that have been used so far (from the start until the current chest). However, the state would be the index i and the number of bad keys used so far (which we call j). Since the halving effect becomes 0 after about 60 times (but note a_i up to 1e9, so 31 is enough because 2^30 ~ 1e9), we can let j from 0 to about 31 (or 60? but 31 is safe because 2^31 is 2e9, so after 31 halvings, any number becomes 0).\n\n However, note: the total n can be up to 10^5 per test case, but the total n over test cases is 10^5. So we can do O(n * 32) which is about 3.2e6 per test case? But note: the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total states would be 10^5 * 32 = 3.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5. So we can do:\n\n   dp[i][j] = maximum total coins we can have after processing the first i chests and having used j bad keys in total (which have affected the chests we've processed).\n\n However, note: the bad keys we use in the first i chests are j, so the next chest (i-th chest, 0-indexed) will be halved j times? Actually, we are going to process chest i (0-indexed) and we have used j bad keys so far (so the chest i has been halved j times already). Then we decide to use a good key or a bad key at chest i.\n\n But note: if we use a good key at chest i, then we pay k and we get floor( a_i / (2^j) ) (because the chest i has been halved j times by the previous bad keys). Then the state for the next chest will be: we have j bad keys (unchanged) for the next chest? Actually, no: the next chest (i+1) has been halved j times already (by the previous bad keys) and we did not use a bad key at i, so the halving count for the next chests remains j.\n\n If we use a bad key at chest i, then we get floor( a_i / (2^j) ) / 2? Actually, we get floor( a_i / (2^j) ) and then we halve it again? But note: the bad key operation: we set a_i = floor( a_i / 2 ). But the current a_i has already been halved j times? So the value we get is floor( (a_i / (2^j)) / 2 ) = floor( a_i / (2^(j+1) ). And then we also halve all the remaining chests (so the next chests will be halved j+1 times). So the state for the next chest is j+1.\n\n Therefore, we have:\n\n   dp[i][j] = max( \n        (use good key) -> dp[i+1][j] + (a_i >> j) - k, \n        (use bad key)  -> dp[i+1][j+1] + (a_i >> (j+1)) \n   )\n\n However, note: the cost of the good key is k. And we are allowed to go into debt.\n\n But wait: what about the effect on the next chests? The good key does not change the halving count for the next chests, so the next state remains j. The bad key increases the halving count for the next chests to j+1.\n\n However, note: we are processing from left to right. The state j at step i means that the chest i has been halved j times (by the previous bad keys). Then we make a decision for chest i.\n\n But there is a problem: the halving operations are applied to all unopened chests. So when we use a bad key at i, it also affects chests i+1, i+2, ... n. However, in our state j we are tracking the number of halvings that have been applied to the current chest i. But note: the previous bad keys have already applied to chest i and beyond. So the state j is the number of halvings that have been applied to chest i (and beyond) so far. Then when we use a bad key at i, we are adding one more halving for chests i (which we are about to open) and for chests beyond. So for chest i, we get a_i_halved = a_i >> j, then we halve it again: so we get (a_i >> j) >> 1 = a_i >> (j+1). And then for the next chests, they will have j+1 halvings.\n\n Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n   dp[i][j] = max( \n        (a_i >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j], \n        (a_i >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][j+1]\n   )\n\n But note: we cannot let j go beyond 60? Actually, we can cap j at 60, but note that after about 31 halvings the value becomes 0. However, we can cap at 31 (or 32 to be safe) because for j>=31, a_i>>j is 0 (if a_i <= 10^9). So we can set j in [0, 31] (32 states).\n\n However, note: what if we have more than 31 bad keys? Then the state j=31 is equivalent to j=32, because a_i>>31 = a_i>>32 = 0 for a_i in [0, 10^9]. So we can cap j at 31 (indexed 0..31).\n\n But note: the state j at step i: j can be at most i (if we use all bad keys so far) but i can be up to 10^5. However, we can cap j at 31 because beyond that the value is 0 and remains 0. So we can set:\n\n   j in [0, min(i, 31)]? Actually, we can set j from 0 to 31 (32 states) for every i. For j>31, we can treat it as 31.\n\n However, we can design the state to have j from 0 to 31 (32 states) for every i. Then:\n\n   dp[i][j] = maximum total coins from chest i to the end, given that the chest i has been halved j times (by previous bad keys).\n\n Then:\n\n   dp[i][j] = max( \n        (use good key) -> (a_i >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j], \n        (use bad key)  -> (a_i >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][min(j+1, 31)]\n   )\n\n But note: the state for the next chest: if we use a bad key, then the next chest (i+1) will have been halved j+1 times. However, if j+1>31, we can use min(j+1,31). Since for j>=31, the value is 0, and min(j+1,31)=31.\n\n However, we must note: the state j for the next chest should be j+1 (capped at 31). So we can write:\n\n   j_next = min(j+1, 31)   for bad key.\n\n But what about the base case?\n\n   dp[n][j] = 0   for any j? Actually, after the last chest, there are no more chests.\n\n   However, we have to process the last chest. So:\n\n      For the last chest (i = n-1, 0-indexed), we have:\n\n        dp[n-1][j] = max( \n            (a_{n-1} >> j) - k, \n            (a_{n-1} >> (j+1))\n        )\n\n But note: after the last chest, we don't have a next state.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   dp[i][j] = 0 for i = n (beyond the last chest)\n\n   Then for i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n        option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j]   # good key: we pay k, and the next chest (i+1) is still at j halvings\n        option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][min(j+1, 31)]   # bad key: we don't pay, but the next chest (i+1) will be at min(j+1,31) halvings\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(option1, option2)\n\n Then the answer for the test case is dp[0][0] (starting at chest0 with 0 halvings so far).\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5. But if we do a DP for each test case with n up to 10^5 and 32 states, that would be 3.2e6 per test case. But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total states we process is 10^5 * 32 = 3.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases does not exceed 10^5. So we can do:\n\n   for each test case:\n        n = ... \n        a = ... \n        dp = array of size (n+1) * 32   (we can do [n+1][32])\n\n        for i from n-1 down to 0:\n            for j from 0 to 31:\n                option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j]\n                option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][min(j+1,31)]\n                dp[i][j] = max(option1, option2)\n\n        print(dp[0][0])\n\n However, note: the array a has n elements, and we are using a[i] for the i-th chest (0-indexed). \n\n But wait: what if j is 31? Then a[i]>>j and a[i]>>(j+1) are both 0? So we can do:\n\n        option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j]   if j < 32, but we cap j at 31 so j in [0,31]\n        option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][min(j+1,31)]\n\n However, if j=31, then j+1=32, and we use min(32,31)=31. Then a[i]>>31 and a[i]>>32: both are 0 for a[i] up to 10^9.\n\n But note: what if a[i] is 2^35? Then we need more than 31? But the input says a[i] in [0,10^9] and 10^9 < 2^30, so 2^30 is about 1e9. So 31 is safe.\n\n However, note: the halving is integer division (floor). So for negative numbers? But the problem says a_i can be negative? The problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).\"\n\n But the halving of negative numbers: the problem says \"floor\", so floor(-3/2) = -2? Actually, in Python, floor division for negative: \n        -3 // 2 = -2? Actually, in Python: \n            -3 // 2 = -2   (because it rounds towards -infinity)\n\n However, the problem says \"floor\", so we are doing floor division. But note: the problem says \"halve\" and then floor. So for negative numbers, we do floor(negative number / 2). \n\n But the bit-shift for negative numbers? In Python, the right shift for negative numbers is implementation-defined? Actually, in many languages, right shift for negative numbers is arithmetic shift (which preserves the sign). But note: the problem uses floor division. \n\n However, the problem does not specify the behavior for negative numbers in bit-shift. We must use integer floor division by powers of two.\n\n Important: we cannot use bit-shift for negative numbers because it is not the same as floor division by 2. For example: \n        -3 >> 1 = -2? In Python: \n            -3 >> 1 = -2   (because it's an arithmetic shift: it preserves the sign, so it rounds towards negative infinity? Actually, it is the same as floor division for negative numbers? Let me check: \n            floor(-3/2) = -2, and -3>>1 = -2? \n\n        But note: \n            -1 >> 1 = -1? \n            floor(-1/2) = -1? Actually, floor(-0.5) = -1? \n\n        So: \n            floor(x/2) = (x >> 1) for nonnegative x? \n            but for negative x: \n                x = -1: -1//2 = -1, and -1>>1 = -1 -> same.\n                x = -2: -2//2 = -1, -2>>1 = -1 -> same.\n                x = -3: -3//2 = -2, -3>>1 = -2 -> same.\n\n        Actually, for integers, the floor division by 2 is equivalent to a right shift for nonnegative numbers? And for negative numbers, in two's complement, the arithmetic right shift does the same as floor division by 2? \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"floor\", and in Python, the right shift for negative integers does floor division? \n\n        But let me test: \n            for x in [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n                print(x, x>>1, x//2)\n\n            -5: -3 and -3? \n            -4: -2 and -2\n            -3: -2 and -2\n            -2: -1 and -1\n            -1: -1 and -1\n            0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:1, 4:2, 5:2.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can use bit-shift for negative numbers? But note: the problem says the numbers can be negative. However, the problem also says that the halving rounds down. And the bit-shift for negative integers in Python does the same as floor division by 2.\n\n        But caution: the problem says \"floor\", and the bit-shift for negative integers in Python is defined as floor division? Actually, the Python documentation says: \n            \"The shift operations have lower priority than the arithmetic operations: ... The result of bitwise operations on integers is calculated as though done in two\u2019s complement with an infinite number of sign bits. For the shift operators, shifting by a negative number or by more than the bit length of the integer is not allowed.\"\n\n        And the arithmetic shift for negative numbers in two's complement (with infinite sign bits) is equivalent to floor division by 2.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints: a_i in [-10^9, 10^9]. The bit-shift for numbers in this range is well-defined in Python? Yes, because Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the shift amount is at most 31, which is safe.\n\n        But note: for negative numbers, the shift might be different? Actually, we saw that it matches.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the problem says \"halve\", and then floor. The operation: \n            x = -3\n            x // 2 = -2   (which is floor(-1.5) = -2)\n\n        And -3 >> 1 = -2.\n\n        So we can use bit-shift.\n\n But wait: what if we have a_i = -1? Then if we use a bad key, we get -1>>1 = -1. Then if we use another bad key, we get -1 again? Actually, no: if we have two bad keys, then the first bad key gives -1 (from -1) and then the second bad key gives -1 again? But note: the value we get from the chest when we open it is the value at the time of opening. So if we have two bad keys, then the chest is halved twice: \n        first bad key: sets the chest to -1 (from -1: floor(-1/2) = -1)\n        then the second bad key: sets the chest to floor(-1/2) = -1.\n\n        But actually, the chest is opened at the second bad key? Then we get -1.\n\n        However, if we open the chest with a good key at the second key, we get -1 (because it was halved once by the first bad key). \n\n        But note: the state j: at the second chest, the chest has been halved once (by the first bad key). Then we use a good key: we get -1 and pay k. \n\n        Alternatively, we use a bad key: we get -1 (without paying k). \n\n        So the bad key is better? \n\n        But note: the problem says the value of a subarray (which is the chest) is:\n            (length) if positive, 0 if zero, -(length) if negative.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the value of a subarray [l, r] is:\n            (r-l+1) if the sum s>0, \n            0 if s=0,\n            -(r-l+1) if s<0.\n\n        But note: each chest is a subarray of length 1. So the value for a chest with value x is:\n            1 if x>0, 0 if x==0, -1 if x<0.\n\n        Therefore, for a_i = -1, we get -1 regardless of the key? \n\n        Actually, no: the value we get from the chest is the value at the time of opening. So if we open the chest with a good key, we get the current value of the chest (which has been halved j times) and then we assign the value: \n            if the current value >0 -> 1\n            if =0 -> 0\n            if <0 -> -1.\n\n        Similarly, if we open with a bad key, we get the value after halving again? But note: the bad key operation: we set the chest to floor(current_value/2) and then we open it. So we get the value of the chest at the time of opening.\n\n        Therefore, the value we get for a chest is: \n            sign = 1 if the value at opening >0, -1 if <0, 0 if 0.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not say that. It says the value of the subarray is the length (if positive) or negative length (if negative) or 0. And the subarray is the entire segment we are opening. Since we are opening one chest, the length is 1. So the value is 1 if the value at opening is positive, -1 if negative, 0 if zero.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot use the bit-shift to compute the value? Because the value we get is not the halved value, but the sign of the halved value multiplied by the length? \n\n        Let me re-read: \n            \"The value of a subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r is: (r-l+1) if s>0, 0 if s=0, -(r-l+1) if s<0.\"\n\n        And s = a_l + ... + a_r.\n\n        So for a single chest: s = a_i (the value at the time of opening). Then the value is:\n            1 if a_i>0, 0 if a_i==0, -1 if a_i<0.\n\n        Therefore, we are not adding the halved value, but we are adding either 1, 0, or -1? \n\n        This changes everything.\n\n        Example: \n            Test case 1: [1,2,-3] \n            They partitioned as [1,2] and [-3]. \n            For [1,2]: s=3>0 -> value=2 (length=2)\n            For [-3]: s=-3<0 -> value=-1 (length=1)\n\n            So they added 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\n        But if we had taken [1,2,-3] as one segment: \n            s=0 -> value=0.\n\n        So the value of a segment is not the sum of the halved values? It is the length (or negative length) based on the sign of the sum.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is: we partition the array. For each segment, we get:\n            length(segment) if the sum of the segment (at the time of opening) is positive, \n            -length(segment) if negative, \n            0 if zero.\n\n        How do the keys affect the segments? \n\n        The keys are applied at the moment of opening a chest. The bad key at chest i does two things:\n            - it sets the value of chest i to floor(a_i/2) (and then we use that value to compute the segment that ends at i? or the segment that starts at i? Actually, the segment that contains i: the bad key is used when we open the chest i, so the segment that ends at i must be opened at i. \n\n        And note: the segment that we open at chest i might be a segment that starts at some l and ends at i. But the problem says: we open the chests in order. So the segments are contiguous and we open from left to right. Therefore, the segment boundaries are set at the time of partition. \n\n        The key used at chest i affects the value of the chest i and all the chests from i to n. But note: the segment that ends at i: the chest i is the last chest of the segment. The bad key at i will halve the chest i (so the value of chest i in the segment is halved) and also halve the chests beyond i (which are not in the segment that ends at i). \n\n        However, the segment that ends at i is already opened? Then the chests beyond i are not opened yet. The bad key at i will halve the chests beyond i (which are in future segments). \n\n        Therefore, the value of the segment that ends at i is computed from the values of the chests in the segment at the time of opening. How are the values of the chests in the segment affected? \n\n        The chests in the segment [l, i] have been halved by every bad key that occurred at or before i? Specifically, by every bad key that occurred at positions from l to i? Actually, no: the bad keys that occur at positions j (for j in [l, i]) will halve the chests from j to n. So the chests in [l, i] are halved by the bad keys that occur at positions j in [l, i]. \n\n        But note: the bad keys that occur at positions j < l? They also halve the chests from j to n, so they halve the chests in [l, i] as well. \n\n        Therefore, the value of a chest at position k is halved by every bad key that occurs at a position j <= k. \n\n        So the value of the chest k at the time of opening (which is at the last chest of the segment that contains k) is: \n            a_k_halved = a_k / (2^{b_k})   (floor division), where b_k is the number of bad keys that occur at positions j<=k.\n\n        Then the sum of the segment [l, r] is: \n            s = sum_{k=l}^{r} (a_k_halved) = sum_{k=l}^{r} (a_k / (2^{b_k}))\n\n        And the value we get for the segment is:\n            (r-l+1) if s>0, \n            0 if s=0, \n            -(r-l+1) if s<0.\n\n        This is a completely different problem.\n\n        How to solve it? \n\n        We are allowed to choose the partition arbitrarily (any contiguous segments) and the keys arbitrarily (at each chest we choose good or bad) as long as we open in order. \n\n        The effect of a bad key is global: it affects all chests from that position to the end. \n\n        The state: we need to know the positions of the bad keys so far? and the current segment? \n\n        But note: the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the state space for the positions of bad keys is exponential.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n\n        We note that the effect of a bad key is to halve the entire suffix. And the value of a segment [l, r] is determined by the sum of the a_k in the segment, each a_k being divided by 2^(number of bad keys that occurred at or before k). \n\n        The problem: we want to maximize the total value.\n\n        The value of a segment is either the length, negative length, or zero. So the value is bounded by the length. The length is at most n, and the total value is at most n (if we get all segments positive) or at least -n.\n\n        How to design a DP? \n\n        Let dp[i] = maximum total value we can get from the prefix ending at i (i.e., we have processed chests 0 to i-1) and we are about to start a new segment at i.\n\n        But we also need to know the effect of bad keys that have been used so far? The bad keys that have been used so far will affect the chests from the position of the bad key to i-1? and beyond. But note: we are starting a new segment at i. The bad keys that have been used so far also affect the chests from i to the end. \n\n        However, the value of a segment [l, r] depends on the bad keys that occur at positions from l to r. And also the bad keys that occur at positions before l? They also affect the chests in [l, r]? \n\n        Actually, yes: a bad key at j (j<l) will halve the entire segment [l, r] (because j<l<=r). So the entire segment [l, r] is halved by every bad key that occurs at j<l and also by the bad keys that occur at j in [l, r]. \n\n        Therefore, the value of the segment [l, r] is:\n\n            s = (sum_{k=l}^{r} a_k) / (2^{b_{l-1} + c})   [but note: the bad keys that occur at j<l are b_{l-1} (the total bad keys in [0, l-1]), and the bad keys that occur in [l, r] are c. Then the total halvings for each chest k in [l, r] is b_{l-1} + (number of bad keys in [l, k]). \n\n        But note: the bad keys in [l, k] only affect chests from their position to the end. So the chest at l is halved by the bad keys at j<l and also by the bad keys at j in [l, l] (if any), the chest at l+1 is halved by bad keys at j<l and j in [l, l+1], etc.\n\n        Therefore, the value of the chest at k is: a_k / (2^{b_{l-1} + c_{k}}), where c_{k} is the number of bad keys in [l, k]. \n\n        This is very complex.\n\n        Insight: \n\n        We are allowed to choose the partition and the keys arbitrarily. The problem is difficult.\n\n        However, note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 10^5. And the effect of more than 30 bad keys is negligible (because the values become 0). \n\n        We can try a greedy? or a state that tracks the number of bad keys that have been used so far (from the beginning) and the start of the current segment.\n\n        But the state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum total value we can get from the prefix ending at i (i.e., we have processed up to i) and we have used j bad keys so far (from 0 to i), and we are not in the middle of a segment? Actually, we need to know the start of the current segment? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: we are going to open chests one by one. At each chest, we can choose to end a segment or not? But also choose the key.\n\n        Actually, the problem: at each chest, we choose the key and also we can choose to end a segment at this chest? But note: the partition is contiguous and we open in order. We must open chest i immediately after chest i-1. We can only end a segment at chest i if we start a new segment at i+1. \n\n        The keys are chosen at the time of opening the chest. And the key choice affects the future.\n\n        We can design a state:\n\n            dp[i][j] = maximum total value for the prefix ending at i (chest0 to chest i-1) and the current segment started at some l (which we haven't closed yet) and we have used j bad keys so far (from 0 to i). \n\n        But then when we close the segment at i-1, we need to compute the value of the segment [l, i-1]. To compute the sum of the segment, we would need to know the halvings for each chest in the segment. The halvings for a chest k: j_k = (number of bad keys from 0 to k) ??? But note: the bad keys that occur after k but before the end of the segment also affect the chest k? \n\n        Actually, no: the bad key at position j (<= i-1) will affect chest k (if k>=j). So the value of chest k is a_k / (2^{b_k}), where b_k is the total number of bad keys from 0 to k. \n\n        But wait: the segment [l, i-1]: the value of chest k in this segment is a_k / (2^{b_k})? \n\n        However, note: the bad keys that occur after i-1 do not affect the segment [l, i-1] because they happen after. \n\n        Therefore, the sum of the segment [l, i-1] is: \n            s = sum_{k=l}^{i-1} (a_k / (2^{b_k}))\n\n        Then the value of the segment is:\n            (len) if s>0, \n            0 if s==0, \n            (-len) if s<0.\n\n        And len = i - l.\n\n        But note: the bad keys that occur after i-1 do not affect this segment. \n\n        However, the state j in dp[i][j] is the total number of bad keys used in the prefix [0, i-1]. But we need to know the exact sequence to compute b_k for each k? \n\n        We only have j = total bad keys, but not the distribution. \n\n        Therefore, we must know the number of bad keys that have occurred up to each chest? That is exponential.\n\n        Alternative approach from known solutions: \n\n        We note that the effect of a bad key is to halve the entire suffix. And the value of a segment is only affected by the bad keys that occur at or before the end of the segment. \n\n        Also, the value of a segment is either the length, negative length, or 0. This is not linear in the sum. \n\n        Known solution in C++ for the same problem (from a contest) often use a greedy or a DP that goes from left to right and uses the fact that the effect of bad keys is limited to 30-40 steps.\n\n        Insight: \n\n        We can try to use a state that includes the number of bad keys that have been used in the current segment? But then the segment boundaries are not fixed.\n\n        Another known solution: \n\n        We can use a state: \n            dp[i] = best value for prefix i, and then we try to start a new segment at i.\n\n        But then we need to simulate the future bad keys? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for prefix i (chests 0 to i-1) and j is the number of bad keys that have been used in the current segment? But then the current segment has not been closed. \n\n        When we close the segment at i-1, we compute the sum of the current segment [l, i-1] (where l is the start of the segment) and then the value. But we don't know l? \n\n        We can let the state include the start of the segment? That would be O(n^2).\n\n        Given the constraints (total n<=10^5) but the total over test cases is 10^5, we cannot do O(n^2).\n\n        We must use the limited halving effect.\n\n        After about 30 halvings, the values become 0. So the effect of a bad key beyond 30 steps in the past is negligible. \n\n        Therefore, the value of a chest i is only affected by the bad keys in the last 30 chests? \n\n        Specifically, the bad keys that occur at positions >= i-30? Because if a bad key occurs at position i-31, then the chest i is halved 31 times -> becomes 0. \n\n        So we can design a DP that goes from left to right and only remembers the last 30 (or 31) bad key decisions. \n\n        Let's define:\n\n            dp[i][j] = maximum total value for the prefix ending at i, where j is the number of bad keys that have been used in the last 30 chests? \n\n        But note: the bad keys that occur before i-30 have made the chest i become 0, so they don't affect the sum. \n\n        However, the value of a segment might depend on chests that are more than 30 steps away? For example, if we have a segment that starts at l and ends at r, and l is more than 30 steps away from r, then the chests in [l, r-30] are all 0? \n\n        Therefore, the sum of the segment [l, r] is essentially the sum of the last min(30, segment_length) chests in the segment. \n\n        So we can try to simulate the last 30 chests in the current segment. \n\n        State: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for the prefix ending at i, and j is a bitmask or a number representing the sequence of bad keys in the last min(i, 30) chests? \n\n        But j can be up to 2^30 which is 1e9, too much.\n\n        Alternatively, we can let j be the number of bad keys in the last 30 chests? But that is not sufficient because the positions matter.\n\n        Another known solution: \n\n        We can use a state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for the prefix ending at i, and j is the number of bad keys that have been used in the current segment, but we cap j at 30. \n\n        Then the value of the current segment (if we end it at i) is determined by the sum of the current segment, which is the sum of the chests in the segment, each chest k in the segment is halved by the number of bad keys that occur from k to i (within the segment) and also by the bad keys that occurred before the segment (which have already reduced the chests to 0 if the segment is long enough).\n\n        Specifically, if the current segment has length L and we have used j bad keys in the current segment, then the chest at position i-L+1 (the start) has been halved by the bad keys that occurred from the start to i. But the bad keys that occurred before the segment have already reduced it to 0 if the segment is long enough (>=31), so only the last 31 chests might be non-zero.\n\n        Therefore, we can try to have the state: \n            dp[i][j] = maximum value for the prefix ending at i, and the current segment has not been closed, and j is the number of bad keys used in the current segment (capped at 30). \n\n        But then how do we close the segment? We would need to know the start of the segment? \n\n        Alternatively, we can try to extend the segment one by one. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp[i][j] = best value for prefix i, and the current segment has not been closed, and in the current segment we have used j bad keys (0<=j<=30), and the current segment has a \"window\" of the last min(L, 31) chests (because the ones beyond the last 31 are 0).\n\n        But then we would need to store the values of the last min(L,31) chests? That is 31 numbers, and then the state would be too heavy.\n\n        Known solution in C++ for this problem (from a Codeforces submission) is as follows:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            typedef long long ll;\n            const int N = 100000;\n            const int B = 30;\n            ll dp[N+1][B+1];\n\n            int main() {\n                ios::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n, k;\n                    cin >> n >> k;\n                    vector<int> a(n);\n                    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                    }\n                    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                        for (int j=0; j<=B; j++) {\n                            dp[i][j] = -1'000'000'000'000'000;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    dp[0][0] = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                        for (int j=0; j<=B; j++) {\n                            if (dp[i][j] == -1'000'000'000'000'000) continue;\n                            // option 1: good key at i\n                            int nj = j;\n                            // good key: we close the segment at i?

\n\n                We did:\n\n                    dp[3][0] = 0\n                    dp[3][1] = -5\n                    dp[3][2] = -5\n\n                For i=3 (chest4, value=1), state j=0: \n                    option1: good key: 1 - 5 + dp[4][0] = 1-5+0 = -4 -> but we got 0 in the calculation?

\n                    but wait, in state j=1, the value of the chest is 1>>1 = 0, then if we use a bad key, we get 0>>1 = 0.\n                    so option2: 0.\n\n                    dp[3][1] = max(-5,0) = 0.\n\n                For state j=2 at i=3:\n                    option1: (1>>2)-5 = 0-5 = -5.\n                    option2: (1>>3)=0.\n                    dp[3][2] = max(-5,0) = 0.\n\n                Then for i=2 (chest3, value=3):\n                    state j=0:\n                        option1: 3-5 + dp[3][0] = 3-5+0 = -2.\n                        option2: 3>>1 = 1 + dp[3][1] = 1+0 = 1.\n                        dp[2][0] = max(-2,1) = 1.\n                    state j=1:\n                        option1: (3>>1)-5 + dp[3][1] = 1-5+0 = -4.\n                        option2: (3>>2)=0 + dp[3][2]=0.\n                        dp[2][1] = max(-4,0)=0.\n                    state j=2: (not needed in this path)\n\n                i=1 (chest2, value=10):\n                    state j=0:\n                        option1: 10-5 + dp[2][0] = 5+1=6.\n                        option2: 10>>1=5 + dp[2][1]=5+0=5.\n                        dp[1][0]=6.\n                    state j=1:\n                        option1: (10>>1)-5 + dp[2][1] = 5-5+0=0.\n                        option2: 10>>2=2 + dp[2][2] (which we haven't computed, but for j=2 at i=2: \n                            i=2, j=2: \n                                option1: (3>>2)-5 + dp[3][2] = 0-5+0 = -5.\n                                option2: (3>>3)=0 + dp[3][3] (which is 0) =0.\n                                so dp[2][2]=0.\n                        then option2: 2+0=2.\n                        dp[1][1]=max(0,2)=2.\n\n                i=0 (chest1, value=10):\n                    state j=0:\n                        option1: 10-5 + dp[1][0] = 5+6=11.\n                        option2: 10>>1=5 + dp[1][1]=5+2=7.\n                        dp[0][0]=11.\n\n                So we get 11.\n\n            Therefore, the first approach (adding the halved value) is correct for the sample.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The problem says: the value of a segment is the length if the sum is positive, etc. \n\n        But in the sample solution, they are not forming segments of length>1. They are forming segments of length1. \n\n        How do they handle segments of length>1? \n\n        The state j is the number of bad keys that have been used so far (from the beginning) that affect the chest i. \n\n        When we use a good key, we are essentially ending a segment at i (of length1) and then starting a new segment at i+1. \n\n        When we use a bad key, we are also ending a segment at i (of length1) and then the next chest will be affected by one more halving. \n\n        Therefore, the dp is only for segments of length1. \n\n        But the sample partition: [1,2] and then [-3] -> two segments, the first of length2. \n\n        How do they handle a segment of length2? \n\n        In the recurrence, they are only doing one chest at a time. \n\n        Let me try a segment of length2: \n\n            We have two chests: [10, 10] as one segment.\n\n            How would the dp handle it? \n\n            We would not. Because the dp is for one chest at a time.\n\n        What's the value of the segment [10,10]? \n            If we use a good key at the first chest: then we get 10-5 = 5, and then the next chest is affected by 0 bad keys? \n            But then for the next chest, we use a good key: 10-5=5, total=10.\n\n            If we use a good key at the first and then a bad key at the second: 10-5 + (10>>1) = 5+5=10.\n            If we use a bad key at the first: then the first chest: 10>>1=5, and the second chest is affected by 1 bad key. Then for the second chest, we can use a good key: (10>>1)-5=0, total=5; or bad key: 10>>2=2, total=5+2=7.\n\n            If we use a bad key at the first and then a good key at the second: 5+0=5.\n\n            But if we want to have a segment [10,10] (so we don't break in between), then we would not have the option to use a key in between. \n\n        How do we get the segment [10,10]? \n\n            In the dp, we are not forced to use a key at every chest to end a segment. In fact, the partition is fixed: we must open the chests in order, and we can choose to end a segment at any chest. \n\n            The dp above does not allow for multi-chest segments. \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            \"You should divide a into continuous non-empty subarrays\"\n\n            and then \"any key (both good and bad) breaks after a usage\"\n\n            and \"you need to use in total n keys, one for each chest\"\n\n            So we must use one key per chest. And the key used at a chest determines whether it is a good key or bad key, and also determines the value of the chest at the time of opening.\n\n            But note: the value of the segment is not for each chest individually, but for the entire contiguous segment. \n\n            However, the problem does not say that we must end a segment at every chest. We can have a segment that spans multiple chests. How is the key used? \n\n            The problem says: \"you need to open all n chests in order\", and \"use a key for each chest\". \n\n            When you open a chest, you use a key. The key type (good or bad) is chosen at the time of opening. \n\n            The value of the segment is determined when we open the last chest of the segment? \n\n            Actually, the value of a segment is determined by the sum of the values of the chests in the segment at the time of opening. \n\n            When we open a chest, we might be in the middle of a segment? \n\n            The problem: we partition into contiguous subarrays. This means that we decide the boundaries in advance. But the keys are chosen at the time of opening. \n\n            How do they interact? \n\n            The partition into segments is fixed in advance? or can we choose the partition and the keys arbitrarily? \n\n            The problem: \"You should divide a into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are 2^(n-1) ways to do that).\" \n\n            Then for each segment, we open the chests in the segment in order. But note: the problem says \"open all n chests in order from chest1 to chestn\". \n\n            This means that we open chest1, then chest2, then chest3, ... chestn. \n\n            The partition means that after opening chest i, we may start a new segment at chest i+1, or we may continue the current segment. \n\n            The catch: the key used at chest i affects the values of chest i and all chests from i to n. \n\n            So the value of a chest j is affected by the keys used at or before j. \n\n            Therefore, the value of a segment [l, r] is: \n                s = sum_{j=l}^{r} ( a_j / (2^{b_j}) )\n                where b_j = number of bad keys used at positions i in [l, j] (because the bad keys used before l have already been applied, and they are the same for all chests in [l, r] -> wait, no: the bad keys used before l have already halved the chests l..r, so they have been applied and are the same for all, say B. Then the bad keys used in [l, r] at position i will affect chests i..r. So the chest j in [l, r] is halved by B + (number of bad keys in [l, j]).\n\n            Therefore, s = sum_{j=l}^{r} ( a_j / (2^{B + c_j}) ) \n            where c_j = number of bad keys in [l, j].\n\n            Then the value of the segment is:\n                (r-l+1) if s>0, \n                0 if s==0, \n                -(r-l+1) if s<0.\n\n            This is very complex.\n\n        However, note the sample: \n            Segment [1,2] in the first test case: \n                a = [1,2] (from the first test case: [1,2,-3])\n                B = number of bad keys before l: 0.\n                c_0 (for chest0, value1): number of bad keys in [0,0] -> if we use a good key at0, then c0=0; if we use a bad key at0, then c0=1.\n                c_1: for chest1, value2: if we use a good key at0 and then a good key at1: c1=0; if we use a bad key at0 and then a good key at1: c1 for chest1: includes the bad key at0 and the good key at1? -> no, c_j is the number of bad keys in [l, j]. So for chest1, if we use a good key at1, then the bad keys in [0,1] are only at0, so c1=1.\n\n                If we use two good keys: \n                    s = 1/(2^0) + 2/(2^0) = 1+2 = 3 -> value=2.\n                If we use a bad key at0 and a good key at1:\n                    s = 1/(2^1) + 2/(2^1) = 0 + 1 = 1 -> value=2.\n                If we use a good key at0 and a bad key at1:\n                    s = 1/1 + 2/(2^1) = 1+1 = 2 -> value=2.\n                If we use two bad keys:\n                    s = 1/2 + 2/4 = 0+0 = 0 -> value=0.\n\n                So the best is 2.\n\n            Then the next segment [-3]: \n                B = number of bad keys before l (which is position2): we have used two bad keys in the first segment? -> B=2.\n                c_2: for chest2: if we use a good key: then c2 = 0 (because the segment is [2,2] and there are no bad keys in this segment) -> s = -3/(2^{2+0}) = -3/4 = -0.75 -> floor? -> -0.75 is negative, so value = -1.\n                if we use a bad key: then c2=1, s = -3/(2^{2+1}) = -3/8 = -0.375 -> floor? -> -0.375 -> floor is -1? -> then s = -1? -> then value = -1.\n\n                So we get -1.\n\n                Total = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\n            How do we get this in the dp that does one chest at a time and uses the halved value as the value? \n\n            In the sample solution's dp, they got 11 for the sample [10,10,3,1] by essentially having each chest as a segment. \n\n            In the first test case, if we do one chest at a time:\n\n                Chest0: a0=1 -> good key: 1-0 (k=0 in the first test case? but k=5 in the second sample) -> wait, the first sample: \n                    \"Test case 1: one optimal partition is [1,2], [\u22123].\"\n                    and the input: \n                        t=?\n                        n=3, k=?\n                        a = [1,2,-3]\n\n                In the first sample, the cost of a good key is not given in the note, but in the input specification: the second line of each test case contains n and k.\n\n                In the first sample, k might be 0? or what? \n\n                The note says: \n                    \"Buy a good key for 5 coins\", so k=5.\n\n                But in the first sample, the array is [1,2,-3] and k=5.\n\n                If we do one chest at a time:\n\n                    Chest0: a0=1 -> good key: 1-5 = -4, or bad key: 0 -> choose bad key: 0.\n                    Then chest1: a1=2 -> has been halved once (by the bad key at0) -> 2/2=1. \n                         good key: 1-5 = -4, bad key: 0 -> choose bad key:0.\n                    Then chest2: a2=-3 -> has been halved twice: -3/4 = -0.75 -> floor is -1.\n                         good key: -1-5 = -6, bad key: floor(-1/2) = -1 -> choose bad key: -1.\n\n                    Total = 0+0-1 = -1.\n\n                But the optimal is 1.\n\n                If we try to form segments of length2 and length1:\n\n                    We would need a state that allows multi-chest segments.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the total n over test cases is 10^5, and the sample solution that uses the first approach (adding the halved value) passed, we must conclude that the problem intended the value of a segment to be the halved value, not the sign times the length. \n\n        Re-read the problem statement: \n\n            \"Let s = a_l + a_{l+1} + ... + a_r. The value of a subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r is: \n                (r-l+1) if s>0, \n                0 if s=0, \n                -(r-l+1) if s<0.\"\n\n        But in the sample: \n            [1,2]: s=3>0 -> value=2.\n            [-3]: s=-3<0 -> value=-1.\n\n        However, in the provided code in the problem: \n\n            \"program1.py\" and \"program2.py\", and the sample solution in the note used the halved value as the value to add.\n\n        And the sample input [10,10,3,1] with k=5 yields 11 in the dp that adds the halved value.\n\n        Therefore, we must output the code for the first approach.\n\n        So the missing code in program1.py is the solve function that does:\n\n            ndivs = 31   # because 31 is enough, since 2^31 > 1e9\n            # dp[i][j] for i in [0, n] (n+1 states) and j in [0, ndivs] (31 states)\n            # we'll do i from n-1 down to 0, and for j from 0 to ndivs-1.\n\n            dp = a 2D array of size (n+1) * ndivs, initialize with -10**18 (a very small number) or 0 for the base.\n\n            Base: for any j, dp[n][j] = 0.\n\n            for i from n-1 down to 0:\n                for j in range(ndivs-1):   # j from 0 to 30, but we have ndivs=31, so j in [0,30] (0 to 30 inclusive)\n                    option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j]\n                    option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][j+1]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(option1, option2)\n\n                # for j = ndivs-1 (31), we do:\n                #   option1 = (a[i] >> 31) - k + dp[i+1][31]\n                #   option2 = (a[i] >> 32) + dp[i+1][31]   # but we only have j up to 31, so we use 31 for both.\n                #   but a[i]>>31 is 0 for a[i] in [0,10^9], and a[i]>>32=0.\n                #   so dp[i][31] = max( -k + dp[i+1][31], 0 + dp[i+1][31] ) = dp[i+1][31] + max(-k,0) -> but we can avoid this by capping j at 31.\n\n            Then answer = dp[0][0]\n\n        However, in the provided code in program1.py, there is already a class Seg and an array d of size (n+1) * ndivs, and they do:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n                    d[i][j] = max((a[i] >> j) + d[i+1][j] - k, (a[i] >> (j+1)) + d[i+1][j+1])\n\n            and then print(d[0][0])\n\n        But note: the recurrence in the provided code does not have a separate case for j=ndivs-1. The loop for j is only for j in range(ndivs-1). So for j=ndivs-1, it is not computed. \n\n        We should also handle j=ndivs-1? \n\n        For j=ndivs-1 (31), we have:\n\n            option1 = (a[i] >> 31) - k + dp[i+1][31] \n            option2 = (a[i] >> 32) + dp[i+1][32]   -> but we don't have dp[i+1][32]\n\n        We can cap j at 31, so for j=31, we use:\n\n            option1 = 0 - k + dp[i+1][31]\n            option2 = 0 + dp[i+1][31]   # because we use min(j+1,31) -> 32 is capped to 31, but then we don't have state 31 for the next if we only have 31 states (0..30).\n\n        In the provided code, the array d is of size (n+1) * ndivs, and ndivs=31, so j in [0,30]. \n\n        For j=30, the recurrence uses:\n\n            d[i][30] = max( (a[i]>>30) - k + d[i+1][30], (a[i]>>31) + d[i+1][31] )\n\n        But d[i+1][31] is out of bounds.\n\n        We should change the loop to include j=30 and then for j=30, we use for the bad key option: d[i+1][31] -> but we don't have that.\n\n        Instead, we can do:\n\n            for j in range(ndivs):\n                # for j from 0 to 30\n                # for the bad key option: next j is min(j+1, 30)  [if we only have 31 states, indices 0..30]\n\n                next_j = j+1\n                if next_j >= ndivs:\n                    next_j = ndivs-1\n\n                option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k + dp[i+1][j]\n                option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + dp[i+1][next_j]\n                dp[i][j] = max(option1, option2)\n\n        But note: for j=30, next_j=31, but we only have 0..30. So we should set next_j = 30 if j+1>=31.\n\n        Alternatively, we can make ndivs=32, and then for j in [0,31], and then for j=31, next_j=min(32,31)=31.\n\n        But the provided code has ndivs=31 and the inner loop for j in range(ndivs-1) (0 to 29). So it does not compute j=30.\n\n        We must initialize d for j=30.\n\n        In the provided code, the initialization: \n            d = [[0] * ndivs for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n        So for the base: for i=n, d[n][j]=0 for all j in [0,30].\n\n        Then for i=n-1, we only compute j in [0,29]. j=30 is not computed and remains 0.\n\n        For i=n-2, we use d[i+1][30] which is 0.\n\n        But for a chest i, if j=30, we should compute it.\n\n        We should change the inner loop to j in range(ndivs) and use next_j = min(j+1, ndivs-1).\n\n        However, the provided code has:\n\n            for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n\n        which is j in [0, 30-1) = [0,29].\n\n        To fix, we can do:\n\n            for j in range(ndivs):\n                next_j = j+1\n                if next_j >= ndivs:\n                    next_j = ndivs-1\n                # then the recurrence\n\n        But the provided code only has a loop for j in range(ndivs-1). \n\n        Since the total n over test cases is 10^5, and ndivs=31, we can do 31*n which is 3.1e6 per test case, and the total n is 10^5, so total states 10^5 * 31 = 3.1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we will change the loop to j in range(ndivs) and use next_j = min(j+1, ndivs-1).\n\n        But the provided code in the problem is:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n                    d[i][j] = max((a[i] >> j) + d[i + 1][j] - k, (a[i] >> (j + 1)) + d[i + 1][j + 1])\n\n        We need to also do for j=ndivs-1? \n\n        For j=ndivs-1 (30), we do:\n\n            option1 = (a[i] >> 30) - k + d[i+1][30]\n            option2 = (a[i] >> 31) + d[i+1][31]   # but d has only 31 columns, index 0..30, so d[i+1][31] is out of bounds.\n\n        So we should change the recurrence for j=ndivs-1 to use d[i+1][ndivs-1] for the bad key option.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs):\n                    # For the bad key option: next state is min(j+1, ndivs-1)\n                    next_j = j+1\n                    if next_j >= ndivs:\n                        next_j = ndivs-1\n                    option1 = (a[i] >> j) - k\n                    option1 += d[i+1][j]\n                    option2 = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + d[i+1][next_j]\n                    d[i][j] = max(option1, option2)\n\n        But the provided code already has a class Seg that initializes _da and _op to [-INF] * (n*5). But we are not using that. \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            class Seg(object):\n                def __init__(self, n):\n                    self._da = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n                    self._op = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n\n            and then no further use.\n\n        And then in solve, they do:\n\n            d = [[0] * ndivs for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n        So we can ignore the Seg class.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is the solve function that does the double loop for j in range(ndivs) (0 to 30) and uses next_j = min(j+1, 30) for the bad key option.\n\n        But note: the provided code in the problem has a loop for j in range(ndivs-1). We need to change that.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is in the solve function.\n\n        The solve function in the provided code is:\n\n            def solve() -> None:\n              n = next_int()\n              k = next_int()\n              a = next_int_array(n)\n              ndivs = 31\n              d = [[0] * ndivs for _ in range(n + 1)]\n              for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs - 1):\n                  d[i][j] = max((a[i] >> j) + d[i + 1][j] - k, (a[i] >> (j + 1)) + d[i + 1][j + 1])\n              print(d[0][0])\n\n        We need to change the inner loop to cover j in [0,30] and use next_j = min(j+1, 30) for the bad key option.\n\n        Let's change:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                for j in range(ndivs):   # j from 0 to 30\n                    # For the bad key option, next state is j+1, but if j+1>=ndivs, use ndivs-1\n                    nj = j+1\n                    if nj >= ndivs:\n                        nj = ndivs-1\n                    option_good = (a[i] >> j) - k + d[i+1][j]\n                    option_bad = (a[i] >> (j+1)) + d[i+1][nj]\n                    d[i][j] = max(option_good, option_bad)\n\n        But note: the base is d[n][j]=0 for all j.\n\n        This should work.\n\n        However, the sample [10,10,3,1] with k=5 should yield 11.\n\n        Let's compute for the last chest (i=3, a[3]=1):\n\n            j=0: \n                option_good = (1>>0) -5 + d[4][0] = 1-5+0 = -4.\n                option_bad = (1>>1) + d[4][1] = 0+0 = 0 -> d[3][0]=0.\n            j=1:\n                option_good = (1>>1)-5 + d[4][1] = 0-5+0 = -5.\n                option_bad = (1>>2) + d[4][2] = 0+0=0 -> d[3][1]=0.\n            ... all j: d[3][j]=0.\n\n        Then i=2, a[2]=3:\n            j=0:\n                option_good = 3-5 + d[3][0] = -2+0 = -2.\n                option_bad = (3>>1) + d[3][1] = 1+0=1 -> d[2][0]=1.\n            j=1:\n                option_good = (3>>1)-5 + d[3][1] = 1-5+0 = -4.\n                option_bad = (3>>2) + d[3][2] = 0+0=0 -> d[2][1]=0.\n            j>=2: 0.\n\n        i=1, a[1]=10:\n            j=0:\n                option_good = 10-5 + d[2][0] = 5+1=6.\n                option_bad = (10>>1) + d[2][1] = 5+0=5 -> d[1][0]=6.\n            j=1:\n                option_good = (10>>1)-5 + d[2][1] = 5-5+0=0.\n                option_bad = (10>>2) + d[2][2] = 2+0=2 -> d[1][1]=2.\n            j>=2:0.\n\n        i=0, a[0]=10:\n            j=0:\n                option_good = 10-5 + d[1][0] = 5+6=11.\n                option_bad = (10>>1) + d[1][1] = 5+2=7 -> d[0][0]=11.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we change the inner loop to j in range(ndivs) and use a variable nj for the next state.\n\n        But note: the provided code has a class Seg that is not used. We can remove it? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the solve function. We are only allowed to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        The problem says: \n            Output Format: \n                {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        And the provided code for program1.py includes the class Seg. We are not using it. But we are not allowed to change the existing code arbitrarily. We are only to fill in the missing parts.\n\n        The existing code in program1.py has:\n\n            from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque\n            import bisect\n            from sys import stdin, stdout\n            from itertools import repeat\n            import math\n\n            MOD = 998244353\n            input = stdin.readline\n            finp = [int(x) for x in stdin.buffer.read().split()]\n\n            def inp(force_list=False):\n                re = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if len(re) == 1 and not force_list:\n                    return re[0]\n                return re\n\n            def inst():\n                return input().strip()\n\n            def gcd(x, y):\n               while(y):\n                   x, y = y, x % y\n               return x\n\n            def qmod(a, b, mod=MOD):\n                res = 1\n                while b:\n                    if b&1:\n                        res = (res*a)%mod\n                    b >>= 1\n                    a = (a*a)%mod\n                return res\n\n            def inv(a):\n                return qmod(a, MOD-2)\n\n            INF = 1<<30\n\n            class Seg(object):\n                def __init__(self, n):\n                    self._da = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n                    self._op = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n\n                def update(self, p):\n                    self._op[p] = max(self._op[p*2], self._op[p*2+1])\n\n                def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r):\n                    if l==r-1:\n                        self._da[p] = self._op[p] = x\n                        return\n                    mid = (l+r)//2\n                    if pos < mid:\n                        self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    self.update(p)\n\n                def query(self, x, y, p, l, r):\n                    if x <= l and r <= y:\n                        return self._op[p]\n                    if x >= r or y<=l:\n                        return -INF\n                    mid = (l+r)//2\n                    return max(self.query(x, y, p*2, l, mid), self.query(x, y, p*2+1, mid, r))\n\n            ... and then the solve function is missing.\n\n        We are to complete the solve function.
