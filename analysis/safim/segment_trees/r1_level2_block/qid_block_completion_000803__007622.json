So the input for the fourth test case should be n=7 and the array [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]. But the problem says: \"the fourth test case\" and then the input n=10 and the array of 10 integers.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code in the while loop for the candy eating problem.\nThe approach is to use two pointers (i from left, j from right) and two sums (lsum for Alice, rsum for Bob).\nWe move the pointers until they meet. When the sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (i+1 from left and n-j from right) and then try to move both pointers to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note: the problem says they want to maximize the total number of candies.\n\nHowever, note the note: in the fourth test case, they eat 7 candies in total (Alice 3, Bob 4). So the total is the count of candies eaten by Alice and Bob.\n\nIn the code, when lsum == rsum, we set best = (i+1) + (n - j) because:\n  - Alice has eaten from index 0 to i (inclusive) -> i+1 candies.\n  - Bob has eaten from index j to n-1 (inclusive) -> n - j candies.\n\nBut then we must continue? Because we might have a possibility of extending? Actually, we can then move both pointers and try to see if we can get another segment? However, note that the problem says: they cannot eat the same candy. So we must move both pointers to the next candy and update the sums.\n\nBut note: the example test cases. In the fourth test case, the array is [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1]. \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> wait, actually the example says: Alice eats [7,3,20] and Bob eats [10,8,11,1]. But wait, 20 is not in the array? Let me check: the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". But the array is [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1]. How does [7,3,20] come? \n\nActually, the example says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" for the second test case. And for the fourth: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". \n\nWait, the fourth test case input is: \n  n=10, arr = [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n\nBut [7,3,20] is not contiguous? Actually, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20]\" \u2014 but 20 is not in the beginning. How did they get 20? \n\nLooking at the example: \n  They each eat 30. \n  Alice: 7+3+20? But 20 is not in the array. \n\nWait, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20]\" \u2014 but the array is [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1]. \n\nI see: the example might have a typo? Or perhaps the example is describing the total? Actually, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20]\" \u2014 that doesn't match the array. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\". So she must eat contiguous from the left. Similarly Bob from the right.\n\nSo how do they get 30? \n  Alice: [7,3,1,6,4,1,10] -> 7+3+1+6+4+1+10 = 32? \n  Bob: [8,11,1] -> 8+11+1=20 -> not 30.\n\nAlternatively, if Alice takes [7,3,1,6,4,1] (that's 7+3+1+6+4+1=22) and Bob takes [10,8,11,1] (10+8+11+1=30) -> not equal.\n\nWait, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The example says: \"the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20]\". How can she get 20? The array does not have 20. \n\nLooking at the array: [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1]. The 20 might be the sum of a contiguous block? But the problem says she eats from the left without skipping. \n\nActually, the example might be describing the total per person? But then it says \"candies with weights\", so it should be the individual weights.\n\nI see the problem: the example input for the fourth test case is actually: \n  n=10, arr = [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1] ??? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". \n\nWait, the example input is: \n  \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\"\n\nBut the array must be: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1]? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"the fourth test case\" and the input is: \n  n=10, and the array: [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1] \n\nBut then how do they get 30? \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> that's not contiguous in the given array.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the example. The official note says: \n  \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1], they each eat 30 weight.\"\n\nBut the array provided is [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1]. \n\nWait, the array has 10 elements. How can Alice eat [7,3,20]? There is no 20 in the first part. \n\nI see: the example might have intended the array to be: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] but that's only 7 elements. \n\nAlternatively, the array might be: [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1] and the solution is:\n  Alice: [7,3,1,6,4,1] -> total 22? \n  Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> total 30 -> not equal.\n\nBut the example says they each eat 30. \n\nAnother possibility: \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> but 20 is not in the array. \n\nAfter re\u2010reading: the example says: \"the fourth test case\" and the array is provided as [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1]. \n\nBut then how? \n\nI notice: the example says: \"they each eat 30\". So the total for Alice is 30 and for Bob is 30. \n\nHow to get 30 from the left? \n  The first three: 7+3+1 = 11 -> too low.\n  The first four: 7+3+1+6=17\n  first five: 17+4=21\n  first six: 21+1=22\n  first seven: 22+10=32 -> too high.\n\nSimilarly, from the right:\n  last one: 1\n  last two: 1+11=12\n  last three: 12+8=20\n  last four: 20+10=30 -> so Bob can get 30 by eating the last four: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1=30.\n\nBut then Alice must also get 30. How? She can't skip. She must start from the left. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\". So she must take a contiguous segment from the left. \n\nBut 22 is the maximum from the left without exceeding 30. \n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that they eat consecutively without leaving a gap? Actually, they can leave candies in the middle. The only condition is that Alice eats from the left without skipping (meaning contiguous from the left) and Bob from the right without skipping (contiguous from the right). And they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nSo the solution: \n  Alice takes [7,3,1,6,4,1,10] -> 7+3+1+6+4+1+10=32 -> too high.\n  Alice takes [7,3,1,6,4,1] -> 22, then Bob takes [10,8,11,1] -> 30 -> not equal.\n\nBut wait, the example says they eat 7 candies in total: 3 by Alice and 4 by Bob? That doesn't add up to 7? 3+4=7. \n\nThe example says: \"the answer is 7\". \n\nSo how? \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20=30 -> but 20 is the third candy? But the array has 1 at index 2. \n\nI see: the example might have a different array. The problem states: \n  \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\"\n\nSo the array must be: \n  [7, 3, 20, ... , 10, 8, 11, 1] \n\nBut the input says: \n  n=10, and the array: [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the sample input from the problem statement? The problem statement says: \n  \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\nSo the fourth test case: \n  n=10\n  weights: 7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1\n\nBut the example solution says: \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> that would require the first three to be 7,3,20. \n\nSo there is a discrepancy. \n\nI think the example intended the array to be: \n  [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1] \nbut that's 7 elements, not 10.\n\nAlternatively, the array might be: \n  [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1, ...] but then the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] which are the last four? \n\nBut the array has 10 elements. \n\nI found the original problem: \"Candies\" in Codeforces? \n  Problem name: \"Candies\" from Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) \u2014 problem C.\n\nThe sample test case 4 is: \n  n=10\n  [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 1, 10, 8, 11, 1]\n\nAnd the solution is 7: meaning they eat 7 candies in total? \n\nHow? \n  Alice: [7,3,1,6,4] -> 7+3+1+6+4 = 21? \n  Bob: [11,1] -> 12 -> not equal.\n\nBut the example says: they each eat 30. \n\nWait, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". \n\nThis is a mystery. \n\nAlternatively, the example might be describing the total per person as 30, but the candies they take are not contiguous? But the problem says contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right.\n\nI see: the problem does not require that the entire array is eaten. They leave some in the middle. \n\nSo in the array [7,3,1,6,4,1,10,8,11,1]:\n  Alice: takes the first three: [7,3,1] -> 11? \n  Bob: takes the last four: [10,8,11,1] -> 30 -> not equal.\n\nBut wait, the example says Alice takes [7,3,20] \u2014 that's 30. How? \n\nI think there is a typo in the example. The intended array for the fourth test case might be: \n  [7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1] \nwith n=7. Then:\n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n  Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30? but that would be the last four: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1=30.\n\nBut then the total candies eaten is 3+4=7. \n\nAnd the array has 7 elements. \n\nSo the input for the fourth test case should be n=7 and the array [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]. \n\nBut the problem says: \"the fourth test case\" and then the input n=10 and the array of 10 integers. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nHowever, the problem statement says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". \n\nSo we must design an efficient solution.\n\nThe intended solution for program1.py is to use two pointers:\n\n  i = 0, j = n-1\n  lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n  best = 0\n\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # total candies eaten: left part (0..i) and right part (j..n-1)\n          # Then we move both pointers to see if we can get a longer sequence? \n          # But note: we are trying to maximize the total number of candies. However, if we move one pointer we break the equality? \n          # Actually, we can try to extend: we move the left pointer to the next and add to lsum, and then the inner loop will adjust the right pointer? \n          # But the problem is: we are currently at a fair state. We can then try to extend by one more on the left and then let the inner while adjust the right? \n          # However, the algorithm already does that: after we set best, we then move both pointers? \n          # But the example: if we have [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6). \n          #   Initially: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> set best = 1 (left) + 1 (right) = 2.\n          #   Then we move: i becomes 1, j becomes 4. Then lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+1=2 -> set best = 2+2 = 4.\n          #   Then move: i=2, j=3: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> set best = 3+3=6.\n          #   Then i=2, j=3 -> then we break because i<j fails? \n          # But we want 6.\n\n          # So we should do: when we get an equality, we record the current total and then we move both pointers to continue? \n          # However, note: we are going to move one pointer and then the other? But the algorithm currently in the else branch (when equal) does nothing? \n\n          # The current code in the else branch (when equal) has a TODO.\n\n          # We should do: \n          #   best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n          #   Then we move both pointers: \n          #      i += 1\n          #      lsum += arr[i]\n          #      j -= 1\n          #      rsum += arr[j]\n          #   Why? Because we want to see if we can get a larger total? \n\n          # But consider: [1,2,1,2] \n          #   Initially: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=2 -> then we move i: i=1, lsum=1+2=3 -> then compare: 3>2 -> then move j: j=2, rsum=2+1=3 -> then we have lsum==rsum at i=1, j=2: then we set best = (1+1) + (4-2) = 2+2=4.\n          #   Then we move both: i=2, j=1 -> break.\n\n          # But what if we don't move both?

We have the while condition at the top.\n\n          #   However, after moving i and j, we break out of the loop if i>=j.\n\n          #   But we do the additions only if i<j. \n\n          #   This should be safe.\n\n          #   But what if i becomes j after increment? \n          #       Example: n=2, [1,1]: \n          #           i=0, j=1: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> set best= (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2.\n          #           then i +=1 -> i=1, then j -=1 -> j=0.\n          #           Then we break the next time because i(1) is not < j(0) -> so we break.\n          #       Then we print 2.\n\n          #   So it's safe.\n\n          #   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the else branch is:\n\n          #       best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n          #       i += 1\n          #       if i < j:\n          #           lsum += arr[i]\n          #       j -= 1\n          #       if i < j:\n          #           rsum += arr[j]\n\n          #   But note: we must do the moves even if i>=j? We are moving the pointers unconditionally, but we only update the sums if i<j.\n\n          #   This is acceptable.\n\n          #   However, what if after moving i and j, we have i==j? Then we break and we don't do anything. \n\n          #   But that's fine.\n\n          #   Let me test with n=4, [1,1,1,1]:\n          #       i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> set best= (0+1)+(4-3)=1+1=2.\n          #       then i=1, j=2 -> then we update: lsum += arr[1] -> lsum=1+1=2, rsum += arr[2] -> rsum=1+1=2.\n          #       Then next iteration: i=1, j=2: lsum=2, rsum=2 -> set best= (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4.\n          #       then i=2, j=1 -> break.\n          #   So best=4.\n\n          #   Correct.\n\n          #   But note: we are updating the sums only if i<j. In the move after the first equality, we had i=1, j=2 -> which is i<j, so we update.\n\n          #   So the code for the else branch is as above.\n\n          #   However, what if we have an equality and then after moving the pointers, we get i>=j? Then we break and we have recorded the best from the previous state.\n\n          #   That's fine.\n\n          #   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the else branch.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  We are to complete the code for the lucky ticket problem.\n\n  The input: \n      t = number of test cases\n      then t lines, each a string of 6 digits.\n\n  For each test case, we need to check if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.\n\n  We can do:\n      s = input string\n      first_three = s[0:3]\n      last_three = s[3:6]\n\n      sum1 = sum(int(x) for x in first_three)\n      sum2 = sum(int(x) for x in last_three)\n\n      if sum1 == sum2:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But the code is given as:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n          if sum(int(x) for x in c[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in c[3:]):\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the ticket has six digits. So we can safely take the first three and last three.\n\n  However, we can do it in one line? But we are to output the code.\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  The missing code for program2.py is the body of the for loop.\n\n  However, the for loop is written as:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must write the body of the for loop.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      s = c   # but c is the string of six digits\n      if sum(map(int, s[:3])) == sum(map(int, s[3:])):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: we can use c directly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      print(\"YES\" if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])) else \"NO\")\n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. And we are to output the entire body.\n\n  However, the for loop is already there. We only need to complete the body.\n\n  But note: the for loop is written as a list comprehension that reads all inputs first. Then we iterate over that list.\n\n  So the body is:\n\n      if sum(int(c[0])+int(c[1])+int(c[2]) == int(c[3])+int(c[4])+int(c[5]): \n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But that is longer.\n\n  I'll go with the map and sum.\n\n  But note: the problem says the input is a string of six digits. So we can do:\n\n      part1 = c[0:3]\n      part2 = c[3:6]\n      s1 = 0\n      for char in part1:\n          s1 += int(char)\n      s2 = 0\n      for char in part2:\n          s2 += int(char)\n      if s1 == s2:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But that is long.\n\n  The concise way is:\n\n      if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But we must be cautious: the problem says the total number of test cases is at most 1000, so efficiency is not an issue.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      if sum(int(x) for x in c[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in c[3:]):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: the above uses generator expressions. We can also use:\n\n      if sum(int(c[i]) for i in range(3)) == sum(int(c[i]) for i in range(3,6)):\n\n  However, the simplest is to use slicing.\n\n  But the code must be exactly the body of the for loop.\n\n  We write:\n\n      if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output only the missing code.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is the else branch block.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n  But note: the for loop in program2.py is written as:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we must write the code that goes in the for loop.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      s = c\n      if sum(int(s[0])+int(s[1])+int(s[2]) == sum(int(s[3])+int(s[4])+int(s[5])):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But that is not using the same style.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      if int(c[0])+int(c[1])+int(c[2]) == int(c[3])+int(c[4])+int(c[5]):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  This is straightforward.\n\n  I'll use that.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the string has six digits, so we can index from 0 to 5.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Now, we output the result in the required JSON format.\n\n  Example:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n        i += 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            lsum += arr[i]\\n        j -= 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"    if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"}\n\n  But note: the indentation must be exactly as in the original program.\n\n  In program1.py, the else branch is indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside the while loop which is inside the for loop). But the TODO is at the same level. The code we write should be at the same indentation level.\n\n  The original program1.py has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n            best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                rsum += arr[j]\n\n  The indentation: \n      The else: is at 8 spaces, then the code inside the else should be 12 spaces.\n\n  But in the JSON string, we must represent the newlines and the spaces.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the for loop body should be indented. The for loop is at the top level, so the body should be 4 spaces? \n\n  But the original program2.py has:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to write the body of the for loop. The body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the context.\n\n  For program1.py, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level. The else branch is inside the while loop (which is 8 spaces indented) so the else branch body should be 12 spaces.\n\n  But the TODO is at 12 spaces? Actually, the comment is at 12 spaces.\n\n  So we write the code for program1.py with 12 spaces for each line, and the inner if at 16 and 20.\n\n  But to be safe, we can write:\n\n      Line1: 12 spaces + \"best = (i+1) + (n - j)\"\n      Line2: 12 spaces + \"i += 1\"\n      Line3: 12 spaces + \"if i < j:\"\n      Line4: 16 spaces + \"lsum += arr[i]\"\n      Line5: 12 spaces + \"j -= 1\"\n      Line6: 12 spaces + \"if i < j:\"\n      Line7: 16 spaces + \"rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n  For program2.py, the body of the for loop should be 4 spaces for the first level.\n\n  We write:\n\n      Line1: 4 spaces + \"if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\"\n      Line2: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"YES\\\")\"\n      Line3: 4 spaces + \"else:\"\n      Line4: 8 spaces + \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n  But note: the for loop is written in one line. The body of the for loop is the next lines.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write the entire body as one line? But that would be messy.\n\n  We'll do multiple lines.\n\n  Now, we output the JSON.\n\n  We must escape newlines and quotes.\n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code. And then we put it in a JSON string.\n\n  We can use:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n        i += 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            lsum += arr[i]\\n        j -= 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            rsum += arr[j]\",\n        \"program2\": \"    if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1 code has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? Actually, the existing code in the else branch is at 8 spaces? \n\n  Let me count the spaces in the original program1.py:\n\n      for s in inp:\n          ... (4 spaces)\n          while i < j:\n              ... (8 spaces)\n              else:\n                  ... (12 spaces) for the TODO\n\n  So the code we put in the else branch should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  But the existing code in the else branch is:\n\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The \"else:\" is at 8 spaces, and the comment is at 12.\n\n  So we write the code at 12 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n        i += 1\n        if i < j:\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        j -= 1\n        if i < j:\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n  Each line of the code we are adding is at 12 spaces.\n\n  In the JSON string, we represent:\n\n      \"        best = (i+1) + (n - j)\\n        i += 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            lsum += arr[i]\\n        j -= 1\\n        if i < j:\\n            rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n  For program2.py, the for loop body should be at 4 spaces relative to the for loop? But the for loop is at 0 spaces. So the body should be 4 spaces.\n\n  But the example in the problem does not show the indentation of the for loop body.\n\n  We write:\n\n      for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n          if ...:\n          else:\n\n  So the body is at 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n      if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\n  And we represent in JSON as:\n\n      \"    if int(c[0]) + int(c[1]) + int(c[2]) == int(c[3]) + int(c[4]) + int(c[5]):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n  But note: the first line of the body is 4 spaces, then the print is 8 spaces, then the else is 4 spaces, then the next print is 8 spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  However, to match the style of the existing code in program2.py, which is not given, we assume 4 spaces for the body and 8 for the inner block.\n\n  Therefore, the final JSON."
