    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to solve the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is defined by its length multiplied by the sign of its sum.\n\nThe provided code in program1.py already has a solution that uses a Fenwick tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) and a segment tree? But actually, we see that the code defines a Seg class but doesn't use it. Instead, it uses two Fenwick trees (named pfen and nfen) and a dictionary (dmx). The solution is already implemented and we are only to complete the missing parts? However, the problem says that there are missing lines or blocks.\n\nLooking at the code, we see:\n\nIn the Seg class, the `modify` method has a TODO:\n\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut note: the entire program does not use the Seg class. So we might not need it? However, the problem says to output the missing code for both programs.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we must complete the Seg class? However, the main function (my_main) does not use the Seg class. It uses two Fenwick trees and a dictionary.\n\nAlternatively, the TODO might be a red herring? Or perhaps the problem expects us to complete the Seg class even though it's not used? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to use the Seg class but the provided solution uses Fenwick trees instead? And the TODO in the Seg class is left as is? But the problem says the code is missing lines.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\nSo we must complete the Seg class? Let's complete the else branch:\n\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n        else:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the function `modify` of the Seg class is recursive and updates the segment tree. However, the update function (self.update) is called after the if-else. So we don't need to do anything else.\n\nBut wait: the function `modify` of the Seg class is defined to take 5 arguments: (self, pos, x, p, l, r). The recursive call must pass the same parameters. So the else branch should be:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the base case is when l == r-1. So the recursive call in the else branch should be for the right child.\n\nHowever, the entire program does not use the Seg class. So why is it there? It might be a leftover. But the problem says to output the missing code. So we must complete it.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo for program1.py, we are to output the missing line in the Seg class.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". There might be more than one missing? However, we see only one TODO.\n\nAlternatively, the main function might be missing something? But the main function is already implemented and runs.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the input has multiple test cases and the constraints are high. The provided solution uses a Fenwick tree and a dictionary. The solution is:\n\n    dp = [0] * (n+1)\n    dmx = {}\n    dmx[0] = 0\n    pfen.modify(ordpos[0], 0)\n    nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[0], 0)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n        pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n        nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nThis seems complete.\n\nSo the only missing part is the else branch in the Seg class.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program1.py, we output the line for the else branch.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"blocks\", so we output the entire else block? But it's one line.\n\nBut wait: what about the Fenwick tree? The Fenwick tree class is defined and used. The Fenwick tree class is complete? It has `max` and `modify` methods.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is only the one line in the else branch.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to compute the number of trees (with a specific structure: vertex i (>=2) is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) for which each vertex i is the centroid.\n\nThe provided code sets up factorials and inverse factorials, and then computes an array `out` and then does a backward update.\n\nWe see a missing function `modmul`:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete this function. Since the modulus is MOD=998244353, we should compute (x * y) % MOD. But note: the function has a third parameter c with default 0. What is c? The function call in the code uses two arguments (like modmul(i, fact[i-1])). So c is not provided. But also, we see:\n\n    base = fact[n - 1]\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n\nSo we are multiplying two numbers modulo MOD.\n\nBut what about c? The function signature has c=0. The problem says: the answer can be huge, output it modulo 998244353.\n\nWe can write:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut wait: what if we have three numbers? The function is called with two arguments. However, the function signature has a third argument c with default 0. The problem does not specify, but looking at the code we see that the function is only called with two arguments. However, in the backward loop we see:\n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nand\n\n    rem = modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nand\n\n    out[i] -= oldrem\n\nSo we only need two-argument multiplication modulo MOD.\n\nBut note: the function is named `modmul` and might be intended to multiply two numbers and then add c? The default for c is 0. So we can do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: the function is called without c. So c=0. Then (x*y+0) % MOD is the same as (x*y) % MOD.\n\nBut in the code, we also have:\n\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\nThis is just multiplying i and fact[i-1] modulo MOD.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut why is there a c? The problem does not specify. However, the function is called without c. So we can ignore c? Actually, the function is defined with a default c=0, so we can use it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to do (x * y) % MOD without adding c? But the parameter c is there. The problem says: \"Complete the code\". We must follow the signature.\n\nBut note: the function is called only with two arguments. So c is always 0. We can do:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nBut the function might be called with three arguments? We don't see any such call. However, to be safe, we should use:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: the function is called with two arguments, so c=0. Then (x*y+0) % MOD = (x*y) % MOD.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to do:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD\n\nand ignore c? But the signature has c. We must use c.\n\nLooking at the name: modmul might be for modular multiplication with an optional additive term? But the name doesn't suggest addition.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Complete the code\". We see that the function is called in several places with two arguments. We also see:\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nThis is adding the result of modmul to rem. So if we do (x*y+c) % MOD, then when called with two arguments, c=0, so it's (x*y) % MOD. Then we add that to rem. That is correct.\n\nBut note: the function is also called in the factorial setup:\n\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\nThis is two arguments. So we are safe.\n\nSo for program2.py, we complete the modmul function.\n\nBut wait: there is another possibility. The function might be intended to multiply more than two numbers? But the calls are two numbers.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the modulus is MOD. We must use MOD.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n    return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be incorrect if c is not 0? Because we are doing ( (x*y mod MOD) + c ) mod MOD. But if c is large, we should mod it? However, the problem says the numbers can be huge, but the modulus is 998244353. The inputs can be negative? But the factorials and combinations are nonnegative. However, the function is called with nonnegative numbers? The factorials are computed modulo MOD, so they are in [0, MOD-1]. The same for the combinations.\n\nBut note: the function is called with `out[i]` and `invs(i)`. The array `out` is computed modulo MOD, and `invs(i)` is also computed modulo MOD. So they are nonnegative and in the range [0, MOD-1]. Then (x*y) might be up to about 10^18, so we do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut to avoid overflow in intermediate steps, we can do:\n\n    return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: x and y can be up to MOD (about 1e9), so x*y can be 1e18, which is acceptable in Python? But we are in Python and integers are big, but modulo arithmetic with big numbers is slower. We can do:\n\n    return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\nBut the problem says the constraints are up to 200000, and we are doing factorials and combinations, so we are doing many multiplications. We want efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    res = (x * y) % MOD\n    res = (res + c) % MOD\n    return res\n\nBut the problem does not specify performance, and the modulus is fixed. We can do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the modulus operator in Python for big numbers is efficient enough.\n\nHowever, to be safe from overflow in other languages? But we are in Python. But the problem says \"python3\".\n\nBut the problem constraints: n < 200000, and we are doing O(n) multiplications. So we can do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut wait: what if c is negative? The function is called with c=0. So we don't care. But if we are to be generic, we can do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut modulo with negative: in Python, the modulus is nonnegative. So it's safe.\n\nSo we write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is defined with c=0, and we are only using two arguments. So we can also write without c? But the problem says to complete the function as given.\n\nSo for program2.py, we complete the modmul function.\n\nNow, we must output the missing code for both programs in a JSON.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line in the else branch of the Seg.modify method.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the body of the modmul function.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output:\n\nFor program1: the line \"self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\"\nFor program2: the line \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut wait: in program1, the missing part is only one line? But the else branch is one line. However, we must be cautious: the code block for the else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with the recursive call. So the missing block is:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the code after the if-else is:\n\n        self.update(p)\n\nSo we are only replacing the TODO line.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we are replacing the entire body of modmul.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"blocks\". So we output the entire block that is missing? But in program1, the missing block is just one line. In program2, the missing block is the entire function body? But the function body is one line.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". So we output the exact code that is missing.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program1, we output the line that goes in the else branch. For program2, we output the return statement.\n\nBut how to represent in JSON? We must escape the string.\n\nWe write:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut wait: the program1 code has 12 leading spaces? The existing code in the if branch has 8 leading spaces? Actually, the existing code in the if branch is:\n\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n\nwhich is indented by 8 and 12. The else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we must have 12 leading spaces for the line we are adding.\n\nSimilarly, in program2, the function modmul is defined and the body is currently:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with a line that has 4 spaces (since the function body is indented by 4). But the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nSo the line we write for program2 should be indented by 4 more? Actually, the function body is already indented. The missing line is at the same level as the TODO comment. So we write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nwith 4 spaces at the beginning? But the TODO comment is at 8 spaces (if the function header is at 4, then the body is 8). Actually, the code in program2:\n\ndef modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at 4 spaces? Because the function body is indented by 4. So we write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nwith 4 spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\". We are replacing the entire body of the function? But the function body is one line. So we output that one line.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended to have multiple lines? But we see only one line.\n\nBut wait: the function might be called with three arguments? We don't see any such call. But to be safe, we write the function as:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function might be called with two arguments, then c=0. So it's (x*y) % MOD.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n    res = x * y\n    res = (res + c) % MOD\n    return res\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the one-liner is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer can be huge. We must do modulo. So we do modulo.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1, the line we are writing is exactly as above? But note that the existing code in the if branch is:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n\nSo we are writing the same for the else branch but with p*2+1.\n\nBut note: the parameters for the right child: the segment for the right child is [mid, r). The function call is:\n\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut note: the function is recursive and the base case is when l == r-1. So the segment [l, r) is of length 1 when l+1==r.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". So we do not output the entire function, only the missing part.\n\nHowever, for program1, the missing part is only the one line in the else branch. For program2, the missing part is the entire body of the modmul function (which is one line).\n\nBut wait: what if the modmul function is intended to be more efficient? For example, using pow? But we don't need that because the modulus is fixed and we are just doing one multiplication and one addition.\n\nSo we output the JSON as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\nWe must use double quotes. And the keys are \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo the final output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\", \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"}\n\nBut wait: the program2 code has 4 spaces? But the existing code has 4 spaces for the function body. So we write 4 spaces? But the TODO comment is at 4 spaces. So we write the same.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the spaces? But the code must be properly indented.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". The missing code is the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at an indentation level of 4. So we write the line with 4 spaces.\n\nBut note: the entire program is provided and we are only replacing the TODO. So we must preserve the indentation.\n\nSo we output the string with the 4 spaces for program2.\n\nSimilarly, for program1, the line is at 12 spaces.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we output only the missing lines.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"blocks\". So if there were multiple lines, we would output multiple lines. But here we have one line each.\n\nBut note: in program1, the missing block is one line. In program2, the missing block is one line.\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\", \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"}\n\nBut wait: in program2, the function modmul might be called with negative numbers? The problem says the answer is modulo 998244353. In Python, the modulus operation for negative numbers: we want nonnegative. The expression (x*y+c) % MOD will be nonnegative because % MOD in Python returns a value in [0, MOD-1]. But if x, y, or c are negative, then the result might be negative? Actually, no: the modulus operation in Python for a negative number: \n\nFor example: (-5) % 3 = 1.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be different if c is negative? Because we are doing (x*y mod MOD) which is nonnegative, then adding c (which might be negative) and then mod again. But the expression (x*y+c) % MOD is the same as (x*y%MOD + c%MOD) % MOD? Not exactly: because (a+b) mod M = (a mod M + b mod M) mod M, but here we have a product. However, the expression (x*y+c) % MOD is equivalent to (x*y%MOD + c) % MOD? Not exactly: because x*y might be huge and then adding c might be huge. But modulo is distributive. Actually:\n\n(x*y + c) % MOD = ( (x*y) % MOD + c % MOD ) % MOD\n\nBut we are not doing that. We are doing (x*y+c) % MOD. This is safe in Python because Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are doing modulo at the end. However, if we are concerned about performance, we can break it down. But the constraints are 200000, and we are doing O(n) multiplications. The numbers are modulo 998244353, so the product is about 1e18, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nSo we stick to:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer can be huge. So we must do modulo. The expression (x*y+c) might be huge, but Python integers are big. However, modulo of a big integer is efficient? It is, because the modulus is fixed size.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut wait: what if the product is negative? Then (x*y+c) % MOD is still nonnegative. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\", \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"}"
