Then no break (so segments unchanged) and last remains the same.\n                    or choose the opposite? then break (segments++) and last becomes the opposite. But to minimize segments, we choose the same as last. However, is that optimal? Example: \n            First pair: non-homogeneous -> we set to 0 -> last=0, segments=1. Second pair: non-homogeneous -> we set to 0 (same as last) -> no break, segments=1, last=0. Third pair: homogeneous and bit=1 -> break, segments=2, last=1. Alternatively, for the first pair: set to 1 -> last=1, segments=1. second pair: set to 1 -> no break, segments=1, last=1. third pair: homogeneous 1 -> no break, segments=1. So the choice in the first pair matters.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given the number of items n and number of queries q.\nThen a list of n integers (prices) which we sort in descending order (so that we can easily take the largest ones).\nWe then build a prefix sum array s for the sorted prices (in descending order). So s[i] is the sum of the first i largest prices.\n\nFor each query (x, y): \nThe customer must purchase at least x items, and then the y cheapest among the purchased items are free.\nTo maximize the free value, the customer would choose to purchase exactly x items (because if they buy more, they might include some expensive items that won't be free, and the free part is only the y cheapest). \nBut note: the free part is the y cheapest among the purchased items. So we want to maximize the sum of the y cheapest items in a set of x items.\n\nHow? \nWe can choose any x items. To maximize the free part (the y cheapest), we want the y cheapest to be as large as possible. \nBut note: the entire set of x items must be chosen. The free part is the y smallest in that set.\n\nStrategy: \nWe want to have as many large numbers as possible, but the free part is the smallest y in the set. \nWe can do: take the largest x items. Then the y smallest in that set are the last y of these x items (which are the smallest in the set). \nBut note: we sorted in descending order. So the largest x items are p[0] to p[x-1]. \nIn this set, the smallest y items are the last y of these, i.e., p[x-y] to p[x-1] (in the descending sorted list, the last y are the smallest).\n\nBut wait: our array p is sorted in descending order. So the entire set of x items we choose is the top x. \nThe smallest y in that set are the last y of the top x, which are the (x-y)th to the (x-1)th in the entire array? Actually, in the descending order, the set of x items is from index0 to index x-1. \nThe smallest in this set is at index x-1, then x-2, ... so the y smallest are from index x-y to x-1? Actually, the entire segment from index0 to x-1 is sorted from high to low. \nSo the smallest y are the last y: indices [x-y, x-1] (inclusive). \n\nBut note: we built a prefix sum for the entire array in descending order. \nThe prefix sum s[i] = p[0] + p[1] + ... + p[i-1]. \nSo the sum of the y smallest in the set of x largest is the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to index (x-1) in the descending array? \nActually, the entire set of x largest is from index0 to index x-1. The y smallest in that set are the last y, which are the ones from index (x-y) to (x-1). \nBut note: our prefix sum array s is 0-indexed such that s[i] is the sum of the first i elements (i.e., indices 0 to i-1). \nTherefore, the sum of the y smallest in the set is: s[x] - s[x-y] \nbecause: \ns[x] = p[0] + ... + p[x-1]\ns[x-y] = p[0] + ... + p[x-y-1]\nso subtracting: we get p[x-y] + ... + p[x-1] (which are the last y in the set of x).\n\nBut wait: let me check with a small example: \nn=3, p = [5,3,1] -> but we sort in descending order: [5,3,1] -> then for x=3, y=2: \nWe take the entire set of 3: [5,3,1]. The two cheapest are 3 and 1 -> sum=4.\ns[3] = 5+3+1 = 9, s[3-2]=s[1]=5 -> then 9-5=4 -> correct.\n\nBut note: the example in the note: \nFirst query: x=3, y=2 -> free value=8. \nThe example: items [5,3,5] -> but note the input: the prices are given as p1, p2, p3. \nIn the example, the input is: \n\"5 3 5\" -> then sorted descending: [5,5,3] -> then for x=3, y=2: \nThe set of 3: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest: 5 and 3 -> sum=8? \nBut wait: the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5 (the two smallest in {5,5,3} are 3 and 5). \nBut note: there are two 5's. The two smallest are 3 and the smallest 5? \nSo the set: [5,5,3] -> sorted ascending: [3,5,5] -> the two smallest: 3 and 5 -> 8. \nIn our method: \ns[3] = 5+5+3 = 13\ns[3-2] = s[1] = 5\nthen 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\nSo the answer for a query (x,y) is: s[x] - s[x-y]\n\nBut note: our prefix sum array s is built for the entire array (which is sorted in descending order). \nWe have: \ns[0] = 0\ns[1] = p[0]\ns[2] = p[0]+p[1]\n...\ns[i] = p[0]+...+p[i-1]\n\nTherefore, for each query (x,y): \n   free_value = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\nBut note: x and y are given for each query. \n\nSo in the loop for queries, we do:\n   x, y = map(int, input().split())\n   ans = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\nBut note: the array p has n elements. Our prefix sum s has indices from 0 to n (so s[n] is the total). \nThe constraints: 1<=y<=x<=n, so x-y is between 0 and n-1. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\nfor _ in [0]*q:\n    x, y = Y()\n    O.append(str(s[x] - s[x-y]))\n\nBut note: the variable O is a list that we are appending the answers to, and then we print them with newlines.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are processing multiple test cases. The input is given in a way that we have an array `inp` of all lines.\n\nThe code already starts by reading all input into `inp`. Then it iterates over every second line starting from index 2 (because the first line is t, then the next lines are: first test case: n and then the string, then next test case: n and string, etc.). \n\nThe code for each test case:\n   s = s.strip()   # the binary string of length n (which is even)\n\nThe goal: \n   We want to make the string good. A string is good if when divided into contiguous subsegments of equal bits (minimal number of subsegments) then every segment has even length.\n\nWe are allowed to change any bit to '0' or '1'. We want two outputs per test case:\n   (1) the minimum number of operations (changes)\n   (2) the minimum number of subsegments that can be achieved among all solutions that use the minimum number of operations.\n\nObservation:\n\nNote: the problem states that the entire string is divided into the minimal number of contiguous subsegments (so we break at every change). \n\nBut we are allowed to change bits arbitrarily. We want to achieve that every segment has even length.\n\nHow can we think?\n\nWe note that the entire string must be partitioned into contiguous segments of even length. However, the minimal number of contiguous subsegments (with each segment having the same bit) is achieved by the natural grouping (by consecutive same bits). But we can change bits arbitrarily.\n\nWe can also note: we can merge adjacent segments if we change the bits in the boundary? But we are free to change arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length, and each segment is of one type. However, the problem does not require that adjacent segments are of different types? Actually, the minimal contiguous subsegments: if two adjacent segments are the same, they would be merged. So we must have alternating segments.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the segments to alternate in bit? Actually, the minimal contiguous subsegments: we break whenever two adjacent characters are different. So the segments are maximal contiguous same characters. Therefore, adjacent segments must be of different bits.\n\nSo the entire string is represented as: \n   [a0 times bit0] [a1 times bit1] [a2 times bit0] ... \nwhere a0, a1, a2, ... are the lengths of the segments, and they must all be even.\n\nWe are allowed to change bits arbitrarily. We want to minimize the number of changes and then minimize the number of segments.\n\nHow to minimize the number of changes?\n\nWe can consider dynamic programming? But note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000, but the number of test cases t can be up to 10000. However, the total n is bounded by 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\nAlternatively, we can think greedily.\n\nNote: the entire string has even length. We can break the string into pairs? Because each segment must be of even length. \n\nIdea: \n   We can traverse the string in steps of 2? \n\nThe provided code already does:\n   for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n        if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n            res += 1\n\nThis counts the number of operations? Why? \n   If in a pair (2*i and 2*i+1) the two characters are different, then we can change one of them to make them equal? But note: we are counting one operation per such pair? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which one to change. But we can change one of them to make the two equal. So one operation per such pair.\n\nBut then what? \n\nThe code also has:\n   else:\n        if prebit is None:\n            prebit = s[2*i]\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nAnd then it prints (res, mseg) at the end.\n\nWhat is the idea?\n\nWe are grouping the string into pairs. For each pair, we require that the two characters are the same? Why? \nBecause if we have a segment of even length, then if we break the string into pairs, each pair must be the same? Actually, not necessarily: a segment of length 4 can be \"0000\", which breaks into two pairs of \"00\" and \"00\", each pair is same. But a segment of length 2 must be \"00\" or \"11\". \n\nBut note: the entire string is partitioned into segments of even length. However, the minimal contiguous subsegments (by the natural grouping) might be altered by our changes.\n\nBut the problem does not require that we break the string arbitrarily. We can change bits arbitrarily and then the natural grouping (by consecutive same bits) will form the segments.\n\nHow to minimize the number of segments?\n\nWe note that the number of segments is determined by the number of changes of consecutive bits. \n\nWe can consider: \n   We want to assign to each pair a value. But note: we are going to have the entire string as a sequence of pairs. Each pair must be \"00\" or \"11\". \n\nSo after the operations, the string becomes a sequence of pairs of the same bit. \n\nNow, how do we form segments? \n   A segment is a contiguous block of the same bit. So if we have consecutive pairs of the same bit, they form one segment. \n\nFor example: \n   \"00\" \"00\" \"11\" \"11\" -> two segments: [0000] and [1111]. \n   \"00\" \"11\" \"00\" \"11\" -> four segments.\n\nBut note: we can merge adjacent segments of the same bit? Actually, if we have \"00\" followed by \"00\", that is the same bit, so they form one segment of length 4. \n\nSo the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of the same bit? \n\nBut we have pairs: each pair is either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\nSo the entire string is a sequence of pairs. We can represent each pair by the bit it uses (0 or 1). \n\nThen the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of the same bit? Actually, the entire string is a sequence of these pairs. The segment breaks when two consecutive pairs have different bits.\n\nTherefore, the number of segments is: 1 + (number of indices i from 0 to len-2 such that the bit of pair i is different from the bit of pair i+1).\n\nBut note: the entire string is of even length, and we have n/2 pairs.\n\nNow, the problem: \n   We are allowed to change bits arbitrarily. We can decide for each pair what bit to assign to it? But note: we can change any bit arbitrarily. \n\nHowever, we have already counted the number of operations: \n   For a pair that originally is \"00\" or \"11\", we don't need to change anything. \n   For a pair that is \"01\" or \"10\", we must change one of the two to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\nBut we have a choice: we can make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\nSo the minimal operations is fixed: it is the number of pairs that are not homogeneous (i.e., not \"00\" and not \"11\"). \n\nBut then we also want to minimize the number of segments. \n\nHow does the choice of the bit for each pair affect the number of segments?\n\nThe number of segments is determined by the sequence of bits we choose for the pairs. \n\nWe start with the first pair: we have a forced bit? Actually, no: we can choose either '0' or '1' for the first pair. \n\nBut note: the provided code initializes:\n   prebit = None\n\nThen for each pair that is homogeneous (so we don't change it) we do:\n   if prebit is None: \n        prebit = s[2*i]   (which is the same as s[2*i+1] because it's homogeneous)\n   else:\n        # then we compare the current pair's bit with prebit? \n\nBut what is the plan? \n\nWe want to count the number of segments. The segments are formed by consecutive pairs of the same bit. \n\nWe can traverse the pairs and form a sequence of bits (each bit representing the chosen bit for that pair). \n\nThe number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of the same bit. \n\nWe can simulate: \n   Start with the first pair: we set prebit to the bit of the first pair. \n   Then for each subsequent pair: \n        if the current pair's bit is the same as the previous pair's bit, then we are in the same segment.\n        else: we have a segment break, and we update prebit to the current bit.\n\nBut note: for the pairs that are not homogeneous, we have a choice: we can set the pair to either '0' or '1'. \n\nSo we want to choose the bit for each non-homogeneous pair in such a way that the number of segments is minimized.\n\nHow? \n\nWe can use dynamic programming? But note: the total length of all strings is 200000, and the number of pairs per string is n/2, so total pairs over test cases is 100000. \n\nBut the state: \n   dp[i][0] = (min_operations, min_segments) for the first i pairs ending with bit 0?\nBut we are also counting the operations? Actually, the operations are fixed: we must change every non-homogeneous pair (one operation per such pair). \n\nBut the choice of bit for the non-homogeneous pair does not change the operation count (we always use one operation per non-homogeneous pair). \n\nSo the operation count is fixed: it is the number of non-homogeneous pairs. \n\nThen we only need to minimize the number of segments. \n\nHow to minimize the segments? \n\nWe have a sequence of pairs. For homogeneous pairs, we have no choice: the bit is fixed. For non-homogeneous pairs, we can choose either '0' or '1'. \n\nWe want to assign bits to the non-homogeneous pairs so that the total number of segment breaks is minimized.\n\nThe segment breaks occur when two consecutive pairs have different bits.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   Let A[0..m-1] be the sequence of bits for the pairs, but for homogeneous pairs we know the bit, for non-homogeneous pairs we have a free choice.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of indices i such that A[i] != A[i-1] (for i>=1).\n\nWe can use a greedy or DP. \n\nBut note: the total length of the sequence of pairs is at most 100000? Actually, the total over test cases is 100000. \n\nBut the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total pairs is 100000.\n\nWe can do a linear scan. \n\nWe can simulate:\n\n   segments = 1   (for the first pair, we start a segment)\n   current_bit = the bit of the first pair (if the first pair is homogeneous, we know it; if non-homogeneous, we have a choice? But note: the first pair: if non-homogeneous, we can choose either 0 or 1. How does that affect the future? We don't know.)\n\nBut we can use a state machine: \n\n   state: the last bit (0 or 1) of the previous pair.\n\n   We traverse the pairs from left to right. \n\n   For the first pair: \n        if it is homogeneous: then we set last = that bit, and segments=1.\n        if it is non-homogeneous: we can choose either 0 or 1. We don't know which is better? \n\n   Then for each next pair:\n        if the pair is homogeneous: \n            if the bit is the same as last, then we don't break the segment.\n            else, we break (segments++), and update last to this bit.\n        if the pair is non-homogeneous: \n            we can choose the same as last to avoid a break, or choose the opposite to cause a break.\n\n   We want to minimize the breaks.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   Let dp[i][0] = minimum breaks for the first i pairs ending with bit 0\n   dp[i][1] = minimum breaks for the first i pairs ending with bit 1\n\nBut note: the homogeneous pairs are fixed. \n\nHowever, the total pairs over test cases is 100000, and we have two states per pair -> 200000 states, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem: we have up to 10000 test cases? But the total n is 200000, so the total pairs is 100000. So the total number of test cases t is at most 10000, but the total pairs is 100000, so the average n per test case is 200000/10000 = 20? Actually, the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total pairs is 100000. \n\nBut 100000 pairs is acceptable for a DP that runs in O(n) per test case? Actually, the total pairs is 100000, so we can do one DP over the entire set of pairs for all test cases? But note: the pairs are per test case. The total pairs is 100000, so we can do a DP for each test case that runs in O(m) where m is the number of pairs in that test case. \n\nBut the total m over test cases is 100000, so we can do a DP that runs in O(m) per test case and overall O(100000). \n\nAlternatively, we can do a greedy: \n\n   We note that we can avoid a break if we choose the same as the previous. \n\n   However, we might have a long run of non-homogeneous pairs. \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        segments = 1\n        last = ?   (for the first pair)\n\n        For the first pair:\n            if it is homogeneous: last = that bit.\n            else: we can choose arbitrarily? Actually, we can set last to either 0 or 1. We don't know which will lead to fewer breaks in the future? \n\n        But note: the future breaks only depend on the next pair. \n\n        Actually, we can do without DP: we can simulate and whenever we have a non-homogeneous pair, we choose the same as the previous to avoid a break. \n\n        Why is that optimal? \n\n        Consider: \n            ... last bit was b, then we have a non-homogeneous pair: we can set it to b (then no break) or to not b (then break). \n\n        To minimize breaks, we set it to b. \n\n        But what if the next pair is homogeneous and is not b? Then we break at the next. But if we set the non-homogeneous to not b, then we break now, but then the next pair (if homogeneous and not b) would not break? \n\n        Actually, the break between the non-homogeneous and the next pair: \n            if we set non-homogeneous to b: then if the next pair is homogeneous and is b -> no break; if next is homogeneous and not b -> break.\n            if we set non-homogeneous to not b: then if the next pair is homogeneous and is not b -> no break; if next is homogeneous and b -> break.\n\n        So the break at the next pair is independent of the choice of the non-homogeneous? It only depends on the next pair. \n\n        Therefore, the immediate break (between the previous and the non-homogeneous) is avoided if we choose the same as the previous. \n\n        And the break between the non-homogeneous and the next is unavoidable if the next pair is homogeneous and different from the chosen bit? \n\n        But wait: the next pair might be non-homogeneous? Then we can choose the next to match the current? \n\n        Actually, we are processing sequentially. \n\n        So the greedy: \n            Start with the first pair: \n                if homogeneous: set last = that bit, and segments=1.\n                if non-homogeneous: we can set it arbitrarily? But note: we want to minimize the segments. We set it to 0? or 1? \n                    Actually, we don't know the future. But we can set it arbitrarily and then update last. The segments count is 1 regardless.\n\n            Then for each next pair i:\n                if the pair is homogeneous: \n                    if the bit is the same as last, then no break (so segments unchanged)\n                    else, break (segments++), and update last to this bit.\n                if the pair is non-homogeneous:\n                    we can choose the same as last? Then no break (so segments unchanged) and last remains the same.\n                    or choose the opposite? then break (segments++) and last becomes the opposite.\n\n            But to minimize segments, we choose the same as last.\n\n        However, is that optimal? \n\n        Example: \n            First pair: non-homogeneous -> we set to 0 -> last=0, segments=1.\n            Second pair: non-homogeneous -> we set to 0 (same as last) -> no break, segments=1, last=0.\n            Third pair: homogeneous and bit=1 -> break, segments=2, last=1.\n\n        Alternatively, for the first pair: set to 1 -> last=1, segments=1.\n            second pair: set to 1 -> no break, segments=1, last=1.\n            third pair: homogeneous 1 -> no break, segments=1.\n\n        So the choice in the first pair matters.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily choose the first non-homogeneous pair. \n\n        How to handle the first pair? \n\n        We can do: \n            We know the entire sequence. We can do a DP that runs over the pairs. \n\n        But note: the total pairs over test cases is 100000, so we can do a DP for each test case. \n\n        Let m = n//2.\n\n        We'll create an array for the pairs: \n            For each pair i (0-indexed), we have:\n                if the pair is homogeneous: then the bit is fixed: \n                    if the pair is \"00\", then bit=0\n                    if the pair is \"11\", then bit=1\n                if the pair is non-homogeneous: then bit can be either 0 or 1.\n\n        We want to minimize the number of breaks: \n            breaks = 0\n            for i from 1 to m-1: \n                if bit[i] != bit[i-1]: breaks++\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 0   # breaks so far for the first pair set to 0? But we haven't had any break at the beginning.\n            dp[0][1] = 0\n\n            However, we also need to know the last bit for the next. \n\n            Actually, we don't care about the breaks in the first pair? \n\n            Then for i=0:\n                if the pair is homogeneous: \n                    then we have only one possibility: \n                        dp[0][b] = 0   (where b is the bit of the pair)\n                        and the other state is infinity? \n                if non-homogeneous: \n                    dp[0][0] = 0\n                    dp[0][1] = 0\n\n            Then for i from 1 to m-1:\n                for current bit in {0,1} (if the pair is non-homogeneous, then both; if homogeneous, then only the fixed bit):\n                    for prev bit in {0,1}:\n                        cost = 0\n                        if current_bit != prev_bit:\n                            cost = 1   (a break)\n                        dp[i][current_bit] = min(dp[i][current_bit], dp[i-1][prev_bit] + cost)\n\n            Then the total breaks = min(dp[m-1][0], dp[m-1][1])\n\n            And the number of segments = 1 + breaks? \n                Why? \n                    The number of segments is the number of contiguous groups. \n                    The breaks count the number of boundaries between consecutive pairs that are different. \n                    Then the number of segments = breaks + 1.\n\n            So mseg = 1 + min(dp[m-1][0], dp[m-1][1])\n\n        But note: the problem also requires the minimum number of operations? \n            The operations are fixed: it is the number of non-homogeneous pairs. \n\n        So we have:\n            operations = res = (number of pairs that are not homogeneous)   [which we already count in the provided code: res is incremented for each non-homogeneous pair]\n\n        Then we also compute the breaks by DP and then mseg = 1 + (min breaks at the end).\n\n        However, the provided code already has a variable `res` for the operations, and then we are to compute `mseg` (the minimum number of segments).\n\n        But the provided code does:\n\n            res = 0\n            mseg = 1   # but wait, the provided code initializes mseg=1? \n            prebit = None\n\n            for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                    res += 1\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]   # which is the same as s[2*i+1]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then print(res, mseg)\n\n        How does this fit? \n\n        The provided code is trying to compute the segments without DP? \n\n        Actually, the provided code uses `prebit` to store the last bit of the previous homogeneous pair? But what about non-homogeneous pairs? \n\n        The provided code does not account for non-homogeneous pairs in the `else` block? \n\n        We must change the code to do the DP? \n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a DP that runs in O(m) per test case and total O(100000). \n\n        However, the provided code structure is not set up for DP. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do the DP in the loop? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let last0 = None   # we'll do a DP with two states: the last bit can be 0 or 1, and we keep the minimal breaks so far for each state.\n\n            For the first pair i=0:\n                if homogeneous: \n                    bit = int(s[0])   # but note: the pair is homogeneous, so both are same. We can use s[0] (or s[1]) to get the bit.\n                    then state0: if we assign the bit, then breaks=0, and we have one segment.\n                    So we set:\n                         state0 = (bit0: breaks=0)   but we have two states? \n                    Actually, we have two states: we can only assign the fixed bit.\n\n                    So we set:\n                         dp0 = { bit: 0 }   # breaks=0 for the fixed bit.\n\n                if non-homogeneous: \n                    we can assign 0 or 1, so:\n                         dp0 = {0:0, 1:0}\n\n            Then for the next pair i=1 to m-1:\n                new_dp = {}\n                for current_bit in [available choices for this pair]:\n                    for prev_bit in dp0.keys():\n                        cost = 0\n                        if current_bit != prev_bit:\n                            cost = 1\n                        new_dp[current_bit] = min(new_dp.get(current_bit, float('inf')), dp0[prev_bit] + cost)\n\n                then set dp0 = new_dp\n\n            Then at the end, mseg = 1 + min(dp0.values())\n\n        But we must do this for each test case. \n\n        However, the provided code does not have this structure. \n\n        We have two options:\n          Option 1: change the entire loop to do DP.\n          Option 2: use the provided structure and do a greedy that is optimal? \n\n        But we saw that the greedy for the first pair matters. \n\n        Alternatively, we can note: \n\n          The breaks occur only between consecutive pairs.

We handled that.\n\n        However, the problem: the total breaks might be None? Actually, no: because we start with at least one pair.\n\n        But we must be cautious: if the first pair is homogeneous, then one state is set. If non-homogeneous, both states are set.\n\n        Then for the next pairs, we update accordingly.\n\n        Example: the first test case in the note: \n            s = \"1110011000\" -> but wait, the example in the note is not the same as the first test case? \n\n        The first test case in the note: \n            Input: \n                6\n                111010\n            Output: 3 2\n\n            How does our state machine work for \"111010\"?\n\n            Break into pairs: \n                pair0: \"11\" -> homogeneous, b=1 -> then state: dp0=None, dp1=0.\n                pair1: \"10\" -> non-homogeneous -> res=1, then we update:\n                    i=1: \n                        for choice0: \n                            from dp0: None -> skip\n                            from dp1: 0+1 = 1 -> so cand0=1\n                        for choice1: \n                            from dp0: None -> skip\n                            from dp1: 0 -> so cand1=0\n                        then dp0=1, dp1=0.\n                pair2: \"10\" -> non-homogeneous -> res=2, then update:\n                    for choice0: \n                         from dp0: 1 -> 1 (no break) \n                         from dp1: 0+1 = 1 -> min(1,1)=1 -> cand0=1\n                    for choice1:\n                         from dp0: 1+1=2\n                         from dp1: 0 (no break) -> 0 -> cand1=0\n                    then dp0=1, dp1=0.\n                pair3: \"00\" -> homogeneous, b=0 -> \n                    then we update:\n                    for b=0: \n                         from dp0: 1 (no break) -> 1\n                         from dp1: 0+1=1 -> so cand0=min(1,1)=1\n                    then dp0=1, dp1=None.\n\n                Then breaks = min(1, None)=1, mseg=1+1=2.\n\n            So we get: operations=3? but we counted 2? \n\n            Actually, we have 3 non-homogeneous pairs? \n                pairs: \n                    \"11\": homogeneous -> 0\n                    \"10\": non-homogeneous -> 1\n                    \"10\": non-homogeneous -> 1\n                    \"00\": homogeneous -> 0\n                total operations = 2.\n\n            But the example says 3 operations. \n\n            Why? \n\n            The example: \n                Change s3, s6, s7 to '0'. \n                s3: the third character? indexing from 1: \n                    s: 1 1 1 0 1 0 -> \n                    positions: \n                        1: '1'\n                        2: '1'\n                        3: '1' -> change to '0'\n                        4: '0' -> remains\n                        5: '1' -> change to '0'? \n                        6: '0' -> remains? \n                    But the example says change s3, s6, s7. \n                    The string is of length 6? so s7 is out of bound? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following.

How can we change s7? \n\n            I see: the example input is not \"111010\", but the example in the note says: \n                \"In the first test case, ...\"\n\n            The problem says: \n                \"The first contains a single positive integer t\"\n\n            The sample input: \n                t=?\n                then for the first test case: n=6, s=\"111010\"\n\n            The sample output: \n                3 2\n\n            So we must get 3 operations. \n\n            Why did we count 2? \n\n            We counted the non-homogeneous pairs: \n                \"11\" -> homogeneous -> 0\n                \"10\" -> non-homogeneous -> 1\n                \"10\" -> non-homogeneous -> 1\n                \"00\" -> homogeneous -> 0\n                total=2.\n\n            But wait: the string \"111010\" has 6 characters.
