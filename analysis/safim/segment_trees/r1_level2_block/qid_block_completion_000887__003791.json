So for second_char='a': \n                        \"aa\": c1='a' -> idx0: 1\n                        \"ca\": c1='c' -> idx2: 1\n                    arr = [1,0,1,0,...] -> total=2, pairs=1, subtract: 1 and 1 -> 0, so 1.\n\n                for 'c':\n                    strings: \"ac\", \"cc\", \"cc\" -> \n                    \"ac\": c1='a' -> idx0: 1\n                    \"cc\": c1='c' -> idx2: 1, then another \"cc\": idx2: 2\n                    arr = [1,0,2,0,...] -> total=3, pairs=3, subtract: 1 (from the 1) and 1 (from the 2: 2*1//2=1) -> 3-1=2. total_pairs from second_group = 1+2=3. total_pairs = 3+3 = 6. So it works. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are iterating over each string twice (once for first_group and once for second_group) and then over the groups (which are at most 11) and then over 11 per group, so total O(n + 11*11) per test case, which is acceptable.",

But the problem says we have strings of length 2.\n\n This indicates that the provided code might be for a different problem? \n\n But wait, the problem statement says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then gives the description.\n\n However, the provided code does not match the input (it reads integers, but we have strings). \n\n Therefore, I suspect that the provided code is actually for a different problem (maybe an inversion count problem) and we are to complete the segment tree and then use it for the current problem? \n\n But the problem we are solving is about strings of length 2 and operations that change the array in a specific way? \n\n Alternatively, note the note: \n   For the first example: \n        Input: 7\n               2 -2 1 4 2 -2 9\n        But wait, the example in the note had 7 stoves and the array [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9]? \n\n Actually, the example input in the note is: \n        \"For the first example, a sequence of operations that can be done is as follows: ... with A = [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9]\"\n\n So the input for a test case is an array of integers? \n\n But the problem says: \n        \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of strings. Then follows n lines, the i-th of which containing a single string s_i of length 2\"\n\n However, the example input in the note does not have strings? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\"\n\n But the example input: \n        \"For the first test case\" ... and then the array [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9] is shown.\n\n This suggests that the problem might have been transformed? \n\n Actually, note the operations: \n        Operation on stove i (with 2<=i<=N-1):\n            A_{i-1} becomes A_{i-1} + A_i\n            A_{i+1} becomes A_{i+1} + A_i\n            A_i becomes -A_i\n\n And we are to make all temperatures non-negative.\n\n How is this related to strings? \n\n The problem says: \"Given n strings, each of length 2\" but then the input example is integers? \n\n I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem input is strings? But the example uses integers? \n\n Actually, the example input for the first test case is 7 stoves and the array [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9]. \n\n So the problem is about an array of integers? \n\n But the problem says: \"each of which containing a single string of length 2\". \n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n After reading the problem again: \n        \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1\u2264t\u2264100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\u2264n\u226410^5) \u2014 the number of strings. Then follows n lines, the i-th of which containing a single string s_i of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'k'.\"\n\n So the input is strings. However, the example in the note uses integers? \n\n But wait, the note says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \n        and then lists pairs of strings? \n\n Example: \n        (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), ... \n\n So the example input for the first test case must be strings? \n\n However, the provided code in the problem reads integers? \n\n This is very confusing.\n\n Let me look at the provided code again:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\n This does not match the problem's input specification.\n\n Therefore, I must assume that the problem has been transformed? \n\n Alternatively, note that the problem title is \"Lemper Cooking Competition\" and the problem statement describes an operation on an array of integers? \n\n But the input says we are given strings? \n\n I see: the problem has two different parts? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n        \"Output the number of pairs (i, j) (i<j) such that the i-th string and the j-th string have exactly one position p (1<=p<=2) such that (s_i)_p != (s_j)_p.\"\n\n This is a counting problem on strings. \n\n How is the provided code (with segment tree) related? \n\n The provided code does:\n\n        A1 = []\n        curr = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            curr += A[i]\n            A1.append([curr, i])\n\n        Then it checks if the minimum prefix sum is negative or the maximum prefix sum is not equal to the last prefix sum? \n\n        Then it sorts A1 and then does an inversion count? \n\n This is typical for counting inversions? \n\n But the problem we are solving is about counting pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position? \n\n How can we relate? \n\n Let me think about the string problem:\n\n        We have n strings, each of length 2: s1, s2, ... , sn.\n\n        We want to count pairs (i, j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n        There are two cases:\n            Case 1: the first character is the same and the second character is different.\n            Case 2: the first character is different and the second character is the same.\n\n        So total pairs = (# of pairs with same first char and different second) + (# of pairs with same second char and different first)\n\n        But note: if we count these separately, we might overcount? Actually, no, because if they differ in exactly one position, then either the first is same and second differs OR the first differs and the second is same. They cannot differ in both and they cannot be the same.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Let:\n                freq1: frequency of each string (which is a pair of characters)\n\n            But note: we are not counting identical pairs? We are counting pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\n        Alternatively, we can group by the first character and then for each group (with same first char), the pairs that have different second char: \n            For a fixed first char c, let we have a list of second characters: [d1, d2, ...]. Then the number of pairs in this group that have different second char is not directly the total pairs? Actually, no: we want pairs that have the same first char and different second char? \n\n        Actually, for a fixed first char c, the number of pairs that have the same first char and the same second char is not what we want. We want pairs that have the same first char and different second char.\n\n        How to compute that? \n            Total pairs in the group: if there are k strings with first char c, then total pairs is C(k,2). \n            Then subtract the pairs that have the same second char? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_same_first = 0\n            for each first char c:\n                Let freq2 = frequency of second characters in the group of first char c.\n                Then the number of pairs in this group that have the same second char is: for each second char d, C(freq2[d], 2).\n                Then the number of pairs that have same first char and different second char = C(k,2) - sum_{d} C(freq2[d], 2)\n\n        Similarly, we can do for the second char: group by the second char, and then for each group (with same second char d), let the first characters form a list. Then the number of pairs that have same second char and different first char = C(m,2) - sum_{c} C(freq1_in_d[c], 2)   [where m is the total in the group for d]\n\n        Then total = (for first char groups) + (for second char groups)\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require grouping by the entire string? It only requires that they differ in exactly one position. \n\n        But wait: if two strings are identical, they are not counted (because they don't differ in any position). If they differ in two positions, they are not counted. So we are only counting the pairs that differ in exactly one.\n\n        The above method counts:\n            Group by first char: we count pairs that have same first char and different second char -> these are pairs that differ only in the second.\n            Group by second char: we count pairs that have same second char and different first char -> these are pairs that differ only in the first.\n\n        So total = (count1) + (count2)\n\n        But note: the entire string is two characters. So if two strings are (a,b) and (a,c), they are counted in the first group (same first char 'a', different second char). Similarly, (a,b) and (c,b) are counted in the second group (same second char 'b', different first char). \n\n        This seems correct.\n\n        However, the constraints: n up to 10^5, and the total n over test cases <= 10^5? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". So we can do O(n) per test case? \n\n        But note: the alphabet is from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters. So we can use arrays of size 11 for frequencies? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let's create:\n                group_by_first = {}   # key: first char, value: dictionary for second char frequencies? Or we can just use a list and then use a frequency array for the 11 letters? \n\n            Since the second character is in 'a' to 'k', we can map the char to an index (0 to 10).

The above count is an integer that might be large.\n\n        But wait: is this correct? \n\n        Example: the second test case: \n            Input: \n                3\n                aa\n                cc\n                ac\n                ca\n                cc\n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                    (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n            But note: the example lists 6 pairs? However, the example input has 4 strings? \n\n            Actually, the example input for the second test case: \n                n=3? but then 3 lines? \n\n            The example says: \n                The second test case: \n                    pairs: \n                        (\"aa\", \"ac\")\n                        (\"aa\", \"ca\")\n                        (\"cc\", \"ac\")\n                        (\"cc\", \"ca\")\n                        (\"ac\", \"aa\")   -> but this is the same as (\"aa\",\"ac\")? \n                        (\"ca\", \"aa\")   -> same as (\"aa\",\"ca\")?\n\n            This is confusing. The example says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\"\n\n            But note: the problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j. So the pair (i,j) is ordered by index. \n\n            The example input for the second test case: \n                n=4? because it lists 4 strings: \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", and then \"cc\" again? \n\n            Actually, the example input for the second test case: \n                \"The second test case the first line contains a single integer n\" \u2014 but the example doesn't specify n? \n\n            The note says: \n                \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\\\"aa\\\", \\\"ac\\\"), (\\\"aa\\\", \\\"ca\\\"), (\\\"cc\\\", \\\"ac\\\"), (\\\"cc\\\", \\\"ca\\\"), (\\\"ac\\\", \\\"aa\\\") and (\\\"ca\\\", \\\"aa\\\")\"\n\n            This has 6 pairs?

And the alphabet is only 11 letters. So the inner loops (over the 11 letters) is constant.\n\n        But note: the problem input has t test cases, and the sum of n <= 10^5. So we can do:\n\n            for each test case:\n                read n\n                read n strings\n\n                first_group = defaultdict(lambda: [0]*11)   # but we don't need an array? We can use a Counter which is a dict, and the keys are only 11, so it's O(1) per group.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                first_group = defaultdict(Counter)\n                for each string s:\n                    c1 = s[0]\n                    c2 = s[1]\n                    first_group[c1][c2] += 1\n\n                Then for each key in first_group, we iterate over the counter (which has at most 11 keys) -> so O(1) per group.\n\n            Similarly for second_group.\n\n        Therefore, the overall complexity is O(n) per test case.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n        However, the provided code in the problem is:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n                ... and then what? \n\n        The provided code does not have the segment tree part? \n\n        Actually, the provided code is:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n                # Then what? \n\n        And then it does:\n\n            for jj in range(n):\n                ... \n\n        But then the code breaks because the next part is:\n\n            A1 = []\n            curr = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                curr += A[i]   # but A is not defined? \n\n        This suggests that the provided code is incomplete and also the variable names are inconsistent.\n\n        Therefore, we must replace the entire code for the test case processing.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                ... \n\n        And then we have to complete the code.\n\n        However, the provided code after reading the strings does:\n\n            A1 = []\n            curr = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                curr += A[i]   # but A is not defined. \n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        I think the provided code is for a different problem? \n\n        The problem we are solving is about strings, but the provided code uses an array A of integers? \n\n        Therefore, I suspect that the problem statement and the provided code are mismatched.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then gives the description of the lemper cooking problem? \n\n        However, the lemper cooking problem is about an array of integers? \n\n        Let me read the lemper cooking problem again: \n            \"Given n strings, each of length 2\" ... \n\n        But then the example input for the lemper cooking problem is integers? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        After re-examining: \n            The problem title: \"Lemper Cooking Competition\" and the operation described is on an array of integers? \n\n            But the input says: n strings of length 2? \n\n        There are two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: The problem is about strings and we are to count pairs that differ in one position. The provided code is for a different problem (inversion count) and we are to replace it.\n\n        Possibility 2: The problem is about the lemper cooking (with integers) and the input is integers? But the problem says \"strings\". \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \n            \"Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\"\n\n        So it must be strings.\n\n        But the example input in the note is integers? \n\n        I see: the note says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \" \n            and then lists pairs of strings? \n\n        And then it says: \n            \"For the first example, a sequence of operations that can be done is as follows: ... with A = [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9]\"\n\n        This suggests that there are two different examples? \n\n        The problem has two examples? \n\n        Actually, the problem has two examples: \n            Example 1: the string example (with 7 strings? but the array [2,-2,...] is the result of operations? not the input)\n\n        I think the problem is: \n            We are given strings of length 2? \n            But then we are to do operations? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"output the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i<j and the i-th string and the j-th string differ in exactly one position\"\n\n        This is a static counting problem. There are no operations to be done on the strings. \n\n        The lemper cooking problem with operations is a different problem? \n\n        The problem statement says: \n            \"Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. ...

The actual problem: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1845/problem/C? \n            But the problem you described (with the operations) is from Codeforces Round 881 (Div. 3) - Problem C.\n\n        However, the problem you described as the counting of pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position is from: \n            https://codeforces.com/contest/1547/problem/B\n\n        But wait, the problem ID 1547B is \"Alphabetical Strings\", not this.\n\n        Alternatively, I recall a problem: \n            Codeforces Round #734 (Div. 3) - Problem B1: Wonderful Coloring - 1? \n\n        But the problem that matches the description of counting pairs of strings of length 2 that differ in exactly one position is: \n            Codeforces Round #734 (Div. 3) - Problem B2: Wonderful Coloring - 2? \n\n        Actually, no. \n\n        There is a problem: \n            Codeforces Round #735 (Div. 2) - Problem B: Cobb \n        but that is different.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be: \n            \"Two Strings\" or \"Swaps\" but not exactly.\n\n        Given the confusion, and since the problem states: \n            \"Given n strings, each of length 2, ... output the number of pairs ... \"\n\n        and the example with 6 pairs, I will assume that the problem is the string counting problem.\n\n        Therefore, I will complete the provided code to solve the string counting problem.\n\n        The provided code currently reads:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n\n                # Then what? \n\n        We need to replace the rest.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        So we are to complete the code from the point after reading the list of strings.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            from collections import defaultdict, Counter\n\n            # We have list 'a' of n strings.\n\n            # We'll create two dictionaries: \n            first_group = defaultdict(Counter)   # for each first char, a Counter of second chars\n            for s in a:\n                first_char = s[0]\n                second_char = s[1]\n                first_group[first_char][second_char] += 1\n\n            total_pairs = 0\n\n            # For the first grouping: by first char\n            for first_char, counter in first_group.items():\n                total_in_group = sum(counter.values())\n                pairs_in_group = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n                for count_second in counter.values():\n                    pairs_in_group -= count_second*(count_second-1)//2\n                total_pairs += pairs_in_group\n\n            second_group = defaultdict(Counter)\n            for s in a:\n                first_char = s[0]\n                second_char = s[1]\n                second_group[second_char][first_char] += 1\n\n            for second_char, counter in second_group.items():\n                total_in_group = sum(counter.values())\n                pairs_in_group = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n                for count_first in counter.values():\n                    pairs_in_group -= count_first*(count_first-1)//2\n                total_pairs += pairs_in_group\n\n            print(total_pairs)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer may be large and we should use 64-bit integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\n        But the problem also says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we are safe.\n\n        But wait: the provided code has a variable 'co' and 'x' that are not used. We can ignore them.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to replace the entire block after reading the list 'a'? \n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            for jj in range(n):\n                a.append(input())\n\n            # and then we are to complete.\n\n        We'll replace from the point after reading.\n\n        But note: the provided code has:\n\n            A1 = []\n            curr = 0\n            ... \n\n        This is not needed. We are not using that.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n            from collections import defaultdict, Counter   # but we have to put this at the top? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the missing block is inside the for-ii loop.\n\n        But the import is at the top? \n\n        We can put the import at the top of the file? But the provided code does not have it.\n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        We are to complete program1.py.\n\n        The provided program1.py does not have the import. So we must include it in the missing block? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid importing by using a different method? \n\n        Since the alphabet is small, we can use arrays of size 11 for each group? \n\n        But then we would need to map char to index: \n\n            chars = 'abcdefghijk'\n            mapping: char to index: { ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(chars) }\n\n        Then for first_group, we can have a dictionary that maps first char to an array of 11 integers? \n\n        But then we lose the defaultdict behavior? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do without Counter? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            first_group = {}\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                if c1 not in first_group:\n                    # create an array of 11 zeros for the 11 letters\n                    first_group[c1] = [0]*11\n                # map c2 to an index: \n                idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                first_group[c1][idx] += 1\n\n            Then for each first_char in first_group:\n                arr = first_group[first_char]\n                total = sum(arr)\n                pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in arr:\n                    pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                total_pairs += pairs\n\n            Similarly for second_group.\n\n        But note: the alphabet is from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters, so we can do:\n\n            total_letters = 11\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the string might contain only a subset of the letters, but we are iterating over 11 for each group. The total groups might be up to 11 (for first char) and then for each group we do 11 iterations. The total work for first_group: 11*11 = 121 per test case. And similarly for second_group: 121. So total 242 per test case. And the total test cases t <= 100, so 100*242 = 24200, which is acceptable.\n\n        But the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100, so 100 test cases, and the sum of n is 10^5, so the worst-case test case might have 1000 stoves? But the number of groups is at most 11, so it's constant.\n\n        But we are not using n in the inner loop? We are only iterating over the groups and then over 11 letters per group.\n\n        So we can do without importing defaultdict and Counter.\n\n        Steps for program1.py:\n\n            We are in the loop for test cases:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                a = []\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input().strip())\n\n                # Now, we want to count the pairs.\n\n                # We'll create a mapping from char to index: \n                #   We know the letters are from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters.\n\n                # But we don't need to map the first char to an index? We only need to map the second char to an index for the array.\n\n                # For first_group: dictionary mapping first_char to an array of 11 integers (for 'a' to 'k')\n                first_group = {}\n                for s in a:\n                    c1 = s[0]\n                    c2 = s[1]\n                    idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                    if c1 not in first_group:\n                        first_group[c1] = [0]*11\n                    first_group[c1][idx] += 1\n\n                total_pairs = 0\n\n                for c1, arr in first_group.items():\n                    total = sum(arr)\n                    pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                    for count in arr:\n                        pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += pairs\n\n                second_group = {}\n                for s in a:\n                    c1 = s[0]\n                    c2 = s[1]\n                    idx = ord(c1) - ord('a')   # now we are grouping by second_char, and within the group, we count the first_char\n                    if c2 not in second_group:\n                        second_group[c2] = [0]*11\n                    second_group[c2][idx] += 1\n\n                for c2, arr in second_group.items():\n                    total = sum(arr)\n                    pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                    for count in arr:\n                        pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += pairs\n\n                print(total_pairs)\n\n        But note: the array for a group might have counts for letters that are not in the group? But we are iterating over the entire array of 11, including zeros. That's fine.\n\n        However, we are using integer arithmetic: count*(count-1)//2 for count=0 is 0.\n\n        This should work.\n\n        But let's test with the second test case:\n\n            n=5, strings: \n                \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\"\n\n            first_group:\n                for 'a': \n                    strings: \"aa\", \"ac\" -> \n                    for \"aa\": c2='a' -> idx=0 -> arr[0] becomes 1, then \"ac\": c2='c' -> idx=2 -> arr[2] becomes 1.\n                    arr = [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n                    total = 2\n                    pairs = 2*1//2 = 1\n                    subtract: for count in arr: \n                        1: 0, 0:0, 1: 1 -> 1-0-0 = 1? \n                    so 1.\n\n                for 'c':\n                    strings: \"cc\", \"ca\", \"cc\" -> \n                    \"cc\": c2='c' -> idx=2 -> count at 2: 1, then \"ca\": c2='a' -> idx=0 -> 1, then \"cc\": idx=2 -> becomes 2.\n                    arr = [1,0,2,0,...] \n                    total = 3\n                    pairs = 3\n                    subtract: \n                        1: 0\n                        0:0\n                        2: 2*1//2 = 1\n                        ... -> 3-1 = 2.\n                total_pairs from first_group = 1+2 = 3.\n\n            second_group:\n                for 'a': \n                    strings: \"aa\", \"ca\" -> \n                    for \"aa\": c1='a' -> idx=0 -> [1,0,...]\n                    for \"ca\": c1='c' -> idx=2 -> [1,0,1,0,...] -> but wait, we are grouping by second_char='a'. \n                    So for second_char='a': \n                        \"aa\": c1='a' -> idx0: 1\n                        \"ca\": c1='c' -> idx2: 1\n                    arr = [1,0,1,0,...] -> total=2, pairs=1, subtract: 1 and 1 -> 0, so 1.\n\n                for 'c':\n                    strings: \"ac\", \"cc\", \"cc\" -> \n                    \"ac\": c1='a' -> idx0: 1\n                    \"cc\": c1='c' -> idx2: 1, then another \"cc\": idx2: 2\n                    arr = [1,0,2,0,...] -> total=3, pairs=3, subtract: 1 (from the 1) and 1 (from the 2: 2*1//2=1) -> 3-1=2.\n                total_pairs from second_group = 1+2=3.\n\n            total_pairs = 3+3 = 6.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are iterating over each string twice (once for first_group and once for second_group) and then over the groups (which are at most 11) and then over 11 per group, so total O(n + 11*11) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n            # We have list 'a' of n strings.\n\n            # We'll create two dictionaries: \n            first_group = {}\n            for s in a:\n                c1 = s[0]\n                c2 = s[1]\n                idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                if c1 not in first_group:\n                    first_group[c1] = [0]*11\n                first_group[c1][idx] += 1\n\n            total_pairs = 0\n\n            for key in first_group:\n                arr = first_group[key]\n                total = sum(arr)\n                pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in arr:\n                    pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                total_pairs += pairs\n\n            second_group = {}\n            for s in a:\n                c1 = s[0]\n                c2 = s[1]\n                idx = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                if c2 not in second_group:\n                    second_group[c2] = [0]*11\n                second_group[c2][idx] += 1\n\n            for key in second_group:\n                arr = second_group[key]\n                total = sum(arr)\n                pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in arr:\n                    pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                total_pairs += pairs\n\n            print(total_pairs)\n\n        But note: the variable 'co' and 'x' are defined in the provided code and not used.

Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the output format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So we must fill in both program1.py and program2.py? \n\n        But the problem only provides program1.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in the description only program1.py is provided.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\", and then the description, and then the code for program1.py.\n\n        And then it says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the example output format has two fields.\n\n        I think there might be a mistake: only program1.py is provided, and program2.py is not provided? \n\n        But the command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        This suggests that program1.py outputs something that is piped to program2.py.\n\n        And the output specification for program1.py is: \n            For each test case, print a single integer.\n\n        So program1.py outputs the answers for each test case, one per line? \n\n        Then program2.py might be a checker or a formatter? \n\n        But the problem does not provide program2.py.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is also missing code? \n\n        But the problem only shows program1.py.\n\n        Given the confusion, and since the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but only program1.py is provided, I will assume that program2.py is not provided and we only need to complete program1.py.\n\n        However, the output format requires both.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is provided in full? \n\n        But the problem says \"with missing lines or blocks\".\n\n        Since we are not given program2.py, we cannot complete it.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the example output format has two fields.\n\n        I think we should output the completion for program1.py and leave program2.py as empty string? \n\n        Or perhaps program2.py is not missing any code? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks that you must fill in\"\n\n        If program2.py is complete, then we don't need to fill in.\n\n        But we are not given program2.py.\n\n        Given the constraints, I will output only for program1.py and for program2.py output an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py' runs correctly\"\n\n        If program2.py is not provided, we cannot know what it does.\n\n        This is a dilemma.\n\n        After re-reading: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in the input we only see program1.py. \n\n        Therefore, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n        Since the problem only provides program1.py, and we are to complete it, and there is no information about program2.py, I will assume that program2.py is not missing any code and is provided in full elsewhere. \n\n        But then we don't need to output anything for program2.py.\n\n        However, the output format requires both. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is the same for all and we don't need to change it? \n\n        Given the time, I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py I will output an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n        And if program2.py has no missing code, then we output empty string for program2.\n\n        So:\n\n            \"program1\": \"the code we wrote above\",\n            \"program2\": \"\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\", implying both have missing parts.\n\n        Without program2.py, we cannot complete it.\n\n        Therefore, I will only output for program1.py and hope that program2.py is provided in full.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that program2.py is the following (as seen in common problems) but not provided? \n\n        Common program2.py for competitive programming problems: it might be a program that checks the output or does nothing? \n\n        Given the lack of information, and since the problem only provides program1.py, I will complete only program1.py.\n\n        But the output format requires both. \n\n        I decide to output for program1.py and for program2.py I output an empty string.\n\n        However, the problem might be that program2.py is also provided in the same manner? But we are not given it.\n\n        This is a problem in the problem statement.\n\n        Given the above, I will output the completion for program1.py as described.\n\n        But note: the provided program1.py has a class SegmentTree defined. We are not using it. \n\n        We are replacing the entire block after reading the list 'a'. \n\n        The current program1.py:\n\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline \n\n            class SegmentTree:\n                ... (the entire class definition)\n\n            def process(A):   # but this function is defined but not used in the test case loop?\n                ... \n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n        This is for a different problem! \n\n        This suggests that the provided program1.py is for a problem that reads an array of integers and then calls process(A). \n\n        But our problem reads test cases and then for each test case reads n and then n strings.\n\n        Therefore, we must also replace the entire structure.\n\n        The provided program1.py is:\n\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline \n\n            class SegmentTree:\n                ... \n\n            def process(A):\n                ... \n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n        But we are to read t test cases.\n\n        So we must change the main part.\n\n        The missing block might be the entire code after the import and the class? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the provided code has the class and the function and then the main.\n\n        We are to replace from the def process(A) to the end? \n\n        Or from the main part? \n\n        Given the provided code in the problem for the test cases:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n\n        This is not present in the current program1.py.\n\n        Therefore, I think we are to replace the entire main block and the process function.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the provided code has the SegmentTree class. We are not using it, but we are not to remove it? \n\n        The problem does not say we can remove existing code.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we are to fill in the missing parts. The SegmentTree class is provided and not missing, so we leave it.\n\n        But then the main part is:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n        This is not suitable for our problem.\n\n        Therefore, we must replace the main part and the process function.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py\", and it includes the SegmentTree class. We are not using it, but we are not allowed to remove it? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that the provided program1.py is a template and we are to complete it by filling in the missing parts, but the missing parts are only in the process function and the main part? \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem states the input format has t test cases, I will replace the entire main part and the process function.\n\n        Steps for program1.py:\n\n            We keep the import and the SegmentTree class.\n\n            Then we replace from the line \"def process(A):\" to the end.\n\n        We'll define a new process for the string counting problem, but note: the function process(A) in the provided code takes an array of integers, but we have strings.\n\n        So we change the function to handle test cases.\n\n        Alternatively, we can remove the function and do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n                # then our counting code\n\n        But the provided code has a function process(A) that is called. We are not using it.\n\n        Given the constraints, I will output for program1.py the following completion:\n\n            We remove the function process and the main lines at the bottom, and replace with:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n                    first_group = {}\n                    for s in a:\n                        c1 = s[0]\n                        c2 = s[1]\n                        idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                        if c1 not in first_group:\n                            first_group[c1] = [0]*11\n                        first_group[c1][idx] += 1\n\n                    total_pairs = 0\n\n                    for key in first_group:\n                        arr = first_group[key]\n                        total = sum(arr)\n                        pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                        for count in arr:\n                            pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                        total_pairs += pairs\n\n                    second_group = {}\n                    for s in a:\n                        c1 = s[0]\n                        c2 = s[1]\n                        idx = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                        if c2 not in second_group:\n                            second_group[c2] = [0]*11\n                        second_group[c2][idx] += 1\n\n                    for key in second_group:\n                        arr = second_group[key]\n                        total = sum(arr)\n                        pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                        for count in arr:\n                            pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                        total_pairs += pairs\n\n                    print(total_pairs)\n\n        But note: the input might be large, and we are using sys.stdin.buffer.readline? \n\n        The provided code has: \n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\n        So we should use input().strip() for each string.\n\n        However, the strings are of length 2, so we can use input().strip().\n\n        But the newline might be an issue? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            s = input().decode().strip()\n\n        because sys.stdin.buffer.readline returns bytes? \n\n        But in Python, if we use sys.stdin.buffer.readline, then we get bytes. \n\n        The provided code uses:\n\n            a.append(input())\n\n        but 'input' is set to sys.stdin.buffer.readline, which returns bytes. \n\n        We can change to text by using .decode(), or we can use sys.stdin instead.\n\n        But the provided code at the top: \n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\n        So we are getting bytes. \n\n        Therefore, we should decode:\n\n            s = input().decode().strip()\n\n        But the problem says the input is text.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the input to text by using:\n\n            input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n        But the provided code sets it to buffer.readline.\n\n        To be safe, we can decode:\n\n            for _ in range(n):\n                s = input().decode().strip()\n                a.append(s)\n\n        But the first integer t: \n\n            t = int(input().decode().strip())\n\n        However, the provided code at the bottom originally did:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\n        This would fail because input() returns bytes and split() on bytes? \n\n        Given that we are replacing that part, we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().decode().strip())\n\n        and then for each test case:\n\n            n = int(input().decode().strip())\n\n        and for each string:\n\n            s = input().decode().strip()\n\n        But this is inefficient? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the input to text at the top? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the top is not missing.\n\n        Therefore, in the main block we will use .decode(). \n\n        However, the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so it's acceptable.\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            t = int(input().decode().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().decode().strip())\n                a = []\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s = input().decode().strip()\n                    a.append(s)\n                first_group = {}\n                for s in a:\n                    c1 = s[0]\n                    c2 = s[1]\n                    idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\n                    if c1 not in first_group:\n                        first_group[c1] = [0]*11\n                    first_group[c1][idx] += 1\n\n                total_pairs = 0\n\n                for key in first_group:\n                    arr = first_group[key]\n                    total = sum(arr)\n                    pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                    for count in arr:\n                        pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += pairs\n\n                second_group = {}\n                for s in a:\n                    c1 = s[0]\n                    c2 = s[1]\n                    idx = ord(c1) - ord('a')\n                    if c2 not in second_group:\n                        second_group[c2] = [0]*11\n                    second_group[c2][idx] += 1\n\n                for key in second_group:\n                    arr = second_group[key]\n                    total = sum(arr)\n                    pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                    for count in arr:\n                        pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += pairs\n\n                print(total_pairs)\n\n        But note: the provided code has a class SegmentTree and a function process that are not used. We are not using them. \n\n        The problem does not say we can remove them, so we leave them.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is from the line after the class SegmentTree to the end of the file.\n\n        We are replacing the function process and the main with the above.\n\n        However, the provided code after the class SegmentTree is:\n\n            def process(A):\n                ... \n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n        We are replacing that entire part.\n\n        So for program1.py, the completion is the above block.\n\n        For program2.py, since we are not given any code, we output an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", so we must assume program2.py is provided and has missing parts? \n\n        Given the lack of information, I will output an empty string for program2.py.\n\n        Final output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"t = int(input().decode().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().decode().strip())\\n    a = []\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        s = input().decode().strip()\\n        a.append(s)\\n    first_group = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        c1 = s[0]\\n        c2 = s[1]\\n        idx = ord(c2) - ord('a')\\n        if c1 not in first_group:\\n            first_group[c1] = [0]*11\\n        first_group[c1][idx] += 1\\n\\n    total_pairs = 0\\n\\n    for key in first_group:\\n        arr = first_group[key]\\n        total = sum(arr)\\n        pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n        for count in arr:\\n            pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n        total_pairs += pairs\\n\\n    second_group = {}\\n    for s in a:\\n        c1 = s[0]\\n        c2 = s[1]\\n        idx = ord(c1) - ord('a')\\n        if c2 not in second_group:\\n            second_group[c2] = [0]*11\\n        second_group[c2][idx] += 1\\n\\n    for key in second_group:\\n        arr = second_group[key]\\n        total = sum(arr)\\n        pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n        for count in arr:\\n            pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n        total_pairs += pairs\\n\\n    print(total_pairs)\",\n                \"program2\": \"\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the provided program1.py has a SegmentTree class. We are not removing it, so the final program1.py will have:\n\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline \n\n            class SegmentTree:\n                ... (as provided)\n\n            # Then our new code for the test cases.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, the SegmentTree class might be for program2.py? \n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", and we are given program1.py with the SegmentTree class.\n\n        And we are not given program2.py.\n\n        Therefore, I output the above.\n\n        But note: the problem says the answer may be large, and we are using //2 for integer arithmetic. This is fine.\n\n        Let me hope.\n\n        However, there is a possibility that the problem intended the lemper cooking problem (with the array of integers) and the provided code for program1.py is for that, and the string counting problem is a different one.\n\n        Given the time, and since the problem description matches the string counting problem, I output the above.\n\n        If the problem intended the lemper cooking problem, then we would have to solve that.\n\n        But the problem description says: \"Given n strings, each of length 2\"\n\n        So I think we are correct.\n\n        We output the json."
