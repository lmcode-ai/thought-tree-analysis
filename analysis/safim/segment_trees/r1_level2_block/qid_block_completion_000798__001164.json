So the entire array sum = a + bw[n-i-2]? But then we require a = bw[n-i-2]? Then 2*a = entire array sum. So the condition a == bw[n-i-2] is exactly the condition for the entire array to be partitioned fairly. Therefore, we can do:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n        mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut note: the entire array candidate is n, which is the maximum possible. So we can break early? But we are iterating i, and we want the maximum over i. But n is the maximum, so we can break? But it is possible that for a larger i we get a candidate that is also n? But if we have the entire array partitioned fairly, then there is only one way: the total sum must be even and the prefix sum at i must be total_sum/2. But there might be multiple i that satisfy a = total_sum/2? For example: \n   w = [1,2,1,2] -> total_sum=6, then at i=0: a=1 -> not 3. i=1: a=3 -> then we check bw[n-1-2] = bw[4-1-2]=bw[1] -> the reversed array is [2,1,2,1] -> prefix: [2,3,5,6] -> bw[1]=3 -> matches. Then we update mx = max(mx, 4) = 4. But also at i=2: a=1+2+1=4 -> not 3. So only one i. But what if we have: \n   w = [1,1,1,1] -> total_sum=4. i=0: a=1 -> not 2. i=1: a=2 -> then bw[4-1-2]=bw[1] = (reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3,4]) -> bw[1]=2 -> matches -> update mx=4. i=2: a=3 -> not 2. So only one i. But what if we have multiple splits? w = [2,0,0,2] -> but weights are at least 1? So no. Therefore, we can do: In the TODO block:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        # Check the entire array candidate for this i? j = n - i - 2   # the candidate index in bw for the entire array\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            candidate = max(candidate, n)   # but candidate might be from the bisect which is less than n? #",

But note: the bisect did not find j because we set hi = n-i-2 (exclusive) so j = n-i-2 is not included. So we do:\n\n        candidate1 = i+1 + c+1\n        candidate2 = 0\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            candidate2 = n   # because they eat the entire array: (i+1) + (n-i-1) = n\n        mx = max(mx, candidate1, candidate2) But note: candidate2 might be 0 if the condition fails.

But it is possible that for a larger i we get a candidate that is also n? But if we have the entire array partitioned fairly, then the total sum is even and the prefix sum at i must be total_sum/2. And there is only one such i? But what if there are multiple i that yield a = total_sum/2? For example: w = [1, 2, 2, 1] -> total_sum=6. i=0: a=1 -> not 3.\n        i=1: a=1+2=3 -> then j = n-1-2 = 4-1-2=1 -> bw[1] = (reversed: [1,2,2,1] -> prefix: [1,3,5,6]) -> bw[1]=3 -> matches -> update mx = max(mx, 4) = 4.\n        i=2: a=1+2+2=5 -> not 3. But what if: w = [1, 1, 1, 1] -> total_sum=4.\n        i=0: a=1 -> not 2. i=1: a=2 -> then j=4-1-2=1 -> bw[1]= (reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3,4]) -> bw[1]=2 -> matches -> update mx=4. i=2: a=3 -> not 2. Another example: w = [2, 2, 2, 2] -> same. But what if: w = [1, 3, 1, 1] -> total_sum=6.\n        i=0: a=1 -> not 3. i=1: a=4 -> not 3.\n        i=2: a=5 -> not 3. So only one i per test case can yield a = total_sum/2? But note: the prefix sums are strictly increasing (since weights are positive). So there is at most one i such that a = total_sum/2.",

But the entire array candidate is n, and the candidate from the bisect is (i+1)+(c+1) which is at most n (if c = n-i-2, then it is n). So if c = n-i-2, then we update mx to n twice? But that's okay. But we can avoid the extra check if we know that c is not n-i-2? But it's simpler to do the check. But note: the condition n-i-2>=0 might be false for the last few i? For i = n-1: n-i-2 = n-1-2 = n-3? -> if n>=3, then for i=n-1: n-i-2 = n-1-2 = n-3? -> but wait: i runs from 0 to n-1. i = n-1: n-i-2 = n - (n-1) - 2 = -1 -> skip. For i = n-2: n-i-2 = n - (n-2) - 2 = 0 -> valid. So we are safe. Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1 if candidate > mx:\n            mx = candidate\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and a == bw[j]:\n            if n > mx:\n                mx = n\n\n   Or simply:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the entire array candidate might be found in multiple test cases? But we are in the loop for one test case. So we write:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n) But wait: what if the entire array candidate is not valid because of non-overlap? But we know the non-overlap condition is automatically satisfied. So we do that. But note: the condition in the if-statement for the bisect candidate already checked non-overlap?",

Known solution in the provided code structure from known submissions:\n\n                         if w % a <= 2 and (l-1) % a == 0: \n                             then add a\n\n                         also if (w-1) % a == 0 and l % a <= 2: \n                             then add a\n\n                    But the provided code only has one condition: \n                         mod_a = w % a\n                         if mod_a <= 2:\n                             # then what? So in the TODO block, we might need to check several conditions. After reading a known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces Round #784, G. Fall Down), we see:\n\n                         ans = set()\n                         half = w + l - 2\n                         for x in range(1, int(half**0.5)+1): if half % x == 0:\n                                 for a in [x, half//x]:\n                                     # check if a is valid\n                                     if a > half: continue\n                                     # scenario 1: no wrap on w, wrap on l? if w % a <= 2 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a) if (w-1) % a == 0 and l % a <= 2:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n                                     if (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a) if w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n\n                         then also consider a=1 and a=2. But the provided code already has solutions = {1,2} and then iterates. So in the TODO block, we might do:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l % a == 0) or ((l-2) % a == 0): \n                             then add a? But we have to use the condition on w (mod_a<=2) and then check l.\n\n                    Specifically, the known conditions are:\n\n                         Condition 1: if (w % a <= 2) and ((l-1) % a == 0) -> valid. Condition 2: if (w % a <= 2) and ((l-2) % a == 0) -> valid? Condition 3: if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a == 0) -> valid. But wait: \n                         Condition 1: \n                             w % a is 0,1, or 2.\n                             (l-1) % a == 0 -> l % a = 1. Condition 2: \n                             (l-2) % a == 0 -> l % a = 2. Condition 3:\n                             l % a == 0. So these cover all possibilities for l mod a: 0,1,2. Therefore, if w % a <=2, then regardless of l mod a (as long as it is 0,1, or 2) it is valid? But that is not true. For example, a=4, w=3, l=5: \n                         w % a = 3, which is not <=2 -> skip.\n\n                    a=3: \n                         w=3, a=3: 3%3=0<=2 -> valid. then we need to check l=5: Condition1: (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> not 0. Condition2: (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> valid. So we add a=3.\n\n                    a=2: \n                         w=3: 3%2=1<=2 -> valid. l=5: \n                             Condition1: (5-1)%2=4%2=0 -> valid. a=1: already in the set.\n\n                    a=4: skipped.\n\n                    a=6: half_perimeter = 3+5-2=6, so a=6: \n                         w=3: 3%6=3 -> not<=2 -> skip.\n\n                    a=6 is not added. But the valid a are 1,2,3. So it works. Therefore, in the TODO block, we can do:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a) But wait: the condition is that at least one of these holds?

No, for example, l=7, a=5: 7 mod 5 = 2 -> valid? But is a=5 valid for w and l? We passed w % a <=2, say w= something that gives remainder 0,1, or 2. Then we would add a=5. But is a=5 valid for a bathroom of size w x l? The boundary length = 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a=5? But we are iterating the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2, so if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a only if a also divides 2? or not necessarily? Actually, half_perimeter = w+l-2, and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, so half_perimeter = k * a. Then the boundary length = 2 * half_perimeter = 2*k*a, which is divisible by a. So the divisibility of the boundary is guaranteed. Then the only conditions are on the segments: which we are checking by the remainders.",

The provided code in program2.py:\n\n                         solutions = {1,2}\n                         for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                             div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i) if mod_i ! = 0:\n                                 continue\n                             for a in [i, div]:\n                                 mod_a = w % a\n                                 if mod_a <= 2:\n                                     # TODO: Your code here\n\n                    So they are iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. Then for each divisor a, they consider a and div = half_perimeter // i. Then they check: mod_a = w % a, and if mod_a <= 2, then ... what? Then they must also check the conditions on l.\n\n                    The condition mod_a = w % a <= 2 might be for the scenario where the top and bottom are covered: \n                         if w % a == 0 -> mod_a=0, which is <=2.\n                         if w % a == 1 or 2, then maybe we can cover by wrapping? The known four scenarios:\n\n                         Scenario 1: no wrapping: requires (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n                         Scenario 2: wrap at two corners (top-left and bottom-left): then the left column is covered by full tiles, and the top and bottom are covered by tiles that start at the left and extend a-1 on the top/bottom and 1 on the left? then the top has a overhang of w - (a-1) = w - a + 1, and we require (w - a + 1) % a = (w+1) % a = (w%a +1) % a = (mod_a+1) % a. \n                                    but also the left column: we used 2 tiles that cover 1 cm each on the left, and the rest of the left column (l-2) must be divisible by a? \n                                    -> conditions: (w+1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0.\n\n                         Scenario 3: wrap at one corner (top-left) and one corner (top-right): then the top row is covered by one tile in the middle of length w-2, and the left and right are covered by tiles that cover the entire column? conditions: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten by Alice and Bob such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right) and they don't overlap.\n\nThe provided code in program1.py uses:\n  aw = prefix sums from the left\n  bw = prefix sums from the right (i.e., reversed array)\n\nThe idea is to iterate over the prefix sums from the left (aw). For each prefix sum `a` (which is the total weight Alice has eaten so far) at index `i` (meaning she has eaten the first i+1 candies), we want to see if there exists a prefix sum from the right (bw) of the same value, but taken from the right (so the index in the reversed array must be such that the two segments do not overlap).\n\nNote: The array `bw` is the prefix sum of the reversed array. So `bw[j]` corresponds to the sum of the last j+1 candies.\n\nWe are using:\n  c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\nThis is searching in `bw` for the value `a`, but we are restricting the search to the indices [0, len(bw)-i-2] (i.e., hi = len(bw)-i-2, meaning we consider indices from 0 to hi-1). The reason for `len(bw)-i-2` is that we cannot have overlapping. Since Alice has eaten i+1 candies from the left, Bob can eat at most (n - (i+1)) candies from the right. But note: the array `bw` has n elements (indexed 0 to n-1). The condition for non-overlap is that the index j in the reversed array (which corresponds to j+1 candies from the right) must satisfy: (i+1) + (j+1) <= n  => j+1 <= n - (i+1) => j <= n - i - 2. So the valid indices in `bw` for Bob are from 0 to n-i-2 (inclusive). Therefore, we set hi = n-i-1? Actually, the `hi` parameter in bisect_left is the index at which to stop (exclusive). So we set hi = n-i-1? But note: the current code uses `hi=len(bw)-i-2` which is n-i-2 (since len(bw)=n). That would make the search in [0, n-i-3]. But we want to include index n-i-2? \n\nActually, the condition in the if-statement is: \n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1)\n\nThis condition checks that the value at index c in `bw` is exactly `a` and that the two segments do not overlap: the condition i < (len(bw)-c-1) is equivalent to i+1 + (c+1) <= n? Let's see: \n   i+1 (candies from left) and c+1 (candies from right) must be <= n? Actually, the condition i < (len(bw)-c-1) is the same as i+1 <= n - (c+1) - 1? That doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me reindex: \n   Alice: indices 0 to i (i+1 candies)\n   Bob: indices from n-1 down to n-1-c (c+1 candies) because `bw` is the prefix of the reversed array.\n\nThe condition for non-overlap is: i < n-1-c. Why? Because the last candy Alice ate is at index i, and the first candy Bob ate (from the right) is at index n-1-c. We require that i < n-1-c, meaning that there is at least one candy in between or they are adjacent? Actually, we require that the two segments do not overlap. So the next candy after Alice's last should be after Bob's first? Actually, we require that the entire segment of Alice is strictly to the left of Bob's segment. Therefore, we require: i < n-1-c. This condition is equivalent to: i+1 <= n-1-c-1? Not exactly. The condition is that the last index of Alice (i) must be strictly less than the first index of Bob (which is n-1-c). So the condition i < n-1-c is correct.\n\nBut note: the condition in the code is: i < (len(bw)-c-1). Since len(bw)=n, that is i < n - c - 1, which is the same as i < n-1-c? Actually, n-1-c is the same as n-c-1? Yes.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nNow, what do we do when we find such a match? We want to update `mx` (which is the maximum total candies eaten) to be the total number of candies = (i+1) + (c+1). But note: the problem asks for the maximum total number of candies.\n\nHowever, we are iterating over i from 0 to n-1. We are also considering all possible c (via bisect) that might give the same sum. We want the maximum total candies? But note: we are iterating from left to right and the prefix sums are increasing. So we might get a candidate with a larger total number of candies? But note: the total candies is (i+1)+(c+1). We want the maximum over all valid pairs.\n\nBut note: the condition in the bisect is set to hi=len(bw)-i-2. This is to avoid overlapping? Actually, the hi parameter in bisect_left is the high bound (exclusive) for the search. We set it to n-i-2? That means we are only searching in indices [0, n-i-3]. But we want to include up to n-i-2? Because the condition for non-overlap is that Bob can have at most n-i-1 candies? Actually, the maximum number of candies Bob can have is n-i-1? But note: the condition in the if-statement uses i < n-1-c, which is equivalent to c < n-1-i. So the maximum c we can have is n-2-i? Then the index in `bw` we can use is from 0 to n-2-i? So the hi parameter should be set to n-1-i? Because we want to include index n-2-i? Actually, the hi parameter is the exclusive upper bound. So if we set hi = n-1-i, then the search is in [0, n-2-i] (inclusive). That is correct.\n\nBut the current code uses hi = len(bw)-i-2 = n-i-2. Then the search is in [0, n-i-3]. That excludes the index n-i-2? So we are not considering the maximum possible Bob segment? \n\nLet me check: \n   We require Bob's segment to be at most n-i-1 candies? Actually, Bob can have at most n-i-1 candies? But note: the condition i < n-1-c is equivalent to c < n-1-i. So the maximum c (the index in the `bw` array) is n-2-i? Because if Bob has k candies, then c = k-1. So the maximum k is n-i-1, then c = n-i-2. Therefore, we must include c = n-i-2? \n\nBut the current hi = n-i-2 (exclusive) means we are searching in [0, n-i-3]. So we are missing c = n-i-2? \n\nTherefore, we should change the hi to n-i-1? \n\nBut note: the condition in the if-statement also checks i < n-1-c. So even if we set hi to a larger value, the condition will filter out the ones that overlap. However, the bisect_left might return an index that is beyond the non-overlap condition? Then we have to check the condition anyway. So we can set hi to the entire array? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but each test case can be up to 200000, and we are iterating over i from 0 to n-1, and each bisect is O(log n). So total O(n log n) per test case? But the note says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can do O(n log n) per test case? Actually, the sum of n is 200000, so the total number of test cases might be up to 10000? But the sum of n is 200000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200000. Then O(n log n) is acceptable? \n\nBut note: the constraint says the sum of n over all test cases <= 200000. So we can do:\n\n   for each test case: O(n log n) and the total n is 200000, so worst-case one test case: n=200000 -> 200000 * log2(200000) \u2248 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo we can change the hi to n (so we search the entire `bw` array) and then rely on the condition i < n-1-c to filter out the overlapping ones? \n\nBut the problem: the current code uses hi = n-i-2. Why? Maybe to avoid the overlapping in the search? But then we are missing the last candidate. \n\nAlternatively, we can set hi = n - i (so that we include up to n-i-1) and then check the condition? \n\nBut note: the condition i < n-1-c must hold. \n\nHowever, the current code has a bug: it misses the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nBut let's look at the example: \n   Example 2: n=3, w = [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] -> actually the example in the note is the fourth test case? \n\nBut the note says: \n   For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1], they each eat 30. So total candies = 3+4=7.\n\nHow would we get that? \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> prefix sum = 30 at index i=2 (0-indexed, so the third candy).\n   Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> which is the last 4 candies. The reversed array is [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7] -> the prefix sum for Bob: \n        [1, 12, 20, 30, ...] -> so we need 30. The index c for 30 in the reversed prefix is 3? \n   Then total candies = (i+1) + (c+1) = 3+4 = 7.\n\nBut the condition: i=2, c=3 -> then we require i < n-1-c? \n   n=8 -> 8-1-3 = 4 -> 2 < 4 -> true.\n\nSo we would update mx = max(mx, 3+4) = 7.\n\nBut how do we get c=3? We are searching in `bw` for the value 30. We set hi = n - i - 1? Because we want to include up to n-i-1? Actually, we set hi = n - i? Then the search is in [0, n-i-1] (exclusive of n-i). \n\nSo we should change the hi to n - i? \n\nBut the current code uses hi = n-i-2. That would be 8-2-2=4? Then we are searching in [0,3] (because hi=4, exclusive) -> so we do include index 3? Because 3<4. So it would be found? \n\nWait: n-i-2 = 8-2-2 = 4 -> then the search is in [0,3] (because hi=4 is exclusive). So we do include index 3. \n\nBut what if the candidate we are looking for is at index 4? Then we would miss it? \n\nBut in the example above, the candidate is at index 3. \n\nWhat if we have a candidate at the maximum possible? For example, if Alice eats 0 candies, then Bob can eat up to n-1? Then c = n-2? Then hi = n - 0 - 2 = n-2 -> then we search in [0, n-3] -> so we miss n-2? \n\nBut if Alice eats 0 candies, then a=0. We are iterating i=0. Then we look for 0 in `bw`. The prefix sum of the reversed array: the first element is the last candy. The prefix sum for 0? Actually, the prefix sum for 0 candies from the right? But the prefix sum array `bw` starts at the first candy (so at least one candy). So 0 might not be present? \n\nBut note: the problem says they can eat any number of candies (including zero). However, the prefix arrays `aw` and `bw` are built from the entire array. The `aw[0] = w[0]`, so we don't have a zero? \n\nWe are iterating i from 0 to n-1. We are not considering the case of zero? \n\nBut note: the problem says they can eat zero? However, the condition of the problem: they want to be fair -> same total weight. Zero is allowed? But the note for the third test case: \"there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So they are not eating any candy? Then total candies=0.\n\nBut how do we get zero? We are iterating i from 0 to n-1. We are not considering the case when both eat zero? \n\nWe can initialize mx=0. Then if we don't find any match, we output 0. But what if we have a match with zero? \n\nWe are building `aw` as the prefix of the original array. The first element is w0. So we are not including the prefix sum for zero? \n\nSimilarly, `bw` does not include zero? \n\nSo we are missing the case when both eat zero? \n\nBut note: the problem says they eat some candies. The example: the third test case -> answer 0. \n\nBut if they both eat zero, then they eat zero candies. That is the same as not eating any. \n\nBut the problem: they are going to eat. The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" -> including zero? But then Bob also eats zero? \n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say they must eat at least one? The example: first test case: they eat one each. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". So if they eat zero, that's 0 candies. But we are looking for maximum. So if we can get a positive number, we take that. \n\nBut the third test case: no non-zero solution -> then we output 0.\n\nSo we are missing the zero case? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. Zero is fair. But the problem does not force them to eat? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So if they eat zero, that's zero. But if we can get a positive, we take the positive. \n\nBut the current code does not consider the zero case? \n\nWe can also consider the case when both eat zero? How? We can do:\n\n   We can let Alice eat 0 and Bob eat 0 -> total 0. Then we update mx = max(mx, 0). But we start mx=0.\n\nBut we are iterating i from 0 to n-1. We are not including the zero prefix? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the entire array and then also check for zero? \n\nBut note: the problem says the candies are positive. So the prefix sums are positive. The only way to get zero is to eat zero candies. \n\nBut we are not building the prefix for zero. \n\nSo we can add an extra condition: if we find a match for zero? \n\nBut we don't have zero in the prefix arrays. \n\nAlternatively, we can build the prefix arrays including zero? \n\nBut the problem: the array `aw` is built as `list(accumulate(w))` -> that starts at w0. \n\nWe can build:\n\n   aw = [0] + list(accumulate(w))\n   bw = [0] + list(accumulate(w[::-1]))\n\nThen we iterate i from 0 to n (inclusive) for aw? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do that. \n\nBut the current code does not do that. \n\nWe are going to change the code? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nWe are only allowed to fill in the missing part? \n\nThe missing part is the TODO block. \n\nBut the current code has a bug: the hi parameter is set to n-i-2, which might be negative? \n\nAlternatively, we can fix the hi to n-i? and then rely on the condition to filter? \n\nBut the condition i < n-1-c must hold. \n\nSo let me change the hi to n-i? \n\nBut note: the current code uses hi=len(bw)-i-2. We are going to change that? \n\nBut the problem says: we can only output the missing code? \n\nWe are not allowed to change existing code? \n\nThe problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So if we need to change an existing line, we cannot? \n\nBut the TODO is only the block. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   We leave the hi as is, but then we also check the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nBut we cannot change the existing code? \n\nSo we must work with the existing code. \n\nThe existing code: \n   for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n        if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are missing the candidate when the entire Bob segment is used? \n\nBut note: the condition hi=len(bw)-i-2 might be negative? For example, when i is large. \n\nWe should avoid that. \n\nWe can change the hi to min(len(bw), len(bw)-i) or something? But we cannot change existing code. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the condition i < n-1-c is equivalent to c < n-1-i. So the maximum c we can have is n-2-i. But if n-2-i < 0, then we skip. \n\nBut the current hi is set to len(bw)-i-2 = n-i-2. If n-i-2 < 0, then hi is negative -> then the bisect_left will search in [0, hi) -> which is [0, negative) -> empty. \n\nSo that is safe. \n\nBut we are missing the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nHow can we get that candidate? \n\nWe can do a separate check? \n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   We do the bisect with hi = n-i-1? \n\nBut we cannot change the existing line. \n\nSo we must leave the hi as n-i-2. \n\nBut then we are missing the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nWe can do a second bisect? \n\nBut we are only allowed to fill the TODO block. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the candidate at c = n-i-2 might be found by the bisect? \n\nWait: the hi is set to n-i-2 (exclusive). So we are searching in [0, n-i-3]. The candidate at c = n-i-2 is not included. \n\nBut what if we also check the value at index c = n-i-2? \n\nWe can do:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2] and i < n-1-(n-i-2) ... \n\nBut the condition i < n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1? -> which is always true? \n\nBut we require non-overlap: i < n-1 - (n-i-2) -> \n   i < n-1 - (n-i-2) \n   i < n-1 - n + i + 2\n   i < i+1 -> true.\n\nSo we can check:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n        candidate = (i+1) + (n-i-2+1) = i+1 + (n-i-1) = n\n        then update mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut wait: if they eat the entire array? Then the total weight must be the same? But note: the entire array is split: Alice eats the left part and Bob the right part? But the entire array is partitioned. Then the condition is that the total sum must be even? And then they each eat half? \n\nBut the problem: they cannot overlap. If they eat the entire array, then the condition is that the total sum is even? \n\nBut note: the entire array is partitioned: Alice from left, Bob from right. They must eat the same total weight. So the total sum must be even? \n\nBut the problem does not require that they eat the entire array? They can leave some in the middle. \n\nBut if they eat the entire array, then the condition is that the total sum is even? \n\nSo we can check: \n   if the total sum is even, then we can have n candies? \n\nBut the problem: the entire array is partitioned: Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left and Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right? But they must be contiguous? And they meet in the middle? \n\nActually, the entire array is partitioned: the left part by Alice and the right part by Bob. The middle part is not eaten? \n\nBut the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". And they can choose any number from the left and any number from the right. But they are contiguous? \n\nBut the entire array is partitioned: the candies are from left to right. Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left (starting at the left) and Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right (starting at the right). The two segments might not meet? \n\nBut if they eat the entire array, then the two segments must meet? \n\nBut the condition: the entire array is partitioned? \n\nSo the total candies eaten = (i+1) + (c+1) = n? Then we must have i+1 + c+1 = n -> c+1 = n - (i+1) -> so Bob eats the last n-i-1 candies? \n\nBut then the condition for non-overlap: the last candy of Alice is at index i, and the first candy of Bob is at index i+1? \n\nBut the condition i < n-1-c: \n   c = n-i-2? \n   then n-1-c = n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1 -> then we require i < i+1 -> true.\n\nSo it is valid.\n\nTherefore, we can check separately for the entire array? \n\nBut the problem: we are iterating i from 0 to n-1. The candidate for the entire array would be when i is such that the prefix sum a = total_sum/2? and then Bob's prefix sum = total_sum/2? and then we get c = n-i-2? \n\nBut we are not including c = n-i-2 in the bisect? \n\nSo we can do in the TODO block:\n\n   candidate = i+1 + c+1\n   mx = max(mx, candidate)\n\nBut we also want to check the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nWe can do:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2] and i < n-1-(n-i-2): \n        # but we already know the condition i < n-1-(n-i-2) is always true? \n        candidate2 = (i+1) + (n-i-2+1) = n\n        mx = max(mx, candidate2)\n\nBut wait: if a == bw[n-i-2] and n-i-2 is in the valid range, then we update. \n\nBut note: we are iterating i. For a fixed i, we are checking the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nBut we must be cautious: the bisect might have already found a candidate at a lower c? But we want the maximum total candies? The candidate at c = n-i-2 gives n, which is the entire array. So that is the maximum possible. \n\nBut we are iterating i. We can break early? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   We update mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)   # for the candidate found by bisect\n   Then we check the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n\nBut note: the candidate at c = n-i-2 might be the same as the one found by bisect? \n\nIf the value a appears multiple times in `bw`, then bisect_left returns the first occurrence. But we want the largest c? Because the total candies is (i+1)+(c+1) and we want to maximize that. \n\nBut the candidate at c = n-i-2 is the largest possible c for this i? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   candidate1 = i+1 + c+1   # from the bisect (if found)\n   candidate2 = 0\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n        candidate2 = n   # because (i+1) + (n-i-2+1) = n\n\n   mx = max(mx, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nBut wait: we are in the if-block only when the bisect found a candidate? \n\nThe if-block is: if a==bw[c] and ... \n\nBut what if the bisect found a candidate at a lower c, but there is also a candidate at c = n-i-2? Then we update with candidate1 and candidate2? \n\nBut note: the candidate at c = n-i-2 might be the same as the one found by bisect? Only if n-i-2 == c? \n\nBut c is the first index where bw[c] >= a. If a appears at multiple indices, we might have found a lower one. \n\nBut we want the largest c for which a==bw[c]? \n\nAlternatively, we can do a bisect_right? \n\nBut the problem: we are only allowed to fill the TODO block. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   We update mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n\n   # Then check the candidate at c = n-i-2? \n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 != c:   # if it's not the same candidate\n        if a == bw[n-i-2] and i < n-1-(n-i-2):   # but the condition is always true\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut the condition i < n-1-(n-i-2) is always true? So we can skip it? \n\nBut note: the condition i < n-1-c is already checked for the candidate from bisect? But for the new candidate c'=n-i-2, we must check? \n\nBut we know: for c'=n-i-2, we have n-1-c' = n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1, and i < i+1 -> true.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n        mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut note: what if n-i-2 is negative? Then skip.\n\nBut we are iterating i from 0 to n-1. \n   n-i-2 >=0  => i <= n-2.\n\nSo for i from 0 to n-2, we check.\n\nBut what if the entire array is eaten? Then we require that the total sum is even? And that the prefix sum a = total_sum/2? \n\nBut note: the entire array being eaten means that the two segments meet. The total sum must be even? \n\nBut the candidate at c = n-i-2: \n   We have: \n        Alice: w0, w1, ..., wi -> sum = a\n        Bob: w_{n-1}, w_{n-2}, ..., w_{n-1 - (n-i-2)} = w_{i+1}? \n        Actually, Bob eats the last (n-i-1) candies? \n        So the sum of Bob = total_sum - a? \n        We require a = total_sum - a? -> so a = total_sum/2.\n\nTherefore, we only get this candidate when a = total_sum/2.\n\nSo we can also compute the total_sum? \n\nBut we have aw[-1] = total_sum? \n\nBut we are iterating i, so we don't have the total_sum in the loop? \n\nBut we can precompute it? \n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\nAlternatively, we can do without total_sum? \n\nWe are checking a == bw[n-i-2]. But note: \n   bw[n-i-2] = sum of the last n-i-1 candies? \n   and a = sum of the first i+1 candies.\n\nAnd we require a = total_sum - a? -> which implies a = total_sum/2.\n\nBut we don't have total_sum? \n\nBut we can compute: \n   total_sum = aw[-1] \n   and we require a = total_sum - a -> 2*a = total_sum.\n\nBut we are in the loop for i. We can precompute total_sum outside the loop? \n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\nWe are only allowed to fill the TODO block. \n\nSo we cannot precompute total_sum? \n\nBut note: the existing code does not have total_sum. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the entire array candidate is only valid if the entire array is partitioned and the sum is even? But we are checking a == bw[n-i-2]. \n\nBut what is bw[n-i-2]? \n   bw is the prefix sum of the reversed array. The reversed array is w_rev = w[::-1] = [w_{n-1}, w_{n-2}, ..., w0]\n   Then bw[j] = w_{n-1} + ... + w_{n-1-j}? \n   Actually, the j-th element of bw is the sum of the first j+1 elements of w_rev, which is the sum of the last j+1 elements of w.\n\n   Therefore, bw[n-i-2] = sum of the last n-i-1 elements of w.\n\n   And a = sum of the first i+1 elements.\n\n   And the entire array sum = a + (sum of the middle) + bw[n-i-2]? \n   But if they eat the entire array, then the middle is empty? \n   Actually, the entire array is partitioned: \n        Alice: [0, i] -> i+1 candies\n        Bob: [i+1, n-1] -> n-i-1 candies? \n        But wait: Bob eats from the right: the last n-i-1 candies? \n        The segment [i+1, n-1] has n-i-1 candies.\n\n   So the entire array sum = a + bw[n-i-2]? \n   But then we require a = bw[n-i-2]? \n   Then 2*a = entire array sum.\n\n   So the condition a == bw[n-i-2] is exactly the condition for the entire array to be partitioned fairly.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n        mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut note: the entire array candidate is n, which is the maximum possible. So we can break early? But we are iterating i, and we want the maximum over i. But n is the maximum, so we can break? \n\nBut it is possible that for a larger i we get a candidate that is also n? \n\nBut if we have the entire array partitioned fairly, then there is only one way: the total sum must be even and the prefix sum at i must be total_sum/2. \n\nBut there might be multiple i that satisfy a = total_sum/2? \n\nFor example: \n   w = [1,2,1,2] -> total_sum=6, then at i=0: a=1 -> not 3.\n        i=1: a=3 -> then we check bw[n-1-2] = bw[4-1-2]=bw[1] -> the reversed array is [2,1,2,1] -> prefix: [2,3,5,6] -> bw[1]=3 -> matches. Then we update mx = max(mx, 4) = 4.\n\n        But also at i=2: a=1+2+1=4 -> not 3.\n\n   So only one i.\n\nBut what if we have: \n   w = [1,1,1,1] -> total_sum=4. \n        i=0: a=1 -> not 2.\n        i=1: a=2 -> then bw[4-1-2]=bw[1] = (reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3,4]) -> bw[1]=2 -> matches -> update mx=4.\n\n        i=2: a=3 -> not 2.\n\n   So only one i.\n\nBut what if we have multiple splits? \n   w = [2,0,0,2] -> but weights are at least 1? So no.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   In the TODO block:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        # Check the entire array candidate for this i? \n        j = n - i - 2   # the candidate index in bw for the entire array\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            candidate = max(candidate, n)   # but candidate might be from the bisect which is less than n? \n            # Actually, we want the maximum candidate for this i? \n            # But the entire array candidate for this i is n, which is larger than i+1+c+1? \n            # Because i+1+c+1 = i+1 + (c+1) and c <= j? \n            # But j = n-i-2, so the entire array candidate is n, and the current candidate is (i+1)+(c+1) which is at most (i+1)+(j+1) = i+1 + n-i-1 = n? \n            # So they are the same? \n            # Actually, if we have a candidate at c and also at j (which is larger) then we would have found j in the bisect? \n            # But we set hi = n-i-2, which excludes j? \n            # So we didn't find j in the bisect. \n        else:\n            candidate = i+1 + c+1   # but we already have candidate from the bisect\n\n        mx = max(mx, candidate)\n\n   But wait: we are in the if-block only when the bisect found a candidate at index c (which is in the range [0, n-i-3]) and we also want to consider j = n-i-2? \n\n   But note: the bisect did not find j because we set hi = n-i-2 (exclusive) so j = n-i-2 is not included. \n\n   So we do:\n\n        candidate1 = i+1 + c+1\n        candidate2 = 0\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            candidate2 = n   # because they eat the entire array: (i+1) + (n-i-1) = n\n        mx = max(mx, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nBut note: candidate2 might be 0 if the condition fails.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        mx = max(mx, candidate)\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\nBut note: the entire array candidate is n, which is the maximum possible, so we can break? But it is possible that for a larger i we get a candidate that is also n? \n\nBut if we have the entire array partitioned fairly, then the total sum is even and the prefix sum at i must be total_sum/2. And there is only one such i? \n\nBut what if there are multiple i that yield a = total_sum/2? \n   For example: w = [1, 2, 2, 1] -> total_sum=6. \n        i=0: a=1 -> not 3.\n        i=1: a=1+2=3 -> then j = n-1-2 = 4-1-2=1 -> bw[1] = (reversed: [1,2,2,1] -> prefix: [1,3,5,6]) -> bw[1]=3 -> matches -> update mx = max(mx, 4) = 4.\n        i=2: a=1+2+2=5 -> not 3.\n\n   But what if: w = [1, 1, 1, 1] -> total_sum=4.\n        i=0: a=1 -> not 2.\n        i=1: a=2 -> then j=4-1-2=1 -> bw[1]= (reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3,4]) -> bw[1]=2 -> matches -> update mx=4.\n        i=2: a=3 -> not 2.\n\n   Another example: w = [2, 2, 2, 2] -> same.\n\n   But what if: w = [1, 3, 1, 1] -> total_sum=6.\n        i=0: a=1 -> not 3.\n        i=1: a=4 -> not 3.\n        i=2: a=5 -> not 3.\n\n   So only one i per test case can yield a = total_sum/2? \n\n   But note: the prefix sums are strictly increasing (since weights are positive). So there is at most one i such that a = total_sum/2.\n\n   Therefore, we can break after we update mx to n? \n\n   But the problem: we are iterating i. We want the maximum total candies. And n is the maximum. So we can break out of the loop? \n\n   But note: it is possible that we have a candidate that is n at an early i? But then we break and skip later i that might yield a candidate of n? But there is only one i that yields a = total_sum/2. \n\n   So we can break? \n\n   But the problem: the entire array candidate is the maximum, so we can break.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        mx = max(mx, candidate)\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and j < len(bw) and a == bw[j]:\n            mx = n   # because n is the maximum possible\n            break   # break out of the for-loop? \n\n   But note: we are in the for-loop for i. \n\n   But the problem: we are guaranteed that there is at most one i that yields a = total_sum/2? \n\n   But what if there are multiple ways to partition the entire array? \n        For example: w = [1,1,1,1] -> only i=1 yields a=2.\n\n   So we can break.\n\n   But caution: what if we break and then later there is a candidate that is also n? But there isn't. \n\n   Alternatively, we can set mx = n and break, but then we skip the rest. \n\n   But the entire array candidate is the maximum, so we can break.\n\n   However, the problem: what if the entire array candidate is not the maximum? But it is: n is the total number of candies. \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". The maximum is at most n. \n\n   So if we achieve n, that is the maximum.\n\n   Therefore, we can break.\n\n   But note: it is possible that we have a candidate of n at an early i? Then we break and skip later i that might yield a candidate of n? But there is only one i that yields a = total_sum/2. \n\n   So we do:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and a == bw[j]:\n            mx = n\n            break\n\n   But note: the condition j < len(bw) is always true because j = n-i-2 and i>=0 -> j<=n-2, and len(bw)=n, so j in [0, n-2] -> valid.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = n\n            break\n\n   But what if we don't break? Then we might update mx to n multiple times? But only one i will satisfy a = total_sum/2.\n\n   But breaking early saves time.\n\n   However, the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, and breaking early might help.\n\n   But note: the entire array candidate might appear at i = n//2? So we break at the middle? \n\n   But worst-case we still do n/2 iterations? \n\n   But it's acceptable.\n\n   But what if there is no entire array candidate? Then we don't break and continue.\n\n   So the TODO block becomes:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        if candidate > mx:\n            mx = candidate\n        # Check for the entire array candidate\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and a == bw[j]:\n            # This means we can eat the entire array\n            mx = n\n            break   # break the inner for-loop (the current test case)\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the code that goes in the TODO block.\n\n   But the existing code has a for-loop over i. We are going to break out of it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the break and just set mx = max(mx, n) and then continue? But then we still iterate. But since there is only one i that yields a = total_sum/2, we do one extra update. \n\n   But the problem: we want efficiency. The total n over test cases is 200000, so even if we iterate the entire array, it's acceptable. \n\n   But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do without break.\n\n   So:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the entire array candidate is n, and we are updating mx to n. And then we continue. \n\n   But later, if we find another candidate that is also n? But there is only one i that yields a = total_sum/2. \n\n   So we can do that.\n\n   But what if the entire array candidate appears at an i that we are currently at, and then later we find a candidate from the bisect that is also n? But that cannot happen because the entire array candidate requires a = total_sum/2, and there is only one i for that.\n\n   So the TODO block:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        mx = max(mx, candidate)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the entire array candidate might appear at an i that is not the current i? \n\n   We are at a specific i. We are checking for the entire array candidate for this i.\n\n   And we know that for this i, if a == bw[n-i-2], then we can update to n.\n\n   And there might be only one i that yields that condition.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: what if n-i-2 is the same as c? Then we are updating twice? But that's okay.\n\n   However, it's the same candidate? \n\n   But the entire array candidate is n, and the candidate from the bisect is (i+1)+(c+1) which is at most n (if c = n-i-2, then it is n). \n\n   So if c = n-i-2, then we update mx to n twice? \n\n   But that's okay.\n\n   But we can avoid the extra check if we know that c is not n-i-2? \n\n   But it's simpler to do the check.\n\n   But note: the condition n-i-2>=0 might be false for the last few i? \n\n   For i = n-1: n-i-2 = n-1-2 = n-3? -> if n>=3, then for i=n-1: n-i-2 = n-1-2 = n-3? -> but wait: i runs from 0 to n-1. \n        i = n-1: n-i-2 = n - (n-1) - 2 = -1 -> skip.\n\n   For i = n-2: n-i-2 = n - (n-2) - 2 = 0 -> valid.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n        candidate = i+1 + c+1\n        if candidate > mx:\n            mx = candidate\n        j = n - i - 2\n        if j >= 0 and a == bw[j]:\n            if n > mx:\n                mx = n\n\n   Or simply:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the entire array candidate might be found in multiple test cases? \n\n   But we are in the loop for one test case.\n\n   So we write:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But wait: what if the entire array candidate is not valid because of non-overlap? But we know the non-overlap condition is automatically satisfied.\n\n   So we do that.\n\n   But note: the condition in the if-statement for the bisect candidate already checked non-overlap? And we are about to update with the entire array candidate? \n\n   The entire array candidate is a special case of non-overlap? \n\n   Yes, because the two segments are adjacent: Alice eats [0, i] and Bob eats [i+1, n-1]. \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the variable `n` is the total number of candies.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the entire array candidate is n, which is the total number of candies.\n\n   But what if the array has 0 candies? But n>=1.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        mx = max(mx, i+1 + c+1)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, n)\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". So we output these two lines.\n\n   But the TODO block is only one block? \n\n   We are replacing the TODO with two lines? \n\n   Yes.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n   We are given: \n        for w, l in zip(...):\n            half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n            solutions = {1, 2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n                if mod_i != 0:\n                    continue\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to find all values of a (>=1) such that Bethany can tile the bathroom.\n\n   The problem: \n        The bathroom has dimensions w x l.\n        She uses 1x1 tiles on the interior: (w-2)*(l-2) of them.\n        On the boundary, she uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated, so a can be the length or the width of the tile).\n\n   The boundary consists of:\n        top and bottom: each of length w, but the corners are shared? \n        Actually, the boundary is a frame. The total number of 1x1 tiles on the boundary is: \n            2 * (w + l - 2)   [because the four corners are counted twice?] \n        But wait: the entire floor has w*l tiles. The interior has (w-2)*(l-2). \n        So the boundary has: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = w*l - [w*l -2w-2l+4] = 2w+2l-4 = 2*(w+l-2).\n\n        And note: the half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n        So the boundary has 2 * half_perimeter tiles.\n\n        And we are to cover the boundary with tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, so they are effectively 1xa or a x 1, but since the boundary is 1 unit wide, we use them as 1xa).\n\n        The tile can be placed horizontally or vertically? But the boundary has straight segments. The top and bottom are horizontal (length w) and the sides are vertical (length l-2) for the left and right? \n\n        Actually, the boundary is composed of four segments:\n            top: w\n            bottom: w\n            left: l-2   (because the corners are already covered by top and bottom)\n            right: l-2\n\n        Total: 2w + 2l - 4 = 2*(w+l-2)\n\n        But note: the problem says the tiles can be rotated. So a tile of size 1xa can be used as 1xa or a x 1? But the boundary is only 1 unit wide. So we must use it as 1xa? \n\n        However, if we use it as a x 1, then it would be placed vertically? But the boundary is 1 unit wide. So we can only use it as 1xa? \n\n        But wait: the boundary segments have different lengths? \n\n        The condition: the entire boundary must be tiled by tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, meaning we can use them as 1xa or 1xa? because rotating 90 degrees gives the same as 1xa? \n\n        Actually, the tile is 1xa, and rotating it gives a 1xa tile? \n\n        So it's the same. \n\n        Therefore, the boundary is a single connected strip? But it is not: it is four segments. \n\n        The problem: we need to cover the entire boundary (which is 2*(w+l-2) tiles) with tiles of size 1xa. \n\n        But note: the tile covers a consecutive segment of a tiles? \n\n        However, the boundary has corners? How do we cover the corners? \n\n        The note has pictures. \n\n        The key: the entire boundary must be covered by tiles that are 1xa, and the tiles can be placed in any orientation? But the boundary is a cycle? \n\n        The problem says: \"On the floor boundary\" and the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. \n\n        After reading the note: \n            In the first test case: 3x5 -> boundary: \n                top: 3, bottom: 3, left: 5-2=3, right: 3 -> total 3+3+3+3=12? \n                But 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12.\n\n            The solutions are a=1,2,3.\n\n        How? \n            a=1: trivial, 12 tiles of 1x1.\n            a=2: we can cover the boundary with 6 tiles of 1x2? \n            a=3: 4 tiles of 1x3? \n\n        But how to cover the corners? \n\n        The picture shows: \n            For a=3: \n                The top row: one tile of 1x3 covering the entire top.\n                The bottom row: one tile of 1x3 covering the entire bottom.\n                The left and right: each has 3 tiles? But 3 is the length? \n                But the left and right are 3 tiles high? But the bathroom is 5 cm long? \n                Actually, the left and right segments are 5-2=3? (because the top and bottom already covered the corners) -> so 3 tiles high.\n\n                Then we can cover the left with one tile of 1x3? and the right with one tile of 1x3? \n\n                Total: 4 tiles -> 4*3 = 12.\n\n        So the condition: the entire boundary must be divisible by a? \n\n        But also, we must be able to assign the tiles to the four segments without breaking a tile? \n\n        The segments: \n            top: length w -> must be covered by tiles of 1xa -> so we require w % a == 0? \n            bottom: w % a == 0\n            left: (l-2) % a == 0\n            right: (l-2) % a == 0\n\n        But wait: what if a=2 for the 3x5? \n            top: 3 % 2 = 1 -> not 0.\n            bottom: 3 % 2 = 1.\n            left: 3 % 2 = 1.\n            right: 3 % 2 = 1.\n\n        But a=2 is valid.\n\n        How? \n            The picture: \n                The top: one tile of 1x2 and then one tile of 1x1? but we don't have 1x1 for the boundary? \n\n        But the problem: the boundary uses 1xa tiles, and the interior uses 1x1. \n\n        However, the boundary can use a mix? \n\n        The problem says: \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1xa\". \n\n        So the entire boundary must be covered by 1xa tiles? \n\n        But then the length of each segment must be divisible by a? \n\n        But 3 is not divisible by 2.\n\n        Alternatively, the tile can be placed such that it wraps the corner? \n\n        The note: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\". \n\n        But that doesn't help for divisibility.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n            \"She needs exactly (w-2) * (l-2) of these [1x1].\" \n            and \"On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1xa\"\n\n        So the boundary is entirely covered by 1xa tiles? \n\n        But then the total boundary length must be divisible by a? \n\n        Condition: 2*(w+l-2) % a == 0.\n\n        But for 3x5: 2*(3+5-2)=12, and 12%2=0 -> valid.\n\n        But is that sufficient? \n\n        Consider: \n            a=4: 12%4=0 -> valid? \n            But the segments: \n                top: 3 % 4 = 3 -> not 0 -> we cannot cover the top with 1x4 tiles? \n\n        How would we cover the top? We need to cover 3 units with tiles of length 4? \n\n        So we must also be able to cover each segment? \n\n        The boundary is a cycle. We can cover it with tiles that wrap around the corners? \n\n        The problem does not explicitly say that the tiles can wrap around corners. \n\n        The pictures in the note do not wrap: each tile is on one side.\n\n        But the problem says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\". \n\n        This might imply that we can use the tile to cover around a corner? \n\n        Example: a=3 for 3x5: \n            We use one tile for the entire top, one for the bottom, and one for each side. \n\n        For a=2 for 3x5: \n            We can do:\n                top: cover the first 2 cm with one tile, then the next 1 cm? but we need a tile of length 1? \n\n        But we don't have 1x1 for the boundary? \n\n        Alternatively, we can cover the top-left corner and the left-top with one tile? \n\n        But the tile is 1x2: if we place it at the top-left corner, covering the top row's first cm and the left column's first cm? \n\n        That is, the tile covers two cm: one on the top row and one on the left column? \n\n        This is wrapping the corner.\n\n        So the boundary is covered in one connected strip? \n\n        Therefore, the condition is that the entire boundary length is divisible by a, and also that the corner constraints are satisfied? \n\n        But what are the corner constraints? \n\n        We have four corners. Each corner is covered by two tiles? But if we wrap, then one tile can cover two adjacent sides? \n\n        The problem: we have a connected boundary. We can cover it with a single strip? \n\n        The total length is 2*(w+l-2). We need to cover it with tiles of length a. So we require 2*(w+l-2) % a == 0.\n\n        But also, we must be able to start and end at the corners? \n\n        However, the note says a=1,2,3 are valid for 3x5. \n            a=4: 12 % 4 == 0 -> divisible, but is it valid? \n            We would need 3 tiles. \n            How to cover? \n                We can start at a corner: \n                    Tile1: covers the entire top? but top is 3, which is not divisible by 4? \n                Alternatively, we wrap: \n                    Tile1: covers 2 cm on the top and 2 cm on the left? \n                    Then the top has 1 cm left, the left has 1 cm left? \n                    Then Tile2: covers 1 cm on the top and 3 cm on the right? -> not contiguous.\n\n        It is complex.\n\n        After reading known solutions for this problem (since it's a known problem), the solution is:\n\n            a is valid if at least one of the following holds:\n\n            1. w % a == 0 and l % a == 0   # but this is too strong? \n\n            Actually, the known approach is to consider the four corners and the possibility of covering each segment independently or with wrapping.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n            Condition 1: The entire boundary length is divisible by a: 2*(w+l-2) % a == 0.\n\n            Condition 2: The following conditions on the segments:\n\n                Option 1: Cover the four segments independently. Then:\n                    top: w % a == 0\n                    bottom: w % a == 0\n                    left: (l-2) % a == 0   # because the corners are already covered by top and bottom? \n                    right: (l-2) % a == 0\n\n                But wait, if the top and bottom cover the corners, then the left and right are only l-2. Similarly, if we cover the left and right first, then the top and bottom are only w-2.\n\n                But we can choose the order? \n\n                Actually, the problem does not specify the order.\n\n                Option 2: Wrap at one corner. For example, wrap at the top-left corner: \n                    Then the top segment: we cover the entire top? \n                    But then the left segment: we cover from the second row to the second last row? \n                    But then the bottom and right are independent.\n\n                Alternatively, we can have:\n\n                    We require:\n                        (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   ? \n\n                Known solutions for this problem (Codeforces) for \"B. Tiling Challenge\" or similar? \n\n                Actually, the known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) G) is:\n\n                    We consider the divisors of the half_perimeter = w+l-2? \n\n                    And then we check four conditions:\n\n                    Condition 1: if w % a == 0 and l % a == 0 -> then a is valid? \n                    But not exactly.\n\n                After reading an editorial:\n\n                    The valid a must be a divisor of one of:\n\n                      the entire boundary length: 2*(w+l-2)   [but this is not sufficient]\n\n                    Actually, the known solution is to consider the divisors of the half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then check four scenarios:\n\n                    Scenario 1: The entire boundary is covered without wrapping any corner. Then we require:\n                         (w) is divisible by a, and (l) is divisible by a? -> no.\n\n                    Instead, we consider:\n\n                    The boundary is covered in four segments. The tiles can be arranged in such a way that:\n\n                      - The top and bottom are covered by full tiles: then we require w % a == 0 for the top and bottom, and the left and right are covered by tiles that cover the entire segment of length l-2? -> so (l-2) % a == 0.\n\n                      - Or, we wrap at one corner: then we require (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0? \n                      - Or, we wrap at two adjacent corners: then we require (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0? \n                      - Or, we wrap at two opposite corners: then we require (w) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0, but this is the same as the first scenario? \n\n                    Actually, there are four scenarios:\n\n                      Scenario 1: no wrapping: \n                         top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> \n                         conditions: w % a == 0, (l-2) % a == 0.\n\n                      Scenario 2: wrap at the top-left and top-right corners:\n                         This means the top row is covered by one tile that also wraps down the left and right? -> not exactly.\n\n                    Known solution in the provided code snippet: \n\n                      solutions = {1,2}\n\n                      for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                         if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                             for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                                 if w % a <= 2 and (l-1) % a == 0:   # not exactly\n\n                    The provided code has:\n\n                         mod_a = w % a\n                         if mod_a <= 2:\n                             # then what?\n\n                    And then there is a symmetric condition for l.\n\n                    After reading known solutions for \"Counting Rectangles\" or \"Tiling with 1xa\", we have:\n\n                    The valid a must satisfy that the entire boundary can be covered. The scenarios:\n\n                     1. The top and bottom are covered by full tiles (so w % a == 0) and the left and right are covered by full tiles on the segments of length l-2 (so (l-2) % a == 0).\n\n                     2. The top and bottom are covered by full tiles on the segments of length w-2 (so (w-2) % a == 0) and the left and right are covered by full tiles (so l % a == 0).\n\n                     3. The top is covered by full tiles on the segment of length w-1, the bottom similarly, and the left and right are covered by full tiles on the segments of length l-1? \n\n                     Actually, if we wrap at the top-left corner, then the top row has a tile that covers the first a-1 cm of the top and then 1 cm down the left. Then the top row has w - (a-1) left, and the left column has l-1 left. This is complex.\n\n                    Known solution from a known submission for this problem (Codeforces):\n\n                      def solve():\n                          w, l = map(int, input().split())\n                          s = set()\n                          s.add(1)\n                          s.add(2)\n                          # function to check divisor for the four scenarios\n                          def check(a):\n                              if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 and (w-2) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0 and (l % a == 0)):\n                                  return True\n                              return False\n\n                          for tot in [w-1, w-2, l-1, l-2, 0]:\n                              if tot <=0:\n                                  continue\n                              for d in range(1, int(tot**0.5)+1):\n                                  if tot % d == 0:\n                                      if check(d):\n                                          s.add(d)\n                                      if check(tot//d):\n                                          s.add(tot//d)\n                          # also consider the entire boundary length divisors?

\n\n                    The known four scenarios:\n\n                         Scenario 1: no wrapping: requires (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n                         Scenario 2: wrap at two corners (top-left and bottom-left): then the left column is covered by full tiles, and the top and bottom are covered by tiles that start at the left and extend a-1 on the top/bottom and 1 on the left? \n                                    then the top has a overhang of w - (a-1) = w - a + 1, and we require (w - a + 1) % a = (w+1) % a = (w%a +1) % a = (mod_a+1) % a. \n                                    but also the left column: we used 2 tiles that cover 1 cm each on the left, and the rest of the left column (l-2) must be divisible by a? \n                                    -> conditions: (w+1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0.\n\n                         Scenario 3: wrap at one corner (top-left) and one corner (top-right): then the top row is covered by one tile in the middle of length w-2, and the left and right are covered by tiles that cover the entire column? \n                                    conditions: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0.\n\n                         Scenario 4: wrap at top-left and bottom-left and also at the right side? -> complex.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can check the following four conditions for a given a:\n\n                         if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                            (w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n                            ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) ?

\n                         It means that the remainder when w is divided by a is 0,1, or 2.\n\n                    Then we need to check the conditions on l.\n\n                    Similarly, we should also check the symmetric condition with l and w swapped? \n\n                    But the problem: the bathroom is w x l, and the boundary is symmetric in a way, but the scenarios are not symmetric in w and l? \n\n                    Known solution in the provided code structure from known submissions:\n\n                         if w % a <= 2 and (l-1) % a == 0: \n                             then add a\n\n                         also if (w-1) % a == 0 and l % a <= 2: \n                             then add a\n\n                    But the provided code only has one condition: \n                         mod_a = w % a\n                         if mod_a <= 2:\n                             # then what?\n\n                    So in the TODO block, we might need to check several conditions.\n\n                    After reading a known solution for this exact problem (Codeforces Round #784, G. Fall Down), we see:\n\n                         ans = set()\n                         half = w + l - 2\n                         for x in range(1, int(half**0.5)+1):\n                             if half % x == 0:\n                                 for a in [x, half//x]:\n                                     # check if a is valid\n                                     if a > half: continue\n                                     # scenario 1: no wrap on w, wrap on l? \n                                     if w % a <= 2 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n                                     if (w-1) % a == 0 and l % a <= 2:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n                                     if (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n                                     if w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                                         ans.add(a)\n\n                         then also consider a=1 and a=2.\n\n                    But the provided code already has solutions = {1,2} and then iterates.\n\n                    So in the TODO block, we might do:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l % a == 0) or ((l-2) % a == 0): \n                             then add a?\n\n                    But we have to use the condition on w (mod_a<=2) and then check l.\n\n                    Specifically, the known conditions are:\n\n                         Condition 1: if (w % a <= 2) and ((l-1) % a == 0) -> valid.\n                         Condition 2: if (w % a <= 2) and ((l-2) % a == 0) -> valid? \n                         Condition 3: if (w % a <= 2) and (l % a == 0) -> valid.\n\n                    But wait: \n                         Condition 1: \n                             w % a is 0,1, or 2.\n                             (l-1) % a == 0 -> l % a = 1.\n                         Condition 2: \n                             (l-2) % a == 0 -> l % a = 2.\n                         Condition 3:\n                             l % a == 0.\n\n                    So these cover all possibilities for l mod a: 0,1,2.\n\n                    Therefore, if w % a <=2, then regardless of l mod a (as long as it is 0,1, or 2) it is valid? \n\n                    But that is not true. For example, a=4, w=3, l=5: \n                         w % a = 3, which is not <=2 -> skip.\n\n                    a=3: \n                         w=3, a=3: 3%3=0<=2 -> valid.\n                         then we need to check l=5: \n                             Condition1: (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> not 0.\n                             Condition2: (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n                    So we add a=3.\n\n                    a=2: \n                         w=3: 3%2=1<=2 -> valid.\n                         l=5: \n                             Condition1: (5-1)%2=4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n                    a=1: already in the set.\n\n                    a=4: skipped.\n\n                    a=6: half_perimeter = 3+5-2=6, so a=6: \n                         w=3: 3%6=3 -> not<=2 -> skip.\n\n                    a=6 is not added.\n\n                    But the valid a are 1,2,3.\n\n                    So it works.\n\n                    Therefore, in the TODO block, we can do:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But wait: the condition is that at least one of these holds? \n\n                    But note: the conditions are not mutually exclusive. \n\n                    However, we only need to add a once.\n\n                    But what if none of these holds? then we skip.\n\n                    Also, note: the condition on w is already passed: w % a <=2.\n\n                    So the TODO block:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But is that sufficient? \n\n                    Consider a=1 for any w,l: \n                         w % 1 = 0 (<=2) -> condition passed.\n                         l % 1 = 0 -> then we add 1.\n\n                    a=2: \n                         passed if w%2 is 0,1, or 2 (which is always true) and then if l%2 is 0 or (l-1)%2==0 or (l-2)%2==0? \n                         (l-2)%2 = (l%2) so it's always true? \n                         because l mod 2 is either 0 or 1.\n                         if l mod 2 =0: then l%2=0 -> true.\n                         if l mod 2 =1: then (l-1)%2=0 -> true.\n\n                    So a=2 is always valid? \n\n                    But the boundary length is 2*(w+l-2), which is even, so divisible by 2. And the condition on the segments: \n                         We can cover with 1x2 tiles: \n                             For example, if w is even and l is even: \n                                 top: w even -> covered.\n                                 bottom: w even.\n                                 left: l-2 even -> covered.\n                                 right: l-2 even.\n                             If w is odd and l is odd: \n                                 then we can wrap at the corners.\n\n                    So a=2 is always valid.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n                    But note: the problem says a can be 1, and we have a=1 and a=2 in the initial set. \n\n                    So we are good.\n\n                    However, the provided code also iterates on a in [i, div] and we are only checking for one orientation (w and then l). \n\n                    Do we need to swap w and l? \n\n                    The condition we checked: \n                         w % a <=2 and (l % a ==0 or (l-1)%a==0 or (l-2)%a==0)\n\n                    This covers one orientation. \n\n                    But the scenarios might be symmetric? \n\n                    For example, the scenario where we use the tile in the other orientation? \n\n                    But the tile is 1xa and can be rotated, so it is the same. \n\n                    And the bathroom is w x l, and we are checking both w and l in the conditions.\n\n                    But wait: the condition on w is only that the remainder is 0,1, or 2. And the condition on l is that either l, l-1, or l-2 is divisible by a.\n\n                    This is not symmetric in w and l. \n\n                    For example, if we swap w and l, then we would check:\n\n                         l % a <=2 and (w % a ==0 or (w-1)%a==0 or (w-2)%a==0)\n\n                    But the known solution in the loop for a might not do the swap. \n\n                    However, the set `solutions` is common. \n\n                    And we are iterating the divisors. \n\n                    But the provided code does not swap. \n\n                    To be safe, we should also check the symmetric condition? \n\n                    But the known solution in the editorial for this problem (Codeforces) does not swap in the same loop; they do:\n\n                         if (w % a <=2 and (l % a==0 or (l-1)%a==0 or (l-2)%a==0)) or (l % a <=2 and (w % a==0 or (w-1)%a==0 or (w-2)%a==0)):\n\n                    But the problem: the initial condition in the provided code is only on w: \n\n                         mod_a = w % a\n                         if mod_a <= 2:\n                             # then we check l\n\n                    So we are not checking the symmetric condition where we start with l. \n\n                    Therefore, we should also check:\n\n                         mod_a = l % a   [but we don't have that]\n\n                    Alternatively, we can do in the TODO block:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n                         # and also check the symmetric condition for l and w swapped?\n                         mod_a_l = l % a\n                         if mod_a_l <= 2:\n                             if (w-1) % a == 0 or (w-2) % a == 0 or w % a == 0:\n                                 solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But note: a might be added twice, but set will handle duplicates.\n\n                    However, the problem: the provided code has only one condition on w. \n\n                    To do the symmetric condition, we would need to compute l % a. \n\n                    But we can do:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n                         if (w-1) % a == 0 or (w-2) % a == 0 or w % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But wait: this is not the symmetric condition; this is two separate conditions. \n\n                    And they might be both true.\n\n                    But that's okay.\n\n                    However, is it correct? \n\n                    Consider a valid a that is found by the symmetric condition: \n                         For example, a=3 for w=5, l=3: \n                             This is the same as the example we had, just swapped.\n                             In the first condition: \n                                 w=5, a=3: 5%3=2<=2 -> then we check l=3: \n                                     (3-1)%3=2 -> not 0\n                                     (3-2)%3=1 -> not 0\n                                     3%3=0 -> true.\n                                 so we add a=3.\n\n                    So it works.\n\n                    But note: the condition on w in the if-statement is already passed: we are in the block because w % a <=2.\n\n                    Then we are checking the condition on l. \n\n                    And then we also want to check the condition where we use l as the width and w as the length? \n\n                    But the problem: the bathroom is w x l, and the tile can be used in any orientation. \n\n                    So the condition should be the same. \n\n                    Therefore, the first condition (using w and then l) should suffice.\n\n                    Why would we need the symmetric condition? \n\n                    Consider a valid a that is not caught by the first condition? \n                         Example: w=5, l=3, a=3: \n                             w=5: 5%3=2<=2 -> then we check l=3: 3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n                    So we don't need the symmetric condition in this example.\n\n                    Another example: w=4, l=5, a=3.\n                         w=4: 4%3=1<=2 -> valid.\n                         l=5: \n                             (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> not 0\n                             (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n                    So we add.\n\n                    But what if a valid a is such that w % a >2, but l % a<=2 and then the condition on w holds? \n                         Example: w=5, l=4, a=3.\n                         w=5: 5%3=2<=2 -> valid.\n                         l=4: \n                             (4-1)%3=3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n                    So we add.\n\n                    Therefore, the first condition suffices.\n\n                    So the TODO block is:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But note: the condition (l-1)%a==0 means (l-1) is divisible by a, which is the same as l % a == 1.\n\n                    Similarly, (l-2)%a==0 means l % a == 2.\n\n                    And l % a == 0 means divisible.\n\n                    So we are checking that l mod a is in {0,1,2}. \n\n                    And since a>=1, and l mod a is in [0, a-1], this is always true for a>=3? \n\n                    No, for example, l=7, a=5: 7 mod 5 = 2 -> valid? \n                         But is a=5 valid for w and l? \n                         We passed w % a <=2, say w= something that gives remainder 0,1, or 2.\n\n                         Then we would add a=5.\n\n                    But is a=5 valid for a bathroom of size w x l? \n                         The boundary length = 2*(w+l-2) must be divisible by a=5? \n                         But we are iterating the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2, so if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a only if a also divides 2? or not necessarily? \n\n                         Actually, half_perimeter = w+l-2, and a is a divisor of half_perimeter, so half_perimeter = k * a.\n                         Then the boundary length = 2 * half_perimeter = 2*k*a, which is divisible by a.\n\n                         So the divisibility of the boundary is guaranteed.\n\n                         Then the only conditions are on the segments: which we are checking by the remainders.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition is that the boundary is covered if the per-segment conditions on the remainders are satisfied.\n\n                    So the TODO block is:\n\n                         if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or l % a == 0:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But note: the condition might be written as:\n\n                         if l % a in [0,1,2]:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But wait: \n                         (l-1)%a==0 -> l%a=1.\n                         (l-2)%a==0 -> l%a=2.\n                         l%a==0 -> 0.\n\n                    So we can write:\n\n                         if l % a in (0,1,2):\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    However, note: \n                         (l-1)%a==0 is not exactly l%a=1? \n                         Example: l=1, a=2: (1-1)%2=0%2=0 -> then we add.\n                         But l%a = 1%2=1, which is in (0,1,2).\n\n                    So we can do:\n\n                         if l % a in [0,1,2]:\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But is that equivalent? \n                         l % a = r, where 0<=r<a.\n                         We want to know if r is 0,1, or 2.\n\n                    But the conditions (l-1)%a==0 means r=1? \n                         (l-1) % a = (r-1) mod a? \n                         We require (l-1)%a==0 -> (r-1) mod a =0 -> r-1 is divisible by a -> but r-1 is in [-1, a-2]. The only possibility is r=1.\n\n                    Similarly, (l-2)%a==0 means (r-2) mod a=0 -> r=2.\n\n                    And l%a==0 means r=0.\n\n                    So the condition is exactly that l % a is in {0,1,2}.\n\n                    Therefore, we can write:\n\n                         if l % a in (0,1,2):\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n                    But note: the condition in the if-statement is after checking w % a <=2.\n\n                    So the TODO block for program2.py is:\n\n                         if l % a in (0,1,2):\n                             solutions.add(a)\n\n   However, the known solution in the editorial might also include a=1 and a=2 initially, and then add more.\n\n   But we are only iterating the divisors of half_perimeter. Are there other a that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n   The problem: the boundary length is 2*(w+l-2). So if a does not divide the boundary length, then we cannot cover. \n\n   Therefore, we only consider the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n   But note: the boundary length is 2*(w+l-2). So a must divide the boundary length. \n\n   And the provided code iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2. \n\n   But a might not divide half_perimeter but might divide 2*(w+l-2)? \n\n   For example, if a is even and a/2 divides half_perimeter, then a divides 2*(w+l-2). \n\n   Therefore, we should iterate over the divisors of 2*(w+l-2)? \n\n   But the provided code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n   And then it checks the conditions. \n\n   But if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then it is also a divisor of 2*(w+l-2)? \n\n   However, there might be divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n   For example, a=4 for half_perimeter=6: 4 is not a divisor of 6, but 4 is a divisor of 12.\n\n   So the provided code might miss a=4.\n\n   Therefore, the known solutions iterate over the divisors of both half_perimeter and also the divisors of the boundary length? \n\n   But the note: the provided code in program2.py does not do that. \n\n   And the problem says: the output contains at most 200000 integers, and the provided code structure is given.\n\n   We must follow the provided code structure.\n\n   Given the time, and since the known condition is that a must divide the boundary length, we would need to iterate over the divisors of the boundary length. \n\n   But the provided code only iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter. \n\n   How to reconcile? \n\n   We can also include the divisors of 2? and then the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\n   But the provided code does not do that.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the boundary length = 2 * half_perimeter. \n        So the divisors of the boundary length = \n             { d such that d divides 2 * half_perimeter }\n\n        = { d : d divides 2 * half_perimeter }\n\n   We can iterate over the divisors of half_perimeter and then also consider 2*d for each divisor d of half_perimeter? \n\n   But the provided code does not do that.\n\n   Given the constraints (w,l up to 1e9), iterating over the divisors of 2*half_perimeter might be heavy.\n\n   But the problem: the sum of the number of test cases is at most 100, and the number of divisors of a number up to 2e9 is about 2000,"
