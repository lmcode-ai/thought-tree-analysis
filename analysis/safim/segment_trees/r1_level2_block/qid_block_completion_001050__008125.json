Example: s=\"01\", n=2. pre[0]=0, pre[1]=1.\n\n          i=1:\n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n            dp1 = (2-1) + min(0, M1) = 1 + 0 = 1. Then update:\n            M0 = min(10**18, 1 - 1) = min(10**18,0)=0\n            M1 = min(10**18, 1 + 1 - 2) = min(10**18,0)=0\n\n          Then answer = min(1,1)=1. How can we do it? We can change the last character to '0': then we get \"00\", which is one segment -> cost=1. Or change the first to '1': then we get \"11\", which is one segment -> cost=1. But note: we can also form two segments? If we do nothing: the natural segmentation is two segments: [0] and [1] -> both length 1 -> odd -> not allowed. So we must change at least one character?",

So 0 operations? But wait, the string is \"0011\", which naturally segments into [00] and [11] -> two segments, each of length 2 -> even. So 0 operations? Therefore, the answer is 0. However, our dp1=0 is correct. How did we get that? For state1 at i=3: \n                    = (4-2) + min(0, M1) = 2 + min(0, -2) = 0. Why? because M1 = -2, so min(0,-2) = -2, then 2-2=0. How did M1 become -2? From i=1: we computed M1 = min(10**18, dp0 + pre[1] - 2) = min(10**18, 0+0-2) = -2. Then at i=3: we use j=2 (which is even) and then the recurrence for state1: \n                = (4-2) + min(0, M1) = 2 + (-2) = 0. This corresponds to: We break at j=2: the segment [2,3] is set to 1? and the previous segment [0,1] is set to 0? The cost for the segment [2,3] = number of zeros in [2,3] = 0? And the cost for the segment [0,1] = 0? Then total cost = 0? But note: the recurrence for state1 at i=3: = min( (4-2), M1 + (4-2) ) = min(2, -2+2) = min(2,0)=0. This 0 comes from the term: \n                dp[j-1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) \n                = dp[1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) \n                = 0 + 0 = 0.",

Let's test with the example: s=\"01\", n=2. pre[0]=0, pre[1]=1. i=1:\n            min0 = min(0, M0) = min(0,10**18)=0 -> dp0 = 1+0=1. min1 = min(0,10**18)=0 -> dp1 = (2-1)+0=1. Then update:\n                M0 = min(10**18, 1-1)=min(10**18,0)=0. M1 = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=min(10**18,0)=0. Then answer = min(1,1)=1.\n\n        Example: s=\"00\", n=2. pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0. i=1:\n            dp0 = 0+0=0.\n            dp1 = 2+0=2.

But the string \"11\": \n            pre[0]=1, pre[1]=2? Then:\n            dp0 = 2 + min(0,10**18)=2.\n            dp1 = (2-2)+min(0,10**18)=0.

Or \"1111\" -> cost=2? Or \"0011\" -> cost=0? but wait: \n                The string \"0101\": \n                  natural segmentation: [0], [1], [0], [1] -> four segments, each length 1 -> not allowed. We can merge? We can change the second character to '0': then \"0001\" -> segments: [000] and [1] -> both odd -> not allowed. We can change the second to '0' and the last to '0': then \"0000\" -> one segment -> cost=2. Or change the first to '1', the third to '1': then \"1111\" -> cost=2. But note: we can also form: [0,1] as \"00\" (by changing the second to '0') -> cost=1, then [2,3] as \"11\" (by changing the last to '1') -> cost=1 -> total=2. So 2 operations.",

In the example \"0101\", at i=3, we considered:\n          j=0: entire segment [0,3] set to 0: cost = number of ones = 2 -> 2 operations. j=0: entire segment set to 1: cost = number of zeros = 2 -> 2 operations.\n          j=2: \n             for state0: we use the recurrence: \n                 = M0 + pre[3] = 0 + 2 = 2.\n             for state1: = M1 + (4-2)=0+2=2. So we get 2. But what if we break at j=0 and j=2? We break at j=0: then the segment [0,1] is set to 0: cost = number of ones in [0,1]=1 -> then the segment [2,3] is set to 1: cost = number of zeros in [2,3]=1 -> total=2. How is this captured? In the recurrence for the segment [2,3] (which is the last segment) we use j=2? Then the state for the segment [0,1] is stored in dp[1][0] (if we set it to 0) which we computed as 1? Then the cost for the segment [2,3] set to 1: \n              = dp[1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) = 1 + 1 = 2. But wait, we also have the option for the segment [2,3] set to 1: = min( (4-2) [which is 2], M1 + (4-2) ) \n          and M1 at the time of i=3 was 0? so we get 2. How did we update M1? After i=1: M1 = min(10**18, dp0 + pre[1] - 2) = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=0. Then at i=3: \n            dp1 = (4-2) + min(0,0)=2. So we did not capture the 1+1=2? Actually, we did: because the recurrence for state1 at i=3: \n            = min( (4-2), M1 + (4-2) ) = min(2, 0+2)=min(2,2)=2. And the recurrence for state0 at i=3: = min(2, 0+2)=2. So we get 2.

So it is valid, and cost=1. But the expected answer is 2? Why is the sample output 2? The problem sample input: \n                5\n                2\n                00\n                2\n                11\n                4\n                0000\n                4\n                0011\n                6\n                001101   -> output 2\n\n            But we found a solution with 1. What's going on? Let me read the problem again: \n                \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\"\n\n            In our solution, we have three segments: [0,1],[2,3],[4,5] -> 3 segments. But the natural segmentation (minimal number of contiguous subsegments) for the string \"00001100\" (if we change the last two to \"00\")? Actually, the string after changes is \"00\",\"11\",\"00\" -> but the entire string is \"001100\" -> \n                    The natural segmentation is: [0,1]: '00 ' -> segment1\n                        [2,3]: '11' -> segment2 [4,5]: '00' -> segment3 So three segments. But is there a way to have fewer than three segments?",

We change [2,3] from \"11\" to \"00\": cost=2, and [4,5] from \"01\" to \"00\": cost=1? total=3? Or if we set [0,3] to '0': then we change the two ones to zeros: cost=2, and [4,5] to '0': cost=1 -> total=3. Or if we set [0,5] to '0': cost= number of ones in the entire string = 3. But we found a solution with 1 operation that yields three segments, which is valid. Why is the sample output 2? I see: the problem says: \"the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" -> but we are not forced to use the minimal number of segments?",

Similarly for dp[i][1]:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]),   # because if we set the segment to 1, the cost is the number of zeros = (length - ones) = (i+1) - pre[i] \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + ( (i+1 - pre[i]) - (j - pre[j-1]) ) } \n                        ) But note: the number of zeros in [j, i] = (i - j + 1) - (pre[i] - pre[j-1]) = (i - j + 1) - pre[i] + pre[j-1]\n\n          Then:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + (i - j + 1 - pre[i] + pre[j-1]) } \n                        )\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } ) [because (i - j + 1) = (i+1) - j, so we can write: = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                       min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j? \n                ) Actually, let me rearrange:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j?   -> this doesn't factor easily. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) + ( - (i+1) + j ) \n                 )\n\n          But note: the term (i+1 - pre[i]) is independent of j, so:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j \n                 ) But j is the starting index? and we are summing over j? Actually, we can do:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + ( (i - j + 1) - (pre[i] - pre[j-1]) ) } \n                        ) = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + (i - j + 1) - pre[i] + pre[j-1] } \n                ) = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1) - pre[i] \n                ) [because (i - j + 1) = (i+1) - j]\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } )\n\n        But wait, that would be:\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)   where M1 = min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } However, note: we have two different expressions for the two states. Actually, for dp[i][0]:\n          dp[i][0] = min( pre[i], \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] + pre[i] - pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = min( pre[i], \n                          pre[i] + min_{j} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = pre[i] + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } )\n\n        Similarly, for dp[i][1]:\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + (i+1) - j - pre[i] + pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          (i+1 - pre[i]) + min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } \n                        )\n                   = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } ) Therefore, we can maintain:\n\n          M0 = minimum value of (dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1]) for j even and j<=i (and j>=2) \n          M1 = minimum value of (dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j) for j even and j<=i (and j>=2)\n\n        But note: in the expression for dp[i][0] we have min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] }. And for dp[i][1] we have min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j }.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we have a string `s` of even length.\n We want to partition the string into contiguous subsegments of the same character, and we require that every segment has an even length.\n We can change any character to '0' or '1' at a cost of one operation per change.\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of operations.\n\n Note: The problem states that we are to divide into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments (which is naturally achieved by grouping consecutive same characters).\n\n However, we are allowed to change some characters. The idea is to try to merge adjacent segments when possible to avoid having a segment of odd length.\n\n Observation:\n In the natural segmentation (without any changes), we break the string at positions where adjacent characters differ.\n But if we change a character, we might merge two adjacent segments (if we change the boundary character to match the adjacent segment) or split a segment? Actually, we can only change a character to merge adjacent segments or change the entire segment.\n\n However, note that we require every segment to have even length.\n\n How can we think?\n Let the natural segmentation be: segments of consecutive same characters. The lengths of these segments might be odd or even.\n\n We are allowed to change a character. Changing a character at a boundary can merge two adjacent segments? But note: if we change a boundary character, we merge two adjacent segments of the same new character? Actually, if we change a boundary character, we might merge two segments that are adjacent and become the same.\n\n However, note: we are free to change any character arbitrarily. We are not forced to merge only adjacent segments? Actually, we can change any character arbitrarily, so we can also break a segment? But note: we are going to partition into contiguous segments of same characters. The partition is done by the boundaries where adjacent characters differ.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even lengths. Moreover, the segments must be contiguous and of the same character.\n\n We can use dynamic programming? But note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200,000. However, the problem says the sum of n over test cases is 200,000? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2e5\". So we can do O(n) per test case? Actually, the total n is 200,000, so we can do a linear solution.\n\n Insight:\n\n Consider the natural segmentation. Let the segments be: [l1, r1], [r1+1, r2], ... with lengths L1, L2, ... \n\n We know that we can change a character to merge two adjacent segments? But note: if we change a character at a boundary, we merge two adjacent segments of the same character? Actually, if we change the boundary character to the same as the left segment, then the left segment and the boundary character become part of the left? But then the segment to the right loses its first character? Actually, we can also change the boundary to the same as the right segment? \n\n However, note: we are allowed to change any character arbitrarily. We can also change a character in the middle of a segment? \n\n But note: the problem does not require the segmentation to be the natural one. We can choose any segmentation as long as each segment is contiguous and of the same character, and we want the minimum number of operations to achieve that the entire string can be partitioned into segments of even length.\n\n How about we think greedily?\n\n We traverse the string and try to form segments of even length. We can start from the left and form as long a segment as possible? But note: we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use the natural boundaries. We can assign a segment arbitrarily. But the requirement is that the entire string is partitioned and each segment has even length.\n\n We can use a greedy algorithm that traverses the string and forms segments of even length. We can consider:\n\n   Let dp[i] = minimum operations to make the prefix s[0:i] good, and then we form a segment from i to j, and then j+1 to ...?\n\n But note: the total n over test cases is 200,000, but the length of each string can be up to 200,000? Actually, the problem says the sum of n over test cases is 200,000. So we can do O(n) per test case? Actually, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2e5\", so we can do a linear solution.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000. So we can do a single pass per test case.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length. Therefore, the entire string length is even (which it is) and each segment must be even.\n\n Moreover, we can change a character arbitrarily. We can also note that the parity of the segment length is what matters.\n\n We can break the string into segments arbitrarily? But we want to minimize the operations.\n\n How about we consider the following:\n\n   We can form a segment of length 2? or 4? etc.\n\n   We traverse the string and try to form segments of minimal even length? Actually, we can form a segment of length 2? But note: if we form a segment of length 2, then we require that the two characters are the same? Because the segment must be of the same character.\n\n   So if we have two consecutive characters that are the same, we can form a segment of length 2 without any operation? But if they are different, we can change one of them to make them the same? That would cost 1 operation.\n\n   However, what if we form a segment of length 4? Then we have four consecutive characters. We can change some of them to make them all the same? But note: we can also have two segments of length 2? \n\n   Actually, we are free to choose the segmentation arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total operations.\n\n   We can use a greedy algorithm that forms segments of length 2 as much as possible? But sometimes we might avoid an operation by merging two adjacent segments? \n\n   However, note: if we have a segment of length 4, we can form it by having two segments of length 2? Then we would have two segments. But if we form one segment of length 4, we have one segment. The problem does not require the minimum number of segments? It only requires that the partition has segments of even length. And we want to minimize the operations.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"divide into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" (in the natural way) but then we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily and then we can choose any partition? Actually, the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\" -> This is the natural segmentation. But then we are allowed to change the string arbitrarily? And then we can choose any partition? Actually, the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze wants to make s good by changing the values of some positions in s\". Then after the changes, we consider the natural segmentation (minimum number of contiguous subsegments) and we require that every segment has even length.\n\n   So after we change the string, we break the string at every adjacent different characters, and then we require that every segment (which is a maximal contiguous same character) has even length.\n\n   Therefore, we are free to change the string arbitrarily, and then we get a natural segmentation. We want the natural segmentation to have all segments of even length, and we want to minimize the number of changes.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   We can use dynamic programming:\n\n   Let dp[i] = minimum operations to make the prefix s[0:i] (i characters) good.\n\n   How to form a segment ending at i? The segment must be of even length and same character. Moreover, the segment must be maximal? Actually, the natural segmentation will break at the next change. But note: we are forming the entire string. We can consider the last segment.\n\n   The last segment must be from j to i (with length L = i - j + 1, which must be even) and the entire segment must be the same character. The cost for this segment: we have to change some characters in the segment to make them all the same? Actually, we can choose the character for the segment arbitrarily.\n\n   For a fixed segment [j, i] and if we choose the segment to be all '0', then the cost is the number of '1' in [j, i]. Similarly, if we choose '1', then the cost is the number of '0'. So the cost for the segment is min( count0, count1 )? Actually, no: we are allowed to change arbitrarily, so we can set the entire segment to either 0 or 1, and the cost is the number of positions that are not the chosen bit.\n\n   Therefore, for a segment [j, i] (with length L even), the cost is min( count0, count1 ).\n\n   Then: dp[i] = min_{j: j<=i and (i-j+1) is even} { dp[j-1] + cost(j, i) }.\n\n   But note: the entire segment must be contiguous and same, and then the natural segmentation will break at j (if j>0) and at i (if i<n) only if the next character is different? Actually, we are forming the entire prefix [0:i]. The natural segmentation for the entire string after our changes might have the segment [j, i] as the last segment, and then the segment before that is [k, j-1] and we require that the character of [k, j-1] is different from the character we choose for [j, i]? Otherwise, they would merge? \n\n   Therefore, we must also ensure that the character of the segment [j, i] is different from the character of the segment ending at j-1? \n\n   So we need to keep track of the character of the last segment? \n\n   Let dp[i][0] = minimum operations to make the prefix [0:i] good and the last segment is all '0'\n   dp[i][1] = minimum operations to make the prefix [0:i] good and the last segment is all '1'\n\n   Then:\n\n   dp[i][0] = min_{j: j<=i, (i-j+1) even} { \n        dp[j-1][1] + (number of ones in [j, i])   # because we set the entire segment to 0, so ones must be changed to 0 -> cost = ones\n        # but note: we cannot use j-1 if j==0? then we have no previous segment? then we don't require the previous segment to be different? Actually, if j==0, then the entire segment is from 0 to i, and we set it to 0. Then the cost is the number of ones in [0,i]. And we don't have a previous segment to conflict.\n\n        However, what if we set the segment to 0 and the previous segment (if exists) is also 0? Then they would merge? So we must avoid that? \n\n        Therefore, we require that the segment [j, i] is set to 0 and the segment ending at j-1 must be 1? \n\n        Similarly, if j==0, then we don't have a previous segment, so we don't care.\n\n   }\n\n   Similarly for dp[i][1].\n\n   But note: the state must also remember the last segment's character to avoid merging.\n\n   However, the state dimension becomes 2, and we iterate j from 0 to i. The total n can be up to 200,000? But the total n over test cases is 200,000, but note: the inner loop j would be O(n) and then total O(n^2) which is 200,000^2 = 40e9, too slow.\n\n   We need a more efficient solution.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   We note that the problem constraints on the total n is 200,000, but that is the sum of the lengths of all test cases. However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2e5\". So we can do an O(n) solution per test case? But O(n^2) is too slow.\n\n   We need to optimize the DP.\n\n   How about we note:\n\n     The segment [j, i] must have even length: so j = i+1 - L, and L is even -> j must be such that j and i have the same parity? Actually, if we consider indices: \n        j must be odd when i is odd? because (i - j + 1) mod 2 = (i mod2 - j mod2 + 1) mod2 = 0 -> so j mod2 = (i+1) mod2? Actually, (i - j + 1) mod2 = (i mod2 - j mod2 + 1) mod2 = 0 -> so (i mod2 + 1) mod2 = j mod2.\n\n        Actually: \n          if i is even: then j must be odd? because (even - j + 1) is even -> even+1 is odd, so j must be odd? \n          if i is odd: then j must be even? because (odd - j + 1) is even -> odd+1 is even, so j must be even? \n\n        So j must have the opposite parity to i? Actually, let me check:\n\n          i even: j must be odd? because even - j + 1 = even -> j must be odd? \n          Example: i=2 (0-indexed, so we consider positions 0,1,2 -> length=3? actually we are considering j to i, so the segment is from j to i inclusive. The length is i-j+1. For i=2 (the third element), we want j such that 2-j+1 is even -> 3-j is even -> j must be odd? but j can be 1: then length=2 (positions 1,2) -> 2 is even? but j=1 is odd. j=0: length=3 -> odd -> not allowed.\n\n        Actually, we want even length: so for a fixed i, j must be such that (i-j+1) is even -> j = i+1 - even. So j must be i+1 mod2? \n\n        Actually: \n          (i - j + 1) mod 2 = 0  => (i+1 - j) mod2 = 0 => j mod2 = (i+1) mod2.\n\n        So for i, j must have the same parity as i+1? \n\n        Example: i=0: then j=0: because (0-0+1)=1 -> odd -> not allowed. So we cannot have a segment ending at 0? But we must have a segment. Actually, we can have a segment of length 2? but i=0 is the first character. Then we must have j=0? but then the segment is [0,0] -> length=1 -> odd -> not allowed. \n\n        This indicates: we cannot have a segment ending at 0? Then how do we form the string? \n\n        Actually, the problem states that the entire string has even length. We are processing the prefix. We must form the entire prefix. So we must have j=0 only if the entire prefix is even? But we are at i=0, which is the first character. We cannot form a segment of even length starting at 0 and ending at 0? \n\n        Therefore, we must start at j=0 and go to j=1? Then the segment is [0,1] -> length=2, even. Then we can set dp[1] = ... \n\n        So we see: we process even indices? Actually, we can only end a segment at an odd index? (0-indexed: the positions are 0,1,...,n-1). The segment must end at an odd index? because the length is even: \n          segment [0,1]: ends at index1 (which is the second element) -> index1=1 (odd)\n          segment [0,3]: ends at index3 (odd)\n\n        So the DP state is only defined for odd indices? \n\n        Actually, we can have a segment that ends at an even index? For example, [0,1] ends at 1 (odd). [0,3] ends at 3 (odd). But what about [0,2]? that would be length=3 -> odd -> not allowed. So we cannot end a segment at an even index? \n\n        Therefore, we only define dp[i] for i odd? \n\n        Then the entire string must be processed? and the last index is n-1. Since n is even, n-1 is odd. So we are good.\n\n        So we only consider i that are odd? \n\n        Then we can do:\n\n          dp[i] = minimum operations for the prefix [0:i] (i is odd)\n\n          Then we consider j from 0 to i, with j having the same parity as i+1? Actually, j must be such that (i-j+1) is even -> j must be (i+1) mod2. Since i is odd, i+1 mod2=0, so j must be even.\n\n          And we break the segment at j: the segment is [j, i]. The previous segment ends at j-1, which must be odd? because j is even -> j-1 is odd? and we require that the segment [j, i] has a different character than the segment ending at j-1? \n\n        How do we compute the cost for the segment [j, i]? \n          We can choose the character for the segment arbitrarily. But we have two choices: 0 or 1. And we require that it is different from the last segment's character (if j>0). If j==0, then we don't have a previous segment.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n          dp[i][0] = min_{j even, 0<=j<=i} { \n              (if j>0: dp[j-1][1] + cost0 ) \n              (if j==0: cost0) \n          }\n\n          where cost0 = number of ones in [j, i]   [if we set the segment to 0]\n\n          Similarly, \n          dp[i][1] = min_{j even, 0<=j<=i} { \n              (if j>0: dp[j-1][0] + cost1 ) \n              (if j==0: cost1) \n          }\n\n          where cost1 = number of zeros in [j, i]\n\n        But note: we are allowed to change the segment arbitrarily? Actually, we are setting the entire segment to 0 or 1. The cost is the number of mismatches.\n\n        However, we are not forced to set the entire segment to one character? Actually, we can change any character arbitrarily. But then we require that the entire segment becomes the same character. The minimal cost for making the segment [j,i] all 0 is the number of ones in the segment. Similarly for 1.\n\n        But note: we are not forced to set the entire segment to the same character by changing only the ones that are not 0? Yes.\n\n        Now, how to optimize? We have to iterate j from 0 to i (stepping by 2? because j must be even) and i is odd. The total number of states is about n/2, and for each state we iterate over about i/2 states? Then the total complexity is O(n^2) which is too slow for n=200,000? Actually, the total n over test cases is 200,000, but the inner loop would be O(n) and then total operations O(n^2) = (200,000)^2 = 40e9, which is too high.\n\n        We need to optimize the transition.\n\n        We can rewrite:\n\n          dp[i][0] = min_{j even} { \n              (if j>0: dp[j-1][1] + (number of ones in [j, i]) \n              else: (number of ones in [0, i])\n          }\n\n          Similarly for dp[i][1].\n\n        How to compute the number of ones quickly? We can precompute prefix sums for ones.\n\n        Let pre0[i] = number of ones in the prefix [0, i]? Actually, we can define:\n\n          pre[i] = prefix sum of ones? \n\n          Then the number of ones in [j, i] = pre[i] - pre[j-1] (if j>=1) or pre[i] if j=0.\n\n        Then:\n\n          dp[i][0] = min_{j even, 0<=j<=i} { \n              (if j>0: dp[j-1][1] + pre[i] - pre[j-1] \n               else: pre[i])\n          }\n\n          = min( pre[i], min_{j even, j=2,4,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] + pre[i] - pre[j-1] } )\n\n          = pre[i] + min(0, min_{j even, j=2,4,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } )   [but note: we have to subtract pre[i] only once?]\n\n        Actually, we can factor:\n\n          = min( pre[i], \n                 min_{j even, j=2,4,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } + pre[i] \n                )\n\n        So we can let:\n\n          M0 = minimum value of (dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1]) for j even in [0, i] (but note j>=2) and similarly we can update as we go.\n\n        Similarly for dp[i][1]:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]),   # because if we set the segment to 1, the cost is the number of zeros = (length - ones) = (i+1) - pre[i] \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + ( (i+1 - pre[i]) - (j - pre[j-1]) ) } \n                        )\n\n          But note: the number of zeros in [j, i] = (i - j + 1) - (pre[i] - pre[j-1]) \n          = (i - j + 1) - pre[i] + pre[j-1]\n\n          Then:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + (i - j + 1 - pre[i] + pre[j-1]) } \n                        )\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } )   [because (i - j + 1) = (i+1) - j, so we can write: \n                = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                       min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j? \n                )\n\n          Actually, let me rearrange:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j?   -> this doesn't factor easily.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) + ( - (i+1) + j ) \n                 )\n\n          But note: the term (i+1 - pre[i]) is independent of j, so:\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) - (i+1) + j \n                 )\n\n          But j is the starting index? and we are summing over j? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + ( (i - j + 1) - (pre[i] - pre[j-1]) ) } \n                        )\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + (i - j + 1) - pre[i] + pre[j-1] } \n                )\n\n          = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                 min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1) - pre[i] \n                )   [because (i - j + 1) = (i+1) - j]\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } )\n\n        But wait, that would be:\n\n          = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)   where M1 = min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j }\n\n        However, note: we have two different expressions for the two states.\n\n        Actually, for dp[i][0]:\n          dp[i][0] = min( pre[i], \n                          min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] + pre[i] - pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = min( pre[i], \n                          pre[i] + min_{j} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = pre[i] + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } )\n\n        Similarly, for dp[i][1]:\n          dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + (i+1) - j - pre[i] + pre[j-1] } \n                        )\n                   = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                          (i+1 - pre[i]) + min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } \n                        )\n                   = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } )\n\n        Therefore, we can maintain:\n\n          M0 = minimum value of (dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1]) for j even and j<=i (and j>=2) \n          M1 = minimum value of (dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j) for j even and j<=i (and j>=2)\n\n        But note: in the expression for dp[i][0] we have min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] }.\n\n        And for dp[i][1] we have min_{j even, j=2,...,i} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j }.\n\n        However, note: j is even, so j-1 is odd. And we are iterating i (which is odd) from 1, 3, 5, ... \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Let A = a large array for the minima? But note we are iterating i.\n\n          We can update M0 and M1 as we go.\n\n          Steps:\n\n          Initialize:\n            dp[1][0] = min( pre[1], ... ) \n            But for i=1 (the second character, index1), we consider j=0 and j=2? but j must be even and <=1 -> only j=0.\n\n            For j=0: \n               dp[1][0] = pre[1]   [if we set the segment [0,1] to 0: cost = number of ones in [0,1] = pre[1]]\n               dp[1][1] = (2 - pre[1])   [if we set to 1: cost = number of zeros = 2 - pre[1]]\n\n            Then we update M0 and M1 for j=0? Actually, j=0: then we consider j-1 = -1 -> we don't have a segment ending at -1. So we don't update M0 and M1 from j=0? \n\n            But note: in the recurrence for a future i (say i=3), we might use j=0? Then we would use the term for j=0: which is pre[i] for state0? and (i+1 - pre[i]) for state1? and we don't use the min_{j} part for j=0? because j=0 is handled separately? \n\n            Actually, we included j=0 in the min( ... ) as the first term. So we don't need to include j=0 in the min_{j>=2} part.\n\n          Therefore, we can maintain:\n\n            M0 = a very large number (like 10**18) initially\n            M1 = a very large number initially\n\n          Then for i from 1, 3, 5, ... (odd indices) up to n-1:\n\n            dp[i][0] = min( pre[i+1]? wait, note: our pre array: we defined pre[i] for the prefix [0,i]. \n\n            Actually, we have the string s of length n. We are using 0-indexing.\n\n            Let pre[i] = number of ones in s[0..i] (inclusive). \n\n            Then for a segment [j, i] (with j even, and i odd), the number of ones is pre[i] - (pre[j-1] if j>=1 else 0). \n\n            But note: if j=0, then the segment [0,i] has pre[i] ones.\n\n            For j>=2: the segment [j,i] has pre[i] - pre[j-1] ones.\n\n            Then:\n\n              dp[i][0] = min( pre[i] - (pre[-1] for j-1? but j=0: we use pre[i] without subtracting anything) \n                            , min_{j even, j in [2, i] (step 2)} { dp[j-1][1] + pre[i] - pre[j-1] } \n                            )\n\n            But we can write:\n\n              candidate0 = pre[i]   # for j=0\n              candidate0 = min(candidate0, M0 + pre[i])   # if we use M0 = min_{j even, j in [2, i]} { dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1] } -> then candidate0 = min(candidate0, M0+pre[i])\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n              candidate0 = min( pre[i], M0 + pre[i] ) \n                         = pre[i] + min(0, M0)   [if M0 is negative, then we use M0+pre[i] which is pre[i]+M0, otherwise we use pre[i]]\n\n            But note: M0 is the minimum of (dp[j-1][1] - pre[j-1]) for j in [2, i] (even j). It might be negative? \n\n            Similarly, for state1:\n\n              candidate1 = (i+1 - pre[i])   # for j=0: the entire segment set to 1: cost = zeros = (i+1) - pre[i]\n              candidate1 = min(candidate1, M1 + (i+1 - pre[i])) \n\n            But wait, in the recurrence for state1 we had:\n\n              dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), \n                               min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) \n                             )\n\n            = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)   [if we let M1 = min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j }]\n\n            But note: the expression for state1: \n                min_{j} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } + (i+1 - pre[i]) \n            is exactly M1 + (i+1 - pre[i])\n\n            So:\n\n              dp[i][1] = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), M1 + (i+1 - pre[i]) ) \n                       = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)\n\n            However, note: we must consider that M1 might be positive? then min(0, M1)=0, so we get (i+1 - pre[i]). \n\n            But what if M1 is negative? then we get (i+1 - pre[i]) + M1, which is less than (i+1 - pre[i]). \n\n            But note: M1 is the minimum of (dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j) for j in [2, i] (even j). \n\n            Then after we compute dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], we update M0 and M1? \n\n            How? \n\n            We note that for a future state i' (which is odd and greater than i), we might use j = i+1? Actually, j must be even. The next even j after i (which is odd) is j = i+1? but i+1 is even. Then we would use the segment [j, i'] = [i+1, i'] and then we need the value for the segment ending at i (which is the state at i) to update M0 and M1.\n\n            Specifically, for j = i+1 (which is even) in the future, we will need:\n\n               For state0: we use dp[i][1] - pre[i]   (because j = i+1, then j-1 = i, and we use state1 at i? because the previous segment must be different: we are setting the next segment to 0, so the previous segment must be 1 -> so we use state1 at i)\n\n               For state1: we use dp[i][0] + pre[i] - (i+1)   [because j = i+1, then j-1 = i, and we use state0 at i? because the next segment is 1, so the previous segment must be 0. Then we use dp[i][0] and then the term is dp[i][0] + pre[i] - j? but j = i+1 -> so dp[i][0] + pre[i] - (i+1)]\n\n            Therefore, we update:\n\n               M0 = min(M0, dp[i][1] - pre[i])\n               M1 = min(M1, dp[i][0] + pre[i] - (i+1))\n\n            But note: we are iterating i (the odd indices). We start with i=1, then i=3, etc.\n\n            However, we must consider that j must be even and at least 2. For i=1: then we can update M0 and M1? because j=i+1=2 (which is even and >=2) will use the state at i=1.\n\n            So after we compute dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] for i=1, we update M0 and M1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precomputation: \n            pre[0] = 1 if s[0]=='1' else 0\n            for i from 1 to n-1: \n                pre[i] = pre[i-1] + (1 if s[i]=='1' else 0)\n\n          Initialize:\n            M0 = 10**18\n            M1 = 10**18\n            dp = a 2D array for states? but we only need the last state? we can do:\n\n          For i=1,3,...,n-1 (odd indices):\n\n            # j=0 is an option: then the segment is [0,i]\n            # For state0: cost0 = pre[i]   [if we set the entire segment to 0: then we change the ones to zeros -> cost = number of ones = pre[i]]\n            # For state1: cost1 = (i+1) - pre[i]   [if we set to 1: cost = number of zeros]\n\n            # Then for state0: \n            #   candidate0 = min( pre[i], M0 + pre[i] ) \n            #   but note: M0 might be large -> then we take pre[i]. But we can also write: candidate0 = pre[i] + min(0, M0)   [if M0 is negative, then we use M0+pre[i], else pre[i]]\n\n            # Similarly, state1: candidate1 = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)\n\n            dp0 = pre[i] + min(0, M0)   # but wait, if M0 is 10**18, then min(0, M0)=0 -> then dp0 = pre[i]\n            dp1 = (i+1 - pre[i]) + min(0, M1)\n\n            Then update M0 and M1 for future use (for j = i+1, which is even) as:\n\n               M0 = min(M0, dp1 - pre[i])\n               M1 = min(M1, dp0 + pre[i] - (i+1))\n\n          Then the answer for the entire string is min(dp0, dp1) for i = n-1? \n\n          But note: the entire string must be processed? and n is even, so the last index is n-1 (which is odd). So we use i = n-1.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating i from 1 to n-1? and we start at i=1? but what if n=2? then we do i=1.\n\n        But what if the string has length 0? we skip.\n\n        But note: the problem states n>=2.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if the string has length 0? no, n>=2.\n\n        But note: we defined pre[i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n        Example: n=2, s=\"00\"\n\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0.\n\n          i=1 (the last index, which is odd)\n\n          dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 0 + min(0, 10**18) = 0.\n          dp1 = (2 - pre[1]) + min(0, M1) = 2 + min(0, 10**18) = 2.\n\n          Then update:\n             M0 = min(10**18, dp1 - pre[1]) = min(10**18, 2-0)=2\n             M1 = min(10**18, dp0 + pre[1] - 2) = min(10**18, 0+0-2) = -2\n\n          Then the answer for this test case is min(0,2)=0.\n\n          But the minimal operations: we can leave the string as \"00\", then the natural segmentation is one segment of length 2 (even) -> operations=0. Correct.\n\n        Example: s=\"01\", n=2.\n\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=1.\n\n          i=1:\n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n            dp1 = (2-1) + min(0, M1) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n          Then update:\n            M0 = min(10**18, 1 - 1) = min(10**18,0)=0\n            M1 = min(10**18, 1 + 1 - 2) = min(10**18,0)=0\n\n          Then answer = min(1,1)=1.\n\n          How can we do it? \n            We can change the last character to '0': then we get \"00\", which is one segment -> cost=1.\n            Or change the first to '1': then we get \"11\", which is one segment -> cost=1.\n\n          But note: we can also form two segments? \n            If we do nothing: the natural segmentation is two segments: [0] and [1] -> both length 1 -> odd -> not allowed.\n            So we must change at least one character? \n\n          However, we can also change the entire string to \"00\" or \"11\", which is one segment of even length.\n\n          But note: we can also form two segments? but we require even length. We cannot have a segment of length 1. So we must merge? \n\n          Actually, we can change the first character to '0' and leave the second as '1'? then we have two segments: [0] and [1] -> both odd -> not allowed.\n\n          We must change at least one character to make the entire string same? then we have one segment? or we can change one character to make the two segments even? \n\n          How? \n            If we change the first character to '1', then we have \"11\"? no, we have \"11\" -> one segment? \n            Or if we change the second to '0', then \"00\" -> one segment.\n\n          Alternatively, we can change the first to '0' and the second to '0'? then one segment? that's two operations? but we found one operation.\n\n          So the minimal operations is 1.\n\n          Therefore, our answer 1 is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we form two segments? \n          We require each segment to be even. The only even length segments we can form are of length 2? but we have two characters. So we can form one segment of length 2? \n\n          Therefore, we must merge the two characters? so we must make them the same? and that requires at least one change? \n\n        So the algorithm for the example \"01\" gives 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the recurrence for state0: \n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n        This corresponds to: \n            j=0: we set the entire segment [0,1] to 0: cost = number of ones = 1 -> 1 operation.\n            j=2? not available.\n\n        Similarly, state1: \n            j=0: set to 1: cost = number of zeros = 1 -> 1 operation.\n\n        So we have two options, both cost 1.\n\n        Now, what about a longer example? s=\"0000\", n=4.\n\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0, pre[2]=0, pre[3]=0.\n\n          i=1: \n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 0 + 0 = 0.\n            dp1 = (2-0) + min(0, M1) = 2 + 0 = 2.\n            Then update:\n                M0 = min(10**18, 2-0) = 2\n                M1 = min(10**18, 0+0-2) = -2\n\n          i=3:\n            dp0 = pre[3] + min(0, M0) = 0 + min(0,2) = 0.\n            dp1 = (4-0) + min(0, M1) = 4 + min(0,-2) = 4-2 = 2.\n\n            Then update M0 and M1 for future? but we are at the last.\n\n          Answer = min(0,2)=0.\n\n          How? \n            We can leave the string as \"0000\", then one segment -> cost=0.\n\n          But what if we try to use two segments? \n            We can break at index1: then we have [0,1] and [2,3]. Both are \"00\" and \"00\", each cost 0? total cost 0? \n            But the natural segmentation for \"0000\" is one segment. \n\n          However, note: the problem says: \"divide into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" -> so we must use the natural segmentation? which is one segment. \n\n          But wait: the problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\" -> so the natural segmentation is one segment. \n\n          And we require that the segment has even length -> 4 is even -> so no change.\n\n          Therefore, 0 operations.\n\n        Now, what if s=\"0011\", n=4.\n\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0, pre[2]=1, pre[3]=2.\n\n          i=1: \n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0) = 0 -> state0: cost0=0 (if we set [0,1] to 0: cost=0)\n            dp1 = (2-0) + min(0, M1) = 2 -> state1: cost1=2 (if we set [0,1] to 1: cost=2)\n            Then update:\n                M0 = min(10**18, 2-0) = 2   [because we use state1 at i=1: dp1 - pre[1] = 2-0=2]\n                M1 = min(10**18, 0+0-2) = -2   [dp0 + pre[1] - 2 = 0+0-2 = -2]\n\n          i=3:\n            j=0: \n                state0: cost0 = pre[3] = 2\n                state1: cost1 = 4 - pre[3] = 2\n            j=2: \n                for state0: we use the recurrence: \n                    candidate0 = M0 + pre[3] = 2 + 2 = 4? \n                    but wait: we have: \n                         dp0 = min(2, M0+pre[3]) = min(2, 2+2)=min(2,4)=2.\n                for state1: \n                    candidate1 = M1 + (4 - pre[3]) = -2 + 2 = 0? \n                    then dp1 = min(2, 0) = 0? \n\n            Actually, from our formula:\n\n                dp0 = pre[3] + min(0, M0) = 2 + min(0,2)=2.\n                dp1 = (4-2) + min(0, M1) = 2 + min(0,-2)=2-2=0.\n\n            So dp1=0.\n\n            How? \n                We set the segment [2,3] to 1? and then the segment [0,1] we set to 0? \n                But note: the natural segmentation: \n                    [0,1] is set to 0 -> then we have a segment of two zeros -> then at index2 we have a 1? so we break? \n                Actually, we are allowed to change arbitrarily. We are forming the entire string arbitrarily. \n\n                We want the natural segmentation (minimal number of contiguous segments) to be: \n                    [0,1] as 0's and [2,3] as 1's. \n                How many operations? \n                    We change s[0] to 0? it is already 0 -> no change.\n                    s[1] to 0? already 0.\n                    s[2] to 1? already 1? \n                    s[3] to 1? already 1.\n                So 0 operations? \n\n                But wait, the string is \"0011\", which naturally segments into [00] and [11] -> two segments, each of length 2 -> even. \n\n                So 0 operations? \n\n            Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n            However, our dp1=0 is correct.\n\n            How did we get that? \n                For state1 at i=3: \n                    = (4-2) + min(0, M1) = 2 + min(0, -2) = 0.\n\n            Why? because M1 = -2, so min(0,-2) = -2, then 2-2=0.\n\n            How did M1 become -2? \n                From i=1: we computed M1 = min(10**18, dp0 + pre[1] - 2) = min(10**18, 0+0-2) = -2.\n\n            Then at i=3: we use j=2 (which is even) and then the recurrence for state1: \n                = (4-2) + min(0, M1) = 2 + (-2) = 0.\n\n            This corresponds to: \n                We break at j=2: the segment [2,3] is set to 1? and the previous segment [0,1] is set to 0? \n                The cost for the segment [2,3] = number of zeros in [2,3] = 0? \n                And the cost for the segment [0,1] = 0? \n                Then total cost = 0? \n\n            But note: the recurrence for state1 at i=3: \n                = min( (4-2), M1 + (4-2) ) \n                = min(2, -2+2) = min(2,0)=0.\n\n            This 0 comes from the term: \n                dp[j-1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) \n                = dp[1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) \n                = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n            How do we get the number of zeros in [2,3]? \n                The segment [2,3] is \"11\", so zeros=0.\n\n            And the segment [0,1] was set to 0: which cost 0 operations? \n\n            So total 0.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              # Precompute prefix sum of ones\n              pre = [0] * n\n              if n>0:\n                  pre[0] = 1 if s[0]=='1' else 0\n                  for i in range(1, n):\n                      pre[i] = pre[i-1] + (1 if s[i]=='1' else 0)\n\n              # If n==0, skip? but n>=2.\n\n              # We'll create dp0 and dp1 for the odd indices? but we only need the last state? and we traverse odd indices.\n\n              # Initialize M0 and M1 to a big number\n              M0 = 10**18\n              M1 = 10**18\n\n              # We'll iterate i from 1 to n-1, step 2? \n              # But note: we need to consider the entire string? the last index is n-1 (which is odd if n is even? because n even -> n-1 is odd)\n\n              # We'll create an array for dp? but we only need the previous state? actually, we need to store the state for every odd index? but we are iterating sequentially.\n\n              # We can do:\n\n              # For i in [1, 3, 5, ..., n-1]:\n              #   Let L = i+1   (the length of the prefix so far)\n              #   Then:\n              #       dp0 = pre[i] + min(0, M0)   # if we set the entire segment [0,i] to 0?

and we break the last segment at j? \n\n              #   We do:\n\n              #       dp0 = min( pre[i], M0 + pre[i] ) \n              #       But we can write: \n              #           candidate0 = pre[i]   # j=0\n              #           candidate0 = min(candidate0, M0 + pre[i])   # j>=2\n              #       Similarly, candidate1 = min( (i+1 - pre[i]), M1 + (i+1 - pre[i]) )\n\n              #   Then set:\n              #       dp0 = candidate0\n              #       dp1 = candidate1\n\n              #   Then update:\n              #       M0 = min(M0, dp1 - pre[i])\n              #       M1 = min(M1, dp0 + pre[i] - (i+1))\n\n              # But note: the recurrence we derived was:\n              #   dp0 = pre[i] + min(0, M0)   -> but this is equivalent to min( pre[i], M0+pre[i] ) only if M0 is negative?

we skip.\n\n        But note: the problem says n>=2.\n\n        Let's test with the example: s=\"01\", n=2.\n\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=1.\n\n          i=1:\n            min0 = min(0, M0) = min(0,10**18)=0 -> dp0 = 1+0=1.\n            min1 = min(0,10**18)=0 -> dp1 = (2-1)+0=1.\n            Then update:\n                M0 = min(10**18, 1-1)=min(10**18,0)=0.\n                M1 = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=min(10**18,0)=0.\n\n          Then answer = min(1,1)=1.\n\n        Example: s=\"00\", n=2.\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0.\n          i=1:\n            dp0 = 0+0=0.\n            dp1 = 2+0=2.\n            M0 = min(10**18, 2-0)=2.\n            M1 = min(10**18, 0+0-2)=min(10**18,-2)=-2.\n\n          Then answer = min(0,2)=0.\n\n        Example: s=\"11\", n=2.\n          pre[0]=1, pre[1]=2? \n          Actually, pre[0]=1, pre[1]=2? \n          But the string \"11\": \n            pre[0]=1, pre[1]=2? \n          Then:\n            dp0 = 2 + min(0,10**18)=2.\n            dp1 = (2-2)+min(0,10**18)=0.\n            Then update:\n                M0 = min(10**18, 0-2)=min(10**18,-2)=-2.\n                M1 = min(10**18, 2+2-2)=min(10**18,2)=2.\n\n          Answer = min(2,0)=0? \n          But we can leave the string as \"11\", which is one segment of length 2 -> 0 operations? \n          So 0 is correct.\n\n        Example: s=\"10\", n=2.\n          pre[0]=1, pre[1]=1.\n          dp0 = 1+0=1.\n          dp1 = (2-1)+0=1.\n          Then update:\n              M0 = min(10**18, 1-1)=0\n              M1 = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=0\n          Answer=1.\n\n        Example: s=\"0000\", n=4.\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=0, pre[2]=0, pre[3]=0.\n          i=1: \n              dp0 = 0+0=0.\n              dp1 = 2+0=2.\n              M0 = min(10**18, 2-0)=2\n              M1 = min(10**18, 0+0-2)=-2\n          i=3:\n              min0 = min(0,2)=0 -> dp0 = 0+0=0.\n              min1 = min(0,-2)=-2 -> dp1 = (4-0)-2 = 2.\n              Then update:\n                 M0 = min(2, 2-0)=min(2,2)=2   [but we don't use beyond i=3?]\n                 M1 = min(-2, 0+0-4)=min(-2,-4)=-4   [but we don't use beyond i=3?]\n          Answer = min(0,2)=0.\n\n        Example: s=\"0011\", n=4: we did above -> 0.\n\n        Example: s=\"0101\", n=4.\n          pre[0]=0, pre[1]=1, pre[2]=1, pre[3]=2.\n          i=1:\n            dp0 = pre[1] + min(0, M0)=1+0=1.\n            dp1 = (2-1)+0=1.\n            M0 = min(10**18, 1-1)=0\n            M1 = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=0\n          i=3:\n            dp0 = pre[3] + min(0, M0)=2+0=2.\n            dp1 = (4-2) + min(0, M1)=2+0=2.\n            Then update: \n                M0 = min(0, 2-2)=0\n                M1 = min(0, 2+2-4)=0\n          Answer = min(2,2)=2.\n\n          How can we do it? \n            We can change the string to \"0000\" -> cost=2? \n            Or \"1111\" -> cost=2? \n            Or \"0011\" -> cost=0? but wait: \n                The string \"0101\": \n                  natural segmentation: \n                    [0], [1], [0], [1] -> four segments, each length 1 -> not allowed.\n                We can merge? \n                We can change the second character to '0': then \"0001\" -> segments: [000] and [1] -> both odd -> not allowed.\n                We can change the second to '0' and the last to '0': then \"0000\" -> one segment -> cost=2.\n                Or change the first to '1', the third to '1': then \"1111\" -> cost=2.\n\n          But note: we can also form: \n                [0,1] as \"00\" (by changing the second to '0') -> cost=1, then [2,3] as \"11\" (by changing the last to '1') -> cost=1 -> total=2.\n\n          So 2 operations.\n\n          Therefore, the answer 2 is correct.\n\n        However, note: we did not consider the possibility of merging more than two segments? \n\n        But our recurrence considers breaking the string at an even index j? and then the segment [j, i] is set to one character arbitrarily. \n\n        In the example \"0101\", at i=3, we considered:\n          j=0: entire segment [0,3] set to 0: cost = number of ones = 2 -> 2 operations.\n          j=0: entire segment set to 1: cost = number of zeros = 2 -> 2 operations.\n          j=2: \n             for state0: we use the recurrence: \n                 = M0 + pre[3] = 0 + 2 = 2.\n             for state1: = M1 + (4-2)=0+2=2.\n\n          So we get 2.\n\n        But what if we break at j=0 and j=2? \n          We break at j=0: then the segment [0,1] is set to 0: cost = number of ones in [0,1]=1 -> then the segment [2,3] is set to 1: cost = number of zeros in [2,3]=1 -> total=2.\n\n          How is this captured? \n          In the recurrence for the segment [2,3] (which is the last segment) we use j=2? \n          Then the state for the segment [0,1] is stored in dp[1][0] (if we set it to 0) which we computed as 1? \n          Then the cost for the segment [2,3] set to 1: \n              = dp[1][0] + (number of zeros in [2,3]) \n              = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n          But wait, we also have the option for the segment [2,3] set to 1: \n              = min( (4-2) [which is 2], M1 + (4-2) ) \n          and M1 at the time of i=3 was 0? so we get 2.\n\n          How did we update M1? \n            After i=1: M1 = min(10**18, dp0 + pre[1] - 2) = min(10**18, 1+1-2)=0.\n\n          Then at i=3: \n            dp1 = (4-2) + min(0,0)=2.\n\n          So we did not capture the 1+1=2? \n\n          Actually, we did: because the recurrence for state1 at i=3: \n            = min( (4-2), M1 + (4-2) ) \n            = min(2, 0+2)=min(2,2)=2.\n\n          And the recurrence for state0 at i=3: \n            = min(2, 0+2)=2.\n\n          So we get 2.\n\n          But note: we did not break the problem into two segments? we are only storing the total cost for the entire prefix? \n\n          The recurrence for the segment [2,3] set to 1: \n            total cost = cost for [0,1] (which is 1) + cost for [2,3] (which is 1) = 2.\n\n          And we computed that as: \n            dp[3][1] = min( (4-2), M1 + (4-2) ) \n            but M1 = min_{j even, j in [2,3]} { dp[j-1][0] + pre[j-1] - j } \n            for j=2: \n                dp[1][0] + pre[1] - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0.\n            then M1=0, so dp[3][1] = min(2, 0+2)=2.\n\n          So it is captured.\n\n        Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000. We are iterating over the odd indices (which are n/2 per test case) and each step is O(1). So total O(n) per test case? but the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we are good.\n\n        Code for program2.py:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              # Precompute prefix sum for ones\n              pre = [0] * n\n              if n > 0:\n                  pre[0] = 1 if s[0]=='1' else 0\n                  for i in range(1, n):\n                      pre[i] = pre[i-1] + (1 if s[i]=='1' else 0)\n\n              # Initialize M0 and M1 to a big number (like 10**18)\n              M0 = 10**18\n              M1 = 10**18\n\n              # We'll iterate over odd indices: i = 1, 3, 5, ... up to n-1 (if n is even, then n-1 is odd)\n              # But note: we need to consider the entire string?

\n                j=0: entire segment [0,5] set to 0: cost=3 (ones) -> 3.\n                j=2: \n                    segment [2,5] set to 0: cost = number of ones in [2,5] = 2 (because s[2]='1', s[3]='1', s[5]='1')? \n                    but wait, we changed the segment [2,5] to 0? then we change the ones to zeros: cost=3? \n                    and then the previous segment [0,1] is set to 1? because we require the previous segment to be different?

but we are not changing the string for the segment [0,3]? we are only changing the segment [4,5]? \n                But note: we are allowed to change arbitrarily? and we are not constrained by the original string for the segment [0,3]? we already accounted for the cost for [0,3] as 0? \n\n            However, the original string for [4,5] is \"01\", so to set it to 0 we change the '1' to '0' -> cost=1.\n\n            Total cost=0+1=1.\n\n            But wait, we are not allowed to change the string arbitrarily in segments? we are changing the entire string arbitrarily? and then we form the natural segmentation? \n\n            The natural segmentation after changes: \n                [0,1]: we set to 0? but we didn't change it? it was \"00\" -> so we leave it as \"00\" -> segment1: \"00\"\n                [2,3]: we set to 1? but it was \"11\" -> leave as \"11\" -> segment2: \"11\"\n                [4,5]: we set to 0? we change the last character from '1' to '0', so we get \"00\" -> segment3: \"00\"\n\n            Then the natural segmentation is: \n                \"00\", \"11\", \"00\" -> three segments, each of length 2 -> even. \n\n            So it is valid, and cost=1.\n\n            But the expected answer is 2? \n\n            Why is the sample output 2? \n\n            The problem sample input: \n                5\n                2\n                00\n                2\n                11\n                4\n                0000\n                4\n                0011\n                6\n                001101   -> output 2\n\n            But we found a solution with 1.\n\n            What's going on?\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\"\n\n            In our solution, we have three segments: [0,1],[2,3],[4,5] -> 3 segments.\n\n            But the natural segmentation (minimal number of contiguous subsegments) for the string \"00001100\" (if we change the last two to \"00\")? \n                Actually, the string after changes is \"00\",\"11\",\"00\" -> but the entire string is \"001100\" -> \n                    The natural segmentation is: \n                        [0,1]: '00' -> segment1\n                        [2,3]: '11' -> segment2\n                        [4,5]: '00' -> segment3\n                    So three segments.\n\n            But is there a way to have fewer than three segments? \n                We could try to merge adjacent segments? \n                If we set [0,3] to '0'? then we have \"0000\" for [0,3] and then [4,5]='00'? \n                    But then the entire string is \"000000\", which would be one segment? \n                How many operations? \n                    We change [2,3] from \"11\" to \"00\": cost=2, and [4,5] from \"01\" to \"00\": cost=1? total=3? \n                Or if we set [0,3] to '0': then we change the two ones to zeros: cost=2, and [4,5] to '0': cost=1 -> total=3.\n\n                Or if we set [0,5] to '0': cost= number of ones in the entire string = 3.\n\n            But we found a solution with 1 operation that yields three segments, which is valid.\n\n            Why is the sample output 2? \n\n            I see: the problem says: \"the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" -> but we are not forced to use the minimal number of segments? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \n                \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\"\n\n            This means that after we change the string, we then divide it in the natural way: break at every change of bit. \n\n            And we require that in that natural segmentation, every segment has even length.\n\n            Our solution with one operation: \n                Original: \"001101\"\n                After change: \"001100\"  (change the last character to '0')\n                Natural segmentation: \n                    [0,1]: \"00\" -> length2\n                    [2,3]: \"11\" -> length2\n                    [4,5]: \"00\" -> length2\n                -> valid.\n\n            So why is the sample output 2? \n\n            The sample input and output in the problem statement for the fifth test case is 2.\n\n            But the sample input they provided for the fifth test case is \"001101\", and they say output 2.\n\n            There is a note: \n                \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following.

There are other ways to operate 3 times to make s good, such as \"1111110000\", \"1100001100\", \"1111001100\".\"\n\n            This note is for a string of length 10? \n\n            And the sample input has 5 test cases: \n                2,2,4,4,6\n\n            So the fifth test case is of length 6: \"001101\", and the expected answer is 2.\n\n            But we found 1.\n\n            I suspect the problem intended that the segmentation is fixed to the minimal number of segments? but the problem says \"minimum number of contiguous subsegments\", which is the natural segmentation.\n\n            Or is there a constraint that we cannot have more segments than the natural segmentation of the original string? \n\n            The problem says: \"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments\" -> this is after the changes. \n\n            And the minimal number of segments is achieved by the natural segmentation (breaking at every change).\n\n            Our solution has 3 segments, which is the minimal possible for the changed string? because the string has three segments: \"00\", \"11\", \"00\". \n\n            So it should be valid.\n\n            But the sample expected output is 2.\n\n            I see: the problem says: \"the minimum number of subsegments\" in the easy version? but the note says: \"the only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments\"\n\n            So the easy version does not care about the number of segments? only that the natural segmentation has even lengths.\n\n            Therefore, our solution of 1 operation is valid.\n\n            But the sample output is 2.\n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n            Let me check the sample input and output provided in the problem statement for the easy version:\n\n                Input:\n                    5\n                    2\n                    00\n                    2\n                    11\n                    4\n                    0000\n                    4\n                    0011\n                    6\n                    001101\n\n                Output:\n                    0\n                    0\n                    0\n                    0\n                    2\n\n            So they say 2 for the last one.\n\n            There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n            Rethink: \n\n            The problem says: \"Tokitsukaze has a binary string s of length n, consisting only of zeros and ones, n is even. Now Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.\"\n\n            This is the natural segmentation of the original string? or after changes? \n\n            The next sentence: \"After that, s is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.\"\n\n            Then: \"Tokitsukaze wants to make s good by changing the values"
