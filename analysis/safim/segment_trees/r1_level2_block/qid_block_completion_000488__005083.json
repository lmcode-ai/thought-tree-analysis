Then j+1 is the last index (n, which is beyond the original array). But we have appended n+1, so a[j] (which is the last element of the original array) is compared to n+1. Since a[j] <= n, then a[j] < n+1, so we would be in the `a[j] < a[j+1]` branch. So that's safe. Therefore, the missing line is:\n                d = a[j] But note: the code also has two other branches: elif u < a[j]: # if only can insert to increasing subsequence\n            u = a[j]\n        elif d > a[j]: # if only can insert to decreasing subsequence\n            d = a[j]\n        else:\n            break\n\nSo the entire logic is covered.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting the number of subarrays [l, r] such that the subarray is Decinc.\nThe provided code uses a function `check(i, u, d)` that starts at index `i` and tries to extend the subarray as far as possible (until index `j-1` such that the subarray [i, j-1] is Decinc, but [i, j] is not). The state is maintained by `u` (the last element of the increasing sequence) and `d` (the last element of the decreasing sequence). The array `a` is the permutation of size n, and we have appended `n+1` at the end.\n\nIn the while loop inside `check`, we are processing from index `j` (starting at `i`) and moving forward. The condition `if u < a[j] < d` means that the current element can be added to either the increasing or the decreasing sequence. Then we look at the next element to decide: if the next element is increasing relative to the current, we add the current to the increasing sequence (by updating `u = a[j]`). If the next element is decreasing, we should add the current to the decreasing sequence (by updating `d = a[j]`). However, note that the sample condition in the code only checks `a[j] < a[j+1]` for the increasing case and `a[j] > a[j+1]` for the decreasing. But what if we are at the last element? The array `a` has an extra element `n+1` at the end, so we can safely check `a[j+1]`.\n\nBut note: when we are at the last element (j = n-1), then a[j+1] is n+1. So we have to consider that.\n\nThe TODO in the code is in the branch:\n        elif u < a[j] < d: # if can insert to both\n            if a[j] < a[j+1]:\n                u = max(u, a[j])\n            elif a[j] > a[j+1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should then update `d` to `a[j]` because we are adding to the decreasing sequence? But note: the condition says that if the current element is greater than the next, then we add the current to the decreasing sequence. However, note that the increasing sequence is built by taking non-removed elements in order, and the decreasing sequence is the removed one. But the state `u` and `d` are the last elements of the increasing and decreasing sequences respectively.\n\nSo in the branch where we can add to either, and we see that the next element is smaller than the current, we decide to add the current to the decreasing sequence (so that the increasing sequence remains as is, and the decreasing sequence now ends with `a[j]`). Therefore, we set `d = a[j]`.\n\nBut note: the condition `a[j] > a[j+1]` might not be the only possibility? What if the next element is equal? But the permutation has distinct numbers, so we don't have to worry about equality.\n\nHowever, what if the next element is greater than the current? Then we would have added the current to the increasing sequence. But what if the next element is less than the current? Then we add the current to the decreasing sequence.\n\nBut what if the next element is not the one that breaks the possibility? Actually, we are making a greedy decision: we are looking at the next element to decide which sequence to assign the current element to. This is because we want to extend the subarray as far as possible.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO block should be:\n                d = a[j]\n\nBut wait, what if the next element is not decreasing? Actually, the condition is `elif a[j] > a[j+1]`? But note that the condition above is `if a[j] < a[j+1]` and then `elif a[j] > a[j+1]`. What if neither? Then we break? Actually, we don't have an `else` in that inner if. But note the structure:\n\n        if u < a[j] < d: # if can insert to both\n            if a[j] < a[j+1]:\n                u = max(u, a[j])\n            elif a[j] > a[j+1]:\n                d = a[j]   # This is the TODO\n            else:\n                # This else is not needed because distinct, but for safety we break?\n                break   # Actually, distinct so no else? But we have an else below that breaks?\n        ... \n\nBut note: after the if-elif, we don't have an else. However, the condition `u < a[j] < d` is true, and then we check the next element. Since the array is distinct, either `a[j] < a[j+1]` or `a[j] > a[j+1]`. So we don't need an else.\n\nBut what if we are at the last element? Then j+1 is the last index (n, which is beyond the original array). But we have appended n+1, so a[j] (which is the last element of the original array) is compared to n+1. Since a[j] <= n, then a[j] < n+1, so we would be in the `a[j] < a[j+1]` branch. So that's safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n                d = a[j]\n\nBut note: the code also has two other branches: \n        elif u < a[j]: # if only can insert to increasing subsequence\n            u = a[j]\n        elif d > a[j]: # if only can insert to decreasing subsequence\n            d = a[j]\n        else:\n            break\n\nSo the entire logic is covered.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is the line: `d = a[j]`\n\nBut note: the code block for the TODO is only one line? The code above has a comment and then the TODO. We are to output only the missing code. So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"d = a[j]\"\n\nHowever, note that the code is indented. We must output the exact code that would replace the TODO. Since the TODO is in the block:\n\n            elif a[j] > a[j+1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO comment with `d = a[j]` and the same indentation.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are to compute the number of trees (with the given attachment rule) for which the i-th vertex is the centroid, modulo 998244353.\n\nThe provided code sets up factorials and inverse factorials, and then computes an array `out` for indices from 0 to (n+1)//2 - 1.\n\nThe code then does:\n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n    base = fact[n - 1]\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nThen it does:\n\nrem = 0   \nfor i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n    oldrem = rem\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n    out[i] -= oldrem\n    rem %= MOD\n    out[i] %= MOD\n\nBut note: the array `out` is of length n, but we only set the first (n+1)//2 elements. The rest are zero. Then we traverse from the last index backwards.\n\nHowever, we are missing the function `inv(x)` for modular inverse.\n\nWe need to compute the modular inverse modulo MOD. We can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo we can write:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: the function `invs(x)` is defined as `modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])`. That is the same as 1/x mod MOD? Actually, fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = (fact[x-1] / fact[x]) mod MOD = 1/x mod MOD. So `invs(x)` returns the modular inverse of x.\n\nBut the function `inv(x)` is for a general x. So we can implement it with pow.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code for `inv(x)` is:\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nBut note: what if x is 0? The problem states that n>=3 and we are computing factorials for indices up to MAX-1 (which is 10**6). So we won't get x=0 in the factorial? But in the function `inv(x)`, we are called with `fact[MAX-1]` which is non-zero. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py also has a function `comb` and `invcomb` and `invs`. The function `invcomb` is defined as `modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))` which is the same as fact[y] * fact[x-y] / fact[x] mod MOD, which is the inverse of the binomial coefficient? Actually, no: the binomial coefficient is fact[x]/(fact[y]*fact[x-y]). So `invcomb(x,y)` returns the inverse of the binomial coefficient? Actually, it returns:\n    invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] mod MOD\nwhich is the same as (fact[y] * fact[x-y]) / fact[x] mod MOD, which is the inverse of the binomial coefficient.\n\nBut the main logic for the problem is non-trivial. However, we are only required to complete the two missing parts.\n\nSo the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"d = a[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py has a TODO block that is only one line. We output exactly that line.\n\nHowever, in program1.py, the code after the TODO is:\n\n        elif u < a[j]: # if only can insert to increasing subsequence\n            u = a[j]\n        elif d > a[j]: # if only can insert to decreasing subsequence\n            d = a[j]\n        else:\n            break\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with one line. So the entire missing code for program1.py is the string \"d = a[j]\".\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code for the function `inv` is the body: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nBut note: the function `inv` in program2.py is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the return statement. So the missing code is the line \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\".\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the problem says \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\". And for program1.py, we are only replacing the one line. For program2.py, we are replacing the body of the function.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are outputting the exact string that would replace the TODO in each program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"d = a[j]\", \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the code after the TODO is an empty block? Actually, the TODO is a comment and then there is nothing. We must have at least one statement. So we are replacing the comment with the statement.\n\nBut note: the code as written for program1.py has:\n\n            elif a[j] > a[j+1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis leaves the block empty. We must put the statement `d = a[j]` at the same indentation level.\n\nSo the string \"d = a[j]\" is exactly what we need.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the function body is replaced by the return statement.\n\nHowever, note that the function `inv` in program2.py is defined with a docstring? No, it's just a comment. So we replace the entire body (the comment) with the return statement.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the JSON as specified.\n\nLet me write the JSON string:\n\n{\"program1\": \"d = a[j]\", \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nBut note: the problem says the output format is a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", and the values are the missing code for each program.\n\nWe must be cautious about the quotes: the problem uses double quotes in the example.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"d = a[j]\", \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"}\n\nBut wait: in program2.py, the function `inv` might be called with x=0? Actually, the factorials are built for indices from 0 to MAX-1. The factorial of 0 is 1, and we are computing the inverse of factorials. But note: the function `inv` is called with `fact[MAX-1]` which is non-zero. Also, in the computation of the binomial coefficients, we are using indices that are non-negative and within the bounds. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, the problem states that n is at least 3 and less than 200000, and we set MAX=10**6, so we are safe.\n\nThus, the answer is as above."
