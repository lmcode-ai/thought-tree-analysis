Then the product is 26. Similarly, if we have a mix, the product is at most (51)*(34)*(26) which is about 51*34=1734, 1734*26=45084. So 45084 iterations is acceptable.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code is almost complete, but there is a TODO in the line:\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe note that the line above is inside a triple nested loop. The variable `ans` is being accumulated. We must take modulo at each step to prevent overflow and to keep the number within the modulus.\n\nSo we should replace the TODO with:\n    ans %= MOD\n\nBut note: the current code does:\n    ans += P(...) * C(...) % MOD * ... % MOD\n\nHowever, the multiplication and modulo operations are done on the term, but then we add to `ans` without taking modulo. Since `ans` can become very large, we must take modulo at each addition.\n\nSo the corrected code for that part is to replace the TODO with:\n    ans %= MOD\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n    ans += ... % MOD\n\nBut the modulus is applied only to the term, not to the entire accumulation. However, the term is taken modulo MOD, but then we add to `ans` which might be huge. Therefore, we should do:\n    ans = (ans + ...) % MOD\n\nBut the current code does:\n    ans += ... (with the term modded by the multiplications)\n\nBut the problem is that the addition might make `ans` exceed MOD. So we can do:\n\n    ans = (ans + ...) % MOD\n\nBut the code structure is:\n\n    ans += P(n, n - two - 2*three - 3*four) * C(cnt[2], two) % MOD \\\n                * C(cnt[3], three) % MOD \\\n                * C(cnt[4], four) % MOD\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n    term = (P(...) * C(...) % MOD) * C(...) % MOD * C(...) % MOD\n    ans += term\n\nSo we are adding a term that is modded (so term is in [0, MOD-1]) to `ans`. Then we check if `ans >= MOD` and then subtract? But that is inefficient. Instead, we can do:\n\n    ans = (ans + term) % MOD\n\nBut note: the problem says to output the missing code only. The missing part is the body of the if-statement.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    ans %= MOD\n\nafter the addition? But that would be outside the if? The if condition is only when `ans>=MOD`? That is not the standard way. We should do modulo at every addition.\n\nBut the code has an if-statement that checks `if ans >= MOD:`. We can change that to:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut note: the modulus is 998244353, and we are doing multiple additions. We can also do:\n\n    ans = (ans + term) % MOD\n\nBut the current code does not have that. It has an if-statement. We can do:\n\n    ans += term\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut note: term might be large? Actually, term is modded by MOD, so term < MOD. Then ans might be in [MOD, 2*MOD-2]. So we can subtract MOD once.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    ans -= MOD\n\nBut wait, we have:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut that would subtract MOD only once. However, if ans becomes 2*MOD, then we need to subtract twice? But note that term is less than MOD, so after adding, ans is at most (previous ans) + (MOD-1). And we are doing modulo after every addition? Actually, the code does not do modulo for the entire accumulation. We are only doing modulo for the term. So we must reduce `ans` modulo MOD.\n\nBut the problem is that the modulus operation is expensive? But n is at most 100, and the loops are over at most 100 for two, three, four? Actually, the counts are at most 100, but the loops are:\n\n    for two in range(cnt[2] + 1):\n        for three in range(cnt[3] + 1):\n            for four in range(cnt[4] + 1):\n\nThe total iterations are (cnt[2]+1) * (cnt[3]+1) * (cnt[4]+1). Since cnt[2], cnt[3], cnt[4] are at most 100, but note that the sum of the sizes of the groups is at most n (which is 100). So the counts are not independent? Actually, the groups are disjoint. The total number of points is n, and we have groups of size 1, 2, 3, 4. The counts for size 2,3,4 are stored in cnt[2], cnt[3], cnt[4] and the rest are size 1 (cnt[1]). The total groups: cnt[1] + cnt[2] + cnt[3] + cnt[4] = total groups. The total points: 1*cnt[1] + 2*cnt[2] + 3*cnt[3] + 4*cnt[4] = n.\n\nSo the maximum for cnt[2] is 50 (if all groups are size 2, then 50 groups) but then the loops would be 51 * (cnt[3]+1) * (cnt[4]+1). Since cnt[3] and cnt[4] are 0, then 51 iterations. Similarly, worst-case when n=100, the worst-case for the product is when we have as many groups as possible? Actually, the groups are at most 100 (if all size 1). But the counts for 2,3,4 are small. The worst-case for the product is when we have as many groups of size 2,3,4 as possible? Actually, the product is (cnt[2]+1)*(cnt[3]+1)*(cnt[4]+1). The maximum value of this product is when we have as many groups as possible? Actually, we have constraints: 2*cnt[2] + 3*cnt[3] + 4*cnt[4] <= 100. The maximum product? It's not too big. For example, if we have 25 groups of size 4, then cnt[4]=25, then the loop for four is 26. Then the product is 26. Similarly, if we have a mix, the product is at most (51)*(34)*(26) which is about 51*34=1734, 1734*26=45084. So 45084 iterations is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n    ans = (ans + term) % MOD\n\nBut the code currently does:\n\n    ans += ... (with term modded)\n\nand then an if-statement for when ans>=MOD.\n\nWe can change the if-statement to:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut note: the term is modded, so term < MOD. Then after adding, if ans was in [0, MOD-1], then after adding term (which is in [0, MOD-1]), ans is in [0, 2*MOD-2]. So we can do:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut that only subtracts once. That is sufficient because 2*MOD-2 - MOD = MOD-2, which is in [0, MOD-1]. So we can do:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        ans -= MOD\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    ans %= MOD\n\nBut modulo operation might be slower? But the problem does not specify performance, and n is small.\n\nHowever, the current code has:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must fill the TODO. So we can write:\n\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut note: we must do this every time ans>=MOD. And we are adding a term that is less than MOD, so we only need to subtract MOD once.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        ans -= MOD\n\nBut wait, what if ans becomes 2*MOD? Then we subtract once and get MOD, which is not in [0, MOD-1]. But note: the maximum value of ans after adding a term (which is less than MOD) is at most MOD-1 + MOD-1 = 2*MOD-2. So we only need to subtract once.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    ans %= MOD\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the if-statement.\n\nSo we write:\n\n        ans %= MOD\n\nBut that is one line. However, the original code has:\n\n    if ans >= MOD:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can write:\n\n        ans %= MOD\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py, the missing code is the body of that if-statement.\n\nBut observe: the code after the if-statement has a comment:\n\n    # print(f'add ... {ans}')\n\nSo we must not break that.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        ans = ans % MOD\n\nBut the common way is:\n\n        ans %= MOD\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        ans %= MOD\n\nBut wait, the original code does:\n\n    ans += ... % MOD\n\nand then the if. We can also change the entire accumulation to:\n\n    ans = (ans + ...) % MOD\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code, and the missing code is only the body of the if-statement.\n\nTherefore, we choose:\n\n        ans %= MOD\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We output only the missing code for program1.py as a string.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe code has a TODO:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to define the function `modmul`. The name suggests modular multiplication. The function is used in several places: in the factorial computation, in the combinations, etc.\n\nThe function is called with two or three arguments? The definition has `c=0`. So sometimes it is called with two arguments, sometimes with three.\n\nLooking at the usage:\n\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n    invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1])\n\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\n    return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x-y]))\n\n    return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n    out[i] -= oldrem\n\nWe see that sometimes it is called with two arguments, sometimes with three? Actually, in the code we see:\n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\nBut the function `invs(i)` returns a number, so that call is with two arguments.\n\nBut the function definition has `c=0`. So we can assume that when called with two arguments, c is 0.\n\nWhat does `modmul` do? It should compute (x * y + c) % MOD? But the name is `modmul` (modular multiplication). However, the third argument `c` is for an additive constant? Then it would be (x*y + c) mod MOD.\n\nBut in the code, we see:\n\n    base = fact[n-1]\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i))\n\nThis is two arguments. And then:\n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\nSo that is base * frac mod MOD.\n\nAlso, in the factorial:\n\n    fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\nThat is (i * fact[i-1]) % MOD.\n\nBut note: the function `modmul` is also used in:\n\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\nThis is fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD) % MOD.\n\nSo the function `modmul` should compute (x * y + c) % MOD? But the default for c is 0. So without c, it is (x*y) % MOD.\n\nBut the function is defined with three parameters? Actually, the third parameter is `c=0`. So we can do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the modulus is MOD (global variable).\n\nSo we can write:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut we must be cautious: the numbers can be large? The modulus is 998244353, and x, y, c can be up to 10^18? Actually, the numbers in the combinations and factorials are modulo MOD, so they are in [0, MOD-1]. But when we multiply two numbers in [0, MOD-1], the product can be up to (MOD-1)^2 which is about 10^12, which is acceptable in Python. However, the problem states n<200000, and we are doing factorials up to 10^6? Actually, MAX=10**6, so factorials up to 10^6. The numbers in the factorials are modulo MOD, so they are less than MOD (about 1e9). Then the product of two such numbers is less than 1e18, which is acceptable in Python because Python integers are arbitrary precision, but modulo operation with 1e9 modulus is safe.\n\nSo the function can be:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is called with two arguments: then c=0. With three arguments: then c is provided.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut the function is named `modmul` and we are doing multiplication and then adding c? That might be confusing. But the code uses it in the way that when c is provided, it is an additive term.\n\nAlternatively, the function might be intended to be:\n\n    return (x * y) % MOD + c   # and then modulo again? \n\nBut that would be wrong because then we are not taking modulo of the entire expression.\n\nWe must do:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nSo that is the correct way.\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nBut note: the function is defined as:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n\nSo we write the body as:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nNow, we must output in the specified JSON format.\n\nThe output should be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        ans %= MOD\",\n    \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the original code.\n\nIn program1.py, the missing code is at an indentation level of 8 (inside the if and inside the loops). But the code we are replacing is:\n\n            if ans >= MOD:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with:\n\n                ans %= MOD\n\nSo the string for program1.py is \"        ans %= MOD\" (with 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the code has 4-space indents. The if is inside three loops, each loop is one indent. The if is at the same level as the comment and the print. The current code has:\n\n    for two in range(cnt[2] + 1):\n        for three in range(cnt[3] + 1):\n            for four in range(cnt[4] + 1):\n                ans += ... (long expression)\n                if ans >= MOD:\n                    # TODO\n\nSo the if is indented by 12 spaces (three levels of 4 each). Then the body of the if should be indented by 16 spaces. But the code we are writing is:\n\n                    ans %= MOD\n\nSo the string should be \"                    ans %= MOD\" (16 spaces). However, the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact number of spaces? But the problem says \"the missing lines or blocks\". We must output the code that goes exactly in the place of the TODO.\n\nBut note: the TODO is at the same indentation level as the body of the if. So we must output the same indentation level.\n\nIn the original program1.py, the if-statement is at an indentation level of 12 (if we assume 4 per indent). Then the body of the if must be 16. But the code we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire line with:\n\n                ans %= MOD\n\nSo the string is \"                ans %= MOD\" (with 16 spaces? Actually, the line above is indented by 12 for the for-loops, then the if is 12+4=16? Actually, the for-loops are:\n\n    for two ...:\n        for three ...:\n            for four ...:\n                ...   # this is 12 spaces (if 4 per indent) for the first non-empty line in the loop\n\nBut the code we are replacing is:\n\n                if ans >= MOD:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the if is at the same level as the expression above (the ans += ...). So the if is at 12 spaces? Then the body of the if is 16. The TODO line is at 16. We are replacing that line with:\n\n                    ans %= MOD\n\nBut that would be 16 spaces? Actually, the original code uses 4-space indentation. The structure:\n\nfor two ...:   # 0\n    for three ...:   # 4\n        for four ...:   # 8\n            ans += ...   # 12\n            if ...:   # 12\n                ...   # 16\n\nSo the body of the if is at 16. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                ans %= MOD\n\nBut wait, the line we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nwhich is at 16. We replace it with:\n\n                ans %= MOD\n\nBut that is the same indentation? Actually, the TODO line is at 16, and we are replacing it with a line at 16. So the string is \"                ans %= MOD\" (with 16 spaces? Actually, 16 characters? No, 16 spaces? But the original code uses 4 spaces per indent, so the if body is 4 more than the if, which is 12+4=16. But the line we are replacing is already at 16. So we write:\n\n\"                ans %= MOD\"\n\nBut that is 16 spaces? Actually, the line we are replacing has 16 spaces? We can count: the for-loops are at 0, then 4, then 8, then 12 for the inner block. The if is at 12, and the body of the if is at 16. So the line we are replacing is at 16. We output the same 16 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we must output the code that fits.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without the leading spaces? But the code must be inserted at that position. So we must output the same indentation.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe are to output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\nIn the original program1.py, the line we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire line with:\n\n                ans %= MOD\n\nSo the string is exactly: \"                ans %= MOD\" (with 16 spaces? Actually, the original line has 16 spaces? Let me count: the for-loops are three, so the inner block is indented by 3*4=12. Then the if is at 12, and the body of the if is 12+4=16. So 16 spaces. But the line we are replacing is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThat line has 16 spaces? Actually, the code we are given in the problem for program1.py is:\n\n                ans += P(n, n - two - 2*three - 3*four) * C(cnt[2], two) % MOD \\\n                * C(cnt[3], three) % MOD \\\n                * C(cnt[4], four) % MOD\n            if ans >= MOD:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            # print(f'add ... {ans}')\n\nThe line with the TODO is at the same indentation as the continuation lines? The continuation lines are at 16? Actually, the first line of the ans+= is at 12, and the next lines are at 16 (because of the backslash). Then the if is at 12, and the TODO is at 16.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\"                ans %= MOD\"\n\nBut that is 16 spaces? Actually, we can write 16 spaces, but we can also note that the original code uses 4 spaces per indent. So we can write:\n\n    \"program1\": \"                ans %= MOD\",\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is the body of the function modmul. The function is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with:\n\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nThe function body should be indented by 4 (or 8? The problem code uses 4 spaces). The function definition is at 0, then the body is 4. The TODO is at 4. We replace it with:\n\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nSo the string is \"        return (x * y + c) % MOD\" (with 8 spaces? Actually, 4 for the function body and then 4 for the return? But the function body is one level: 4 spaces. So the return should be at 4. But the TODO is at 4. So we write:\n\n    \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\nBut note: the original code for program2.py uses 4 spaces per indent. The function definition is:\n\n    def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO line is indented by 4. We replace it with:\n\n        return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nSo the string is \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning? Actually, 4 spaces for the function body, and then the return is at the same level as the TODO. So 4 spaces.\n\nBut the string \"    \" is 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the output JSON is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"                ans %= MOD\",\n    \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2.py function body must be exactly that.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the expression (x * y + c) % MOD might be computed as (x*y) which might be huge? But in Python, integers are big, so it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    return (x * y % MOD + c) % MOD\n\nBut that would be more efficient? But the problem does not require efficiency. And the numbers are not astronomically huge? The modulus is 998244353, and x, y, c are integers. The product x*y might be up to (10^9)^2 = 10^18, which is acceptable in Python. Then adding c (which is also mod MOD) and then mod again is safe.\n\nSo we stick to:\n\n    return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\nNow, write the JSON.\n\nNote: the JSON requires double quotes. We must escape the quotes? Actually, we are writing a string that will be parsed as JSON. But the content of the strings for the code may contain backslashes? In program2, we have a return statement with a plus and a modulo. No backslashes.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                ans %= MOD\", \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"}\n\nBut the program1 string has 16 spaces? We can count: 16 spaces. Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem uses spaces.\n\nWe output the exact string.\n\nBut note: the program1.py code after the TODO has a comment:\n\n            # print(f'add ... {ans}')\n\nWe are not changing that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                ans %= MOD\", \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"}"
