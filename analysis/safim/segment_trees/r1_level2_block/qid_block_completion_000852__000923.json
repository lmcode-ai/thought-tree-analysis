This matches. However, note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5. So splitting and checking each segment is efficient.

What if the segment is \"RB\"? -> valid. But what if the segment is \"R\", and then there is another segment \"B\" (separated by white)? Example: \"R W B\" -> but the string is \"RWB\" -> then split by 'W' gives ['R','B'] -> then we check the first segment: \"R\" -> invalid -> we break and output \"NO\". This is correct. But note: what if the string is \"RW\"? Then split by 'W' -> ['R', ''] -> the first segment is \"R\" -> invalid. And \"WR\": same -> segment is \"R\" -> invalid. And \"W\": -> segments are ['',''] -> skip -> valid. And \"\": -> skip. But note: the problem says n>=1.",

The grid has n rows and m columns.\n The stones ('*') fall down until they meet the floor (the bottom row), an obstacle ('o'), or another stone that is already immovable.\n We are given multiple test cases.\n\n The current code structure:\n   for i in range(int(input())):\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        s = [list(input()) for j in range(n)]\n        for _ in range(n):   # we do n passes to ensure that stones fall as far as they can (since in one pass a stone might only fall one step)\n            for a in reversed(range(n-1)):   # we go from the second last row up to the top (row index 0)\n                for b in range(m):\n                    if s[a][b] == '*':\n                        if s[a+1][b] == 'o' or s[a+1][b] == '*':\n                            # then we cannot move this stone at (a,b) because the cell below is blocked\n                            continue\n                        else:\n                            # We need to move the stone down and clear the current cell.\n\n However, note: if we move the stone down, we must set the current cell to '.' and the next cell to '*'. But caution: if we do that, then in the same pass, the stone that has just fallen might be able to fall further? But note the outer loop runs n times (which is enough because the grid has n rows, so a stone can fall at most n-1 steps). However, we are processing from top to bottom? Actually, we are processing from the bottom row upwards? But note: we are iterating a in reversed(range(n-1)) meaning from n-2 down to 0. This is from the bottom upwards? Actually, reversed(range(n-1)) gives [n-2, n-3, ..., 0]. So we are processing from the row just above the bottom upwards to the top.\n\n But the falling stone might be above another stone that is also falling? However, we are doing multiple passes (n times) so it should be okay.\n\n However, we can optimize: we can let the stone fall as far as possible in one go? But the problem says to simulate until they are immovable. The current approach of multiple passes (n times) is acceptable because n<=50.\n\n So in the else block, we can do:\n   s[a][b] = '.'   # we remove the stone from the current cell\n   s[a+1][b] = '*'   # and place it in the cell below\n\n But note: what if the cell below is currently empty? Then we do that. However, what if in the same pass, we have two stones above each other? For example, if we have two stones one above the other, and we move the top one down, then the one that was originally at a might now be at a+1, and then when we process the row a (which is now empty) we skip, but the stone that was at a+1 (now at a+1) might have been moved from a to a+1, and then we process the row a-1? But note: we are processing from the bottom upwards. So if we have two stones at row a and a+1 (with a+1 being the one we just moved to), then when we get to row a-1, we might see the stone at row a (which is now empty) and then the stone at row a+1 is already there? Actually, we are processing row a (which is now empty) and then row a-1: the stone at row a-1 would then check the row below (a) and see it's empty and then move to row a, and then in the same pass, the stone that was at row a (now moved to row a+1) is not processed again because we are going row by row and we have passed row a? \n\n However, note: we are iterating from the bottom upwards. The row a we are processing is above row a+1. We are processing row a and then we move the stone from a to a+1. Then we move to row a-1. The stone that we moved to a+1 is now in row a+1, which is below row a. We don't process row a+1 in the inner loop (because a is from n-2 down to 0). So the stone that we just moved to a+1 will be processed in the same pass? No, because the inner loop for a is fixed for each row. We are currently at row a. We move the stone from a to a+1. Then we move to the next row (a-1). The stone at a+1 is now in a row that we have already processed? Actually, we are going from high row index (n-2) down to 0. So row a+1 is below row a, and we have already processed row a+1? Because we started at n-2 (which is the highest row index we process) and then go down to 0. So if a = n-2, then we process row n-2, and then row n-3, etc. The row n-1 (the last row) is not processed because we only go from 0 to n-2. \n\n Therefore, if we move a stone from row n-2 to row n-1, then we don't process row n-1 in the same pass. So that stone at n-1 will be processed in the next outer iteration? But note: we are doing n passes. So in the next pass, we will process row n-2 again and then row n-3, etc. And the stone at n-1 will not be moved because we don't process row n-1 (since we only go up to n-2). \n\n However, what if we have a stone at row n-3? Then in the same pass, after moving the stone at n-2 to n-1, we then process row n-3. The stone at n-3: the cell below (n-2) is now empty (because we moved the stone that was at n-2 to n-1). So we can move the stone at n-3 to n-2. Then in the next pass, we can move the stone at n-2 to n-1? \n\n So the current approach of moving one step at a time and doing n passes (which is the maximum number of steps a stone can fall) is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n   s[a][b] = '.'\n   s[a+1][b] = '*'\n\n But note: we must be cautious because if we do this, then the same stone might be moved multiple times in one pass? Actually, no: because we are processing each row from bottom to top. When we move a stone down, we set the current cell to '.' and the next to '*', and then we move to the row above. The stone that we just moved to the next row (a+1) will not be processed again in the same pass because we are going upwards. So it's safe.\n\n However, what if two stones in the same column? For example, if we have two stones in the same column at rows a and a+1? Then when we process row a (the top one), we see a stone and check the cell below: it's a stone? Then we skip. Then we process row a+1? But note: we are processing from the bottom upwards. We process row a+1 first? Actually, we are going from n-2 down to 0. So if a+1 is less than n-1, then we process row a+1 (if a+1 is in the range [0, n-2]) and then row a (which is a+1-1). So if we have two stones at row a and a+1 (with a+1 being the lower one and a being the one above), then we first process row a+1: we see a stone and check row a+2 (if exists). If row a+2 is empty, we move the stone at a+1 to a+2. Then we process row a: we see a stone and check row a+1: which is now empty (because we moved the stone from a+1 to a+2) so we move the stone at a to a+1. Then in the next pass, the stone at a+1 can move to a+2? But note: the stone at a+2 is already there? Then we have two stones at a+2? That would be incorrect.\n\n Actually, we are moving stones one step at a time. In one pass, we move each stone that can move one step. Then in the next pass, we move again. So the two stones would eventually fall to the bottom.\n\n But the above scenario: \n   Initially: \n        row a: '*' \n        row a+1: '*' \n        row a+2: '.' \n   In the first pass (for the row a+1): \n        we see a stone at a+1, and the cell below (a+2) is empty -> we move the stone at a+1 to a+2. Now:\n            row a: '*' \n            row a+1: '.' \n            row a+2: '*' \n        Then we process row a: \n            we see a stone at a, and the cell below (a+1) is now empty -> we move the stone at a to a+1. Now:\n            row a: '.' \n            row a+1: '*' \n            row a+2: '*' \n   Then in the next pass (outer loop iteration), we process again:\n        row a+1: we see a stone at a+1, and the cell below (a+2) is a stone -> so we don't move.\n        row a: we see nothing.\n\n   So we end up with the two stones at a+1 and a+2. But they should both be at the bottom? \n\n   However, note: the bottom is row a+2? and we have two stones: one at a+1 and one at a+2. That is not the bottom? The bottom is the last row (which is a+2? if a+2 is the last row). Then the stone at a+1 is above the stone at a+2? and the stone at a+1 cannot fall because the cell below is a stone? So that is correct.\n\n   But what if there are three rows? Then the bottom row is row n-1 (indexing from 0 to n-1). So if a+2 is the last row, then the stone at a+1 is at the second last and the stone at a+2 is at the last. Then the stone at a+1 is above the last row and the cell below is the last row which has a stone? so it stops. That is correct.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"until they meet the floor (the bottom row), an obstacle, or other stone which is already immovable\". The stone at a+2 is at the bottom row? then it is immovable. So the stone at a+1 is above an immovable stone? so it stops. Correct.\n\n   But what if the bottom row is not a+2? What if we have more rows? Then in the next pass, the stone at a+1 would be moved to a+2? and then the stone at a+2 (which was moved from a+1) would then be moved to a+3? and then the stone that was originally at a (now at a+1) would be moved to a+2? and then to a+3? \n\n   Actually, we are doing n passes (which is the total number of rows). So the stone at the top can fall at most n-1 steps. Therefore, n passes are enough.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n            for a in reversed(range(n-1)):\n                for b in range(m):\n                    if s[a][b]=='*':\n                        if s[a+1][b]=='o' or s[a+1][b]=='*':\n                            continue\n                        else:\n                            s[a][b] = '.'\n                            s[a+1][b] = '*'\n\n But note: we must be cautious that we are modifying the grid as we traverse. However, we are processing each cell independently. When we move a stone from (a,b) to (a+1,b), we set (a,b) to '.' and (a+1,b) to '*'. Then when we later process (a+1,b) in the same pass? We are processing row a+1? But note: we are iterating a from n-2 down to 0. So we process row a+1 (if a+1 is in the range [0, n-2]) in an earlier iteration? Actually, we are going from high index to low index. So we process row a+1 (which is a row with a higher index) before row a (a lower index). Therefore, when we process row a, we have already processed row a+1. So if we move a stone from row a to row a+1, then we are setting a cell in row a+1 to '*' that we have already processed. That is acceptable because we don't need to process row a+1 again in the same pass? We are done with row a+1. \n\n   However, what if we have two stones in the same column in consecutive rows? For example, at row a and row a+1. We process row a+1 first: we see a stone at a+1 and then we check row a+2. If row a+2 is empty, we move the stone at a+1 to a+2. Then we process row a: we see a stone at a and the cell below (a+1) is now empty, so we move the stone at a to a+1. Then in the same pass, we have moved both stones one step down. That is what we want.\n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\nFor program2.py:\n We are given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B') and we want to know if we can form the picture by stamping.\n\n The stamp: it stamps two adjacent cells at a time, and each stamping can be either BR or RB. The stamp must fit entirely (so we can only stamp on two adjacent cells). We can stamp multiple times on the same cell.\n\n Important: the entire process starts with a white row (all white). We can only change the color by stamping. The stamping operation: it sets two adjacent cells to one red and one blue (in either order).\n\n Observation:\n   We note that the stamping operation always changes two white cells to one red and one blue? But note: we can stamp on a cell that has been stamped before. So the same cell can be stamped multiple times.\n\n   How does stamping multiple times work?\n     Example: if we have a cell that is stamped once: it becomes either R or B. Then if we stamp again on that cell and an adjacent one, the color of that cell will be flipped? Because the stamp sets the two cells to R and B (or B and R). So if the cell was R and we stamp it again with the same stamp (with the adjacent cell) and we choose the orientation that sets the cell to B, then it becomes B? \n\n   Actually, the operation is: \n        If we stamp a pair (i, i+1), then we set:\n            Option 1: cell i becomes R and cell i+1 becomes B.\n            Option 2: cell i becomes B and cell i+1 becomes R.\n\n   But note: if we stamp the same pair again, we can choose the same or opposite orientation. So we can flip the colors of the two cells arbitrarily? \n\n   However, the key is: each stamping operation flips the colors of the two cells? Actually, it sets them to a specific pattern. But if we stamp the same pair twice with opposite orientations, we get:\n        First stamp: (R, B) \n        Second stamp: (B, R) on the same pair -> then the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R? \n        But then if we do both, the first cell: originally white -> then R -> then B? \n        Similarly, the second cell: white -> B -> R.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think in terms of linear algebra modulo 2? \n\n   Another approach: note that the stamping operation is reversible? Actually, if we stamp the same pair twice, we can get the original colors? Not exactly: \n        First stamp: (R, B) \n        Second stamp: (B, R) -> then we get (B, R) from the second stamp? But wait, the second stamp would overwrite the first? \n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So it sets the two cells to the new colors. Therefore, if we stamp the same pair twice, the second stamp completely overwrites the first.\n\n   However, note: we can also stamp overlapping pairs. \n\n   Insight: \n     We note that the entire coloring must be consistent with the constraint that the number of red and blue in contiguous non-white segments must be constrained.\n\n   Actually, we can break the string into segments separated by white. Because white cells are never stamped? But wait: the stamping operation always produces either R or B. How do we get white? We cannot get white again once we stamp? \n\n   However, note: the problem says we start with white. We can only change a cell by stamping it. But if we never stamp a cell, it remains white. Also, if we stamp a cell an even number of times? Actually, each stamping sets the cell to either R or B. If we stamp the same cell multiple times, the last stamp determines the color? \n\n   But note: the stamping operations can be done in any order? and the same cell can be part of multiple stamps. \n\n   Alternate Insight (known from similar problems): \n        The problem is equivalent to: we can assign to each stamping operation a color pattern for two adjacent cells. The operations can be done in any order and multiple times. \n\n        We note that the entire process can be modeled as: \n            Let each cell have a state: 0 for white, 1 for red, 2 for blue? \n            But note: the stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. \n\n        However, we can use the following known solution for this problem (from known contests):\n\n        Solution:\n          We split the string by 'W'. Then we get contiguous segments of non-white. For each contiguous segment, we must have:\n            - The segment length must be at least 1? But note: if the segment has length 1, then it's impossible? because we cannot stamp a single cell. So we require that the segment must be of length at least 2? Actually, no: we can stamp a segment of length 1? \n\n          However, note: the stamp covers two adjacent cells. So if we have a segment of length 1, we cannot have stamped it without also stamping an adjacent cell that is white? But wait, we cannot stamp partially. So we cannot stamp a single cell. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n          But also, we must check the counts of R and B? \n\n          Actually, we can do: \n            In each contiguous segment (without any white), we must be able to assign the stamps. \n\n          Known solution from Codeforces problems (e.g., problem 1781B) and similar: \n            We can check that in each contiguous segment of non-white:\n                - The segment must have at least one red and at least one blue? \n            But consider: \n                Example: \"RB\" -> valid.\n                Example: \"BR\" -> valid.\n                Example: \"R\" -> invalid? \n                Example: \"B\" -> invalid.\n                Example: \"RRB\" -> how? \n                    We can do: \n                      WWW -> W[RB] -> then [BR]B -> becomes BRB? \n                    But wait, we want RRB? \n                    Alternatively: \n                      Step1: stamp the first two: BR -> then we have BRW. \n                      Step2: stamp the last two: then we have B (from the first cell) and then the last two become RB? -> so we have B and then the last two: but wait, the last two are the second and third: so we have the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> so we get: B, R, B -> not RRB.\n\n            How to get RRB?\n                Step1: stamp the last two: so we have WWR and then stamp the last two: we set the second to R and the third to B? -> then we have W, R, B -> not RRB.\n\n            Alternatively: \n                Step1: stamp the first two: set to BR -> then we have B, R, W.\n                Step2: stamp the first two again: but this time use the other orientation: set to RB -> then we have R, B, W.\n                Step3: stamp the last two: but the last is white and the second is B: we set the second to R and the third to B? -> then we have R, R, B.\n\n            So we can have RRB.\n\n            Therefore, the constraint is not just having at least one R and one B? because in the segment \"RRB\", we have two R and one B.\n\n            Alternate Insight: \n                We can assign a value to the colors: \n                  Let R = +1, B = -1.\n                Then the entire segment must have a total sum of 0? \n                But \"RRB\": +1, +1, -1 -> sum = 1, not 0.\n\n            How about: the operations are linear? \n\n            Actually, note that each stamping operation covers two adjacent cells and adds +1 and -1? So the total sum of the segment would be 0? \n\n            But wait: we can stamp the same cell multiple times. Each stamping operation flips the sign of the two cells? \n\n            Let's model: \n                Initially, all zeros (white). \n                Each stamping operation: we choose two adjacent cells (i, i+1) and we add a vector: either (1, -1) or (-1, 1). \n\n            Then the entire vector is in the linear space generated by these vectors. \n\n            The condition: the sum of the entire vector must be 0? because each operation adds 0 to the total sum.\n\n            But \"RRB\": [1, 1, -1] -> sum = 1, not 0 -> so impossible? \n\n            But we did it above? \n\n            How? \n                Operation1: (0,0,0) -> stamp first two: (1,-1,0) -> total sum=0.\n                Operation2: stamp first two again: we add (-1,1,0) -> then (0,0,0) -> then we stamp the last two: (0,1,-1) -> total sum=0.\n\n            Then how did we get RRB? \n                We did three operations: \n                  Operation1: (1,-1,0) -> [B, R, W] -> but wait, we set the first two: we can choose the orientation. \n                  Operation1: we choose the first two to be (B,R) -> so we set: first=-1, second=+1.\n                  Operation2: we stamp the first two again: we choose (R,B) -> so we add (1, -1) -> then first: -1+1=0, second: 1-1=0 -> then we have (0,0,0) -> white.\n                  Operation3: we stamp the last two: we choose (R,B) -> then we set the second to R and the third to B? -> but wait, the second was 0 (white) and we set it to R? and the third to B? -> then we have (0,1,-1) -> which is W, R, B.\n\n            How do we get RRB? \n                We want: (1,1,-1). \n\n            How about:\n                Operation1: stamp the first two as (R,B): (1,-1,0)\n                Operation2: stamp the last two as (R,B): (1, -1+1, -1) = (1,0,-1) -> but that's not (1,1,-1).\n\n            Another try:\n                Operation1: stamp the first two as (B,R): (-1,1,0)\n                Operation2: stamp the first two again as (R,B): ( -1+1, 1-1, 0) = (0,0,0)\n                Operation3: stamp the last two as (R,B): (0,1,-1) -> then we have [0,1,-1] -> which is W, R, B.\n\n            How to get (1,1,-1)? \n                We need to have the first cell as R (1) and the second as R (1) and the third as B (-1).\n\n            Operation1: stamp the first two as (R,B): (1,-1,0)\n            Operation2: stamp the last two as (B,R): (1, -1, 0) -> then stamp the last two: we set the second to B and the third to R? -> then we have (1, -1, 1) -> but that's R, B, R.\n\n            Operation1: stamp the first two as (R,B): (1,-1,0)\n            Operation2: stamp the first two as (B,R): (1-1, -1+1,0) = (0,0,0) -> then we are back to white.\n\n            Operation1: stamp the first two as (R,B): (1,-1,0)\n            Operation2: stamp the second and third: we set the second to R and the third to B? -> then we have (1, R, B) -> but wait, the second was -1 (B) and we set it to R? -> then we have (1,1,-1) -> that's RRB.\n\n            So: \n                Operation1: (0,0,0) -> stamp(0,1) as (R,B): (1,-1,0)\n                Operation2: stamp(1,2) as (R,B): then the second cell becomes R (so we set it to 1) and the third becomes B (-1). \n                Then we have (1,1,-1) -> RRB.\n\n            Now, what is the total sum? 1+1-1=1, not 0. \n\n            Therefore, the linear algebra model must account for the fact that we are overwriting the previous value? \n\n        Alternate Insight (known from the problem \"Stamp\" in Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4)): \n            The solution is: \n                Split the string by 'W' into segments.\n                For each segment:\n                    If the segment is empty, skip.\n                    If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n                    Also, if the segment has only one color (only 'R' or only 'B'), then it's impossible? \n                But wait: we have the example \"RRB\" which is possible and has two R and one B.\n\n            Actually, the known solution for the problem (from the editorial) is:\n                We can do the following:\n                  - The entire picture must be splittable into contiguous segments of non-white. In each segment, we must have at least one red and at least one blue? \n                Why? \n                  Because the stamp always places one red and one blue. And if we have a contiguous segment that is non-white, then we must have applied at least one stamp that covers at least two adjacent cells? and that stamp gives one red and one blue. Moreover, even if we stamp multiple times, we cannot avoid having at least one blue and one red in the segment? \n\n            But consider: \n                Segment \"RR\": \n                  How to get \"RR\"? \n                  We can do: \n                    Step1: stamp the first two: (R,B) -> then we have R, B.\n                    Step2: stamp the first two again: but this time use (B,R) -> then we have B, R.\n                    Step3: stamp the first two again: (R,B) -> then we have R, B.\n                  We never get two R's.\n\n            How to get \"RR\"?\n                We can also stamp overlapping:\n                  Step1: stamp the first two: (R,B) -> [R, B, W]\n                  Step2: stamp the second and third: (R,B) -> [R, R, B] -> then we have two R's? but then we have an extra B at the end.\n\n                How to get rid of the B? \n                  Step3: stamp the last two: (B,R) -> [R, R, R]? no, that would set the second to R and the third to R? but wait: \n                  Step3: stamp the last two: we set the second and third: we can choose the orientation. If we choose (R,B) then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> then we have R, R, B. \n                  If we choose (B,R) then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n                How about:\n                  Step1: stamp the first two: (R,B) -> [R,B,W]\n                  Step2: stamp the first two: (B,R) -> [B,R,W] -> then we have B,R,W.\n                  Step3: stamp the first two: (R,B) -> [R,B,W] -> we are back.\n\n                It seems we cannot get \"RR\".\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: in each contiguous non-white segment, we must have at least one red and at least one blue? \n\n            But wait: what about \"RBR\"? \n                We have both R and B -> valid.\n\n            And \"RRB\": we have both R and B -> valid.\n\n            And \"R\": only one color -> invalid.\n\n            And \"BB\": only one color -> invalid.\n\n            So the solution: \n                Split the string by 'W' to get segments.\n                For each segment:\n                    if the segment is non-empty:\n                        if the segment has length 1: \n                            return \"NO\"\n                        else:\n                            if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment:\n                                return \"NO\"\n                If all segments are valid, return \"YES\".\n\n            Let's test with known examples:\n                Example 1: \"RRB\" -> segment = \"RRB\": has 'R' and 'B' -> valid.\n                Example 2: \"R\" -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n                Example 3: \"WB\" -> segment: \"B\" (after splitting by W) -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n                Example 4: \"W\" -> segment: empty -> skip -> valid.\n                Example 5: \"BRB\" -> segment: \"BRB\": has both -> valid.\n                Example 6: \"RR\" -> segment: \"RR\": no 'B' -> invalid.\n\n            But wait: the example \"RR\" is invalid?

We cannot get \"RR\".\n\n            Therefore, the solution for program2.py:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                # The next lines: we have t test cases.

So we are safe.\n\n But note: the code for program2.py is:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            flag = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n But note: the input might have multiple test cases and the total length of the strings is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the split function might create many segments? but the total length of the string is the same as the original, so the total work is O(n) per test case, and the sum of n is <= 10^5.\n\n Therefore, we output:\n\n   program1: the code block: \n        s[a][b] = '.'\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\n\n   program2: the code block as above.\n\n But note: the problem says to output only the missing code in the specified format.\n\n We are to output a JSON object: \n     {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n For program1, the missing code is the two lines that replace the TODO.\n\n For program2, the missing code is the entire block that processes the test cases (since the given code is a for loop that iterates over the test case strings, and we have to complete the body).\n\n However, note the given code for program2: \n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We must write the body of the for loop.\n\n Therefore, the completions:\n\n   program1: \n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But note: the existing code has an else block. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n   However, the existing code has an else: and then a comment. We are replacing the comment with two lines.\n\n   We must be careful: the indentation level is 20 (inside the for _ in range(n), then for a in ..., then for b in ..., then if s[a][b]=='*', then if ... else: ...). The two lines must be indented appropriately.\n\n   But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines at the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        s[a][b] = '.'\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\n\n   But note: we must write it as a string that can be inserted. We can write it as two lines.\n\n   For program2, we output:\n\n        s = s.strip()\n        segs = s.split('W')\n        flag = True\n        for seg in segs:\n            if seg == '':\n                continue\n            if len(seg)==1:\n                flag = False\n                break\n            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                flag = False\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n   But note: the for loop in program2 is already given. We are only completing the body.\n\n   However, the given code: \n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must write the body of this for loop.\n\n   But note: the variable s in the for loop is a line from the input. We are going to use that variable. We then strip it and split it. Then we check the segments.\n\n   We output the above block.\n\n   However, note: the input might have multiple test cases, and we are printing one line per test case.\n\n   Therefore, the JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\",\n          \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the indentation in program2: the for loop body must be indented one level more than the for statement. The given for loop is at the top level. So we indent the body by 4 spaces? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must be consistent. Since the original code in program2 is not indented for the body, we must add one level of indentation.\n\n   We'll use 4 spaces for each level.\n\n   The for loop in program2 is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   Then the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n   But the code we wrote: \n        s = s.strip()\n        ... \n\n   We must indent each line by 4 spaces? \n\n   However, the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But note: the inner for loop (for seg in segs) also needs an indented body. We use 8 spaces for the inner for loop body? \n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            flag = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n   So the body of the outer for loop is 9 lines. We must indent each of these 9 lines by 4 spaces? \n\n   But the problem says: output the missing code. We output the entire body of the outer for loop, with the same indentation as the for loop.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the body.\n\n   But the body must be indented appropriately? \n\n   We'll output the body with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output without specifying the absolute indentation? but the problem says the code must run.\n\n   We know that the for loop is at the top level, so the body must be indented.\n\n   We'll use 4 spaces for the first level.\n\n   Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n        \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But note: the inner for loop body: we use 8 spaces (which is two levels: 4 for the outer for loop and 4 for the inner for loop). \n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n        line1: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n        line2: 4 spaces: \"    segs = s.split('W')\"\n        line3: 4 spaces: \"    flag = True\"\n        line4: 4 spaces: \"    for seg in segs:\"\n        line5: 8 spaces: \"        if seg == '':\"\n        line6: 12 spaces: \"            continue\"\n        line7: 8 spaces: \"        if len(seg)==1:\"\n        line8: 12 spaces: \"            flag = False\"\n        line9: 12 spaces: \"            break\"\n        line10:8 spaces: \"        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\"\n        line11:12 spaces: \"            flag = False\"\n        line12:12 spaces: \"            break\"\n        line13:4 spaces: \"    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   So we write:\n\n        \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But note: the inner for loop body has multiple conditions. We break out of the inner for loop as soon as we find an invalid segment.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also break out of the inner for loop and then break the outer? but we break the inner for loop and then we continue to the print. Then we break the inner for loop and then we set flag to False and break the inner for loop, but then we break the inner for loop and then we do nothing? we just then break the inner for loop and then we go to the print.\n\n   Actually, the break in the inner for loop only breaks the inner for loop. Then we then go to the print. So we don't break the outer for loop? \n\n   But we are iterating over the segments. We break the inner for loop (so we stop checking the remaining segments) and then we print.\n\n   That is what we want.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   But note: the inner for loop: we break at the first invalid segment. Then we set flag to False and break the inner for loop. Then we do not check the remaining segments. Then we print.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1 we are only replacing the TODO. The TODO is in an else block. We are replacing the TODO with two lines. We write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But the existing code has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n        else:\n            s[a][b] = '.'\n            s[a+1][b] = '*'\n\n   So the two lines must be at the same indentation level as the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the if and else. We output the two lines without the else: and without the if.\n\n   We output the two lines of code that should be placed at the TODO.\n\n   The existing code has 12 spaces for the inner blocks? We don't know. But we output the two lines without any extra indentation? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines that are the body of the else.\n\n   We write:\n\n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   The \"\\n        \" is to match the existing indentation? but we don't know the exact indentation. However, the problem says the code must run. The existing code uses 8 spaces for the inner loops? \n\n   But the problem does not specify. We can assume that the existing code uses 4 or 8? \n\n   Actually, the code we are given for program1:\n\n        for i in range(int(input())):\n            n,m=map(int,input().split())\n            s=[list(input()) for j in range(n)]\n            for _ in range(n):\n                for a in reversed(range(n-1)):\n                    for b in range(m):\n                        if s[a][b]=='*':\n                            if s[a+1][b]=='o' or s[a+1][b]=='*':\n                                continue\n                            else:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at the same level as the continue. The continue is at 8 more spaces? \n\n   Actually, the code is:\n\n        for i in ...:\n            ... (indent level 4)\n            for _ in ...:\n                for a in ...:\n                    for b in ...:\n                        if ...: (indent level 20)\n                            if ...: (indent level 24)\n                                continue (indent level 28)\n                            else: (indent level 24)\n                                # TODO (indent level 28)\n\n   So the two lines we output must be at indent level 28? \n\n   But we don't know the exact number of spaces. However, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines as they would appear in the else block.\n\n   We can output:\n\n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But that is 16 extra spaces? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? but the problem says the code must run.\n\n   We note that the existing code uses the same indentation for the if and else bodies. The if body is \"continue\", which is at the same level as the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines that should be at the same level as the \"continue\".\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"                s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But wait, the \"continue\" is at 8 more spaces than the else? Actually, the else is at 24 spaces, and the body of the else is at 28? \n\n   We can count:\n\n        for i in range(...):  # 0\n            n,m = ...         # 4\n            s = ...           # 4\n            for _ in ...:     # 4\n                for a in ...: # 8\n                    for b in ...: # 12\n                        if ...:   # 16\n                            if ...: # 20\n                                continue # 24\n                            else:        # 20\n                                # TODO   # 24\n\n   So the TODO is at 24 spaces? \n\n   Then the two lines should be at 24 spaces? \n\n   But the continue is at 24 spaces. So we output:\n\n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   with 16 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n   Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\n   The else: is at 20 spaces, and the body of the else is indented by 4 more spaces -> 24 spaces.\n\n   So we output the two lines at 24 spaces.\n\n   How many spaces is that? 24. But we don't know the exact indentation per level? the problem doesn't specify. However, the problem says the code must run. We assume the environment uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"                s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But note: the string we output for program1 must be exactly the two lines, each with 16 spaces at the beginning? \n\n   Actually, 24 - 0 = 24? but we are writing the two lines as the body. We can write without the leading spaces? and let the existing indentation take care? \n\n   But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the two lines of code that replace the TODO. The TODO is at the current indentation level. We output the two lines without any extra leading spaces? \n\n   However, the existing code has the else: and then the TODO is at the next indentation level. We output the two lines at the same level as the TODO.\n\n   We can output:\n\n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   but then when we insert, the first line will be at the same level as the else: (which is 20) and then the next line at 20? \n\n   We must output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at 24. \n\n   How to represent 24 spaces? we can write 24 spaces? \n\n   But the problem does not specify. We can assume that the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent, and we have 6 levels (from the outer for i to the inner else) -> 6*4=24. \n\n   Therefore, we output 24 spaces? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output the two lines without leading spaces and let the existing structure handle the indentation? \n\n   But the TODO is a comment. We are replacing it with two lines. The two lines must be at the same level as the continue.\n\n   We output:\n\n        \"                s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   This is 16 spaces? \n\n   Actually, 16 spaces is 4*4=16? \n\n   We have:\n\n        for i ...:  # level0: 0\n            ...     # level1: 4\n            for ...: # level1: 4\n                for ...: # level2: 8\n                    for ...: # level3: 12\n                        if ...: # level4: 16\n                            if ...: # level5: 20\n                                ... # level6: 24\n                            else:   # level5: 20\n                                ... # level6: 24\n\n   So 6 levels * 4 = 24. But 24 spaces? \n\n   We can write 24 spaces as a string of 24 spaces? \n\n   But that is long. \n\n   Alternatively, we can output the two lines without the leading spaces and assume that the code is already indented? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the missing code. We are to replace the TODO. The TODO is at the correct indentation. We output the two lines at the same level.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        \"s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   but then the first line will be at the same column as the 'else:'. \n\n   We must have the two lines at the same level as the 'continue'. \n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"                s[a][b] = '.'\\n                s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   This is 16 spaces? \n\n   But 16 spaces is 4*4=16, but we need 24? \n\n   We are confused.\n\n   Let me count the levels:\n\n        for i in ...:   # 0\n            n,m = ...   # 4\n            s = ...     # 4\n            for _ in ...:   # 4\n                for a in ...:   # 8\n                    for b in ...:   # 12\n                        if ...:     # 16\n                            if ...:   # 20\n                                continue   # 24\n                            else:   # 20\n                                # TODO   # 24\n\n   So the TODO is at 24 spaces. The two lines we want to put there should be at 24 spaces.\n\n   We output:\n\n        \"                        s[a][b] = '.'\\n                        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   That is 24 spaces? \n\n   But 24 spaces is a string of 24 spaces.\n\n   We can generate: 24 spaces = 6*4.\n\n   But we don't know if the environment uses 4 spaces per indent. The problem doesn't specify. However, the sample code uses consistent indentation.\n\n   We assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\n   Therefore, for program1, we output:\n\n        \"                        s[a][b] = '.'\\n                        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   But this is long and might be error-prone.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and hope that the existing structure provides the indentation? \n\n   But the TODO is at 24 spaces, and we are replacing it with two lines. The two lines will be placed exactly at the same position as the TODO.\n\n   So if we output the two lines without any leading spaces, they will be at column 0? \n\n   That is not what we want.\n\n   Therefore, we must output the two lines with 24 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   But 24 spaces is a fixed string.\n\n   We write:\n\n        program1: \"                        s[a][b] = '.'\\n                        s[a+1][b] = '*'\"\n\n   For program2, we output the body with 4 spaces for the outer for loop body, and then 4 more for the inner for loop body, etc.\n\n   But note: the program2 code is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with the body. The body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n   We output the body with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   But the for loop is at column 0, so the body should be at column 4.\n\n   We write:\n\n        \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   This uses 4 spaces for the outer body, and 8 spaces for the inner body.\n\n   This is standard.\n\n   Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"                        s[a][b] = '.'\\n                        s[a+1][b] = '*'\",\n          \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    flag = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            flag = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if flag else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But wait, the program2 body: the last line is \"    print(...)\" -> that is at 4 spaces, which is correct.\n\n   We are done."
