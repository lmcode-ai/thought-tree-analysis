How do we form w? w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]   # a is the length of s.\n\n            Here, i=4, a=5, s[:4]=\"abcd\", then \"abcd\"*5 = \"abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd\", then take 5: \"abcda\" -> which is not \"abcdb\". So we go to the else. Then we print \"NO\" and break.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the smallest integer d (minimum days) such that AmShZ and Keshi can meet within d days.\n\nThe approach in program1.py uses Dijkstra's algorithm on an inverted graph. The idea is to compute the cost (which represents the minimum days required to reach city n from the current city) for each city.\n\nIn the provided code:\n- We have an inverted adjacency list `iadj` which for a node u stores the incoming edges (from v to u) and the count of such edges (since there can be multiple roads from v to u).\n- `nadj` is an array that initially stores the out-degree of each node (but note: in the loop we are decrementing it by the number of edges from u to v? Actually, we are building the graph and then in the inverted graph, for each node u, we are storing the predecessors and the count of edges from each predecessor.\n\nHowever, note that the problem is about having two types of actions. The key insight is that we can model the problem with a state (city) and we want to compute the minimum d such that from city 1 we can reach city n within d days.\n\nThe algorithm in the code uses a min-heap (priority queue) starting from the destination (city n-1, since we index from 0). The cost for the destination is 0.\n\nThe relaxation step: for a node v, we look at its predecessors u (in the inverted graph, so edges from u to v). For each u, we note that if we are at u, then we have several outgoing edges. Some of them might be blocked by AmShZ. The idea is that AmShZ can block roads to force Keshi to take the desired path.\n\nThe formula used in the condition is:\n    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n        ... then update cost[u]\n\nBut note: the variable `nadj[u]` is being decremented by the number of edges from u to v (which is stored in `iadj[v][u]`). Actually, the code initially sets `nadj` to the out-degree of each node? But wait: in the input reading, we do:\n    nadj[v] += 1   for each edge (v, u)  [because we are building the graph: from v to u]\n\nBut then in the inverted graph, when processing node v, we look at its predecessors u (which in the original graph are the nodes that have an edge to v). However, in the code, the inverted graph `iadj` is built for node u (as the key) and then we are processing node v and then for each u in `iadj[v]` (which are the nodes that have an edge to v, i.e., u->v in the inverted graph? Actually, the graph is built as: \n    iadj[u][v] = count   meaning there are `count` edges from v to u? \nBut wait: the input is (v, u) meaning an edge from v to u. Then we do:\n    v, u = ...; v-=1; u-=1\n    iadj[u][v] = ...   so we are storing in iadj[u] the node v that has an edge to u? So that's the inverted edge: from v to u becomes stored as u has an incoming edge from v.\n\nBut then in the inverted graph, we are building the reverse graph: for a node u, we store the nodes v that have an edge to u? Actually, the graph is stored as: for each node, we store the nodes that have an edge to it? So to traverse backwards, we use the inverted graph.\n\nNow, the algorithm:\n    We start at the destination (n-1) with cost 0.\n    Then we consider all nodes u that have an edge to v (so u->v in the original graph, and we are at v). \n    We update the out-degree of u: we subtract the number of edges from u to v (which is stored in iadj[v][u]? Actually, in the inverted graph, we have for node v: the key u (which is a predecessor in the original graph) and the value is the count of edges from u to v? But wait: the inverted graph is built as: for an edge (v, u) we store in iadj[u] the node v? So when we are at node v, we look at iadj[v] to get the nodes that have an edge to v? Actually, the inverted graph is stored per node: for a node w, iadj[w] contains the nodes that have an edge to w? So for node v, iadj[v] contains the nodes that have an edge to v? Then in the loop, we are iterating over u in iadj[v]: meaning u is a node that has an edge to v? Then the edge is u->v.\n\nBut note: the variable `nadj` was initially set to the out-degree of each node? Actually, we did:\n    for each edge (v, u): we did nadj[v] += 1.\n\nSo `nadj[u]` initially is the out-degree of u? But wait: we did `nadj[v] += 1` for an edge from v to u. So `nadj` is an array of the out-degrees of each node.\n\nThen in the relaxation for an edge from u to v (which we are traversing backwards from v to u), we do:\n    nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # because we are removing the edges from u to v? Actually, we are removing the count of edges from u to v? But note: there might be multiple edges from u to v.\n\nThe idea is that when we are at node u, we have several outgoing edges. Some of them lead to nodes that we have already processed (and we know the cost to the destination from those nodes). The strategy is that AmShZ can block all the edges from u that lead to nodes that are not the best choice? \n\nThe formula for updating the cost of u is:\n    cost[u] = min(cost[u], cost[v] + (out_degree[u] - (number of edges from u to v)) + 1)\n\nBut wait: the condition in the code is:\n    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\nBut note: we have just subtracted the edges from u to v from nadj[u] (so nadj[u] becomes the out-degree of u minus the edges from u to v). Then we are adding that to cost[v] and then adding 1? \n\nActually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known) is:\n\n    Let dp[u] = minimum days to reach n from u.\n    We start with dp[n] = 0.\n    Then for a node u, we have:\n        dp[u] = min_{v in neighbors of u} { dp[v] + (out_degree[u] - (number of edges from u to v)) } \n    But note: actually, the known solution uses:\n        dp[u] = min_{v} { dp[v] } + deg[u]   [but then we subtract the edges that we block?]\n\nHowever, the known solution for the problem \"Keshi in Search of AmShZ\" (CodeForces) uses:\n\n    We use a priority queue. We start from node n (dp[n]=0). Then for each node u, we maintain:\n        dp[u] = min(dp[u], dp[v] + (deg[u] - count[u] + 1))   [but I need to recall]\n\nAlternatively, the known solution:\n\n    Let d[u] = minimum days to reach n from u.\n    We start with d[n] = 0.\n    We use a priority queue (min-heap) by d[u].\n    For a node u, we have:\n        d[u] = min(d[u], 1 + d[v] + (deg[u] - cnt[u] - 1))   ?\n\nBut in the code we see:\n\n    We have a heap that we pop the smallest d[v]. Then for each neighbor u (in the reverse graph) of v, we do:\n        deg[u]--   [but in our code we are subtracting the entire count of edges from u to v?]\n\nActually, the known solution (from known submissions) is:\n\n    d = [10**18] * (n+1)\n    d[n] = 0\n    q = [(0, n)]\n    deg = [0]*(n+1)\n    # Build graph: for each node, the list of nodes that have an edge to it? (reverse graph)\n    # Also, deg[i] = out-degree of i\n    # Then in the graph, for each node, we have a list of predecessors? Actually, we build the reverse graph: for an edge (a,b), we add b to the list of a's reverse neighbors? Actually, we build: \n    #   graph: for an edge (a,b) we do: graph[b].append(a)   [so we can go from b to a?] and then deg[a]++ (the out-degree of a) but note: we are building the reverse graph.\n\n    while q:\n        d_val, u = heapq.heappop(q)\n        if d_val != d[u]: continue\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            deg[v] -= 1\n            # Then we can update d[v]? \n            # The update: d[v] = min(d[v], d[u] + deg[v] + 1)\n            # But wait: in the known solution, it is: \n            #   d[v] = min(d[v], d[u] + 1 + deg[v] - cnt[v][u]?) \n            # Actually, we see in our code: we are subtracting the entire count of edges from u to v? But note: in the code we are doing:\n            #   for u in iadj[v]:   # u is a predecessor of v? (so edge u->v)\n            #       deg[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # so we remove the count of edges from u to v from the out-degree of u? Then we do:\n            #       if cost[v] + deg[u] + 1 < cost[u]: then update.\n\nBut the known solution (from known submissions) is:\n\n    d = [10**18] * n\n    d[n-1] = 0\n    heap = [(0, n-1)]\n    deg = [0] * n\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    # Build the graph: for each edge (u, v) we add to graph[v] the node u (reverse graph) and deg[u]++ (the out-degree of u)\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v = ... \n        graph[v-1].append(u-1)\n        deg[u-1] += 1\n\n    while heap:\n        days, u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if days != d[u]: continue\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            deg[v] -= 1\n            # Then we update: \n            new_days = days + 1 + deg[v]\n            if new_days < d[v]:\n                d[v] = new_days\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (d[v], v))\n\nBut wait: in the known solution, we do:\n    new_days = d[u] + 1 + deg[v]\n\nBut in our code, we have:\n    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n        cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n        heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nBut note: in the known solution, we subtract one edge at a time? But in our code, we are subtracting the entire count of edges from u to v? That is, we are processing all edges from u to v at once? \n\nActually, the problem: the graph may have multiple edges. The known solution above does not account for multiple edges? \n\nBut in our code, we are storing the count of edges from u to v in `iadj[v][u]`. Then we subtract that entire count from `nadj[u]` (which is the out-degree of u) at once. Then we use the updated `nadj[u]` (which is the out-degree of u minus the edges from u to v) in the update.\n\nBut the known solution for multiple edges: we have to account for the fact that when we are at node u, we can block all the edges that we don't want to use? \n\nThe correct update for a node u is:\n\n    We are going to use one edge from u to a node v (which we have already processed). Then we must block all the other edges from u to nodes that are not v? But note: we might have multiple edges to the same node? \n\nActually, the problem: when we are at u, we have an out-degree of `deg[u]` (which counts multiple edges). We can block all edges that we don't want to use. We want to use the edge that leads to a node v that minimizes the total days. However, we have to block the other edges? How many blocks? We have to block `deg[u] - count` edges, where `count` is the number of edges from u to v? But note: we can block one edge per day? \n\nThe strategy: \n    On the day we decide to move, we block all edges that we don't want to use? But we can only block one edge per day? \n\nActually, the problem says: at the beginning of each day, AmShZ can send one of two messages:\n    Type 1: send a blocked road (so one road per day) and then Keshi remains.\n    Type 2: tell Keshi to move.\n\nSo to force Keshi to take the edge to v, we must block all the other edges from u? But note: there might be multiple edges to the same node? We don't need to block multiple edges to the same node? Because if there are multiple edges to v, then even if we block one of them, Keshi can still use the others? \n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"AmShZ sends the index of one road to Keshi as a blocked road\". So each road has an index. So if there are multiple edges from u to v, then we have to block each one individually? \n\nTherefore, to block all edges from u to nodes other than v, we must block each of those roads one by one. However, we can also block some roads that go to v? But we don't want to block the road we are going to use? \n\nThe optimal strategy: \n    We want to use an edge to a node v that minimizes the total days. The total days would be:\n        (number of days we spend blocking) + 1 (for the move day)\n    The number of blocks we need is: (the total out-degree of u) - (the number of edges from u to v) \n    Why? Because we have to block every edge that does not lead to v? But note: there might be multiple edges to v? We don't need to block the edges that go to v? So we only block the edges that go to nodes other than v? \n\nBut the total number of edges that do not go to v is: deg[u] - (number of edges from u to v)\n\nTherefore, the total days for the move from u is: \n    (deg[u] - (number of edges from u to v)) [blocking days] + 1 [the move day] \n    and then we add the days from v to the destination.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple edges to v? Then we don't need to block the edges to v? So the blocking days are only for the edges that go to nodes other than v.\n\nHowever, in the update step for u, we are processing a particular v? How do we account for the multiple edges? \n\nIn the known solution for multiple edges, we do:\n\n    We maintain for each node u: \n        dp[u] = min_{v in neighbors of u} { dp[v] + (deg[u] - cnt[u][v]) } + 1? \n\nBut note: the known solution in the code we are building does not account for multiple edges? \n\nActually, the known solution that accounts for multiple edges:\n\n    We build the graph: for each node u, we have a list of neighbors and the count? But the known solution above does not use the count? \n\nBut in our code, we are storing the count. And we subtract the entire count of edges from u to v from the out-degree of u? Then we update:\n\n    candidate = dp[v] + (deg[u] after subtracting the edges to v) + 1\n\nBut wait: the candidate for u from v is: \n    candidate = dp[v] + (deg[u] - count_edges_to_v) + 1\n\nBut note: we are subtracting the edges to v from deg[u]? Then we are left with the edges that go to nodes other than v? Then we add 1 for the move? \n\nBut why do we add the entire deg[u] (after subtracting the edges to v) to dp[v]? \n\nThe idea: \n    We are going to use the edge to v. Then we must block all the other edges (which are deg[u] - count_edges_to_v). Each blocking takes one day. Then we have one day to move. So the total days for u is: \n        (deg[u] - count_edges_to_v) [blocking] + 1 [move] + dp[v] [days from v to n]\n\nBut note: we can interleave the blocking and moving? Actually, the problem: we can block one road per day and then on the move day we move. So the blocking must be done before the move? \n\nTherefore, the update is:\n\n    candidate = dp[v] + 1 + (deg[u] - count_edges_to_v)\n\nBut note: in the code, we are doing:\n\n    candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\nwhere nadj[u] is deg[u] (the initial out-degree) minus the count of edges from u to v? \n\nBut wait: we subtracted the edges from u to v from nadj[u] just before? So nadj[u] is now deg[u] - count_edges_to_v? \n\nTherefore, the update is:\n\n    candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - count_edges_to_v) + 1\n\nBut note: we are processing each edge (u->v) one by one? However, we are updating nadj[u] by subtracting the entire count of edges to v? Then we use the updated nadj[u]? \n\nBut the problem: we are processing multiple v's for the same u? Then we subtract the count of edges to v from nadj[u] each time we process an edge from u to a v? \n\nThis is incorrect? Because the out-degree of u is fixed. We should not subtract the edges to v for every v we process? \n\nActually, the known solution for multiple edges is to do:\n\n    We maintain the current out-degree of u (which initially is the total out-degree). Then when we process an edge from u to v, we subtract the count of edges from u to v from the current out-degree? Then we update the candidate for u as: \n        candidate = dp[v] + (current_out_degree) + 1\n\nBut note: the current_out_degree after subtracting the edges to v is the number of edges from u to nodes that we haven't processed? \n\nBut wait: we are processing the nodes in increasing order of dp[v]? \n\nActually, the algorithm:\n\n    We use a min-heap by dp[v]. We start from the destination. Then we update the predecessors.\n\n    For a node u, we want to compute:\n        dp[u] = min_{v} { dp[v] + (deg[u] - count[u][v]) + 1 } \n    but note: we cannot use the same v for which we subtract the count? \n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n    dp[u] = min_{v} { dp[v] } + deg[u] - (the total count of edges from u to the nodes that we have already processed) + 1? \n\nBut the known solution (from known submissions) for multiple edges is:\n\n    We maintain:\n        dp[u] = min_{v in the set of processed neighbors} { dp[v] + (deg[u] - (the number of edges from u to v that we have processed?)) } \n\nBut actually, we can do:\n\n    We maintain for each node u:\n        total = deg[u]   (the initial out-degree, counting multiple edges)\n        count = 0   (the total number of edges from u to nodes that we have processed? not exactly, but we subtract the edges as we process the nodes)\n\n    Then when we process a node v (which is a neighbor of u in the reverse graph) and we know dp[v], we do:\n        total = total - cnt[u][v]   # because we are going to use one of the edges to v? but we are not using it yet? \n        candidate = dp[v] + total + 1   # but then we update dp[u] = min(dp[u], candidate)\n\n    But then we push u when? \n\nActually, the known solution (from known submissions) for multiple edges is:\n\n    d = [10**18] * n\n    d[n-1] = 0\n    heap = [(0, n-1)]\n    deg = [0] * n   # total out-degree (counting multiple edges)\n    cnt = [0] * n   # or we can use a separate array for the count of edges to processed nodes? \n\n    # Build the reverse graph: for each edge (u, v) we add to graph[v] the node u, and we also record the multiplicity? \n    # Actually, we can use a list of (neighbor, count) for the reverse graph? \n\n    # Alternatively, we can precompute for each node u, the total out-degree and then for each node u, we maintain the current out-degree (which we subtract as we process edges).\n\n    # But the known solution that passes for multiple edges:\n\n    #   d = [10**18] * n\n    #   d[n-1] = 0\n    #   heap = [(0, n-1)]\n    #   deg = [0] * n   # the total out-degree (counting multiple edges)\n    #   # We also need an array for the current count of edges that we have subtracted? \n    #   # Actually, we maintain an array `cnt` for each node u: the number of edges from u to nodes that have been processed? \n    #   # But then we update: \n    #   #   when we process a node v, then for each neighbor u (in the reverse graph) that has an edge to v, we do:\n    #   #       cnt[u] += count(u->v)   # the number of edges from u to v\n    #   #       candidate = d[v] + (deg[u] - cnt[u]) + 1\n    #   #       if candidate < d[u]:\n    #   #           d[u] = candidate\n    #   #           heapq.heappush(heap, (d[u], u))\n\n    But note: this is not the same as the known solution? \n\nAfter checking known submissions for the problem \"Keshi in Search of AmShZ\" (CodeForces 1610D), we find:\n\n    # Example submission (C++):\n    #   vector<vector<int>> g(n);\n    #   vector<int> deg(n, 0);\n    #   for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    #       int u, v;\n    #       cin >> u >> v;\n    #       u--; v--;\n    #       g[v].push_back(u);\n    #       deg[u]++;\n    #   }\n    #   vector<int> d(n, 1e9);\n    #   d[n-1] = 0;\n    #   priority_queue<pair<int, int>> q;\n    #   q.push({0, n-1});\n    #   vector<int> cnt(n, 0);   // cnt[u] = number of edges from u to nodes that we have already processed? \n    #   while (!q.empty()) {\n    #       int u = q.top().second;\n    #       int dist = -q.top().first;\n    #       q.pop();\n    #       if (dist != d[u]) continue;\n    #       for (int v : g[u]) {\n    #           cnt[v]++;\n    #           int nd = d[u] + deg[v] - cnt[v] + 1;\n    #           if (nd < d[v]) {\n    #               d[v] = nd;\n    #               q.push({-d[v], v});\n    #           }\n    #       }\n    #   }\n\n    But wait: the update is:\n        nd = d[u] + deg[v] - cnt[v] + 1;\n    Here, for an edge from v to u (in the original graph) we are updating v? \n    And we do: \n        cnt[v]++   (because we have processed one edge from v to u? but there might be multiple edges? so we should add the count of edges from v to u? \n\n    But in the above, they only do cnt[v]++ for one edge? \n\n    This is for simple edges? \n\n    For multiple edges, we must change cnt[v] by the count of edges from v to u? \n\n    Therefore, in our code, we have stored the count. So we should do:\n\n        for u in iadj[v]:   # u is a node that has an edge to v? (so edge u->v in the original graph) and we are at v.\n            # We have iadj[v][u] = count of edges from u to v.\n            # Then we update:\n            #   cnt[u] += iadj[v][u]   # we have processed these edges from u to v.\n            #   candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - cnt[u]) + 1   # but note: we haven't processed all edges from u, only some? \n\n    But the above known solution does not work for multiple edges? \n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        We maintain for each node u: \n            total_processed[u] = the total count of edges from u to nodes that have been processed (i.e., for which we have computed the cost).\n\n        Then when we process a node v, for each u in iadj[v] (so u has an edge to v), we do:\n            total_processed[u] += iadj[v][u]   # because we have processed the edges from u to v? \n            candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - total_processed[u]) + 1\n            if candidate < cost[u]:\n                cost[u] = candidate\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n    But note: we are updating cost[u] multiple times? \n\n    However, the condition: we want to update cost[u] only when we have a better candidate? \n\n    But the formula: \n        candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - total_processed[u]) + 1\n\n    Why? \n        deg[u] is the total out-degree of u (counting multiple edges).\n        total_processed[u] is the total count of edges from u to nodes that have been processed (i.e., we know the cost for those nodes).\n\n        Then (deg[u] - total_processed[u]) is the number of edges from u to nodes that have not been processed? \n\n        The idea: we are going to use an edge from u to a node that has been processed? Then we must block all the edges from u to unprocessed nodes? and also block all the edges from u to processed nodes that we don't want to use? \n\n        But wait: we can choose which edge to use? We want to use the edge that minimizes the total days. However, we are processing nodes in increasing order of cost? \n\n        The known solution (with the array `cnt` and without multiple edges) does:\n\n            nd = d[u] + deg[v] - cnt[v] + 1\n\n        and then updates.\n\n        For multiple edges, we replace the simple increment by the count.\n\n    Therefore, we should change the code to:\n\n        We maintain an array `processed` (or `cnt`) of length n, initially zeros.\n\n        Then in the loop for node v, for each u in iadj[v]:\n            processed[u] += iadj[v][u]   # add the count of edges from u to v\n            candidate = cost[v] + (nadj[u] - processed[u]) + 1   # note: nadj[u] is the total out-degree of u? \n\n        But wait: in our code, we did not store the total out-degree separately? We have `nadj` which we are decrementing? \n\n        Actually, we initially set `nadj` to the out-degree of each node? Then we are decrementing it by the count of edges from u to v? \n\n        But that is not the same as the `processed` array? \n\n        We want to keep the total out-degree (deg[u]) fixed, and then we have a separate array `processed` that accumulates the count of edges from u to any processed node.\n\n        Then the candidate is: cost[v] + (deg[u] - processed[u]) + 1\n\n        But note: we are not using the updated `nadj`? \n\n        So we should change the code:\n\n            We don't need to decrement `nadj[u]`? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let's rename:\n                deg = [0]*n   # total out-degree (counting multiple edges) -> we already have this as `nadj` initially? \n                processed = [0]*n   # we'll create a new array.\n\n            Then in the input, we set `nadj` (which we can call `deg`) to the out-degree.\n\n            Then in the loop:\n\n                for u in iadj[v]:\n                    processed[u] += iadj[v][u]   # we have processed the edges from u to v\n                    candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - processed[u]) + 1\n                    if candidate < cost[u]:\n                        cost[u] = candidate\n                        heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: we might have multiple edges from u to the same node v? and we are adding the count.\n\n        However, the problem: we might have multiple edges from u to v? then we add the count for the same v multiple times? \n\n        But we are iterating over u in iadj[v]: and for each u, we add iadj[v][u] (which is the count of edges from u to v). \n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But then we update cost[u] every time we process an edge from u to a processed node? \n\n        However, the candidate might improve as we process more nodes? \n\n        But the known solution updates cost[u] every time we process an edge from u to a node? \n\n        But note: the candidate formula: \n            candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - processed[u]) + 1\n\n        Here, `processed[u]` is the total count of edges from u to any processed node (including v). And we are using the current cost[v] (which is the best known cost for v).\n\n        However, we might have multiple v's? and we want the best candidate? \n\n        But the known solution does not take the minimum over v? it updates as soon as it sees an edge? \n\n        This is not the standard Dijkstra? \n\n        Actually, the known solution (with the array `cnt`) does:\n\n            for each neighbor v of u (in the reverse graph) we do:\n                cnt[v]++   (or add the count for multiple edges)\n                candidate = d[u] + deg[v] - cnt[v] + 1\n                if candidate < d[v]:\n                    d[v] = candidate\n                    push\n\n        This is not the standard relaxation? because we update d[v] multiple times? \n\n        Why is it correct? \n\n        The formula: \n            d[v] = min_{over the processed nodes u that are neighbors of v} { d[u] + deg[v] - cnt[v] + 1 }\n\n        But note: as we process more nodes, cnt[v] increases, so the candidate might become smaller? \n\n        Actually, the term (deg[v] - cnt[v]) decreases as we process more nodes? \n\n        Therefore, we might get a better candidate later? \n\n        But the known solution updates immediately? \n\n        However, the known solution passes? \n\n        But the complexity: we update a node u only once? \n\n        Actually, in the known solution, they use a priority queue and they mark the best cost. They only push once? \n\n        But they update the candidate for a node v multiple times? \n\n        How many times? The number of incoming edges to v? \n\n        But the total number of edges is m, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we change the code to:\n\n            We remove the line: `nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]` \n            We create a new array `processed` of zeros.\n\n            Then in the loop:\n\n                for u in iadj[v]:\n                    # We are going to update u\n                    processed[u] += iadj[v][u]   # we have processed the edges from u to v\n                    candidate = cost[v] + (nadj[u] - processed[u]) + 1   # note: nadj[u] is the total out-degree of u (fixed)\n                    if candidate < cost[u]:\n                        cost[u] = candidate\n                        heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: we are modifying `processed[u]` and then using it in the candidate? \n\n        However, we must maintain `processed` per node? \n\n        But we are iterating over different v's? \n\n        We must initialize `processed` as an array of zeros.\n\n        But in the provided code, we don't have `processed` array. We have to add it.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are only allowed to fill in the missing block? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            for u in iadj[v]:\n                nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # we are going to remove this line?\n                if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                    # update\n\n        We are not allowed to change the existing code? only fill in the missing block? \n\n        But the TODO is inside the while loop. We are allowed to change the code in the TODO block? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the missing block. \n\n        However, the provided code has:\n\n            for u in iadj[v]:\n                nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]\n                if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO block? \n\n        But the known solution with multiple edges requires an array `processed` that we haven't declared? \n\n        We are not allowed to change the rest of the code? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the array `nadj` as the total out-degree? and then use a separate array for the current out-degree? \n\n        Actually, the initial `nadj` is the total out-degree. Then we are decrementing it by the count of edges to v? But then we use it in the candidate? \n\n        But the candidate formula: cost[v] + (nadj[u] after subtracting the edges to v) + 1\n\n        This is not the same as the known solution? \n\n        The known solution uses: \n            candidate = cost[v] + (total_deg[u] - total_processed_edges[u]) + 1\n\n        In our code, after we subtract the edges to v, `nadj[u]` becomes total_deg[u] - count_edges_to_v. But then if we process another edge from u to a different v', we subtract again? \n\n        Then `nadj[u]` becomes total_deg[u] - count_edges_to_v - count_edges_to_v'? \n\n        Then the candidate for the next v' would be: cost[v'] + (nadj[u] after subtracting the edges to v') + 1 = cost[v'] + (total_deg[u] - count_edges_to_v - count_edges_to_v') + 1\n\n        This is exactly: cost[v'] + (total_deg[u] - total_processed_edges[u]) + 1, where total_processed_edges[u] = count_edges_to_v + count_edges_to_v'\n\n        Therefore, the code as provided is already accounting for the multiple edges? \n\n        And the update is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            then push (cost[u], u)\n\n        But note: we are updating cost[u] for every edge? and we are using the current value of nadj[u] (which is the total out-degree minus the count of edges to all the v's we have processed so far).\n\n        This is the same as the known solution? \n\n        Why? \n\n        The candidate for u from a particular v is: \n            candidate = cost[v] + (deg[u] - (count of edges from u to all the v's we have processed so far)) + 1\n\n        But note: the count of edges from u to all the v's we have processed so far is exactly: (initial deg[u] - nadj[u])\n\n        So candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        And then we break out of the loop? No, we continue to process other edges? \n\n        But note: we are updating cost[u] for every outgoing edge? and we are pushing the updated cost[u] into the heap. Then when we pop a node, we mark it as visited and skip if we have already visited.\n\n        This is standard Dijkstra? \n\n        However, the candidate for u might be updated multiple times? and we want the smallest candidate? \n\n        But the formula: \n            candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n\n        Here, nadj[u] is being decremented as we process more edges from u? So the candidate might become smaller as we process more edges? \n\n        Therefore, we should update cost[u] every time we process an edge from u? \n\n        And then push the new cost[u]? \n\n        But then when we pop a node, we might have multiple entries in the heap? so we use the visited array to skip duplicates.\n\n        The provided code has a visited array: `visit=[0]*n`\n\n        And we do: \n            if visit[v]: continue\n\n        So we only process a node once.\n\n        But then how do we update cost[u] multiple times? \n\n        We are processing node v only once. Then for each u in iadj[v], we do:\n\n            nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]\n            candidate = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            if candidate < cost[u]:\n                cost[u] = candidate\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        This means that for a node u, we might update it multiple times (from different v's) and we might push it multiple times? \n\n        But then when we pop a node u, we mark it as visited and skip future pops? \n\n        This is not correct? because we might get a better candidate for u later? \n\n        However, the candidate for u from a later v might be: \n            candidate = cost[v] + (nadj[u] at that time) + 1\n\n        But note: at the time we process the later v, we have already subtracted the edges from u to the earlier v's? so nadj[u] is smaller? \n\n        Therefore, the candidate might be smaller? \n\n        But we are not revisiting u? because we only process it once? \n\n        This is a problem.\n\n        The known solution does not use a visited array? it uses:\n\n            if d[u] != dist: continue\n\n        which is the same as our visited array? \n\n        But then how do we account for the fact that the candidate for u depends on the number of processed edges? \n\n        The known solution (without multiple edges) does not use a visited array? it uses the condition:\n\n            if d[u] != dist: continue\n\n        and they update d[u] multiple times? \n\n        In our code, we are updating cost[u] and then pushing. Then when we pop, we check if the popped value matches the current cost[u]? \n\n        But the provided code uses a visited array? \n\n        We should change the visited array to the standard \"lazy Dijkstra\" by checking if the popped value is the same as the current cost? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            d, v = heapq.heappop(q)\n            if visit[v]: \n                continue\n            visit[v] = 1\n\n        This means we only process each node once.\n\n        Therefore, we must ensure that when we update cost[u], we do it before we pop u? \n\n        But the candidate formula for u depends on the number of processed edges from u? which increases over time? \n\n        Therefore, we should not mark u as visited until we have processed all incoming edges? \n\n        But that is not possible? \n\n        The solution: remove the visited array? and use the standard:\n\n            if d_val != cost[v]: continue\n\n        But the provided code has a visited array? \n\n        We are not allowed to change the existing code? only fill in the TODO block? \n\n        Given the constraints, we must use the provided structure.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the provided code might be intended to work without the visited array? \n\n        But the provided code has the visited array and skips if visited.\n\n        How to resolve? \n\n        After reading known submissions for the problem, we see that they do not use a visited array? they use:\n\n            if d[u] < dist: continue   [because they are popping]\n\n        But in our code, we are using a visited array? \n\n        Given the problem, we are to output only the missing block.\n\n        The missing block is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: we have to update cost[u] and then push.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: we are inside a for loop over u in iadj[v]. We are updating cost[u] and then pushing. \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But will it work for multiple edges? \n\n        Let's test with a simple graph: \n            n=3, m=3: \n                edge1: 1->2\n                edge2: 1->3\n                edge3: 1->3\n            We want to compute cost[0] (city1).\n\n            We start at node2 (index1) and node3 (index2) with cost 0? \n            But we start from n-1 which is node2 (if n=3, then n-1=2) -> but we are starting from n-1? \n\n            Actually, we start from node2 (index2) and node3 (index2) is not the destination? \n\n            The destination is node3 (index2) for n=3? \n\n            So we start at node2 (index2) with cost[2]=0.\n\n            Then we look at the inverted graph for node2: which nodes have an edge to node2? \n                edge1: 1->2, so node0 has an edge to node1? no, wait: \n                We have: \n                    edge1: 1->2: so in the inverted graph, we store for node1: iadj[1][0] = 1? \n                    Actually, we store in iadj[1] (which is for node1) the node0? \n                But our indexing: \n                    n=3, so we have nodes 0,1,2.\n                    The edge: v=1, u=2: then we do v0=0, u0=1? \n                    Then we do: iadj[1][0] = 1 (count=1)\n\n            Similarly, for edge2: 1->3: v=1, u=3 -> v0=0, u0=2 -> iadj[2][0] = 1\n            for edge3: 1->3: v=1, u=3 -> v0=0, u0=2 -> iadj[2][0] becomes 2.\n\n            Then we start from node2 (which is the destination? n-1=2) with cost[2]=0.\n\n            Then we process node2: \n                for u in iadj[2]: only u=0? \n                then we do: \n                    nadj[0] -= iadj[2][0]   # which is 2 -> so if initially nadj[0] = out-degree of node0 = 3 (because there are 3 edges: 1->2, 1->3, 1->3) -> then nadj[0] becomes 1.\n                then candidate = cost[2] + nadj[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n                then we set cost[0]=2 and push (2,0).\n\n            Then we process node1? but we haven't seen node1? \n\n            How do we get to node1? \n                We have an edge from node0 to node1? so in the inverted graph, for node1, we have an entry from node0? \n                But we haven't processed node1? \n\n            We start from node2, then we process node0? \n                Then for node0, we look at iadj[0]? which is empty? \n                So we are done.\n\n            Then the answer is cost[0]=2.\n\n            Is that correct? \n                From node0 (city1): \n                    We have 3 edges: to node1, node2, node2.\n                AmShZ can block two edges: the two edges to node2? then only the edge to node1 remains? \n                Then on day1: block one edge to node2 -> Keshi remains.\n                Day2: block another edge to node2 -> Keshi remains.\n                Day3: tell Keshi to move -> he moves to node1.\n                Then from node1: \n                    We have to go to node2? \n                    But the edge from node1 to node2? \n                    AmShZ doesn't block it? \n                    Then on day4: tell Keshi to move -> he moves to node2? \n                    But node2 is not the destination? the destination is node3 (index2)? \n\n            We see: the destination is node3 (index2), not node2 (index1). \n\n            We made a mistake: \n                The cities: \n                    city1: index0\n                    city2: index1\n                    city3: index2\n\n            So the destination is index2.\n\n            The edge from node0 (city1) to node1 (city2) is one edge.\n            The edges from node0 to node2 (city3) are two edges.\n\n            The strategy: \n                We want to go to node2 (city3). \n                We can block the edge to node1? \n                Then on day1: block the edge to node1 -> then Keshi has two edges to node2? \n                Then on day2: tell Keshi to move -> he moves to node2? \n\n            So total days=2.\n\n            Therefore, the answer 2 is correct.\n\n            How did we get 2? \n                candidate = 0 + (3-2) + 1 = 0+1+1=2.\n\n            So the formula works.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: we are updating cost[u] and then pushing. \n\n        However, we must check: what if there is a better candidate already? \n\n        The condition: \n            if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                then update.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: we are updating nadj[u] before the condition? \n\n        The code:\n\n            for u in iadj[v]:\n                nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # update the out-degree of u by removing the edges to v\n                if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                    cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n                    heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        This is the entire block.\n\n        But note: we are updating nadj[u] even if we don't update cost[u]? \n\n        Yes, because we have processed the edges from u to v, so we subtract them from the current out-degree of u.\n\n        This is necessary for future updates.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        However, we must be careful: the condition is already checked, so we only do the update if the condition holds.\n\n        So the code for the TODO block is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        But note: the variable names: we have `v` and `u`? \n\n        Yes.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    We are to determine if a string s is perfectly balanced.\n\n    The provided code:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input()[:-1]\n            a = len(s)\n            b = len(set(s))\n            if b == 1 or a == b:\n                print('YES')\n            else:\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        break\n\n    The idea: \n        If the string has only one distinct character, then it is balanced -> print YES.\n        If the string has length equal to the number of distinct characters (so it has all distinct and no repeats) then it is balanced? \n            But note: the example \"abc\" is balanced? and a=3, b=3 -> so it prints YES.\n\n        But what about \"ab\"? \n            a=2, b=2 -> YES, and it is balanced.\n\n        However, what about \"aba\"? \n            a=3, b=2 -> so it goes to the else.\n\n        Then it loops i from 1 to a-1.\n        It checks if s[i] is in s[:i] (the prefix before i).\n\n        For \"aba\": \n            i=0: not in the loop? \n            i=1: s[1]='b', is 'b' in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='a', is 'a' in s[:2]=\"ab\"? -> yes.\n\n        Then it does:\n            w = (s[:2] * 3)[:3] = (\"ab\"*3)[:3] = \"aba\" -> which equals s, so it prints \"YES\".\n\n        For \"abb\": \n            i=1: s[1]='b' in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='b' in s[:2]=\"ab\"? -> yes.\n            w = (s[:2]*3)[:3] = (\"ab\"*3)[:3] = \"aba\" -> which is not equal to \"abb\", so it goes to the else.\n\n        Then we have a TODO.\n\n        What should we do in the else? \n\n        The known solution for the problem: \n            We note that the condition is violated if there is a substring that has a frequency difference more than 1 for two characters.\n\n        But the known insight: \n            The only perfectly balanced strings are those that are of the form: \n                a string with at most two distinct characters? \n            But the example \"abc\" is balanced.\n\n        Actually, the known solution: \n            The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it is of the form: \n                (a substring of the alphabet in order) repeated? \n\n        But the example: \n            \"aba\": is \"ab\" repeated? \n            \"abc\": is \"abc\" repeated? \n\n        However, the provided code is checking for a period of i? \n\n        The condition: \n            w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]   -> this creates a string of length a by repeating the prefix of length i.\n\n        Then if s equals w, then it is periodic with period i? \n\n        And then it prints YES.\n\n        But what if it is not periodic? \n\n        The known solution from the note: \n            The condition is violated if there is a substring of length 2 that has two of the same character? \n            But \"aba\" has \"a\" and then \"ba\", and then \"aba\", and \"b\", and \"ba\", and \"a\" -> but it is balanced.\n\n        Actually, the condition is violated if there is a substring that has two of the same character consecutively? \n            For \"abb\", we have \"bb\", which has two 'b's -> the frequency of 'b' is 2 and 'a' is 0 -> difference 2.\n\n        Therefore, we can check: \n            if there is any substring of the form \"xx\" (two consecutive same characters) or \"x...x\" (with more than one x) then it is not balanced? \n            But note: the condition requires that for every substring and every two characters, the difference is at most 1.\n\n        The known necessary and sufficient condition: \n            The string is perfectly balanced if and only if it does not contain any substring of the form \"aa\", \"aba\", or more generally, any substring that is not a subsequence of a string of the form (abc...k) repeated? \n\n        Actually, after reading known submissions for the problem (CodeForces 1675D), we find:\n\n            The solution: \n                for each test case:\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    n = len(s)\n                    # Check for every triplet of consecutive characters?\n                    # But the note: the total length over test cases <= 200000.\n\n            The known solution: \n                We only need to check all substrings of length up to the size of the alphabet? \n\n            But the problem: the total length is 200000, but the alphabet is 26.\n\n            The known solution: \n                for each character c, we record the positions.\n                then for each character c, we check the gaps between consecutive occurrences? \n                but that is for a different problem.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            The condition is violated if there exists a substring of length 2 that has two of the same character? \n            because in that substring, the frequency of that character is 2 and the frequency of any other character is 0 -> difference 2.\n\n        Therefore, we can check for any consecutive same characters? \n\n        But what about non consecutive? \n            Example: \"abacaba\" -> has \"a\" at the beginning and then at the end? but the substring \"abacaba\" has 4 a's, 2 b's, 1 c -> difference 3? \n            But the condition: for every substring and every two characters? \n            In the substring \"abacaba\", the difference between 'a' and 'b' is 2? -> so it is not balanced.\n\n        However, the example: \n            Input: \"abacaba\" \n            Output: \n                According to the problem: \n                    The third test case: \"abc\" is balanced, but \"abacaba\" is not? \n\n            But the problem note: \n                Example: \"abc\" is balanced.\n\n            So \"abacaba\" should be \"NO\".\n\n        How to check? \n\n        The known solution from known submissions:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                # Check for duplicate characters in a window of size 2? \n                # But also for larger windows? \n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n                #   Let last_occurrence = {}\n                #   for i, c in enumerate(s):\n                #       if c in last_occurrence and last_occurrence[c] >= i-1: \n                #           # then between last_occurrence[c] and i, there is no other c? and the substring s[last_occurrence[c]:i+1] has two c's and the other characters in between? \n                #           # but the substring from last_occurrence[c] to i has at least two c's and the other characters appear at most once? \n                #           # then the difference between c and any other character in that substring is at least 1? -> but that is allowed? \n                #   This is not sufficient.\n\n            Another known solution:\n\n                We can check: \n                    for length in range(2, min(26, n)+1): \n                        for start in range(0, n-length+1):\n                            substring = s[start:start+length]\n                            # then check for every pair of characters in the substring? \n                            # but the total length over test cases is 200000, but the length of the substring is at most 26, and the number of start positions is n, so total about 200000*25 = 5e6, which is acceptable? \n                But the total length of all test cases is 200000, but the number of test cases t can be up to 20000? and the sum of |s| is 200000, so t is at most 200000? but the sum of |s| is 200000, so t is at most 200000? but the constraint says the sum of |s| over test cases <= 200000.\n\n                Then we can do:\n\n                    for each test case:\n                        s = given\n                        n = len(s)\n                        distinct = set(s)\n                        if len(distinct)==1:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                            continue\n                        if len(distinct)==n:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                            continue\n                        # Now, we want to check for every substring of length up to len(distinct)+1? \n                        # But the condition: if there is a substring that has a character repeated and another character missing, then the difference is at least 2? \n                        # Actually, the minimal violation is a substring of length 2 with two same characters.\n\n                    Therefore, we can simply check: \n                        for i in range(1, n):\n                            if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                                print(\"NO\")\n                                break\n                        else:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n\n                But wait: the string \"aab\" has \"aa\", so it is not balanced -> NO, which is correct.\n\n                But what about \"aba\"? \n                    'a' and 'b' -> not equal, then 'b' and 'a' -> not equal -> then it would print YES? \n\n                And \"abc\": \n                    'a' and 'b' -> not equal, 'b' and 'c' -> not equal -> YES.\n\n                And \"abacaba\": \n                    'a' and 'b' -> not equal, 'b' and 'a' -> not equal, 'a' and 'c' -> not equal, 'c' and 'a' -> not equal, 'a' and 'b' -> not equal, 'b' and 'a' -> not equal -> YES? \n                    But we know it should be NO.\n\n                Why is \"abacaba\" not balanced? \n                    Consider the substring \"abacaba\": \n                        frequency of 'a': 4, 'b':2, 'c':1.\n                    Then the difference between 'a' and 'b' is 2 -> not allowed.\n\n                Therefore, checking only consecutive duplicates is not sufficient.\n\n        The known solution in the provided code has a different approach: \n            It tries to find a period? \n\n        Insight from the provided code: \n            It breaks at the first i (>=1) such that s[i] is in s[:i]. \n            Then it forms a string w by repeating the prefix of length i to the length of s.\n            If s equals w, then it prints YES, else it goes to the else.\n\n        What to do in the else? \n\n        The known solution from known submissions for the problem \"Perfectly Balanced\" (CodeForces) is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                if len(set(s)) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                flag = True\n                for i in range(1, 27):\n                    if i > n: break\n                    base = s[:i]\n                    # Check if s is a repetition of base?\n                    # But the known solution: \n                    #   for j in range(n):\n                    #       if s[j] != base[j%i]:\n                    #           flag = False\n                    #           break\n                    #   if not flag: break\n                if flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        But this is not efficient? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if s in (base * (n//i+1))[:n]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But the provided code already does that? \n\n        Then in the else, we should print \"NO\" and break out of the for loop? \n\n        But note: the for loop breaks after the first i where s[i] in s[:i]. \n\n        What if there is no such i? then the for loop finishes without breaking? \n\n        The provided code does not handle that? \n\n        But the condition: if the string has all distinct characters, then we never enter the else? because we did:\n\n            if b==1 or a==b: print('YES')\n\n        So the for loop in the else is only for strings that have at least one repeat and are not of distinct characters.\n\n        And in the for loop, we break at the first i where s[i] in s[:i]. \n\n        Then we do the periodic check. \n\n        If it is periodic, we print \"YES\", else we print \"NO\".\n\n        But is that sufficient? \n\n        Let's test with \"abacaba\": \n            distinct: 3, length 7 -> not distinct and not single char -> goes to else.\n            i=1: s[1]='b' in s[:1]=\"a\"? -> no.\n            i=2: s[2]='a' in s[:2]=\"ab\"? -> yes.\n            base = s[:2] = \"ab\"\n            w = (\"ab\" repeated to length 7) = \"abababa\"\n            s = \"abacaba\" -> not equal -> so we go to the else.\n\n        Then we must print \"NO\".\n\n        So in the else block, we print \"NO\" and break.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\n        But note: we are in a for loop. After printing \"NO\", we break out of the for loop.\n\n        What if there is a later i that might yield a periodic string? \n\n        The problem: the first time we see a repeated character (at position i) we do the periodic check. If it fails, we output \"NO\" and break.\n\n        Is it possible that a later i might yield a periodic string? \n\n        Example: \"abcabc\" -> \n            distinct: 3, length 6 -> else.\n            i=1: 'b' in \"a\"? no.\n            i=2: 'c' in \"ab\"? no.\n            i=3: 'a' in \"abc\"? yes.\n            base = \"abc\"\n            w = (\"abc\" repeated to 6) = \"abcabc\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\".\n\n        But what about \"abacaba\": \n            i=2: we break and do the periodic check and it fails -> we print \"NO\".\n\n        What about a string like \"aabc\": \n            distinct: 3, length 4 -> else.\n            i=1: s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\" -> yes.\n            base = \"a\"\n            w = \"a\"*4 = \"aaaa\" -> not equal to \"aabc\" -> print \"NO\".\n\n        But is \"aabc\" balanced? \n            substring \"aa\": has two 'a's -> not balanced -> NO is correct.\n\n        What about \"aab\": \n            i=1: s[1]='a' in \"a\" -> yes.\n            base=\"a\", w=\"a\"*3=\"aaa\" != \"aab\" -> print \"NO\".\n\n        What about \"abba\": \n            i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n            i=2: 'b' in \"ab\" -> yes.\n            base=\"ab\", w=\"abab\" -> \"abab\" != \"abba\" -> print \"NO\".\n\n        What about \"abcba\": \n            i=1: 'b' in \"a\" -> no.\n            i=2: 'c' in \"ab\" -> no.\n            i=3: 'b' in \"abc\" -> yes.\n            base=\"abc\", w=\"abcabc\"[:5] = \"abcab\" -> not equal to \"abcba\" -> print \"NO\".\n\n        But is \"abcba\" balanced? \n            substring \"bcb\": \n                frequency: b:2, c:1 -> difference between b and c is 1 -> allowed.\n            substring \"ab\": \n                a:1, b:1 -> allowed.\n            substring \"abc\": \n                a:1, b:1, c:1 -> allowed.\n            substring \"abcb\": \n                a:1, b:2, c:1 -> difference between b and a is 1, b and c is 1 -> allowed.\n            substring \"bcba\": \n                b:2, c:1, a:1 -> allowed.\n            substring \"abcba\": \n                a:2, b:2, c:1 -> difference between a and c is 1, b and c is 1, a and b is 0 -> allowed.\n\n            But wait: the condition: for every substring and every two characters? \n                In \"abcba\", the substring \"bcb\" is allowed? \n                But the condition: the difference between the frequencies of any two characters in the substring is at most 1? \n                Here, for 'b' and 'a': in the substring \"bcb\", there is no 'a', so the frequency of 'a' is 0, and the frequency of 'b' is 2 -> difference 2? \n\n            Therefore, the substring \"bcb\" violates the condition? \n\n            So \"abcba\" is not balanced -> NO is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the approach of checking the first occurrence of a repeated character and then checking if the entire string is periodic with the prefix up to that point is sufficient? \n\n        But consider \"abcdab\": \n            distinct: 4, length 6 -> else.\n            i=4: s[4]='a' in s[:4]=\"abcd\" -> yes.\n            base = \"abcd\"\n            w = \"abcdabcd\"[:6] = \"abcdab\" -> equals s -> print \"YES\".\n\n        Is \"abcdab\" balanced? \n            It is periodic with period 4: \"abcdab\" = \"abcd\" then \"ab\".\n            We need to check: \n                substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"abcd\": a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"bcda\": b:1, c:1, d:1, a:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"cdab\": c:1, d:1, a:1, b:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"da\": d:1, a:1 -> ok.\n                substring \"abcdab\": \n                    a:2, b:2, c:1, d:1 -> \n                    difference between a and c: 1 -> ok.\n                substring \"bcd\": b:1, c:1, d:1 -> ok.\n\n            But what about the substring \"a\" and \"b\", etc. -> all single characters are ok.\n\n            However, what about the substring \"aa\"? \n                There is no \"aa\" in the string.\n\n            But wait: the substring \"a\" appears at index0 and index4? but they are not consecutive? \n\n            The condition: the difference between the frequencies of any two characters in the substring must be at most 1.\n\n            In the substring \"abcdab\", the entire string: \n                a:2, b:2, c:1, d:1 -> the difference between a and c is 1 -> allowed.\n\n            But the condition must hold for every substring? \n\n            Consider the substring \"a\" (at index0) and the substring \"a\" (at index4) are not in the same substring? \n\n            The condition is per substring.\n\n            Therefore, \"abcdab\" is balanced? \n\n            But the known solution says YES.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\n        But note: we are in a for loop. We break after printing \"NO\".\n\n        What if we don't break? then the for loop would continue? \n\n        But the problem: we only want to print one answer per test case.\n\n        And the structure: \n            for i in range(1, a):\n                if ...:\n                    ... \n                    break   # breaks the for loop\n\n        So if we break, we break the for loop and move to the next test case.\n\n        If we don't break, then after the for loop, we haven't printed anything? \n\n        The provided code does not have an else for the for loop? \n\n        So if we do not break in the for loop, then after the for loop, we have to print something? \n\n        But the condition: we break at the first i where s[i] in s[:i]. \n\n        What if we never find such i? then the for loop completes without breaking? \n\n        But we already handled the case of distinct characters? \n\n        Actually, the else branch is only taken when the string is not of distinct characters and not single character. \n\n        And in the for loop, we are looking for the first i such that s[i] is in s[:i]. \n\n        Since the string is not of distinct characters, there must be a repeated character. But the repeated character might appear at an index i, and then we break.\n\n        However, it is guaranteed that we will find one? \n\n        Example: \"abcde\": \n            distinct, so we don't enter the else.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\": \n            we enter the else, and at i=1 we find s[1]='a' in s[:1]=\"a\", so we break.\n\n        Example: \"abac\": \n            at i=2: s[2]='a' in s[:2]=\"ab\" -> no, then at i=3: s[3]='c' in s[:3]=\"aba\" -> yes.\n\n        But what if the repeated character is not in the prefix? \n            Example: \"abcdb\": \n                i=1: 'b' in \"a\"? no.\n                i=2: 'c' in \"ab\"? no.\n                i=3: 'd' in \"abc\"? no.\n                i=4: 'b' in \"abcd\"? yes.\n\n            Then we do the periodic check: base = \"abcd\", w = \"abcdabcd\"[:5] = \"abcdb\" -> which equals s? \n                \"abcdb\" vs \"abcdb\": equal? \n                But wait: s is \"abcdb\", and w is (\"abcd\" repeated to 5) = \"abcda\"[:5] -> no, wait:\n\n                (\"abcd\" * 2) = \"abcdabcd\", then take 5: \"abcdb\"? -> no, it's \"abcda\" for the first 5? \n\n            How do we form w? \n                w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]   # a is the length of s.\n\n            Here, i=4, a=5, s[:4]=\"abcd\", then \"abcd\"*5 = \"abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd\", then take 5: \"abcda\" -> which is not \"abcdb\".\n\n            So we go to the else.\n\n            Then we print \"NO\" and break.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the else block is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n        So for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n        For program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\n        However, in program2.py, the break is necessary to break the for loop and avoid multiple prints.\n\n        But what if we don't break? then we would continue the for loop? and we might print multiple times? \n\n        We break to exit the for loop and the test case.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the indentation. In program1.py, the TODO is inside the if condition and inside the for loop. The existing code has:\n\n                if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are to replace the TODO with two lines.\n\n        In program2.py, the TODO is in the else block of the if s==w, and we are to replace the TODO with two lines.\n\n        We must preserve the indentation.\n\n        For program1.py, the existing code has 8 or 12 spaces? \n\n            while q:\n                d,v=heapq.heappop(q)\n                if visit[v]:\n                    continue\n                visit[v]=1\n                for u in iadj[v]:\n                    nadj[u]-=iadj[v][u]\n                    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The TODO is at an indentation level of 8 (or 12) from the while? \n\n            We are to write two lines at the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py:\n\n                for i in range(1, a):\n                    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n                        w = (s[:i]*a)[:a]\n                        if s == w:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The TODO is at an indentation level of 8 (from the for) and 12 (from the if) and 16 (from the else).\n\n        We write:\n\n            for program1: \n                cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\n            for program2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n        But note: in program2, we break to break the for loop.\n\n        However, the for loop is the one that is iterating i from 1 to a-1. We break that for loop.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Let's write the JSON.\n\n        Important: we must escape the quotes? \n\n        We are to output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n                \"program2\": \"            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But the indentation: in program1, the TODO is at the same level as the if condition? \n\n        The existing code in program1 for the if block is at 12 spaces? \n\n            for u in iadj[v]:\n                nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]   # 8 spaces for the for, then 12 for the body\n                if ...:   # 12 spaces\n                    ...   # 16 spaces for the TODO\n\n        So we should write:\n\n            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1   # at 16 spaces\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))    # at 16 spaces\n\n        Similarly, in program2:\n\n            for i in range(1, a):   # 8 spaces\n                if s[i] in s[:i]:   # 12 spaces\n                    w = ...   # 16 spaces\n                    if s == w:   # 16 spaces\n                        print ...   # 20 spaces\n                    else:   # 16 spaces\n                        ...   # 20 spaces for the TODO\n\n        So we write:\n\n            print(\"NO\")   # 20 spaces\n            break         # 20 spaces\n\n        But note: the break is to break the for loop? so it should be at the same level as the for? \n\n        However, we are in the else block of the if (s==w). \n\n        We want to break the for loop? \n\n        The break will break the innermost loop, which is the for loop.\n\n        But we are inside the for loop? \n\n        Yes, so break will break the for loop.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\\n            heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n                \"program2\": \"            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            break\"\n            }\n\n        But wait: in program1, the two lines should be at the same indentation level as the TODO, which is 16 spaces? \n\n        The existing code has 12 spaces for the if condition? \n\n        Actually, the code for program1:\n\n            for u in iadj[v]:\n                nadj[u]-=iadj[v][u]   # 8 spaces for the for, then 12 for the body? \n                if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:   # 12 spaces\n                    ...   # 16 spaces for the TODO\n\n        So we write two lines at 16 spaces.\n\n        Similarly, in program2:\n\n            else:   # 16 spaces\n                ...   # 20 spaces for the TODO\n\n        So we write two lines at 20 spaces.\n\n        But the problem: the existing code in the problem statement uses spaces? \n\n        We'll assume 4 spaces per level.\n\n        For program1, the block is at 16 spaces (4 levels) and for program2, the block is at 20 spaces (5 levels).\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"                cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n            \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n\n        But note: the program1 code has:\n\n            while q:\n                ...   # 4 spaces\n                for u in iadj[v]:   # 8 spaces\n                    ...   # 12 spaces\n                    if ...:   # 12 spaces\n                        ...   # 16 spaces\n\n        So 16 spaces: 4*4.\n\n        Similarly, program2:\n\n            for _ in range(n):   # 4 spaces\n                ...   # 4 spaces\n                for i in range(1, a):   # 8 spaces\n                    if ...:   # 12 spaces\n                        ...   # 16 spaces\n                        if ...:   # 16 spaces\n                            ...   # 20 spaces\n                        else:   # 16 spaces\n                            ...   # 20 spaces\n\n        So 20 spaces: 5*4.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"                cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\\n                heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\",\n                \"program2\": \"                print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 code has a break at the same level as the print? \n\n        Yes.\n\n        Let me write the exact string for program1: \n            Line1: 16 spaces + \"cost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\"\n            Line2: 16 spaces + \"heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\"\n\n        For program2:\n            Line1: 20 spaces + \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n            Line2: 20 spaces + \"break\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines for each.\n\n        However, the program2 code has a break that breaks the for loop? and then we are done for that test case.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
