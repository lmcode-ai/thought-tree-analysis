However, there is a logical error: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is equivalent to (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x). This is correct. But what if the old state was different, but the new state becomes different in a different way? We don't need to do anything. So the code for the right pair should be:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] and x != a[ix+1]:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] and x == a[ix+1]:\n                    c -= w[ix]\n\n        However, the provided code uses:\n\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] ! = x: \n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] ! = a[ix+1] == x: \n                c -= w[ix]\n\n        This is equivalent because:\n            a[ix] == a[ix+1] ! = x   -> same as (a[ix] == a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] ! = x) -> and note that if a[ix] == a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] ! = x, then the new value x is different from a[ix+1] (which is the same as the old a[ix]? but note: we are updating a[ix] to x, so the new pair is (x, a[ix+1]) and since a[ix+1] ! = x, they become different. Similarly, the second condition: a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x -> same as (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x). Then the new pair is (x, a[ix+1]) = (x, x) -> becomes equal. So the conditions are correct.",

But we saw that a segment of length 1 is impossible. Therefore, the solution is to split by white and check each contiguous non-white segment: \n                - If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n                - If the segment has at least one R and at least one B -> valid; otherwise invalid. But note: a segment of length 2: \n                \"RR\" -> invalid (because no B) -> NO.\n                \"RB\" -> valid -> YES. A segment of length 3: \n                \"RRR\" -> invalid -> NO. \"RBR\" -> valid -> YES. So the code for program2.py:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts: if part == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(part) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                        elif 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            However, note: the condition for a segment of length 1 is already covered by the condition: \n                if the segment has no R or no B -> then invalid. But a segment of length 1: \n                    if it is \"R\", then it has no B -> invalid. if it is \"B\", then it has no R -> invalid. So we can simply do:\n\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part != '' and (part.count('R') == 0 or part.count('B') == 0):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n\n            However, what if the segment is of length 1? Then it will have either R or B, so one of the counts is 0 -> invalid. But what if the segment is of length 0? we skip.",

And we are reading with [*open(0)] and then taking [2::2] -> the even-indexed lines starting at index2. But note: the first line is index0, then the next two lines (for the first test case) are index1 (n1) and index2 (s1). Then the next test case: index3 (n2) and index4 (s2). So the list [*open(0)] has:\n\n            index0: t (as a string)\n            index1: n1 (as a string)\n            index2:",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges: one involving dynamic updates to an array and calculating the sum of awesomeness over all subsegments after each update, and the other determining if a given pattern can be formed using a stamp that colors adjacent cells in specific ways.\n\n### Approach for Program1\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial array is processed to compute the contribution of each adjacent pair to the total awesomeness. The awesomeness of a subarray is defined as the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n2. **Handling Queries**: For each query that updates an element in the array, we adjust the contributions of the adjacent pairs affected by the update. Specifically:\n   - If an update changes an adjacent pair from equal to different, we add the contribution of that pair.\n   - If an update changes an adjacent pair from different to equal, we subtract the contribution of that pair.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles each query in constant time by precomputing the contributions of adjacent pairs and updating only the affected pairs during each query.\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n}\n```\n\n### Approach for Program2\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to determine if a given string (composed of 'R', 'B', and 'W') can be formed by stamping adjacent cells with either 'RB' or 'BR'. The stamping operations can be applied multiple times to the same cells.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves splitting the string into segments separated by 'W' (white cells). Each segment must:\n   - Be non-empty and contain at least one 'R' and one 'B'. Segments of length 1 or segments with only one color are invalid.\n3. **Validation**: For each test case, the string is split into segments by 'W'. Each segment is checked to ensure it meets the validity criteria. If any segment fails, the entire pattern is deemed invalid.\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\n```json\n{\n  \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The solution efficiently tracks the changes in adjacent pairs when an element is updated. The variable `c` maintains the sum of contributions from all adjacent pairs that are different. For each query, it checks the left and right adjacent pairs of the updated element and adjusts `c` accordingly. The total awesomeness is then computed as `c` plus the base value (the number of subarrays).\n- **Program2**: The solution checks each contiguous segment of non-white characters. If any segment is either of length 1 or lacks one of the colors 'R' or 'B', the pattern is impossible to achieve. The solution processes each test case by splitting the string into segments and validating each segment, ensuring optimal performance with linear time complexity per test case.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array `a` of length `n` and `m` queries. Each query updates an element and then we must output the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,1,1] has awesomeness 1, [1,2] has 2, [1,2,2] has 2.\n\nThe total we are to compute is the sum of awesomeness for every contiguous subarray.\n\nNote: The provided code already has a partial solution. We are to complete the missing part.\n\nInsight:\nThe total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be computed by considering the contribution of each adjacent pair.\n\nConsider that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus 1 for every index i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1]. Therefore, the awesomeness for [l, r] is: 1 + (number of indices i in [l, r-1] where a[i] != a[i+1]).\n\nThen the total sum is:\n  Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1])]\n\nThe first part is the number of contiguous subarrays, which is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThe second part: for a fixed adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different (i.e., a[i]!=a[i+1]), how many contiguous subarrays [l, r] include this adjacent pair? \n- The adjacent pair (i, i+1) is included in a subarray [l, r] if and only if l <= i and r >= i+1.\n- The number of choices for l is i (from 1 to i) and the number of choices for r is (n - i) (from i+1 to n). So the contribution of a difference at position i is i * (n - i) [if we use 0-indexing, then the adjacent pair at index i (between a[i] and a[i+1]) would be included for l in [0, i] and r in [i+1, n-1] -> (i+1) * (n-i-1)].\n\nBut note: in the provided code, they have defined:\n   w = [(i+1)*(n-i-1) for i in range(n-1)]\n\nSo w[i] is the contribution of the adjacent pair (i, i+1) if they are different.\n\nTherefore, the total awesomeness is:\n   base = n*(n+1)//2   [because every subarray has at least 1 block] \n   plus the contributions from adjacent differences: for each adjacent pair i (0-indexed) that is different, we add w[i] (which is (i+1)*(n-i-1)).\n\nSo the initial total is: base + (sum of w[i] for every i where a[i]!=a[i+1])\n\nThen, when updating an element at index `ix`, we must consider the adjacent pairs that change: (ix-1, ix) and (ix, ix+1). \n\nThe provided code does:\n   c = sum([w[i] if a[i+1] != a[i] else 0 for i in range(n-1)])\n\nAnd then for each query, it updates the array and adjusts c accordingly.\n\nIn the loop for a query:\n   We are updating a[ix] to x.\n\n   The adjacent pairs that might change are:\n        left pair: (ix-1, ix)   -> if ix != 0\n        right pair: (ix, ix+1)   -> if ix != n-1\n\n   For the left pair (ix-1, ix):\n        Before update: \n            if a[ix-1] == a[ix] -> then this pair was not contributing (so we didn't add w[ix-1] to c)\n            if they were different, then we did add w[ix-1] to c.\n\n        After update:\n            if a[ix-1] (which is unchanged) and the new x are equal, then we should remove the contribution if it was there? \n            But note: if they become equal, then we lose the contribution that we might have had.\n\n        The code checks:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix-1] and now they become different? Actually, the condition is:\n\n            Condition 1: if currently (before update) they are equal and after update they become different? \n                But note: the condition in the code is: \n                    if a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x: \n                This means: before update, a[ix] was equal to a[ix-1] and the new value x is different from a[ix-1] (so the pair becomes different). \n                Then we add w[ix-1] to c.\n\n            Condition 2: if before update they were different and after update they become equal? \n                The code: \n                    elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] and now they become equal (i.e., x equals a[ix-1])? \n                The condition: \n                    elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x: \n                This means: before update, a[ix] != a[ix-1] and the new value x is equal to a[ix-1] -> so the pair becomes equal. Then we subtract w[ix-1] from c.\n\n   Similarly, for the right pair (ix, ix+1):\n        The code has started an if block for the right pair (if ix != n-1) and has two conditions for when the pair becomes different and when it becomes equal.\n\n        But note: the condition for the right pair is symmetric. However, the provided code has a TODO for the right pair.\n\n        We see that the condition for the left pair was:\n            if a[ix] == a[ix-1] != x:   -> becomes different: add w[ix-1]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix-1] == x: -> becomes equal: subtract w[ix-1]\n\n        For the right pair, we must do the same but for the pair (ix, ix+1). \n\n        Condition 1: if currently (before update) a[ix] == a[ix+1] and after update the new value x is different from a[ix+1]? \n            Then we must add w[ix] (because the pair becomes different).\n\n        Condition 2: if currently a[ix] != a[ix+1] and after update the new value x is equal to a[ix+1]? \n            Then we must subtract w[ix] (because the pair becomes equal).\n\n        However, note: the condition in the code for the left pair used the old value of a[ix] and the new value x. \n\n        But wait: the code for the right pair is written as:\n\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                c -= w[ix]\n\n        However, note the condition for the second case: \n            \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" \n            This condition is equivalent to: \n                (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x)\n\n            But note: after update, the element at ix becomes x. So the new pair (ix, ix+1) will be (x, a[ix+1]). \n            Since a[ix+1] == x, then the new pair is equal. So we subtract the contribution.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the adjacent pair was different because a[ix] was not equal to a[ix+1], but after update we set a[ix] to x, and x might be equal to a[ix+1]? \n        The condition above checks exactly that: if the old state was different and the new state becomes equal (because x equals a[ix+1]), then we subtract.\n\n        But note: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is not the only way the pair can become equal. What if the old state was different, and the new value x is equal to a[ix+1]? \n        That condition is exactly what we need.\n\n        However, there is a logical error: the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is equivalent to (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x). \n        This is correct.\n\n        But what if the old state was different, but the new state becomes different in a different way? We don't need to do anything.\n\n        So the code for the right pair should be:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] and x != a[ix+1]:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] and x == a[ix+1]:\n                    c -= w[ix]\n\n        However, the provided code uses:\n\n            if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x: \n                c += w[ix]\n            elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x: \n                c -= w[ix]\n\n        This is equivalent because:\n            a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x   -> same as (a[ix] == a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] != x) -> and note that if a[ix] == a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] != x, then the new value x is different from a[ix+1] (which is the same as the old a[ix]? but note: we are updating a[ix] to x, so the new pair is (x, a[ix+1]) and since a[ix+1] != x, they become different.\n\n        Similarly, the second condition: a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x -> same as (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x). Then the new pair is (x, a[ix+1]) = (x, x) -> becomes equal.\n\n        So the conditions are correct.\n\n        However, the provided code for the right pair is incomplete: it has a TODO and only the first condition is written. We must complete the second condition.\n\n        But note: the code already has:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must complete the TODO: we need to subtract w[ix] in that case.\n\n        However, the code after the TODO is missing. We should write: c -= w[ix]\n\n        But wait: the code already has the condition and then a comment. We must replace the TODO line with the subtraction.\n\n        Also note: after updating the adjacent pairs, we update the array: a[ix] = x.\n\n        And then we output: c + (n*(n+1))//2\n\n        So the missing part for program1.py is to complete the right pair condition.\n\n        Specifically, we need to write:\n\n            c -= w[ix]\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition is written as an `elif` and we are in the block for the right pair.\n\n        So the code for the right pair should be:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] and a[ix+1] == x:   # but note: the condition is written as \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\", which is the same as (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x)\n                    c -= w[ix]\n\n        But the condition is already written as `elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:`, so we just need to put the subtraction.\n\n        Therefore, in the TODO part, we write: c -= w[ix]\n\n        However, note: the condition might be misinterpreted by the parser? Actually, the condition \"a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x\" is valid in Python: it means (a[ix] != a[ix+1]) and (a[ix+1] == x). \n\n        So we complete the TODO by replacing the comment with: c -= w[ix]\n\n        But note: the code already has the condition and then a comment. We are to output only the missing code for the TODO.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program1.py, we are to output the line that goes in the TODO.\n\n        But note: the entire program1.py is provided and we are to fill in the missing part. The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and then in the format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        We are to output the missing code for program1.py as a string. Since the TODO is in the middle of an elif block, we must output the line that completes that block.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"            c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        However, note that the code has an indentation of 8 spaces at that point? Actually, the code we see:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at the same indentation level as the previous condition's body (which is 12 spaces: 4 for the outer if, 4 for the inner if, and then 4 for the body). Actually, the code we are given has:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must replace the TODO line with a line that subtracts. The indentation for the body of the elif should be 12 spaces? Actually, the code uses 4-space indentation. The structure:\n\n            if ...:\n                if ...:\n                    ...   # 8 spaces\n                elif ...:\n                    ...   # 8 spaces\n\n        So the missing line should be at 8 spaces of indentation? Actually, the TODO comment is at the same level as the previous c+=, so 8 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the missing line is: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        But wait: the code we are given in the problem has:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the condition above. We need to replace the TODO line with a line that does the subtraction. The line should be:\n\n                    c -= w[ix]\n\n        So the string for program1 is: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that should be inserted. The existing code has 8 spaces at the beginning of the line for the body of the elif. We are replacing the comment with a statement.\n\n        But wait: the existing code has 4 spaces for the outer if, then 4 more for the inner if and elif, and then 8 for the body? Actually, the code we are given in the problem has:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO line is at 8 spaces. So we write:\n\n            \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the line that is missing.\n\n        However, what if the TODO block is more than one line? Here it's one line.\n\n        But note: the code after the TODO might have the update of the array and the output. We are only replacing the TODO line.\n\n        So for program1, the missing code is: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        But wait: the code we are given for program1.py has:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            a[ix] = x\n\n        We are replacing the TODO line with \"c -= w[ix]\". So the code becomes:\n\n            if ix != n-1:\n                if a[ix] == a[ix+1] != x:\n                    c += w[ix]\n                elif a[ix] != a[ix+1] == x:\n                    c -= w[ix]\n\n        This is correct.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B').\n\nWe must determine if it is possible to obtain the string s by starting with all whites and applying the stamp any number of times. The stamp covers two adjacent cells and colors them as either (B,R) or (R,B). The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n\nImportant: the stamp must always cover two adjacent cells (so it cannot be applied to a single cell). Also, note that the stamp can be applied to the same cell multiple times, which may change its color multiple times.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. The entire process must be done on contiguous cells? Actually, the stamp is applied to two adjacent cells. So the operations are on adjacent pairs.\n\n2. Note that the stamping operation is reversible? Actually, we are building the picture from white. Alternatively, we can think of \"cleaning\" the picture to all white by reversing the operations.\n\nHowever, a known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n   - The entire string must not be all white? Actually, all white is achievable (by zero operations) so that is valid.\n\n   - The key idea: \n        * The operation always stamps two adjacent cells: one red and one blue. Therefore, the number of red and blue cells must be balanced in some way? \n\n        But note: we can stamp the same cell multiple times. Each stamping operation flips the color of a cell in a specific way? Actually, each operation adds one red and one blue. However, if a cell is stamped multiple times, then:\n\n            - If stamped an odd number of times, the cell will be the opposite of white? Actually, white is the starting color. Each stamp on a cell changes its color: \n                W -> R (if stamped as the red part) or W -> B (if stamped as the blue part). \n            - But then if stamped again, it can change: \n                R stamped again: \n                    If the stamp is applied to this cell and the next, and this cell is stamped as blue? Then R becomes B? \n                    Or if the stamp is applied to the previous and this, and this cell is stamped as blue? Then R becomes B.\n\n            Actually, the stamp always sets the two cells to R and B (or B and R). So if a cell is stamped k times, then its color is determined by the parity of the number of times it is assigned red and blue.\n\n            However, note: the stamping operation does not necessarily assign the same role to the cell every time. We can choose the orientation arbitrarily. So for a given cell, we can choose to assign it red in some operations and blue in others.\n\n            Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the net effect: \n                Let r_i be the number of times the cell i is assigned red, and b_i the number of times it is assigned blue. Then the final color is:\n                    If (r_i + b_i) is even, then the cell would be white? Because starting from white, each pair (r and b) would cancel? Actually, no: each stamping operation that involves the cell assigns either red or blue. But note: the operations are not independent per cell.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We note:\n\n          - The operation is linear? Actually, we can model the colors modulo 2? \n\n          Let:\n            Let x_i be the number of times the stamp is applied with the left part being the red one and covering (i, i+1). \n            Let y_i be the number of times the stamp is applied with the left part being the blue one and covering (i, i+1). But note: we can also consider the same stamp as having two orientations.\n\n          Actually, we can define:\n\n            For each adjacent pair (i, i+1), we can apply the stamp in two ways:\n                Way1: color i as R and i+1 as B.\n                Way2: color i as B and i+1 as R.\n\n          Let a_i be the net number of times the stamp is applied at position i (meaning the stamp covering (i-1, i) or (i, i+1))? Actually, each stamp covers two consecutive cells.\n\n          We can model the entire coloring as a system of equations:\n\n            For cell i, it is covered by:\n                - The stamp on (i-1, i): if applied as (i-1, i) then it can be either:\n                    if the stamp at (i-1, i) is applied as (R, B): then cell i gets B.\n                    if the stamp at (i-1, i) is applied as (B, R): then cell i gets R.\n                - The stamp on (i, i+1): similarly.\n\n            So we can define:\n\n                Let f(i) = (number of times the stamp at (i, i+1) is applied as (R,B) minus the number of times as (B,R))? \n                But note: we can also model the two orientations as additive inverses.\n\n          Alternatively, known solution:\n\n          We break the string s by the white cells. Because white cells are never stamped? Actually, white cells can be stamped? But note: if a cell is stamped an even number of times (with the two colors in balance) then it becomes white? \n\n          Actually, the starting color is white. Each stamping operation on a cell flips it: \n              If a cell is stamped once: it becomes either R or B.\n              If stamped again: \n                  if stamped with the same color again, then it becomes white? \n                  but wait: the stamping operation sets the cell to a specific color. It does not additively combine? \n\n          However, the problem states: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So it sets the color. Therefore, the last stamp that covers a cell determines its color? \n\n          But note: the problem says \"The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\" and the example shows multiple stamps.\n\n          Actually, the example: \n              WWWWW -> WW RB W -> then the middle part becomes R and B? Then the next stamp covers the first two: BR RB W -> then the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R? \n\n          How does the second stamp affect the second cell? The second cell was R and then the stamp (on the first two) sets the second cell to R? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to B and R? So the second cell becomes R. \n\n          But then the third stamp: covers the second and third: sets the second to R and the third to B? Then the second cell becomes R again.\n\n          So the operations overwrite the previous color.\n\n          Therefore, the order matters and we cannot simply use linear algebra.\n\n        Known solution from Codeforces (problem \"Stamp\"):\n\n          We can use the following:\n\n          - The entire string must be partitioned into contiguous non-white segments. For each contiguous non-white segment (with no white in between), we can solve independently.\n\n          - Conditions for a contiguous segment (without white) of length L:\n\n              * If L == 1: then we cannot have a non-white segment of length 1. Why? Because the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So we cannot stamp a single cell. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n              * Also, the entire segment must be colorable. But note: the stamping operation always sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. Therefore, the segment must not be all the same color? Actually, no: because we can do multiple stamps. \n\n          However, note:\n\n            Example: \"RR\" -> is it possible?\n                We start with WW. \n                We can stamp the two as RB? Then we get RB. \n                Then we stamp again the same two as BR? Then we get BR? \n                Then we stamp again as RB? Then we get RB? \n\n            How to get RR? \n\n            We cannot get two adjacent reds? Because every stamp that covers two adjacent cells sets one to red and the other to blue. \n\n            Therefore, in a contiguous non-white segment, adjacent cells must be different? \n\n            But wait: what if we stamp overlapping? \n\n            Example for \"RRB\": \n                We have three cells: 0,1,2.\n\n                Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB -> [R, B, W]\n                Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR -> [R, R, R]? \n                    But wait: the stamp (1,2) as BR: sets cell1 to B and cell2 to R? -> [R, B, R] -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n                How to get RRB? \n\n                Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                Step2: stamp (1,2) as RB: [R, R, B] -> this is RRB.\n\n                So we have two adjacent reds? How? \n                    In step2, we stamped (1,2) as RB: meaning cell1 becomes R and cell2 becomes B? \n                    But then cell1 was B and becomes R? \n\n                So we have: \n                    cell0: R (from step1) \n                    cell1: step1 made it B, then step2 made it R -> so R.\n                    cell2: step2 made it B.\n\n                So we have R, R, B.\n\n            Therefore, adjacent cells can be the same? \n\n            However, note: the stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. But if we stamp over a cell multiple times, we can change it arbitrarily. \n\n            The key: the entire segment must have at least one blue and one red? \n\n            Actually, known solution from Codeforces (from similar problems) is:\n\n                - Split the string by 'W'\n                - For each contiguous segment of non-white (only R and B), check:\n                    * The length of the segment must be at least 1? Actually, if the segment is empty, skip.\n                    * If the segment has length 1 -> impossible (return False).\n                    * Also, if the entire segment is of the same color? Then it is impossible? \n\n                But wait: in the example above, we had \"RRB\", which is not all same, and it worked.\n\n                However, what about \"RR\": \n                    We try: \n                        Start: WW\n                        We can stamp (0,1) as RB -> [R, B] -> not RR.\n                        Then stamp (0,1) again as BR -> [B, R] -> not RR.\n                        Then stamp (0,1) again as RB -> [R, B] -> we are looping.\n\n                    How to get RR? \n                        We cannot, because every stamp on (0,1) sets one to R and the other to B (or vice versa). \n\n                Therefore, a segment of two with the same color is impossible? \n\n                But what about three? \n                    \"RRR\": \n                    We can do:\n                        Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                        Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR: [R, R, R] -> wait, step2: stamp (1,2) as BR: \n                            cell1 (currently B) becomes R? and cell2 becomes R? -> no, the stamp sets two adjacent cells: one to B and one to R. \n                            Specifically, BR means: first cell (which is cell1) becomes B? and second (cell2) becomes R? -> then we have [R, B, R] -> not RRR.\n\n                    Alternatively:\n                        Step1: (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                        Step2: (0,1) as BR: [B, R, W]\n                        Step3: (1,2) as RB: [B, R, B] -> not RRR.\n\n                How to get RRR? \n\n                Actually, we cannot have three consecutive reds? \n\n                Why? Consider the parity of the number of stamps covering each cell. \n\n                Let the three cells be a, b, c.\n\n                We can define:\n\n                  a is covered by stamps on (0,1)\n                  b is covered by stamps on (0,1) and (1,2)\n                  c is covered by stamps on (1,2)\n\n                Each stamp on (0,1) assigns either (R,B) or (B,R) to (a,b). Similarly, stamp on (1,2) assigns to (b,c).\n\n                We want a=R, b=R, c=R.\n\n                For a: \n                    The stamp (0,1) must assign R to a. So we choose orientation (R,B) for the first stamp? \n                For c:\n                    The stamp (1,2) must assign R to c? Then we must choose orientation (B,R) for the stamp (1,2) (so that the second cell of the stamp is R).\n\n                Then for b: \n                    From the first stamp: b becomes B (if we choose (R,B) for (0,1))\n                    From the second stamp: b becomes B (if we choose (B,R) for (1,2))? because the stamp (1,2) sets the first cell (which is b) to B.\n\n                Then we get a=R, b=B, c=R -> not RRR.\n\n                Alternatively, if we choose for (0,1): (R,B) -> a=R, b=B.\n                         for (1,2): (R,B) -> then b becomes R and c becomes B -> then a=R, b=R, c=B.\n\n                Then we can do another stamp on (1,2) with (B,R): then b becomes B and c becomes R -> a=R, b=B, c=R.\n\n                Then we can do another stamp on (0,1) with (R,B): then a becomes R, b becomes B -> but then b was R? becomes B -> a=R, b=B, c=R.\n\n                We cannot get three reds.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for a contiguous non-white segment is:\n\n                - The segment must have at least two different colors? Actually, no: we can have two colors but we require that the entire segment is not monochromatic? \n\n                But note: the example \"RRB\" is not monochromatic and it worked.\n\n            Known solution from Codeforces (from the problem \"Stamp\" with the same name) is:\n\n                We split by W. For each segment of non-W:\n\n                    if the segment has length 1: then NO.\n\n                    Also, if the segment has all the same color? then NO. But wait: what if the segment has two colors? \n\n                Actually, we can have a segment that is not monochromatic? \n\n                However, note: we can also have a segment that is monochromatic? We just saw that \"RR\" is impossible and \"RRR\" is impossible.\n\n                Therefore, the condition is: the segment must have at least one red and at least one blue.\n\n            But wait: what about \"RBR\" (which has both colors)? \n\n                Example for \"RBR\" (three cells):\n\n                    We can do:\n                        Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                        Step2: stamp (0,1) as BR: [B, R, W] -> not RBR.\n                        Step3: stamp (1,2) as RB: [B, R, B] -> not RBR.\n\n                How to get RBR?\n\n                    Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                    Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR: [R, R, R]? -> no, that would be [R, (B becomes R?) and then the second cell becomes R and the third becomes R? -> but the stamp (1,2) as BR: sets the first of the two (which is cell1) to B? and the second to R? -> [R, B, R] -> that is RBR.\n\n                So it is possible.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for a contiguous non-white segment is:\n\n                - The segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n            Why? \n\n                Because if the entire segment is only R, then we cannot have any stamping operation that produces an R without also producing a B in the same operation? \n\n            But note: we can cover a cell multiple times. However, the entire segment must have been produced by a sequence of stamps. Each stamp produces one R and one B. Therefore, the total number of R and B in the entire segment must be the same? \n\n            However, the entire segment might be covered by multiple stamps. \n\n            Actually, the entire segment must have an even number of cells? \n\n            But note: the segment \"RRB\" has 3 cells -> odd. And it worked.\n\n            The counts: \n                R: 2, B: 1 -> not equal.\n\n            Therefore, the counts of R and B do not have to be equal.\n\n            The known solution from Codeforces (problem B. Stamp) in the contest 767 (Div2) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part == '':\n                            continue\n                        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            But wait: what about the example: \n                s = \"R\" -> split by W: ['R'] -> then we see that 'R' has no 'B' -> invalid -> NO -> which is correct.\n\n                s = \"RRB\" -> split: ['RRB'] -> has 'R' and 'B' -> valid -> YES.\n\n                s = \"RR\" -> split: ['RR'] -> has no 'B' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            However, what about a segment that is \"RB\" -> valid -> YES.\n\n            But what about a segment that is \"RBRB\" -> valid.\n\n            However, what about a segment that is \"R\" and then a white and then \"B\"? \n                s = \"RWB\" -> split: ['R', '', 'B'] -> \n                    'R' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            But wait: the entire picture is \"RWB\". \n                We can do:\n                    Step1: stamp (1,2) -> but wait, the white in the middle? \n\n                Actually, the segment \"R\" is isolated by white. We cannot connect the R and the B because of the white in the middle. \n\n                How to make \"RWB\":\n                    We start: WWW.\n                    We can stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W] -> then we have R, B, W -> not RWB.\n                    We can stamp (1,2) as RB: [W, R, B] -> that is R at index1 and B at index2 -> then the picture is \"WRB\", not \"RWB\".\n\n                How to get R at index0 and B at index2? \n                    We cannot stamp (0,1) and then (1,2) without affecting the middle? \n\n                    Step1: stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                    Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR: [R, R, R]? -> no, we get [R, (B becomes R) and then the next becomes R? -> [R, R, R] -> not RWB.\n\n                Actually, we cannot change the middle cell without affecting the adjacent ones? \n\n                Therefore, the segment \"R\" (at the beginning) is isolated and has length 1 -> invalid.\n\n            Therefore, the solution is:\n\n                Split the string s by 'W'. For each part (which is a contiguous non-white segment), if the part is non-empty, then we require that the part contains at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n\n            However, note: what if the entire string is non-white? Then we have one segment. We require that the entire string has at least one R and one B.\n\n            Example: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> invalid -> NO -> correct.\n\n            Example: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> valid -> YES.\n\n            Example: n=3, s=\"RRB\" -> valid -> YES.\n\n            Example: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            Example: n=1, s=\"R\" -> invalid -> NO.\n\n            Example: n=0? not possible.\n\n            Also, what about an empty segment? We skip.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for each test case:\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if len(part) == 0:\n                            continue\n                        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: what if the string is \"W\"? \n            Then parts = ['', ''] -> but wait: split by 'W' on \"W\" -> ['','']? Actually, no: \n                \"W\".split('W') -> ['', '']? \n                But we skip the empty parts -> then no non-empty part -> valid.\n\n            And \"W\" is achievable (by zero operations) -> YES.\n\n        What about \"WW\"? -> parts = ['','',''] -> valid -> YES.\n\n        What about \"RW\"? -> parts = ['R', ''] -> then we check 'R': has no 'B' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n        But wait: \"RW\": \n            We start: WW -> \n            We can stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B] -> then we have \"RB\", not \"RW\".\n\n            How to get \"RW\"? \n                We start: WW\n                We stamp (0,1) as RB: [R, B] -> then we have RB, not RW.\n                We stamp (0,1) as BR: [B, R] -> then we have BR.\n\n            How to get the second cell to be white? \n                We cannot: because the stamp always sets two cells.

There is no operation that sets a cell to white. \n\n            Therefore, once a cell is stamped, it becomes non-white. \n\n            So if the final picture has a white cell, then that cell must never have been stamped. \n\n            Therefore, the white cells are fixed as the starting white. \n\n            And the non-white cells must be arranged in contiguous segments that are separated by white cells. \n\n            And each contiguous non-white segment must be achievable. \n\n            And the condition for a contiguous non-white segment is: \n                - It must have at least two cells? Actually, no: we can have a segment of length 1? But we saw that a segment of length 1 is impossible. \n\n            Therefore, the solution is to split by white and check each contiguous non-white segment: \n                - If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n                - If the segment has at least one R and at least one B -> valid; otherwise invalid.\n\n            But note: a segment of length 2: \n                \"RR\" -> invalid (because no B) -> NO.\n                \"RB\" -> valid -> YES.\n\n            A segment of length 3: \n                \"RRR\" -> invalid -> NO.\n                \"RBR\" -> valid -> YES.\n\n            So the code for program2.py:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(part) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                        elif 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            However, note: the condition for a segment of length 1 is already covered by the condition: \n                if the segment has no R or no B -> then invalid. \n                But a segment of length 1: \n                    if it is \"R\", then it has no B -> invalid.\n                    if it is \"B\", then it has no R -> invalid.\n\n            So we can simply do:\n\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part != '' and (part.count('R') == 0 or part.count('B') == 0):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n\n            However, what if the segment is of length 1? Then it will have either R or B, so one of the counts is 0 -> invalid. \n\n            But what if the segment is of length 0? we skip.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part and ('R' not in part or 'B' not in part):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n\n            This covers the length 1 and also the monochromatic segments of length>=2.\n\n            However, note: a segment of length 0 (empty) is skipped.\n\n            But what if the segment is non-empty and has both R and B? Then we are good.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    # s is the string for the picture, including newline? \n                    # The input: \n                    #   first line: t\n                    #   then for each test case: \n                    #        n\n                    #        s (with newline)\n                    # We are taking every second line starting from index 2 (0-indexed: the first line is index0, then the next two lines for the first test case: index1 and index2, then next test case: index3 and index4, ...). \n                    # So the pictures are at indices 2, 4, 6, ... -> [2::2] gives these.\n\n                    # But note: the variable s in the loop is a string that ends with newline? We should strip.\n\n                    # We'll do:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part:   # non-empty\n                            if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            However, the problem says: the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so this is efficient.\n\n        But note: the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO. We must output the answer for each test case.\n\n        However, the problem says: output t lines, each of which contains the answer.\n\n        We are in a loop over the test cases (each s is the string for one test case). \n\n        We must output the answer for that test case.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p != '':\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: we must reset `valid` for each test case.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without a flag:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break\n                print(ans)\n\n        However, what if there are multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n        This is efficient.\n\n        But note: the condition: 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p -> is equivalent to: not ( 'R' in p and 'B' in p )\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        This is the same.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        But note: we are in a loop over test cases and we must output one line per test case.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        We'll use the latter.\n\n        However, the provided code has:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must write the entire block for the test case.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the block that goes in the for loop.\n\n        The entire block for the TODO is:\n\n            s_clean = s.strip()\n            parts = s_clean.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:   # non-empty\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, we can use the same variable name `s` for the stripped string? \n\n        But note: the input line has a newline, so we strip.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        But note: the condition: if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p) -> \n            This is equivalent to: if p and (not ('R' in p and 'B' in p))\n\n        However, we can write:\n\n            if p and not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n\n        But the original condition is also clear.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            flag = True\n            for seg in parts:\n                if seg:  # non-empty segment\n                    if 'B' not in seg or 'R' not in seg:\n                        flag = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of the string over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do the split and the 'in' checks.\n\n        The 'in' check for a string of length L is O(L). And the total length of all segments is the total length of the string (without the W's) and the total length of all strings is <= 10^5.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p != '':\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: we can write without the explicit '':\n\n            if p:   # which is the same as non-empty\n\n        So:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        This is the code.\n\n        However, the problem says: the input is given as:\n\n            t\n            n1\n            s1\n            n2\n            s2\n            ...\n\n        And we are reading with [*open(0)] and then taking [2::2] -> the even-indexed lines starting at index2. \n\n        But note: the first line is index0, then the next two lines (for the first test case) are index1 (n1) and index2 (s1). Then the next test case: index3 (n2) and index4 (s2). \n\n        So the list [*open(0)] has:\n\n            index0: t (as a string)\n            index1: n1 (as a string)\n            index2: s1 (as a string, with newline)\n            index3: n2\n            index4: s2\n            ...\n\n        Therefore, [2::2] gives: [s1, s2, ...]\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the variable `s` in the loop is the string of the picture, including the newline. We strip to remove the newline.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the above block.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". The existing code is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        We are to complete the body of the for loop.\n\n        So the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and then in the format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        We must output the exact string for the missing code for each program.\n\n        For program1: the missing code is one line: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n\n        For program2: the missing code is a block of 6 lines (with proper indentation). \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We output:\n\n            program1: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n            program2: \n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n\" +\n                \"    parts = s.split('W')\\n\" +\n                \"    valid = True\\n\" +\n                \"    for p in parts:\\n\" +\n                \"        if p:\\n\" +\n                \"            if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\\n\" +\n                \"                valid = False\\n\" +\n                \"                break\\n\" +\n                \"    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the existing for loop in program2.py is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at the end of the line. We must write the body of the loop. The body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the block we write for program2 should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n        But the for loop is already at the top level? Actually, the entire program is:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO with the block. The block we write should be at the next line and indented.\n\n        So the code we write for program2 is:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:\n                    if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the first line of the block should be indented by 4 spaces. Then the rest accordingly.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. But we know the for loop is at the top level, so the body must be indented by 4.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p:\\n            if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\\n                valid = False\\n                break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But wait: the for loop in the block has an inner loop? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p:\n                        if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        The inner for loop: the body of the inner for loop (the if and the nested if) should be indented by 4 and 8 respectively.\n\n        But in the string representation, we must represent the entire block with the same relative indentation.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n            Line2: 4 spaces: \"    parts = s.split('W')\"\n            Line3: 4 spaces: \"    valid = True\"\n            Line4: 4 spaces: \"    for p in parts:\"\n            Line5: 8 spaces: \"        if p:\"\n            Line6: 12 spaces: \"            if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\"\n            Line7: 16 spaces: \"                valid = False\"\n            Line8: 16 spaces: \"                break\"\n            Line9: 4 spaces: \"    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the inner for loop body (the if and the break) are under the inner for, so they are indented by 8 and 12? Actually, the condition is:\n\n            for p in parts:\n                if p:   # 8 spaces\n                    if ...:   # 12 spaces\n                        ...   # 16 spaces\n\n        However, we can write the inner for loop body as:\n\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n        Then we can write:\n\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n        This reduces the indentation levels.\n\n        So:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            parts = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for p in parts:\n                if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        Then the block is:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n            Line2: 4 spaces: \"    parts = s.split('W')\"\n            Line3: 4 spaces: \"    valid = True\"\n            Line4: 4 spaces: \"    for p in parts:\"\n            Line5: 8 spaces: \"        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\"\n            Line6: 12 spaces: \"            valid = False\"\n            Line7: 12 spaces: \"            break\"\n            Line8: 4 spaces: \"    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        This is 8 lines.\n\n        We'll use this.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the condition: \"if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p)\" is equivalent to: if the segment is non-empty and (it has no red or no blue) -> then invalid.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without parentheses? \n\n            if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\n\n        But the parentheses are necessary because of operator precedence: and/or.\n\n        So we keep the parentheses.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"        c -= w[ix]\"\n            program2: \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code must be exactly as above. The newline character is represented as '\\n'.\n\n        We output in JSON format.\n\n        Example output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"        c -= w[ix]\",\n                \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p and ('R' not in p or 'B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n            }\n\n        However, note: the program2 code has a trailing newline? We don't need to add one because the print already does.\n\n        But the problem says: output the answer to each query on a new line. The program2 code uses print which adds a newline.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Let's write the JSON.\n\n        We must escape the string properly.\n\n        But in the JSON, we can represent the newline as \\n.\n\n        We are done."
