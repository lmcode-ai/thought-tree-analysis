The provided code structure is:\n\nI=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\nfor _ in range(I()[0]):\n    n=I()[0]\n    l=I()\n    l2=[]\n    s1,s2=0,0\n    p1,p2=0,n-1\n    while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition seems off. We should have p1 <= p2 for valid indices.\n        if s1 == s2:    # We are going to record the number of candies eaten when the sums are equal.\n            # We want to record the total number of candies eaten so far? Actually, the problem asks for the maximum total candies.\n            # But note: the condition is that the total weight eaten by Alice (s1) equals that by Bob (s2).\n            # At such a point, the total candies eaten is (p1) from the left and (n-1-p2) from the right? Actually, we have:\n            # Alice has eaten candies from index 0 to p1-1 (so p1 candies) and Bob from p2+1 to n-1 (so n-1-p2 candies).\n            # So total candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = n - (p2 - p1 + 1) ??? Actually, let me count:\n            # The candies that have been eaten: [0, p1-1] and [p2+1, n-1]. So total = p1 + (n - p2 - 1) = p1 + n - p2 - 1.\n            # But note: we are in the middle of processing. We are about to add a candy to either Alice or Bob? Actually, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop.\n\n            # However, the problem: we are to maximize the total number of candies when the two sums are equal.\n\n            # The provided code does:\n            #   if s1 == s2: then we record something? But the code currently does nothing. We need to record the total candies at that moment.\n\n            # We can record the total candies: total = p1 + (n - p2 - 1) and then store it in l2? But note the problem: we want the maximum total candies over all moments when s1==s2.\n\n            # However, the problem says: they want to be fair (same total weight) and maximize the total number of candies.\n\n            # So we should record the total candies when s1==s2 and then take the maximum? But note: the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\".\n\n            # But note: the provided code prints l2[-1] at the end. So we are storing something in l2 and then printing the last element? That doesn't seem right.\n\n            # Actually, we are going to traverse the array with two pointers. We start with no candies (s1=s2=0) and then we add from left or right until the pointers cross.\n\n            # We want to record every time the sums are equal? And then take the maximum total candies? But note: we are traversing and the condition s1==s2 might occur multiple times.\n\n            # However, the problem: we are to output the maximum total candies for each test case.\n\n            # But note: the provided code does not have a variable to record the maximum. Instead, it prints l2[-1]. So we are storing the total candies each time we have s1==s2? Then at the end we take the last one? That doesn't make sense.\n\n            # Actually, we can see that the two pointers are moving and we are increasing the total candies? But note: when we have s1==s2, we record the total candies at that moment. Then we continue? But we can continue and then we break the condition? However, we are not stopping.\n\n            # But note: the problem does not require that we stop at the first fair moment. We can continue and then we might get a fair moment with more candies? Actually, we are moving the pointers until they cross. So we can record the maximum total candies when s1==s2.\n\n            # However, the provided code does not have a variable for the maximum. Instead, it prints l2[-1]. So we are storing every time we have an equal sum? Then we take the last one? That doesn't seem to be the maximum.\n\n            # Let me read the problem again: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" -> so we want the maximum.\n\n            # We should change the code: we record the total candies when s1==s2 and then update a maximum variable. But the provided code uses l2 and then prints l2[-1]. That is not the maximum.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can store the current total in l2 and then at the end take the maximum of l2? But the code prints l2[-1]. So we must change that.\n\n            # But note: the problem constraints and the fact that the total n over test cases is 200000, we cannot store every occurrence and then take max because that might be too many.\n\n            # Actually, we can do: when s1==s2, we record the total candies (which is p1 + n - p2 - 1) and then we update a variable max_candies. Then at the end we print max_candies.\n\n            # However, the provided code does not have such a variable. Also, the code after the condition is:\n\n            #   if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            #   if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            # But note: if s1==s2, we do nothing? Then we get stuck? So we must break the condition? Actually, we can do:\n\n            #   if s1 == s2:\n            #       # record the current total candies: total = p1 + (n - p2 - 1)\n            #       # then we can break? But we might get a better one? Actually, we can continue by moving one of the pointers? But note: if we move both, we break the equality.\n\n            # How about: when s1==s2, we record the total and then we try to move the left pointer? But the problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily which candies to eat? Actually, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They can choose how many to eat arbitrarily? But the two pointers are moving independently? Actually, the algorithm is:\n\n            #   We start with no candies. Then we have two pointers: p1 (next candy for Alice) and p2 (next candy for Bob). We can choose to add to the smaller sum? But note: the condition: if s1 < s2, we add the next left candy to Alice. If s2 < s1, we add the next right candy to Bob. If they are equal, we have a candidate. Then we can try to move one of them? Actually, we can move the left one? But then s1 becomes bigger? Then we would have to move the right one? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can do: when s1==s2, we record the total and then we move the left pointer? But then we break the equality? Then we continue the loop? Then we might get another equality later? \n\n            # However, note: we are moving the pointers until they cross. We can do:\n\n            #   if s1 == s2:\n            #       candidate = p1 + (n - p2 - 1)\n            #       # and then we can move the left pointer? Because if we don't move, we are stuck. So we move the left pointer? Then we break the equality? Then the next step we will add to the smaller side? \n\n            # But the problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily? Actually, the algorithm is greedy: we are building the two sums by always adding to the smaller one? That is a standard two-pointer approach for such problems.\n\n            # However, we must record the candidate when the sums are equal. And we can continue because we might get another candidate? \n\n            # Example: [1, 2, 3, 3] \n            #   Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate: total=0 (0 candies) -> then we can add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1=1, s2=0 -> so we add to Bob: s2=3, p2=3 -> then s1=1, s2=3 -> add to Alice: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> now s1=3, s2=3 -> candidate: total = 2 (from Alice) + (n - p2 - 1) = 2 + (4-3-1)=2+0=2 -> then we can move? We can add to Alice: s1=3+3=6, p1=3 -> then s1=6, s2=3 -> then we add to Bob: but Bob has no more? p2 is at 3, and p1 is at 3 -> then we break? But we have p1=3 and p2=3: then we break the loop? \n\n            # But note: the condition in the while loop: while (p1-1<=p2) -> when p1=0: condition is -1<=p2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then when p1=3 and p2=3: condition: 3-1=2<=3 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we check s1==s2? no. Then we do: if s1 (6) < s2 (3)? no. Then if s2 (3) < s1 (6): yes -> then we add l[p2] to s2? but p2 is 3 -> we add l[3]=3 -> s2=6, then p2 becomes 2? Then we break? Then we have p1=3, p2=2 -> then condition: p1-1=2<=2 -> true. Then we check: s1=6, s2=6 -> candidate: total = 3 (from Alice) + (4-2-1)=3+1=4. Then we break? Then we move: we can add to Alice? but p1 is at 3 (end) so we can't. Then we break? Actually, we break the loop when we cannot move? \n\n            # But note: the condition: while (p1-1<=p2) -> when p1=3 and p2=2: 3-1=2<=2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we have s1==s2=6 -> record candidate=4. Then we try to move: we don't have an else? So we do nothing? Then we are stuck? \n\n            # We must break the condition? Actually, we can break the loop when p1>p2? But the condition is p1-1<=p2. So when p1-1>p2, we break. But when we are at p1=3 and p2=2: p1-1=2<=2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we have s1==s2, but then we don't move any pointer? So we are stuck.\n\n            # Therefore, we must move a pointer when s1==s2? Otherwise, we get stuck. How about: when s1==s2, we move the left pointer? Then we break the equality? Then the next step we will add to the side that becomes smaller? \n\n            # But note: we can also move the right pointer? Actually, we can move either. Let's move the left pointer? Then:\n\n            #   if s1==s2:\n            #       candidate = p1 + n - p2 - 1\n            #       # Then we move the left pointer? \n            #       s1 += l[p1]\n            #       p1 += 1\n\n            # But then we break the equality? Then the next step we will have s1 > s2? Then we will move the right pointer? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily? \n\n            # However, note: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily which candies to eat? The problem does not require a specific order? The two pointers are independent? Actually, the problem: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They can choose how many to eat arbitrarily? But the algorithm is building the two sums by always adding the next candy to the side that has the smaller current sum? That is a valid strategy? \n\n            # But note: the problem does not require that they eat in a fixed order? They can decide arbitrarily? So we are free to choose the order? \n\n            # Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. But they cannot skip. However, they can choose how many to eat arbitrarily? So we are free to choose the partition? \n\n            # The two-pointer method that always adds to the smaller sum is a standard way to find the maximum partition such that the two sums are equal? \n\n            # Therefore, we can do:\n\n            #   if s1 == s2:\n            #       candidate = p1 + n - p2 - 1\n            #       # We record candidate? But we want the maximum candidate? So we can store the candidate and then move the left pointer? \n            #       # Actually, we can update a variable max_candies = max(max_candies, candidate) and then move the left pointer? \n            #       # But note: we are moving the pointers and we might get a larger candidate? \n            #       # However, as we move the pointers, the total candies we have eaten so far (p1 + n-p2-1) is increasing? Actually, no: when we move the left pointer, p1 increases, and when we move the right pointer, p2 decreases. So the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, we are adding one candy at a time? So the total candies eaten is increasing? \n\n            # But wait: the candidate we record at s1==s2 is the total candies at that moment. Then we move a pointer and the total candies increases? Then the next candidate we get will have more candies? \n\n            # However, consider: we have two pointers. The total candies eaten is p1 (from left) and (n-p2-1) from right. When we move the left pointer: p1 increases by 1, so the total increases by 1. Similarly, when we move the right pointer: p2 decreases by 1, so the total increases by 1. So the total is increasing. Therefore, the last candidate we get (when the pointers are about to cross) is the largest? \n\n            # But note: we might have multiple equalities? And the last one is the largest? \n\n            # Example: [1, 1, 1] \n            #   n=3\n            #   Initially: p1=0, p2=2, s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate: total=0+ (3-2-1)=0 -> then we move: we can move left? because s1==s2, we break the tie arbitrarily? Let's move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1=1, s2=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=1 -> then s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: total=1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then we move: we can move left? s1=1+1=2, p1=2 -> then s1=2, s2=1 -> then we move right? but p2=1 and we are at the last candy? Actually, we have p1=2 and p2=1: then condition: p1-1=1<=1 -> true. Then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> then we move right? but we have only one candy at the right? we take l[1]=1 -> s2=2, p2=0 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=0? false -> break. Then we have s1=2, s2=2? but we didn't check? \n\n            # Actually, we break the loop? Then we miss the candidate at the end? \n\n            # How about we check after the loop? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can change the condition to p1<=p2? and then when we break, we check if s1==s2? \n\n            # But note: the problem: we are to maximize the total candies. The last candidate we get is the largest? \n\n            # However, in the example above, we got candidate=2 at the second equality. Then we moved and then we broke without checking? \n\n            # Actually, after the loop, we can check: if s1==s2? then candidate = p1 + n - p2 - 1? But note: after the loop, we have p1-1>p2 -> meaning p1>p2+1. Then the candies we have eaten: [0, p1-1] and [p2+1, n-1]. But note: if p1>p2+1, then we have an overlap? Actually, the candies from p2+1 to p1-1 are not eaten? \n\n            # Actually, the two pointers: \n            #   Alice: [0, p1-1] -> p1 candies\n            #   Bob: [p2+1, n-1] -> n-1-p2 candies\n            #   The middle [p1, p2] is not eaten? \n\n            # But when we break the loop, we have p1-1>p2 -> meaning p1>p2+1 -> so the middle segment is non-empty? \n\n            # Therefore, we cannot have an equality at the end? \n\n            # So we only record during the loop? \n\n            # But in the example [1,1,1] we broke the loop without recording the last equality? \n\n            # Actually, in the last step: \n            #   We had p1=2, p2=1: \n            #       s1=2, s2=1 -> then we do: if s2 < s1 -> we add l[p2]=l[1]=1 -> s2=2, p2=0.\n            #   Then condition: p1-1=1<=0? -> false -> break.\n            #   Then we have s1=2, s2=2 -> but we didn't record? \n\n            # How about we change the condition to p1<=p2? and then after the loop we check? \n\n            # Actually, the problem: we are to output the maximum candidate.
