Example: x=0, a[j]=1 -> (0-1)//1 = -1//1 = -1 -> value = -1, moves = 1 (because |k|=1). Example: x=-1, a[j]=2 -> (-1-1)//2 = -2//2 = -1 -> value = -2, moves=1. But wait: we want the value at j to be less than x. -2 is less than -1? Yes. However, we could also set k=0? Then value=0, but 0 is not less than -1? So we must set k=-1? Then value=-2. But is there a multiple between -1 and 0? For a[j]=2, the multiples are ... -4, -2, 0, 2, ... so the largest multiple below -1 is -2. So the formula is correct.

But for the left part, we are using the largest multiple (which may be negative) that is less than k. \n\n        However, note: the right part formula can be rewritten in terms of k_val? For the right part, we set: k_val = (k // a[t2+1] + 1)   [which is the multiple, positive]\n            then moves = k_val [because we add k_val times? But note: k_val is positive, so moves = k_val]\n            then k = a[t2+1] * k_val\n\n        For the left part, we set: k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]   [which is the multiple, and it can be negative]\n            then moves = |k_val|\n            then k = a[t2-1] * k_val This is consistent. But note: the right part formula does not work for negative k? But in the right part, k starts at 0 and then becomes positive? So it's safe. Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val) k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -= 1\n\n        However, we must be cautious: integer division in Python for negative numbers. Example: k=0, a[t2-1]=1 -> k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> moves += 1, k = -1. Then next: k=-1, a[t2-1]=2 -> k_val = (-1-1)//2 = -2//2 = -1 -> moves += 1, k = -2. Then we have the left part:",

So we try center t1=1 (0-indexed: so the center is at index1).

Then the right part takes 3 moves? But wait, the example only used 3 moves for the right part? But the example says 4 moves total? Actually, the example did: subtract at index0 (1 move) and then added at indices2,3,4 (3 moves) -> total 4. So for center t1=1, the left part: \n                    t2=1, k=0. while t2>0: so we process index0 (t2-1=0). k_val = (0-1)//a[0] = (-1)//1 = -1.\n                    t += 1 -> total t=6+1=7? That is not 4. What if we choose center t1=0? Then the center is at index0. Then the left part is empty (t2=0, so the left loop doesn't run).

What if center t1=3? Right part: \n                        t2=3: then only index4: moves = (0//1+1)=1 -> t=1, k=1. Left part:\n                        t2=3: \n                            index2: k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> t=1+1=2, k=-1.\n                            index1: k_val = (-1-1)//1 = -2 -> t=2+2=4, k=-2.\n                            index0: k_val = (-2-1)//1 = -3 -> t=4+3=7. total=7. What if center t1=4? (last element)\n                    Left part: \n                        t2=4: then we process indices 3,2,1,0.\n                        index3: k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> t=1, k=-1.\n                        index2: k_val = (-1-1)//1 = -2 -> t=3, k=-2.\n                        index1: k_val = (-2-1)//1 = -3 -> t=6, k=-3.\n                        index0: k_val = (-3-1)//1 = -4 -> t=10, k=-4.\n                    total=10. The minimum we found is 4? But we got 6 for t1=2, 7 for t1=3, 10 for others. But the example says 4. How do we get 4? The example solution: \n                    b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0: 0 - 1 = -1) -> moves=1.\n                    b1 = 0 (remains 0) -> moves=0.\n                    b2 = 3 (by adding a2 three times? but a2=1, so 0+1+1+1=3) -> moves=3? but that would be 3 moves? total 4? But wait: they said: subtract a1 from b1 -> that would set b1 to -1?",

The right part: \n                    index0: value=-1 (not 0) -> then we cannot start the right part from index0 with k=0. So our method of fixing the center to 0 might be the issue. Insight: the method in the code is known as: \n                  for i in range(n):\n                      cost = 0\n                      cur = 0\n                      for j in range(i+1, n):\n                          // minimal moves to make b[j] > cur\n                          k = (cur // a[j] + 1)\n                          cost += k\n                          cur = a[j] * k\n                      cur = 0\n                      for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                          // minimal moves to make b[j] < cur (which is the value at j+1) k = (cur - 1) // a[j] [then use abs(k) for cost, and cur = a[j]*k]\n\n                But note: in the left part, the \"cur\" for the first left element is the value at the center, which is 0. Then we set the left element to a negative value. Then for the next left element, we use that negative value as the target. In the example solution with a=[1,1,1,1,1] and center at index1 (0-indexed) and b1=0, then the left element index0 is set to -1, and the right elements: \n                    index2: must be >0 -> set to 1 (1 move) -> then index3: must be >1 -> set to 2 (2 moves) -> index4: must be >2 -> set to 3 (3 moves) -> total 1+1+2+3=7. But the example solution only used 4 moves: \n                    index0: 1 move (subtract)\n                    index2: 3 moves (add three times) -> and left index1 at 0 and index3,4 at 0? then the array: [-1,0,3,0,0] -> not increasing.\n\n                unless they also set index3 and index4: \n                    index3: add once -> 1 move, then array: [-1,0,3,1,0] -> not increasing.\n                    index4: add once -> 1 move, then array: [-1,0,3,1,1] -> not increasing.\n\n                index3: must be >3? then set to 4 (4 moves) -> then index4: must be >4 -> 5 (5 moves) -> total 1+3+4+5=13.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b (initially zeros) strictly increasing by either adding or subtracting a_i at each move for index i.\n\nThe provided code structure in program1.py is:\n\nm = int(input())\na = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\nt1, min = 0, 10**20\nwhile(t1 < m):\n    t2 = t1\n    k, t = 0, 0\n    while(t2 < m-1):\n        t += (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n        k = a[t2+1] * (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n        t2 += 1\n    t2 = t1\n    k = 0\n    while(t2 > 0):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    if(min > t):\n        min = t\n    t1 += 1\nprint(min)\n\nWe note that the current code does two parts for each starting index t1:\n1. It goes to the right (from t1 to the end) and computes the moves needed to make the sequence increasing. The way it does for the right part is by ensuring that the current value (k) is such that the next element (a[t2+1]) must be at least k+1. The moves for the next element are computed as (k // a[t2+1] + 1) which gives the smallest multiple of a[t2+1] that is greater than k. Then k becomes that multiple.\n\n2. The left part (from t1 down to 0) is missing. We need to do a similar thing but going leftwards. However, note that the condition for increasing is: \n   ... < b[t1-1] < b[t1] < b[t1+1] < ...\n\nBut when going left, we are effectively building the sequence from the center (at t1) to the left, and we require that the sequence is decreasing as we move left? Actually, we require the entire array to be increasing. So if we fix the center at t1, then we require:\n   b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[t1] < ... < b[m-1]\n\nFor the left part, we are going from t1 down to 0. We start at t1 and then move to t1-1, then t1-2, etc. We have to ensure that b[t1-1] < b[t1]. However, note that in the left part we are building backwards: we want b[t1-1] to be less than b[t1]. But in the left part, we are going to assign values to the left indices. We can do:\n\n   We start at t1 and then for the next left element (at index t2 = t1-1) we require that b[t2] < b[t1]. But note that we are going to assign b[t2] by subtracting or adding a[t2] multiple times. We want the value of b[t2] to be as close to b[t1] as possible but less than it. Actually, we want the entire sequence to be increasing. So we require:\n      b[t1-1] < b[t1]\n      b[t1-2] < b[t1-1]\n      etc.\n\nWe can do a similar greedy: we start at t1 and then for the left element at index t2 (which is initially t1-1, then t1-2, etc.), we want the value at t2 to be less than the next value (which is the one we just computed for t2+1). So we set a target: we want b[t2] to be at most (b[t2+1] - 1). Then we have to choose the multiple of a[t2] that is just below that target.\n\nBut note: the moves for an element can be either adding or subtracting. So we can get any multiple of a[t2]. We want the largest multiple that is <= (b[t2+1] - 1). However, we are building backwards and we are free to choose the sign? Actually, we can choose to subtract as many times as we want to get negative numbers. But note: we are starting from 0 and then we can do multiple moves (each move adds or subtracts a_i). So the value at index i must be a multiple of a_i, but it can be negative.\n\nHowever, the problem is symmetric: we can get any integer multiple of a_i. So for the left part, we can do:\n\n   Let k = 0 (starting at the center t1, we haven't set the left part yet). But wait, the center t1 is fixed to 0? Actually, no: the center t1 is the starting point and we haven't moved at the center? Actually, the code for the right part starts at t1 and then moves to the right. For the left part, we start at t1 and then move to the left.\n\nBut note: the center t1 is not necessarily fixed to 0. We are going to assign moves to every index? Actually, the problem allows us to choose any number of moves at each index. The entire array b is built by independent moves at each index.\n\nThe current code for the right part starts at t1 and then for each next index to the right (t2+1) we set k to the smallest multiple of a[t2+1] that is greater than the current k (which is the value at t2). Then the moves for that index are (k // a[t2+1] + 1) ? Actually, that formula doesn't look right because k is the value we want at the next index? And we are starting from 0 at the center? \n\nWait, the code for the right part:\n\n   t2 = t1\n   k, t = 0, 0\n   while(t2 < m-1):\n        t += (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n        k = a[t2+1] * (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n        t2 += 1\n\nThis seems to be setting the value at index t2+1 to a multiple of a[t2+1] that is at least k+1. The number of moves for that index is the multiple count (which is positive, so we are adding). But note: we could also subtract? However, the problem says we can add or subtract. But if we subtract, we get negative multiples. However, for the right part we want the sequence to be increasing. So we want the next value to be greater than the current. Therefore, we must add at least enough to get above the current value.\n\nBut the formula: \n   moves = (k // a[t2+1] + 1) \n   then k becomes a[t2+1] * (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n\nThis is the smallest multiple of a[t2+1] that is greater than k. So that is the minimal positive moves to get above k. However, we could also subtract to get negative? But that would make the next value negative and the current value (k) is nonnegative? That might break the increasing sequence. Actually, we are free to assign any multiple at each index. However, the minimal moves for the next index to be above k is to use the smallest positive multiple that is above k. Because if we use a negative multiple, then we would have to use even more moves to then get above k? It's not clear.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimum number of moves. So for each index, we are going to choose the multiple that minimizes the moves and satisfies the condition. For the right part, we want the next value to be at least k+1. The minimal moves to achieve a value that is at least k+1 is to take the smallest multiple of a_i that is >= k+1. The number of moves is the absolute value of the multiple. But note: we can get a positive multiple by adding, and the multiple is positive. The minimal positive multiple that is >= k+1 is: ceil((k+1)/a_i) * a_i, and the number of moves is ceil((k+1)/a_i). However, the current code does:\n\n   t += (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n\nBut if k is 0, then we do 0//a_i + 1 = 1, which is correct: we need one move to get a_i (if we add) which is >=1 (since k=0, we need at least 1). Then k becomes a_i.\n\nBut if k is 1, then for a_i=2: 1//2 = 0, then moves=1, and k becomes 2. That is correct: we need 2 to be above 1.\n\nBut if k is 2 and a_i=2: then 2//2=1, then moves=2, and k becomes 4. But we only need 2 to be above 2? Actually, we need strictly greater: so we need at least 3. The smallest multiple of 2 that is >=3 is 4. So moves=2 (because we add twice: 0->2->4) and k=4. So the formula is: we are computing the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than k. The number of moves is the multiple (which is the coefficient) and that is (k // a_i) + 1? Actually, the multiple is (k // a_i) + 1, so the value is a_i * ( (k // a_i) + 1 ). And the number of moves is (k // a_i) + 1? But note: we can also subtract? However, subtracting would give negative values and then we would have to do even more moves to get above k? So the minimal moves is to use the smallest positive multiple that is above k.\n\nSo the right part is handled.\n\nNow for the left part: we start at t1 and move left. We want the value at index t2 (which is t1-1, then t1-2, etc.) to be less than the value at index t2+1. We are starting at the center t1 with value 0? Actually, no: the center t1 is also going to be assigned moves? But in the current code, the center t1 is not assigned any moves in either the left or right part. That is a problem because we are starting at t1 with k=0 for the right part and k=0 for the left part? But then the entire array b is built by the moves we assign. However, the center t1 is not touched? Then it remains 0. Then the left part: we start at t1 and then move to t1-1. We want b[t1-1] < b[t1] = 0. So we need a negative value at t1-1.\n\nWe can do: we want the value at t1-1 to be at most -1. Then we can use the same idea: we want the largest multiple of a[t1-1] that is <= -1. How do we compute that? The moves for a negative multiple: we subtract. The minimal moves to get a value <= -1 is to subtract once? Then we get -a[t1-1]. But that might be too low? Actually, we want the minimal moves to get a value that is less than 0 and as close to 0 as possible? But note: we are going to build the entire left part and then the condition is that the entire sequence must be increasing. So we want the value at t1-1 to be as high as possible but still less than 0. The highest multiple of a[t1-1] that is less than 0 is -a[t1-1]? But that might be too low if we have to then set the next left element (t1-2) to be less than that? We want to minimize the moves and also set the values as high as possible to make the left part easier.\n\nSo the idea: for the left part, we start at t1 and then for index j = t1-1, then t1-2, ... we want the value at j to be less than the value at j+1. We are going to set the value at j to the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than the value at j+1. Then the number of moves is the absolute value of the multiple? But note: we can get negative multiples by subtracting. The largest multiple of a[j] that is less than x (where x is the value at j+1) is:\n\n   Let x = value at j+1.\n   We want a value y such that y = k * a[j] and y < x, and y is as close to x as possible (so the largest y < x).\n\n   How to compute k? \n        k = floor((x-1) / a[j])\n\n   Then the value y = k * a[j]. The number of moves is |k|? But k can be negative? Actually, we can have k negative: then we subtract |k| times? But note: if k is negative, then we subtract |k| times. The total moves is |k|.\n\n   However, we can also have k positive? But if k is positive, then we are adding k times? But then the value would be positive? But we want it to be less than x (which might be negative). Actually, we are free to choose any integer multiple.\n\n   The formula: \n        k = floor((x-1) / a[j])\n\n   Then the value is k * a[j]. The moves is |k|.\n\nBut note: we are starting at the center t1 with value 0. Then for the first left element (t1-1) we set x = 0. Then we want y < 0. Then k = floor((0-1)/a[j]) = floor(-1/a[j]) = -1 (if a[j]>=1, which it is). Then y = -a[j]. Moves = 1.\n\nThen for the next left element (t1-2): we set x = -a[t1-1]. Then we want y < x. Then k = floor((x-1)/a[t1-2]) = floor((-a[t1-1]-1)/a[t1-2]). \n\nBut note: we want to minimize the moves and also set the value as high as possible (to make the next left element easier). So we use the largest multiple that is less than x.\n\nSo the algorithm for the left part:\n\n   We start at the center t1 with value 0. Then we go from t1-1 down to 0.\n   Let x = current value at the next index (which is the one we just computed to the right, initially 0 at t1).\n   For index j (from t1-1 down to 0):\n        k = floor((x-1) / a[j])   [this gives the largest integer k such that k*a[j] < x]\n        Then the value at j becomes k * a[j]\n        The number of moves for this index is |k|\n        Then set x = k * a[j] for the next left element.\n\nBut note: the value at the center t1 is 0. Then we do the left part and then the right part? But the right part starts at t1 and then moves to the right, and the left part starts at t1 and moves to the left. The center t1 is fixed to 0? Actually, the center t1 is not assigned any moves. That is acceptable because we are allowed to leave it at 0? But note: the problem says we start with b_i=0 for all. Then we can choose to not move at an index? Then the value remains 0.\n\nBut the condition: the entire array must be strictly increasing. So if we leave the center at 0, then the left part must be negative and the right part positive? That is one possibility.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require the center to be 0. We can also assign moves to the center? But in the current code, the center is not being assigned any moves. That means we are leaving it at 0. But that might not be optimal? Actually, the problem allows us to assign moves arbitrarily. The current code structure is: for each center t1, we are leaving the center at 0 and then building the left and right parts. Then we take the minimum over t1.\n\nBut note: the center t1 is being considered as the starting point for both the left and right. We are iterating t1 from 0 to m-1. For each t1, we compute the total moves for the entire array (left and right) and then take the minimum.\n\nSo for the left part, we need to write:\n\n   t2 = t1   [then we start at t1 and go left? Actually, the loop is: while(t2>0): ... and we start at t1 and then go to t1-1, t1-2, ... until 0]\n\n   We have k = 0 (the value at the center t1) for the left part? Actually, the left part starts at the center and then moves left. But the center is fixed to 0? Then the first left element (t1-1) must be less than 0.\n\n   So we set:\n        current_value = 0   [at index t1]\n        then for j from t1-1 down to 0:\n            We want the value at j to be the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than the value at j+1 (which is the current_value for the next index to the right, which is the one we just computed for j+1).\n\n   How to compute the multiple? \n        Let x = current_value (for the index j+1)\n        Then we want k such that k * a[j] < x, and k is as large as possible (so that the value is as close to x as possible, minimizing the moves for the next left element).\n\n        k = (x-1) // a[j]   [if x-1 is negative, then // is floor division? In Python, floor division for negative numbers rounds down? But we want the largest integer k such that k*a[j] < x. This is equivalent to k = floor((x-1)/a[j]).]\n\n        But note: if (x-1) is negative, then (x-1)//a[j] is negative? And that is what we want.\n\n        Example: x=0, a[j]=1 -> (0-1)//1 = -1//1 = -1 -> value = -1, moves = 1 (because |k|=1).\n        Example: x=-1, a[j]=2 -> (-1-1)//2 = -2//2 = -1 -> value = -2, moves=1.\n\n        But wait: we want the value at j to be less than x. -2 is less than -1? Yes.\n\n        However, we could also set k=0? Then value=0, but 0 is not less than -1? So we must set k=-1? Then value=-2. But is there a multiple between -1 and 0? For a[j]=2, the multiples are ... -4, -2, 0, 2, ... so the largest multiple below -1 is -2.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n   Then we update:\n        t += |k|   [because the moves for index j is |k|: if k is negative, we subtract |k| times; if k is positive, we add k times? But k is always negative? Because we are going to the left and the values are decreasing? Actually, k can be positive? \n\n        Consider: if the current_value (x) is very large positive? Then we are going left and we want the next value to be less than x. Then k = floor((x-1)/a[j]) might be positive? For example, x=10, a[j]=3 -> k = (10-1)//3 = 9//3=3 -> value=9, which is less than 10. Then moves=3 (if we add 3 times). But note: we can also subtract? Then we could get negative values? But why would we? Because we want the entire sequence to be increasing? The left part must be increasing from left to right. So the value at j must be less than the value at j+1. But if we set the value at j to 9 and then the next left element must be less than 9? Then we can set it to 8? But if we subtract, we get negative? Then the entire left part would be negative? But the center is 0? Then the left part must be negative? \n\n        Actually, the center is at 0. Then the left part must be negative. So if we are at the center and then the first left element must be negative. Then the next left element must be even more negative. So k should be negative? \n\n        But wait: the center is at 0. Then the first left element must be negative. Then the next left element must be less than that negative? So it must be more negative. Then k for the next left element must be negative? \n\n        Therefore, the entire left part will be negative and k will be negative? Then the moves are |k| (which is -k).\n\n        However, the formula k = (x-1)//a[j] for negative x: \n            Example: x = -1, a[j]=3 -> (-1-1)//3 = -2//3 -> in Python, -2//3 is -1? Because floor(-2/3) = -1? Then value = -1 * 3 = -3, which is less than -1? Then moves = 1.\n\n        But we want the largest multiple that is less than x. For x=-1, the multiples of 3 that are less than -1 are -3, -6, ... and the largest (closest to -1) is -3? So that is correct.\n\n        However, note: if we do floor division for negative numbers, it rounds toward -infinity. But we want the largest multiple that is less than x. That is exactly what floor((x-1)/a[j]) does? \n\n        Actually, we want the largest integer k such that k*a[j] < x. \n            k <= (x-1)/a[j]   [because k*a[j] < x  => k < x/a[j], but we want the largest integer k, so k = floor((x-1)/a[j])? \n\n        Let me test: \n            x=0, a[j]=1: then (0-1)/1 = -1 -> k=-1 -> value=-1, which is less than 0 -> correct.\n            x=-1, a[j]=2: then (-1-1)/2 = -2/2 = -1 -> k=-1 -> value=-2, which is less than -1 -> correct.\n\n        But what if x=5, a[j]=3: then (5-1)/3 = 4/3 = 1.33 -> floor=1 -> value=3, which is less than 5 -> correct. And the next value must be less than 3? Then we set the next to 2? But wait, we are going left and the center is 0? Then the left part must be negative? \n\n        Actually, the center is at 0. Then the first left element must be negative. Then the next left element must be more negative. So we should never have a positive value in the left part? \n\n        Therefore, the center is 0, and the left part must be negative. So the value at the center is 0, then the first left element must be negative, then the next left element must be even more negative. So the value at the center is the highest in the entire array? Then the left part is decreasing as we move left? \n\n        But the condition is: the entire array must be increasing from left to right. So the leftmost element is the smallest, then the next, ... then the center, then the right part. So the center is the highest? Actually, no: the right part is increasing from the center to the right? Then the rightmost element is the largest. The center is the lowest? Actually, no: the center is 0, the left part is negative and the right part is positive. Then the entire array is increasing: negative numbers then 0 then positive numbers.\n\n        But the condition is: every element is strictly greater than the element before it. So the left part must be increasing: the leftmost element is the smallest, then the next is larger, ... then the center. Then the center is the largest in the left part? But then the center is 0 and the element to the left of the center is negative. Then the element to the left of that must be less than that negative? Then the entire left part is decreasing as we move left? But that is the opposite of increasing? \n\n        Actually, the array is from index0 to index m-1. We require:\n            b0 < b1 < ... < b_{m-1}\n\n        If we have the center at index t1, then we require:\n            ... < b_{t1-1} < b_{t1} < b_{t1+1} < ...\n\n        So the left part (from 0 to t1) must be increasing? Then the leftmost element is the smallest, and then it increases until the center. Then the center is the largest in the left part? But then the center is 0, and the element to the left of the center is negative, and the element to the left of that is even more negative? Then we have: ... < -2 < -1 < 0 ... -> which is increasing? \n\n        Actually, if we have: \n            b0 = -2, b1 = -1, b2 = 0, b3 = 1, b4 = 2\n        then the sequence is increasing: -2 < -1 < 0 < 1 < 2.\n\n        So the left part must be increasing from left to right. Therefore, when we build the left part, we start at the center and move left, we are building the sequence from the center to the left. But the condition requires that the entire array is increasing. Therefore, the left part must be increasing from left to center. So when we move from the center to the left, we are going backwards in the array. The condition for the left part is: \n            b_{j} < b_{j+1}   for j from 0 to t1-1.\n\n        So when we are at the center (index t1) and then we set index t1-1 to a value less than the center (0), then we set index t1-2 to a value less than the value at t1-1? \n\n        Example: \n            center: index2 = 0.\n            index1: we set to -a1 (say -1) -> then we require index0 < index1? So index0 must be less than -1? Then we set index0 to -2 (if a0=1) -> then we have [-2, -1, 0, ...] -> which is increasing.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm for the left part:\n\n            current = 0   [at index t1]\n            moves_left = 0\n            for j from t1-1 down to 0:\n                # We want the value at j to be less than current (which is the value at j+1)\n                # We choose k = floor((current - 1) / a[j])\n                # Then the value at j is k * a[j]\n                # The moves for j is |k|\n                # Then set current = k * a[j]   (for the next left element)\n\n        Then we add moves_left to the total moves for this center.\n\n        But note: the value at the center is 0, and we are not assigning any moves to the center? That is acceptable.\n\n        However, what if we want to assign moves to the center? The problem does not require the center to be 0. We could assign moves to the center? But in the current code, we are leaving the center at 0. Why? Because we are iterating over every center and then taking the minimum. It might be that leaving the center at 0 is optimal? Or we might assign moves to the center? \n\n        Actually, the current code does not assign moves to the center. The center is fixed at 0. Then the left part and right part are built relative to 0. But the problem does not require the center to be 0. We could assign moves to the center? Then the center would be a multiple of a[t1]. Then the left part would be built relative to that multiple? \n\n        However, the current code structure does not do that. The center is not included in the left or right loops. So we are leaving it at 0. Then the entire array is built with the center at 0. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the center to be 0. We are free to assign moves arbitrarily. The current code is only one possibility: we fix the center at 0 and then build the left and right. Then we take the minimum over the choice of center? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not fix the center. We are iterating t1 from 0 to m-1. For each t1, we are building the entire array with the center at t1 fixed to 0. Then we compute the total moves. Then we take the minimum over t1.\n\n        Why is that valid? Because we are allowed to assign moves arbitrarily. The center t1 is just the index we choose to leave at 0? But we could also assign moves to the center? Then the value at the center would be non-zero. Then the left and right parts would be built relative to that non-zero value. \n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the center to be 0. But the current code does not consider assigning moves to the center. \n\n        But observe: the moves at the center can be incorporated? Actually, we can always adjust the center by moving it and then adjust the left and right parts accordingly. However, the minimal moves might be achieved by leaving the center at 0? \n\n        Actually, the problem is symmetric: we can shift the entire array by a multiple of a[t1] at the center. But note: the condition is relative: we require increasing. The relative differences matter. \n\n        However, the current approach is known in the problem: we fix the center to 0 and then build the left and right. Then we take the minimum over the center index. This is a known solution for similar problems (like \"Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating\" or \"Increasing Array\" with minimal moves). \n\n        Therefore, we complete the left part as:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k_left = 0   # This will be the value at the center for the left part? Actually, we start at the center with value 0.\n            moves_left = 0\n            # We are going to traverse from t1-1 down to 0.\n            t2 = t1 - 1   # we start at the first left index? Actually, the loop condition is while(t2>0): but we need to go down to 0? So we do while t2>=0? \n\n            Actually, the current code has:\n                t2 = t1\n                k = 0   [for the left part?]\n                while(t2>0):\n                    # we are going to process index t2-1? \n\n            But the code sets t2 = t1, then in the loop we do t2>0? Then we process from t1 down to 1? Then we skip index0? \n\n            We need to process from t1-1 down to 0. So the loop should run for (t1) times? \n\n            The current code: \n                t2 = t1\n                while(t2>0):\n                    # TODO\n\n            Then we start at t1 and then we do t2>0. We need to process indices from t1-1 down to 0. So we can do:\n\n                t2 = t1\n                k = 0   # the value at the center (index t1) is 0.\n                while t2 > 0:\n                    # we are going to process index = t2-1\n                    # compute k_val = (k - 1) // a[t2-1]   [but k is the value at index t2, which is the next to the right of the current index t2-1]\n                    k_val = (k - 1) // a[t2-1]   # but wait: k is the value at index t2, and we are setting the value at index t2-1 to k_val * a[t2-1]\n                    # But note: k is the value at index t2? Actually, in the left part we are building from the center to the left. So the value at the current index (which is t2) is stored in k. Then we set the value at t2-1 to k_val * a[t2-1]. Then we update k to be that value for the next iteration (to the left).\n\n                    Then we add |k_val| to the total moves for the left part.\n\n                    Then we set k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                    Then we set t2 -= 1\n\n            But note: the loop condition: we start at t2 = t1, then we process t2-1, then set t2 = t2-1. Then we do until t2>0? Then we process indices: t1-1, t1-2, ... until 1? Then we skip index0? \n\n            We need to process index0. So we should change the condition to t2>=0? But then when t2=0, we try to access a[t2-1] = a[-1] -> which is the last element? That is not correct.\n\n            Actually, we are going from t1 down to 0. The indices we process are from t1-1 down to 0. So we need to run the loop for t1 times? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                t2 = t1\n                k = 0\n                while t2 > 0:\n                    # we are going to process index = t2-1\n                    # ...\n\n            Then we process indices: t1-1, t1-2, ... until 0? Actually, when t2=1, we process index0? Then we set t2=0 and then the loop condition t2>0 fails. So we process all indices from t1-1 down to 0? \n\n            How? \n                Initially: t2 = t1 (which is in [0, m-1])\n                Then we do:\n                    while t2>0:\n                        j = t2-1   [which is from t1-1 down to 0? when t2=1, j=0]\n                        then t2 = t2-1 -> becomes 0, then the loop stops.\n\n            So we process all indices from t1-1 down to 0? Yes.\n\n            Therefore, the code for the left part:\n\n                t2 = t1\n                k = 0   # the value at the center (index t1) is 0.\n                while t2 > 0:\n                    # Compute k_val = (k - 1) // a[t2-1]\n                    # But note: k is the value at index t2 (the next to the right of the current index j = t2-1)\n                    # We want the value at j = t2-1 to be the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than k.\n\n                    # However, note: k might be an integer, but we are doing integer division.\n\n                    # But what if k-1 is negative? Then (k-1)//a[t2-1] is floor division? In Python, floor division for negative numbers rounds down? \n\n                    # Example: k=0, a[t2-1]=1 -> (0-1)//1 = -1//1 = -1 -> k_val = -1 -> moves = 1, then set k = -1 * 1 = -1.\n\n                    # Then next: t2 becomes t1-1, then we process j = t2-1 = t1-2: \n                    #   k = -1, then k_val = (-1-1)//a[t1-2] = -2//a[t1-2]\n\n                    k_val = (k - 1) // a[t2-1]   # This is the coefficient.\n\n                    # But wait: what if a[t2-1] is 0? But a[i] are positive integers.\n\n                    # Then we add |k_val| to the total moves t (which is the total moves for the entire array for this center).\n\n                    t += abs(k_val)\n\n                    # Then set k = k_val * a[t2-1]   (the value at index j = t2-1)\n\n                    k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n\n                    t2 -= 1\n\n            Then after the left part, we have the total moves for the left part.\n\n        But note: the right part we already computed and stored in t? Then we add the left part moves to the same t? \n\n        The current code for the right part:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k, t = 0, 0\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                t += (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n                k = a[t2+1] * (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n                t2 += 1\n\n        Then we do the left part:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k = 0   # we reset k to 0 for the left part? But the right part used k and set it to the last value? We don't need that for the left part.\n\n            Then we do the left part and add to t.\n\n        Then we compare t to min.\n\n        However, note: the center is not assigned any moves. That is acceptable.\n\n        But what if the center is not at 0? We are leaving it at 0. But we could assign moves to the center? Then we would have to adjust the left and right parts. However, the problem does not require the center to be 0. But the minimal moves might be achieved by leaving it at 0? \n\n        Actually, we are iterating over every center. For each center, we leave that center at 0 and then build the left and right parts. Then we take the minimum over centers. This is a valid solution.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for the left part in program1.py is:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k = 0\n            while t2 > 0:\n                # Compute k_val: the coefficient for the current index (t2-1)\n                k_val = (k - 1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val)\n                k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -= 1\n\n        But note: the right part uses a different formula? For the right part, we did:\n\n            t += (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n            k = a[t2+1] * (k // a[t2+1] + 1)\n\n        For the left part, we are doing:\n\n            k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n            t += abs(k_val)\n            k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n\n        Why the difference? Because for the right part, we are using the smallest positive multiple that is greater than k. The formula for the multiple was (k // a[t2+1] + 1). But for the left part, we are using the largest multiple (which may be negative) that is less than k. \n\n        However, note: the right part formula can be rewritten in terms of k_val? \n\n        For the right part, we set:\n            k_val = (k // a[t2+1] + 1)   [which is the multiple, positive]\n            then moves = k_val   [because we add k_val times? But note: k_val is positive, so moves = k_val]\n            then k = a[t2+1] * k_val\n\n        For the left part, we set:\n            k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]   [which is the multiple, and it can be negative]\n            then moves = |k_val|\n            then k = a[t2-1] * k_val\n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        But note: the right part formula does not work for negative k? But in the right part, k starts at 0 and then becomes positive? So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val)\n                k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -= 1\n\n        However, we must be cautious: integer division in Python for negative numbers.\n\n        Example: k=0, a[t2-1]=1 -> k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> moves += 1, k = -1.\n        Then next: k=-1, a[t2-1]=2 -> k_val = (-1-1)//2 = -2//2 = -1 -> moves += 1, k = -2.\n\n        Then we have the left part: [-2, -1] and then center 0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But what if k is positive? For the left part, we start at the center with k=0. Then we set the first left element to negative. Then the next left element to even more negative. So k becomes negative and remains negative. So we don't have to worry about positive k in the left part? \n\n        However, what if the center is at the beginning? Then the left part is empty? Then the loop doesn't run. \n\n        So the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val)\n                k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -=1\n\n        But note: the variable k in the left part is the same k that we set to 0 at the beginning of the left part. The right part used a variable k that we don't use anymore? We reset k to 0 for the left part.\n\n        The code for the left part is after the right part? Actually, the code:\n\n            t2 = t1\n            k, t = 0, 0\n            while(t2 < m-1):\n                ...   # right part: updates k and t, and t2 increases\n            t2 = t1\n            k = 0   # reset k for the left part\n            while(t2>0):\n                ...   # left part\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n            t += abs(k_val)\n            k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n            t2 -= 1\n\n        But note: we must do this in the loop. So the entire block for the while loop is:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val)\n                k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -= 1\n\n        However, the problem constraints: n up to 5000. This loop runs at most 5000 times, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Let me test with the example: \n            Example1: n=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n            We are told the answer is 4.\n\n            How? \n                We fix the center? The example solution: subtract a1 from b1 -> that is index0? Then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5 -> that is indices2,3,4. So total moves=4.\n\n                Which center did they use? They left the center at index1? Because they subtracted at index0 (which is left of center) and then added at indices2,3,4 (which are right of center). The center index1 is left at 0.\n\n                So we try center t1=1 (0-indexed: so the center is at index1).\n\n                Right part: \n                    t2=1, k=0, t=0.\n                    t2<4 (m-1=4): \n                        next index: t2+1=2 -> a[2]=1.\n                        moves = (0//1+1)=1 -> t=1.\n                        k = 1 * (0//1+1) = 1.\n                        t2=2.\n                    then t2=2: next index3: a[3]=1.\n                        moves = (1//1+1)=1+1=2 -> t=3.\n                        k = 1 * (1//1+1)= 1*2=2.\n                    then t2=3: next index4: a[4]=1.\n                        moves = (2//1+1)=2+1=3 -> t=6? \n                    Then the right part takes 3 moves? \n\n                But wait, the example only used 3 moves for the right part? But the example says 4 moves total? \n\n                Actually, the example did: subtract at index0 (1 move) and then added at indices2,3,4 (3 moves) -> total 4.\n\n                So for center t1=1, the left part: \n                    t2=1, k=0.\n                    while t2>0: so we process index0 (t2-1=0).\n                    k_val = (0-1)//a[0] = (-1)//1 = -1.\n                    t += 1 -> total t=6+1=7? \n\n                That is not 4.\n\n                What if we choose center t1=0? \n                    Then the center is at index0. Then the left part is empty (t2=0, so the left loop doesn't run). The right part: \n                        t2=0, k=0.\n                        while t2<4: \n                            index1: a[1]=1 -> moves= (0//1+1)=1 -> t=1, k=1.\n                            index2: a[2]=1 -> moves= (1//1+1)=2 -> t=3, k=2.\n                            index3: a[3]=1 -> moves= (2//1+1)=3 -> t=6, k=3.\n                            index4: a[4]=1 -> moves= (3//1+1)=4 -> t=10, k=4.\n                    total moves=10.\n\n                What if center t1=2?\n                    Right part: \n                        t2=2, k=0.\n                        index3: moves = (0//1+1)=1 -> t=1, k=1.\n                        index4: moves = (1//1+1)=2 -> t=3, k=2.\n                    Left part:\n                        t2=2, k=0.\n                        while t2>0: \n                            index1: t2-1=1 -> a[1]=1 -> k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> t=3+1=4, k=-1.\n                            then t2=1, then process index0: t2-1=0 -> a[0]=1 -> k_val = (-1-1)//1 = -2 -> t=4+2=6, k=-2.\n                    total moves=6.\n\n                What if center t1=3?\n                    Right part: \n                        t2=3: then only index4: moves = (0//1+1)=1 -> t=1, k=1.\n                    Left part:\n                        t2=3: \n                            index2: k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> t=1+1=2, k=-1.\n                            index1: k_val = (-1-1)//1 = -2 -> t=2+2=4, k=-2.\n                            index0: k_val = (-2-1)//1 = -3 -> t=4+3=7.\n                    total=7.\n\n                What if center t1=4? (last element)\n                    Left part: \n                        t2=4: then we process indices 3,2,1,0.\n                        index3: k_val = (0-1)//1 = -1 -> t=1, k=-1.\n                        index2: k_val = (-1-1)//1 = -2 -> t=3, k=-2.\n                        index1: k_val = (-2-1)//1 = -3 -> t=6, k=-3.\n                        index0: k_val = (-3-1)//1 = -4 -> t=10, k=-4.\n                    total=10.\n\n                The minimum we found is 4? But we got 6 for t1=2, 7 for t1=3, 10 for others. But the example says 4.\n\n                How do we get 4? \n\n                The example solution: \n                    b0 = -1 (by subtracting a0: 0 - 1 = -1) -> moves=1.\n                    b1 = 0 (remains 0) -> moves=0.\n                    b2 = 3 (by adding a2 three times? but a2=1, so 0+1+1+1=3) -> moves=3? but that would be 3 moves? total 4? \n                    But wait: they said: subtract a1 from b1 -> that would set b1 to -1? and then they added a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5? \n                    But the array a is [1,1,1,1,1]. \n                    They did: \n                        b0: subtract a0: -1 -> moves=1.\n                        b1: subtract a1: 0-1 = -1? but then the sequence: b0=-1, b1=-1 -> not strictly increasing? \n                    Actually, the example says: the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n                    So they did:\n                        b0: subtract a0: 0-1 = -1 -> moves=1.\n                        b1: remains 0? but then how? they didn't move b1? \n                        b2: add a2 three times: 0+1+1+1=3 -> moves=3.\n                        b3: add a3 once: 0+1=1? but they set it to 4? \n                    Actually, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" -> so b3: 0+1=1? but they got 4? \n\n                I see: the example has a = [1,1,1,1,1]? Then the moves for b3: they add a3 (which is 1) four times? to get 4? Then moves=4? total moves=1 (b0) + 0 (b1) + 3 (b2) + 4 (b3) + 5 (b4) = 13? \n\n                Actually, the example says: \"The final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves.\" \n\n                How? \n                    Move1: subtract a0: b0 becomes -1.\n                    Move2: add a2: b2 becomes 1 -> but then they add a2 two more times: so 3 moves for b2? total moves=4? then b2=3.\n                    Then they add a3 to b3: one move? but that would be 5 moves? \n                Or: \n                    They did:\n                        Move1: subtract a0 -> b0=-1.\n                        Then they did nothing to b1 -> remains 0.\n                        Then they did three moves to b2: add three times -> b2=3.\n                        Then they did nothing to b3 and b4? but then b3=0, b4=0 -> not increasing.\n\n                I see: the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" -> but that would be one move for each? Then total moves=1 (b0) + 3 (b2) + 1 (b3) + 1 (b4) + 1 (b5) = 6? \n\n                But the example says 4 moves.\n\n                The example: \n                    Input: n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]\n                    Output: 4.\n\n                How? \n                    They did:\n                        b0: subtract a0: -1 (1 move)\n                        b1: leave at 0 -> 0 moves\n                        b2: add a2 three times: 3 (3 moves) -> total 4 moves.\n                        b3: leave at 0? but then 3>0 -> so that's increasing? \n                        b4: leave at 0? but then 0 is not greater than 0? \n\n                Actually, the array must be strictly increasing: \n                    b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=0, b4=0 -> fails at b3 and b4.\n\n                The example final array: [-1,0,3,4,5] -> so they must have set b3 to 4 and b4 to 5? That would be 4 moves? \n\n                How? \n                    Move1: b0: subtract -> -1.\n                    Move2: b2: add -> 1.\n                    Move3: b2: add again -> 2.\n                    Move4: b2: add again -> 3.\n                    Then how are b3 and b4 set? \n\n                They must have done moves on b3 and b4 as well? \n\n                Actually, the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" -> but that would be three more moves? \n\n                I see the confusion: the example says: \"add a3, a4, and a5\" meaning one move for each? Then total moves=1+3+1+1+1=7? \n\n                But the example says 4 moves.\n\n                Rethink: the problem allows multiple moves at the same index. But the example solution: \n                    \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> that is one move at index0? (if we consider 1-indexed: a1 is the first element, so index0 in 0-indexed) -> b0=-1.\n                    \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> that is one move for each of indices2,3,4? \n                    Then moves: index0:1, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1 -> total 4 moves.\n\n                Then the array: \n                    b0 = -1 (one move: subtract)\n                    b1 = 0 (no move)\n                    b2 = 1 (one move: add) -> but the example says 3? \n                They said: \"add a3\" -> a3 is the third element? which is at index2? then b2=1? but they got 3? \n\n                How do they get b2=3?

The problem does not require it. But our method does. \n\n                Alternatively, known solution: \n                    We are allowed to leave the center at 0, but then the moves for the center is 0. Then the left and right parts are built.\n\n                But the example solution does not leave the center at 0? \n\n                They did: \n                    b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=4, b4=5.\n\n                In this solution, the center might be at index0: then the left part is empty. The right part: \n                    index0: value=-1 (not 0) -> then we cannot start the right part from index0 with k=0.\n\n                So our method of fixing the center to 0 might be the issue.\n\n                Insight: the method in the code is known as: \n                  for i in range(n):\n                      cost = 0\n                      cur = 0\n                      for j in range(i+1, n):\n                          // minimal moves to make b[j] > cur\n                          k = (cur // a[j] + 1)\n                          cost += k\n                          cur = a[j] * k\n                      cur = 0\n                      for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                          // minimal moves to make b[j] < cur (which is the value at j+1)\n                          k = (cur - 1) // a[j]   [then use abs(k) for cost, and cur = a[j]*k]\n\n                But note: in the left part, the \"cur\" for the first left element is the value at the center, which is 0. Then we set the left element to a negative value. Then for the next left element, we use that negative value as the target.\n\n                In the example solution with a=[1,1,1,1,1] and center at index1 (0-indexed) and b1=0, then the left element index0 is set to -1, and the right elements: \n                    index2: must be >0 -> set to 1 (1 move) -> then index3: must be >1 -> set to 2 (2 moves) -> index4: must be >2 -> set to 3 (3 moves) -> total 1+1+2+3=7.\n\n                But the example solution only used 4 moves: \n                    index0: 1 move (subtract)\n                    index2: 3 moves (add three times) -> and left index1 at 0 and index3,4 at 0? \n                then the array: [-1,0,3,0,0] -> not increasing.\n\n                unless they also set index3 and index4: \n                    index3: add once -> 1 move, then array: [-1,0,3,1,0] -> not increasing.\n                    index4: add once -> 1 move, then array: [-1,0,3,1,1] -> not increasing.\n\n                index3: must be >3? then set to 4 (4 moves) -> then index4: must be >4 -> 5 (5 moves) -> total 1+3+4+5=13.\n\n                Therefore, the example provided in the note might be with a different array? \n\n                The note says: \"Example1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively. The final array will be [-1,0,3,4,5] after 4 moves.\"\n\n                In this example, a1, a3, a4, a5 are mentioned. What is a2? not mentioned. \n                The array might be: a = [1,?,1,1,1] and a2=0? then they could set b2=0 without moves? \n\n                But the input specification: a_i are positive integers.\n\n                I see the only way: the example has a = [1,0,1,1,1]? but a_i>=1.\n\n                Given the time, we trust the method and output the code as described.\n\n                Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is the left part loop.\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n        The problem: count the number of trees (with the given structure) for which vertex i is the centroid, modulo 998244353.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            MOD = 998244353\n\n            def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n                return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n            def inv(x):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            MAX = 10 ** 6\n\n            fact = [1]\n            for i in range(1, MAX):\n                fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n            invfact = [1] * (MAX)\n            invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n            for i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n                invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n            def comb(x, y):\n                return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\n            def invcomb(x, y):\n                return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\n            def invs(x):\n                return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\n            n = int(input())\n\n            out = [0] * n\n\n            for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n                base = fact[n - 1]\n                frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n\n                out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n            rem = 0   \n            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n                oldrem = rem\n                rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n                out[i] -= oldrem\n\n                rem %= MOD\n                out[i] %= MOD\n\n            print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n        We need to complete the inv function.\n\n        The inv function should return the modular inverse of x modulo MOD.\n\n        We can use Fermat's little theorem: since MOD is prime, the inverse of x is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\n        But note: x might be 0? but in the context, we are inverting factorials, so x is not 0.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            def inv(x):\n                return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n        But the problem: the input x might be 0? then we get an error. But in the context, we are inverting factorials, and factorial[0]=1, and we start from 1 in the factorial array. So x>=1.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            def inv(x):\n                return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n        However, note: the function might be called with x=0? then we need to handle it. But the factorials are at least 1. And in the comb function, we use invfact for positive integers. So it's safe.\n\n        But the comb function is called with x and y in range, and we have MAX=10**6, and n<200000, so it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the inv function using pow.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        program1: \n            while(t2>0):\n                k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n                t += abs(k_val)\n                k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n                t2 -= 1\n\n        program2:\n            def inv(x):\n                return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n        But note: in program1, we must be cautious that the // operator in Python for negative numbers does floor division, which is what we want.\n\n        We output in the specified JSON format.\n\n        Note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and in the specified format.\n\n        For program1, the missing code is the entire while loop block? But the TODO is inside the while loop. The existing code has:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the 4 lines.\n\n        But note: the existing code has a while loop with a comment. We replace the comment with the code.\n\n        For program2, the TODO is the body of the inv function.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n            t += abs(k_val)\\n            k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n            t2 -= 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n        }\n\n        But wait: in program1, the existing code has indentation. We must preserve the indentation level.\n\n        In the given program1, the while loop is:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the comment with:\n\n            k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\n            t += abs(k_val)\n            k = k_val * a[t2-1]\n            t2 -= 1\n\n        And the indentation is one level (4 spaces or a tab). We use the same.\n\n        In the JSON, we use \\n and spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write in one line for program1? But it's multiple statements.\n\n        We output as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n        For program2, the function body is one line.\n\n        Let me write the exact string for program1: \n            \"k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n        t += abs(k_val)\\n        k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n        t2 -= 1\"\n\n        But the existing code in program1 has 8 spaces for the while loop body? The TODO is at 8 spaces. So we use 8 spaces for each line.\n\n        Actually, the provided code in program1 uses 4 spaces per indent. The while loop is at 4 spaces, then the body should be 8 spaces.\n\n        In the given code:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The comment is at 8 spaces (one level of 4 spaces). So we use 8 spaces for each line.\n\n        But in the JSON string, we can use \\t for tab? The problem does not specify. We use spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same indentation as the comment: 8 spaces.\n\n        So:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n        t += abs(k_val)\\n        k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n        t2 -= 1\"\n\n        But wait, the while loop already has an indentation of 8 spaces? Then we are adding 8 more? \n\n        Actually, the existing code has:\n\n            while(t2>0):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The '#' is at 8 spaces. We replace the comment with the code at the same indentation level.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        But the provided code in the problem for the right part inside the while loop has 12 spaces? \n\n        Example from the given code for the right part:\n\n            while(t2<m-1):\n                t+=(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                k=a[t2+1]*(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                t2+=1\n\n        The body is at 8 spaces (two tabs or 8 spaces). \n\n        So we use 8 spaces for the left part as well.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"        k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n        t += abs(k_val)\\n        k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n        t2 -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the first line has 8 spaces, then the next lines also have 8 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use one line? \n\n        We cannot, because it's multiple statements.\n\n        For program2, the function body is one line, and we put it at the same indentation level as the comment. The function is:\n\n            def inv(x):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with: \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" at 4 spaces indentation.\n\n        So the string for program2 is: \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\n        But the existing code might use 4 spaces for the function body.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n        t += abs(k_val)\\n        k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n        t2 -= 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n        }\n\n        But wait: in program1, the code after the while loop in the right part is:\n\n            while(t2<m-1):\n                t+=(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                k=a[t2+1]*(k//a[t2+1]+1)\n                t2+=1\n\n        The body is at 8 spaces. So we use 8 spaces for the left part.\n\n        In program2, the function body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        Let me check the provided program2: the other functions are:\n\n            def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n                return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n            def inv(x):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the body of modmul is at 4 spaces. We should use 4 spaces for inv.\n\n        Therefore, program2: \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" -> 4 spaces.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We output only the missing code.\n\n        So for program1, the missing code is the block for the while loop (4 lines) with the same indentation as the TODO (which is 8 spaces).\n\n        For program2, the missing code is the return statement for the inv function, indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        We output in JSON.\n\n        Note: the JSON requires double quotes. We escape the strings.\n\n        Let me write the exact strings:\n\n        program1: \n            Line1: 8 spaces + \"k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\"\n            Line2: 8 spaces + \"t += abs(k_val)\"\n            Line3: 8 spaces + \"k = k_val * a[t2-1]\"\n            Line4: 8 spaces + \"t2 -= 1\"\n\n        So the string: \n            \"        k_val = (k-1) // a[t2-1]\\n        t += abs(k_val)\\n        k = k_val * a[t2-1]\\n        t2 -= 1\"\n\n        program2: \n            \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\n        But note: in the provided program2, the TODO is in a function that currently has no return. We are replacing the TODO with a return statement.\n\n        We output."
