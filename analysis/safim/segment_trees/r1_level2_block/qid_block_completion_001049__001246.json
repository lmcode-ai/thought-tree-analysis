So we did it in two operations. Therefore, the condition: \n            In the original array: [0,0,1] -> we did not have an element 1/3. But after the first operation, we had [0,0.5,0.5].

This is a contradiction. I see the error: in the first operation, when we leave out the first 0, we set the other two to (0+1)/2 = 0.5. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 1]? But wait, we left out the first element (which was 0) and replaced the other two (the second 0 and the 1) by 0.5. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]?",

Since n<=50 and sm and elem are integers, we can do integer arithmetic:\n\n                if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n\n          This is equivalent.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length of the subarray multiplied by the sign of its sum (positive: +length, negative: -length, zero: 0).\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum sum. The dynamic programming state dp[i] represents the maximum value we can get for the prefix ending at i.\n\nThe key idea is to use the prefix sums and then use coordinate compression and Fenwick trees to efficiently query the maximum dp[j] - j for j with prefix[j] < prefix[i] (for positive contribution) and similarly for negative.\n\nHowever, in the loop for i from 1 to n, we have:\n    dp[i] = max( i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) )\n\nThen we update the Fenwick trees and the dictionary dmx.\n\nBut note the comment: \n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should update dmx[pref[i]] to be at least dp[i]. Because dmx stores the best dp value for a given prefix sum.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: we are updating the Fenwick trees and the dictionary for each i. The dictionary dmx is used for the case when we have the same prefix sum, then we can extend without changing the sign? Actually, the recurrence considers three cases:\n  1. The current segment (from j+1 to i) is positive: then we get (i - j) and we add dp[j]. But note that the condition for positive is that pref[i] - pref[j] > 0, i.e., pref[i] > pref[j]. Then the recurrence would be: dp[j] + (i - j) = (dp[j] - j) + i.\n  2. The current segment is negative: then we get -(i - j) and we add dp[j]. Condition: pref[i] < pref[j]. Then recurrence: dp[j] - (i - j) = (dp[j] + j) - i.\n  3. The current segment is zero: then we get 0. Condition: pref[i] == pref[j]. Then recurrence: dp[j] + 0 = dp[j].\n\nThe third case is handled by the dictionary: we store the best dp[j] for a given prefix[j] (which equals prefix[i] in this case). Then we do: dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) to get the best dp[j] for which prefix[j] = prefix[i]. Then we set dp[i] to be at least that.\n\nTherefore, after computing dp[i], we must update the dictionary if we have a better dp value for the prefix sum pref[i]. So the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note that the code already checks: if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF): then we do something. So we can simply set:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBecause if dp[i] is greater than the current value, we update it.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the dictionary dmx was initialized with dmx[0] = 0 (for the prefix at index 0). Then for each i, we update.\n\nHowever, what if there are multiple indices with the same prefix? We want the best dp value for that prefix. So we update only when we have a better one? Actually, the code condition is: if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF). So we are updating only when we have a new maximum. Therefore, we set:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if we have two indices with the same prefix and the same dp value? Then we don't need to update because it's the same. But the condition is strict: only when dp[i] is greater. However, we might have the same value? Then we don't update. But that's okay because the Fenwick trees and the dictionary are updated for each index? Actually, the Fenwick trees are updated unconditionally. The dictionary update is only when we have a new maximum. But note: the recurrence for the same prefix might come from an earlier index with the same prefix and a higher dp value? Actually, we are storing the best dp value for the prefix. So we want the maximum. Therefore, we update the dictionary only when we have a new maximum.\n\nBut the problem: the recurrence for the zero segment uses the dictionary. So we want the best dp[j] for j < i with the same prefix. Therefore, we must update the dictionary with the current dp[i] only if it is at least as good as the current one? Actually, we want the maximum. So we should update the dictionary to the maximum value we have seen so far for that prefix.\n\nHowever, the code condition is: if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF). Then we set dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]. But what if we have a later index with a lower dp[i]? Then we don't update. That is correct because we want the best.\n\nBut note: the Fenwick trees are updated for every index. The Fenwick trees are for the conditions of positive and negative segments. The dictionary is for the zero segment. And we update the dictionary only when we have a new maximum for that prefix.\n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple indices with the same prefix? We want to store the best dp value for that prefix. The code condition ensures that we update the dictionary only when we have a new maximum. So we set it to the current dp[i] which is the new maximum.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nNow for program2.py:\nThe problem: We are allowed to choose any n-1 elements and replace them with their arithmetic mean. We can do this operation any number of times. We want to know if we can make all elements equal.\n\nThe provided code does:\n    sm = 0\n    for elem in a:\n        sm += elem\n\n    found = False\n    for elem in a:\n        lhs = elem\n        rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n        if lhs == rhs:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThen if found is True, it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThe idea: \n    If we have an element 'elem' such that when we replace the other n-1 elements by their mean, then the entire array becomes:\n        [ (sm - elem)/(n-1), ... , (sm - elem)/(n-1), elem ]\n\nBut note: the operation replaces the chosen n-1 elements by their mean. So after one operation, the array becomes:\n        [ (sm - elem)/(n-1), ... , (sm - elem)/(n-1), elem ]\n\nNow, for the entire array to be equal, we require:\n        (sm - elem)/(n-1) = elem\n\nWhich is what the condition checks: lhs = elem, rhs = (sm - elem)/(n-1). If they are equal, then we can do one operation and get all equal.\n\nBut note: what if we can do more than one operation? The problem says \"finite number\". \n\nHowever, note the note: \n    In the first test case, all elements are already equal -> then we don't need any operation? But the condition: for any element, (sm - elem)/(n-1) = (n*elem - elem)/(n-1) = (n-1)*elem/(n-1) = elem. So it would be true.\n\n    Second test case: [1,2,3,4,5] -> n=5. We choose all except the third (which is 3). Then the average of the others is (1+2+4+5)/4 = 12/4=3. Then the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3]. So we are done. And indeed, if we take elem=3: then (sm - 3)/(4) = (15-3)/4=12/4=3, which equals 3. So found becomes True.\n\nBut what if we can do more than one operation? The problem says \"finite number\". However, it turns out that if there is at least one element that satisfies the condition, then we can do one operation and get all equal. Conversely, if we can make all equal, then the common value must be the overall mean: total_sum / n. Then, for the array to be equal, we must have every element equal to total_sum / n. \n\nBut note: the operation: we choose n-1 elements and set them to their mean. The mean of n-1 elements is (total_sum - x) / (n-1) for the element x that we left out. Then we require that (total_sum - x) / (n-1) = total_sum / n? Actually, no: because after the operation, the entire array becomes: \n    [ (total_sum - x)/(n-1), ... , (total_sum - x)/(n-1), x ]\n\nThen for the entire array to be equal, we require that (total_sum - x)/(n-1) = x.\n\nBut note: we can do multiple operations. However, it turns out that if the entire array is not already constant, then we can only get to a constant array in one step if there is an element x such that (total_sum - x)/(n-1) = x. \n\nBut what if we do two operations? \n    Example: [1, 2, 3] (n=3). \n        total_sum = 6, mean = 2.\n        Condition: \n            For x=1: (6-1)/2 = 2.5 -> not equal to 1.\n            For x=2: (6-2)/2 = 2 -> equal to 2 -> so we can do: leave out 2, set the others to (1+3)/2=2 -> becomes [2,2,2]. \n        So it works.\n\n    But what about [0, 0, 1]? \n        total_sum = 1.\n        Condition: \n            For x=0: (1-0)/2 = 0.5 -> not 0.\n            For x=1: (1-1)/2 = 0 -> not 1.\n        So the condition fails.\n\n        Is it possible in two operations?\n            Operation 1: leave out the last element (1). Then set the first two to (0+0)/2 = 0 -> becomes [0,0,1] -> same as before.\n            Operation 1: leave out the first element (0). Then set the last two to (0+1)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0, 0.5, 0.5].\n            Now, total_sum = 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.\n            Operation 2: leave out the first element (0). Then set the last two to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0, 0.5, 0.5] -> same.\n            Operation 2: leave out one of the 0.5: then set the other two: (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25, 0.25, 0.5]. \n            Then we have [0.25,0.25,0.5] -> not constant.\n\n        Alternatively, Operation 1: leave out the first 0 -> becomes [0, 0.5, 0.5]. \n        Operation 2: leave out the last 0.5: then set the first two: (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.5]. \n        Then Operation 3: leave out the last 0.5: set the first two to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n        So we can do it in three operations? \n\n        But wait: the problem says: replace each of the chosen n-1 elements with their arithmetic mean. In the second operation: we leave out the last element (0.5) and replace the first two (0 and 0.5) by (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes [0.25, 0.25, 0.5]. \n\n        Then in the third operation: we leave out the last element (0.5) again? Then we set the first two to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n        So it is possible.\n\n        However, the condition in the code would not have found any element in the original array that satisfies the condition. But we did multiple operations.\n\n        How to resolve? \n\n        Claim: It is possible to make all elements equal if and only if the initial total_sum is 0 OR there exists at least one element x such that x = total_sum / n.\n\n        Why? \n          - If the entire array is already constant, then we are done. And then every element is total_sum/n.\n          - If the entire array is not constant, then note that the total sum remains invariant? \n\n          Actually, the total sum changes? \n\n          Operation: \n            Let the array be [a1, a2, ..., an]. We choose n-1 elements, say all except ak. Then the new array is:\n                [ (S - ak)/(n-1), (S - ak)/(n-1), ... , ak, ... , (S - ak)/(n-1) ]\n            The new total sum = (n-1) * (S - ak)/(n-1) + ak = (S - ak) + ak = S.\n\n          So the total sum S is invariant.\n\n          Therefore, if we ever make all elements equal to c, then we must have n*c = S -> c = S/n.\n\n          Now, the condition for one operation: we require that there is an element ak such that (S - ak)/(n-1) = ak -> S - ak = ak*(n-1) -> S = ak * n -> ak = S/n.\n\n          But what if we do multiple operations? \n            We require that at some operation, we have an element that is already S/n? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Operation 1: we leave out an element that is not necessarily S/n. Then we get a new array. Then we do operation 2, etc.\n\n          However, note that if we ever have an element that is S/n, then we can do an operation leaving that element out and setting the others to (S - S/n)/(n-1) = ( (n*S/n - S/n) )/(n-1) = ( (S*(n-1)/n) )/(n-1) = S/n. So then we get all equal.\n\n          Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that at some point we have at least one element equal to S/n.\n\n          But note: we can create an element equal to S/n? \n\n          Consider: \n            We start with an array that does not have S/n. \n            Operation 1: we leave out an element ak. Then we set the other n-1 elements to (S - ak)/(n-1). \n            Now, the new array has one element ak and the rest are (S-ak)/(n-1). \n\n            Now, if we leave out ak again? Then we set the other n-1 elements to the mean of the other n-1, which is (S - ak)/(n-1) (because they are all the same). Then the mean of the other n-1 is ( (n-1) * (S-ak)/(n-1) ) / (n-1) = (S-ak)/(n-1). Then the array becomes: \n                [ (S-ak)/(n-1), ... , (S-ak)/(n-1), ak]   -> same as after the first operation.\n\n            So we don't get a new element.\n\n          What if we leave out a different element? \n            After the first operation, we have an array: [x, x, ..., x, ak] (with ak at the original position). \n            Now, we leave out one of the x's? Then the mean of the other n-1 (which are: n-2 x's and ak) is: ( (n-2)*x + ak ) / (n-1). \n            Then the array becomes: \n                [ ( (n-2)*x + ak )/(n-1), ... , ( (n-2)*x + ak )/(n-1), x (at the position we left out) ]\n\n            Now, we have a new element: ( (n-2)*x + ak )/(n-1). \n\n            We require that either the new element is S/n or the element we left out (x) is S/n? \n\n          But note: x = (S - ak)/(n-1). And S is fixed.\n\n          Then the new element: \n            = ( (n-2)*(S-ak)/(n-1) + ak ) / (n-1)\n            = ( (n-2)(S-ak) + ak*(n-1) ) / ( (n-1)^2 )\n            = ( (n-2)S - (n-2)ak + (n-1)ak ) / ( (n-1)^2 )\n            = ( (n-2)S + ak ) / ( (n-1)^2 )\n\n          We want this to be S/n? \n            ( (n-2)S + ak ) / ( (n-1)^2 ) = S/n\n            => n*( (n-2)S + ak ) = S * (n-1)^2\n            => n(n-2)S + n*ak = S*(n^2 - 2n + 1)\n            => n*ak = S*(n^2 - 2n + 1 - n(n-2)) \n            => n*ak = S*(n^2 - 2n + 1 - n^2 + 2n)\n            => n*ak = S*(1)\n            => ak = S/n.\n\n          But ak was an element from the original array. So if the original array had an element ak = S/n, then we could have done one operation. \n\n          Therefore, if the original array does not have an element equal to S/n, then after one operation we get an array that still does not have an element equal to S/n? \n\n          Actually, we just showed that the new element we create is S/n only if ak = S/n (which we didn't have). \n\n          So how did we get [0,0,1] to work? \n            Original: [0,0,1] -> S=1, n=3, S/n = 1/3.\n            Operation 1: leave out the last element (1) -> set the first two to (0+0)/2 = 0 -> [0,0,1] -> same? \n            But wait, we can leave out a different element? \n\n            Operation 1: leave out the first 0 -> set the other two (0 and 1) to (0+1)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n                Actually, the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n                But the original array: [0,0,1] -> we left out the first 0, then we set the other two (which are the second 0 and the 1) to 0.5. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n                But the problem says: we replace the chosen n-1 elements (so the two we chose) by their mean. So the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n\n            Then total sum = 0.5+0.5+0 = 1 -> same.\n\n            Now, we have an array [0.5, 0.5, 0]. \n            Operation 2: leave out the last element (0). Then set the first two to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0] -> same? \n            Operation 2: leave out one of the 0.5. Then set the other two: (0.5 and 0) to (0.5+0)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]? \n            Then Operation 3: leave out the 0.5, set the other two to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n            How did we get the 0.25? \n\n            In the second operation: we left out the first element (0.5) and set the other two (the second element 0.5 and the last element 0) to (0.5+0)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]. \n\n            Then in the third operation: we left out the first element (0.5) and set the other two (0.25 and 0.25) to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n            So we did it.\n\n            But note: in the array [0.5,0.5,0] we have an element 0.5 which is not 1/3. But we did not use the condition of having an element equal to the overall mean? \n\n          However, the overall mean is 1/3. In the array [0.5,0.5,0] we have an element 0.5 which is greater than 1/3, and 0 which is less. \n\n          How did we get the 0.25? \n\n          The key: we don't require that an element is the overall mean at the beginning, but we can create one? \n\n          Actually, the condition for the second operation: \n            We had [0.5,0.5,0]. \n            We left out the first 0.5. Then we set the other two to (0.5+0)/2 = 0.25. \n            Then we have [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]. \n\n            Now, the element 0.25 is the overall mean? total_sum = 0.5+0.25+0.25 = 1 -> mean=1/3. 0.25 != 1/3. \n\n          Then how did we get to the final array? \n\n          In the third operation: we left out the first element (0.5) and set the other two (0.25 and 0.25) to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25. Then we have [0.25,0.25,0.25]. Now the entire array is 0.25, which is not 1/3? \n\n          But 0.25 * 3 = 0.75, not 1. \n\n          There is a mistake: \n            Original: [0,0,1] -> S=1.\n            Operation1: leave out the first 0 -> set the other two to (0+1)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0]? \n                Actually, the array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n                But then the total sum is 0.5+0.5+0 = 1 -> correct.\n            Operation2: leave out the last element (0) -> set the first two to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0] -> same? \n            Operation2: leave out the first element (0.5) -> set the other two (0.5 and 0) to (0.5+0)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.5]? \n                But note: we left out the first element (0.5) and replaced the other two (which are the second element 0.5 and the last element 0) by 0.25. Then the array becomes: [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]? \n                Actually, the first element is the one we left out, so it remains 0.5. The other two become 0.25. So the array is [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]. Total sum = 0.5+0.25+0.25=1.\n            Operation3: leave out the first element (0.5) -> set the other two to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n          Now, 0.25*3 = 0.75, but we need 1. This is a contradiction.\n\n          I see the error: in the first operation, when we leave out the first 0, we set the other two to (0+1)/2 = 0.5. Then the array becomes: \n                [0.5, 0.5, 1]? \n          But wait, we left out the first element (which was 0) and replaced the other two (the second 0 and the 1) by 0.5. Then the array becomes: \n                [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]? \n          No, because the element we left out remains. The problem says: replace each of the chosen n-1 elements. So the two chosen elements (the second and the third) become 0.5. The first element remains 0.5? \n\n          Actually, the operation: we choose the last two and replace them by their mean. So the array becomes: \n                [0, 0.5, 0.5]? \n\n          Then total sum = 0+0.5+0.5=1.\n\n          Then Operation2: we leave out the first element (0) and set the other two to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]. \n\n          So we did it in two operations.\n\n          Therefore, the condition: \n            In the original array: [0,0,1] -> we did not have an element 1/3. \n            But after the first operation, we had [0,0.5,0.5]. \n            Now, in the second operation, we can leave out the 0 and set the other two to 0.5 -> then we get [0.5,0.5,0.5]. \n            But note: in the array [0,0.5,0.5], we have an element 0.5 which is the overall mean? total_sum=1, mean=1/3. 0.5 != 1/3. \n\n          However, we did not use the condition of having an element equal to the overall mean in the intermediate array? \n\n          The condition for the second operation: we leave out the 0. Then the other two are 0.5 and 0.5. We set them to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5. Then the entire array becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]. \n\n          Why did that work? Because the two elements we set were already 0.5? \n\n          Actually, the condition for one operation to make the array constant is that there is an element x such that (S - x)/(n-1) = the common value we want, and then we set the other n-1 to that common value. But note: after the operation, the entire array becomes that common value. \n\n          In the second operation: we left out the 0. Then we set the other two to 0.5. Then the entire array becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]. So the common value is 0.5. But the total sum is 1.5? \n\n          No, the total sum after the first operation was 1. Then we set two elements to 0.5: but note, the element we left out (0) remains. Then we set the other two to 0.5 -> then the array becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]? \n\n          Actually, we left out the first element (which was 0) and then set the other two to 0.5. Then the array becomes: \n                [0, 0.5, 0.5] -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]? \n          How? \n\n          The operation: we choose n-1 elements (the last two) and replace each of them with their arithmetic mean. The mean of the last two is (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5. So we set both to 0.5. Then the array becomes: \n                [0, 0.5, 0.5] -> [0, 0.5, 0.5] becomes [0, 0.5, 0.5]? \n          But we set the two chosen elements to 0.5, so they were already 0.5? Then the array doesn't change? \n\n          I see the confusion: the operation replaces each of the chosen n-1 elements with the mean of the chosen n-1 elements. \n\n          In the array [0,0.5,0.5]: \n            We choose the last two: which are 0.5 and 0.5. Their mean is 0.5. Then we replace each of them with 0.5. So they remain 0.5. \n\n          Then the array remains [0,0.5,0.5]. \n\n          How did we get to [0.5,0.5,0.5]? \n\n          We must have done: \n            Operation2: leave out the first element (0) and then set the chosen two (the last two) to the mean of the chosen two, which is 0.5. Then the array becomes [0.5,0.5,0.5]? \n          But the first element is the one we left out, which remains 0. Then we set the last two to 0.5 -> so the array becomes [0, 0.5, 0.5] -> same as before.\n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          Let me re-read the problem: \n            \"replace each of them with their arithmetic mean\"\n\n          This means: we replace every chosen element by the same value: the mean of the chosen elements.\n\n          So in the array [0,0.5,0.5]: \n            We choose the last two: their mean is 0.5. Then we replace each of them by 0.5 -> so they remain 0.5. The array is unchanged.\n\n          How then did the example work? \n\n          The example: \n            [0,0,1] -> leave out the last element (1) -> then set the first two to (0+0)/2 = 0 -> becomes [0,0,1] -> unchanged.\n\n          Or leave out the first 0: then set the other two to (0+1)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0.5,0.5,0]? \n            The array becomes: [0.5, 0.5, 0]? \n            But the first element was left out? Then it becomes the new value? \n\n          The problem says: we replace each of the chosen n-1 elements. So the chosen elements are the last two: the two zeros? \n            Original: [0,0,1] -> we leave out the first 0. Then we choose the last two: the second 0 and the 1. We replace each of them by (0+1)/2 = 0.5. \n            Then the array becomes: [0, 0.5, 0.5]? \n\n          Then total sum = 0+0.5+0.5=1.\n\n          Then we leave out the first element (0) again? Then we set the last two to (0.5+0.5)/2 = 0.5 -> becomes [0,0.5,0.5] -> same.\n\n          Or we leave out the last element (0.5): then we set the first two to (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.5]. \n          Then total sum = 0.25+0.25+0.5 = 1.\n          Then we leave out the last element (0.5): set the first two to (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25]. \n\n          This works.\n\n          So the first operation: leave out the last element (1) -> then set the first two to (0+0)/2=0 -> unchanged.\n          Or leave out the first 0: then set the last two to (0+1)/2=0.5 -> becomes [0,0.5,0.5] -> wait, the first element is the one we left out, so it remains 0. The last two become 0.5. So [0,0.5,0.5].\n\n          Second operation: leave out the first element (0) -> then set the last two to (0.5+0.5)/2=0.5 -> unchanged.\n          Or leave out the second element (0.5): then set the first and the last to (0+0.5)/2=0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.5,0.25]? \n          Or leave out the third element (0.5): then set the first two to (0+0.5)/2=0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.5].\n\n          Third operation: in [0.25,0.25,0.5]: \n            We can leave out the last element (0.5): then set the first two to (0.25+0.25)/2=0.25 -> becomes [0.25,0.25,0.25].\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is not only that there is an element equal to the overall mean in the current array, but also that we can create an element equal to the overall mean in a future array? \n\n          However, note that the overall mean is always S/n = 1/3. In the array [0,0.5,0.5] we don't have 1/3. In [0.25,0.25,0.5] we don't have 1/3. In the final array [0.25,0.25,0.25] we have 0.25 which is not 1/3? \n\n          But 0.25 * 3 = 0.75, not 1. \n\n          There is a mistake in the example: \n            Original: [0,0,1] -> S=1.\n            After first operation: leave out the first 0: then the chosen elements are the last two: [0,1] -> mean = 0.5. Then the array becomes: [0.5,0.5,0]? \n            But the first element was left out, so it remains 0? \n            The problem says: we replace each of the chosen n-1 elements. So the chosen elements become 0.5. The array becomes: \n                [0 (unchanged), 0.5, 0.5] -> [0,0.5,0.5].\n\n          Then total sum = 0+0.5+0.5=1.\n\n          Then second operation: leave out the last element (0.5): then the chosen elements are the first two: [0,0.5] -> mean = (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25. Then we replace the first two by 0.25. The array becomes: \n                [0.25,0.25,0.5].\n\n          Then third operation: leave out the last element (0.5): then the chosen elements are the first two: [0.25,0.25] -> mean = 0.25. Then we replace the first two by 0.25. The array becomes: \n                [0.25,0.25,0.25].\n\n          Now, 0.25 * 3 = 0.75, but the total sum should be 1. \n\n          This is the error: the total sum after the first operation: 0+0.5+0.5=1.\n          After the second operation: 0.25+0.25+0.5 = 1.\n          After the third operation: 0.25+0.25+0.25 = 0.75 -> not 1.\n\n          I see the mistake: in the second operation, when we leave out the last element (0.5), we replace the chosen two (the first two) by the mean of the chosen two. The mean of the chosen two is (0+0.5)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes: \n                [0.25,0.25,0.5] -> total sum = 0.25+0.25+0.5 = 1.\n\n          In the third operation: we leave out the last element (0.5) and replace the chosen two (the first two) by their mean: (0.25+0.25)/2 = 0.25. Then the array becomes: \n                [0.25,0.25,0.25] -> total sum = 0.25*3 = 0.75, which is not 1.\n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          The problem: the operation should be: \n            We choose n-1 elements. We replace each of them by the arithmetic mean of the chosen n-1 elements.\n\n          In the third operation: the chosen two are the first two: [0.25,0.25]. Their mean is 0.25. Then we replace each of them by 0.25 -> so they remain 0.25. The last element is left out, so it remains 0.5. \n          Therefore, the array remains [0.25,0.25,0.5].\n\n          So we cannot change the last element to 0.25 by leaving it out? \n\n          To change the last element, we would have to leave it out in an operation? But then we would set the other two to their mean, which is 0.25, and then the array becomes [0.25,0.25,0.5] -> the last element remains 0.5.\n\n          How then can we change the last element to 0.25? \n\n          We must leave it in the chosen set in some operation. But if we leave it in the chosen set, then we are not allowed to change it individually; we change it to the mean of the chosen set. \n\n          In the array [0.25,0.25,0.5]: \n            If we leave out no element? We have to leave out one element. \n            If we leave out one of the 0.25's, then the chosen set is the other 0.25 and the 0.5. Their mean is (0.25+0.5)/2 = 0.375. Then we set both chosen elements to 0.375. The array becomes: \n                [0.25 (unchanged), 0.375, 0.375] -> [0.25,0.375,0.375] -> total sum = 1.\n            Then we can try to leave out the 0.25: then the chosen set is the two 0.375's -> mean=0.375. Then we set them to 0.375 -> unchanged.\n            Or leave out one of the 0.375's: then the chosen set is the 0.25 and the other 0.375 -> mean = (0.25+0.375)/2 = 0.3125. Then the array becomes: \n                [0.3125,0.375,0.3125] -> total sum = 1.\n\n          It seems we can never make them all equal.\n\n          Therefore, the example [0,0,1] might be impossible? \n\n          But the film example: \n            \"For example, from the array [1,2,3,1] we can get the array [2,2,2,1]\"\n            and then they did one operation and then another? \n\n          The note: \n            \"It's possible to show that it's impossible to make all elements equal in the third and fourth test cases.\"\n\n          The third test case: \n            Input: \n                3\n                0 2 0\n            Output: NO\n\n          The fourth test case: \n                4\n                3 3 3 3\n            Output: YES\n\n          So [0,0,1] should be impossible? \n\n          But the sample input says: \n            The first test case: already equal.\n            The second test case: [1,2,3,4,5] -> YES.\n            The third and fourth: NO.\n\n          Therefore, the example [0,0,1] is the third test case? \n\n          So it should be NO.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: \n            It is possible if and only if the array is already constant OR there is at least one element equal to the overall mean.\n\n          Why? \n            - If the array is already constant, then we are done.\n            - If there is an element x such that x = S/n, then we can do one operation: leave out that element and set the others to (S - x)/(n-1) = (S - S/n)/(n-1) = (S(n-1)/n) / (n-1) = S/n. Then the array becomes all S/n.\n\n          But note: the array might not be originally constant, but have an element equal to S/n. For example, [1,2,3,4,5]: S=15, n=5, S/n=3. And there is a 3. \n\n          What about [1,0,0]? \n            S=1, n=3, S/n=1/3. \n            Is there an element 1/3? No. \n            And the array is not constant. \n            -> NO.\n\n          What about [0,0,0]? \n            Already constant -> YES.\n\n          What about [1,1,1]? \n            Already constant -> YES.\n\n          What about [1,1,0]? \n            S=2, n=3, S/n=2/3. \n            Is there an element 2/3? No. -> NO.\n\n          What about [2,2,2,0]? \n            S=6, n=4, S/n=1.5.\n            Is there an element 1.5? No. -> NO.\n\n          What about [2,2,2,6]? \n            S=12, n=4, S/n=3.\n            Is there an element 3? No. -> NO.\n\n          What about [3,3,3,3]? \n            Already constant -> YES.\n\n          What about [1,2]? \n            But n>=3.\n\n          Therefore, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n            if the array is already constant: then YES.\n            else if there is at least one element equal to (total_sum / n): then YES.\n            else: NO.\n\n          But note: the array might become constant after more than one operation even if there is no element equal to S/n initially? We saw that [0,0,1] is not possible. And the note says the third and fourth test cases are impossible.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            total_sum = sum(a)\n            if all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n                found = True\n            else:\n                found = any(x == total_sum / n for x in a)\n\n          However, note: total_sum/n might not be an integer, and the array contains integers. But the mean might be fractional. The condition checks for equality of an integer and a float. This might be problematic.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3] -> total_sum=6, n=3, mean=2.0. Then we have an element 2.0 -> which is 2. So it will be true.\n\n          But what if the mean is not an integer? For example, [0,0,1]: total_sum=1, mean=1/3\u22480.333. The array has only integers: 0,0,1. Then there is no element equal to 1/3. So we return NO.\n\n          How to check: \n            We can do: total_sum % n == 0 and (total_sum // n) in a\n\n          Because if total_sum is not divisible by n, then there is no integer in the array that equals the mean. But the array contains integers. And the mean is total_sum/n. For an integer in the array to equal total_sum/n, we must have total_sum divisible by n and then the integer must be total_sum//n.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if all(x == a[0] for x in a):\n                found = True\n            else:\n                if total_sum % n != 0:\n                    found = False\n                else:\n                    mean = total_sum // n\n                    found = any(x == mean for x in a)\n\n          But note: the array might have negative numbers? The input says: \"0<=a_i<=100\", so nonnegative.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do in the existing loop:\n\n            for elem in a:\n                # We are doing: if elem == (total_sum - elem) / (n-1)  -> which is the condition for one operation to work.\n                # But this condition is equivalent to: n * elem = total_sum.\n\n            Because: \n                elem = (total_sum - elem) / (n-1)\n                => elem * (n-1) = total_sum - elem\n                => elem * n = total_sum\n\n            So the condition in the loop is exactly checking if there is an element elem such that n * elem = total_sum.\n\n          Therefore, the existing condition in the loop is sufficient. But note: the array might be already constant, then we don't need to find such an element? \n\n          However, if the array is already constant, say all elements are c, then total_sum = n * c. Then for any element c, we have: \n                c = (n*c - c) / (n-1) = ( (n-1)*c ) / (n-1) = c.\n\n          So the condition will be true for every element.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            found = False\n            for elem in a:\n                if n * elem == total_sum:   # because then (total_sum - elem) = n*elem - elem = (n-1)*elem, then divided by (n-1) is elem.\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n          But note: the condition in the code is: \n                lhs = elem\n                rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n                if lhs == rhs:\n\n          This is the same as: \n                elem == (sm - elem) / (n-1)\n\n          But this is comparing an integer (elem) to a float. This might be inexact. \n\n          We can avoid float by: \n                if n * elem == total_sum:   # because then (total_sum - elem) = n*elem - elem = (n-1)*elem, so (total_sum - elem) / (n-1) = elem.\n\n          But note: total_sum = sm.\n\n          So we can change the condition to:\n\n                if n * elem == sm:   # then we have found one.\n\n          However, the problem says the array has integers and the operations might produce non-integers, but the condition for the existence of an element that satisfies the equation is an integer condition.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n                if n * elem == sm:   # then we set found to True and break.\n\n          But the code already has:\n\n                if lhs == rhs:\n\n          This might work for small integers, but for larger ones, floating point might be inexact.\n\n          Since n<=50 and sm and elem are integers, we can do integer arithmetic:\n\n                if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n\n          This is equivalent.\n\n          So we can change the condition to:\n\n                if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n\n          Or we can break out as soon as we find one.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code in the TODO is:\n\n                found = True\n                break\n\n          Because if we find one element that satisfies the condition, then we can make the array constant in one operation, so we break and output YES.\n\n          But note: the array might be already constant, then we find the condition true for the first element and break.\n\n          So the code becomes:\n\n            sm = 0\n            for elem in a:\n                sm += elem\n\n            found = False\n            for elem in a:\n                # Avoid floating point: use integer condition.\n                if elem * (n-1) == sm - elem:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n          Then output YES if found, else NO.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50*200=10000\", so n is at most 50 and t<=200, so the loop is efficient.\n\n          But note: the array might be already constant, then we break at the first element.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                    found = True\n                    break\n\n          But note: the code already has the condition:\n\n                if lhs == rhs:\n\n          And we want to set found to True and break out of the loop.\n\n          So we put:\n\n                found = True\n                break\n\n          inside the if.\n\nSummary:\n\n  For program1.py: \n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n  For program2.py:\n        found = True\n        break\n\n  But note: in program1.py, the line is inside an if block: \n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we output: \n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n  And in program2.py, inside the if block: \n        if lhs == rhs:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We output:\n        found = True\n        break\n\n  However, the problem says: output only the missing code, and in the format: \n        {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  We must output the exact code that is missing.\n\n  But note: in program1.py, the missing code is one line. In program2.py, the missing code is two lines.\n\n  We output as a JSON string.\n\n  Example: \n        {\"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"found = True\\n                    break\"}\n\n  However, we must be cautious about indentation. In program1.py, the indentation level is 8 (inside the for loop and the if). In program2.py, the indentation level is 8 (inside the for loop and the if).\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code, so we output the code as it would appear.\n\n  For program1.py: the missing line is at the same indentation as the comment, which is 8 spaces.\n\n  For program2.py: the missing two lines: \n        found = True\n        break\n\n  But note: the break should be at the same level as the assignment. And the existing code has 8 spaces for the for loop and 12 spaces for the if. So we output:\n\n        found = True\n        break\n\n  with 12 spaces for the first line and 12 for the second? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, in the provided code, the if block in program2.py is indented by 8 (from the for) and then the condition is indented by 12. The TODO is at 12. So the missing code should be at 12.\n\n  But the break should be at 12 as well.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the code as it is in the TODO, without worrying about the exact indentation? The problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n  Since the TODO is at a certain indentation level, we output the code at that level.\n\n  However, the problem does not require the exact indentation? It requires that the program runs correctly. So we output the code that is syntactically correct.\n\n  In program1.py: the line \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" should be at the same indentation as the comment above it (which is 8 spaces).\n\n  In program2.py: the two lines should be at the same indentation as the condition (which is 12 spaces).\n\n  But to be safe, we output the code without extra spaces? The problem does not specify.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code as it would be written in the program.\n\n  We'll assume:\n\n    program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n    program2: \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  But wait, in the provided program1.py, the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n  Let me count:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The if block is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12.\n\n  So the missing line should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n        for elem in a:\n            lhs = elem\n            rhs = ((sm - elem) / (n-1))\n            if lhs == rhs:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The if block is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12.\n\n  So the two lines should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py: \n        \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n  For program2.py: \n        \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  But note: the break should be at the same level as the assignment.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n        program2: \"            found = True\\n            break\"\n\n  But the problem says: the output format is a JSON string.\n\n  We must escape the newline in program2.\n\n  In JSON, we can use \\n.\n\n  So the output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"            found = True\\n            break\"}\n\n  However, the exact number of spaces: \n        In program1: the line after the if is indented by 4 more than the if. So 8 (for the for) + 4 (for the if) = 12? But the code has 8 for the for and 12 for the if body? \n\n  Actually, the provided code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n  In program1.py:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            ...   # 4 spaces for the for body\n            if ...:\n                ...   # 4 more spaces -> 8 in total.\n\n  But the TODO comment is at 8 spaces? \n\n  In the provided code: \n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = ...   # this line is at 4 spaces? \n            pfen.modify(...)   # 4 spaces\n            nfen.modify(...)   # 4 spaces\n            if ...:   # 4 spaces\n                # TODO:   # 8 spaces\n\n  So the missing line should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  But wait, the code in the for loop is at 4 spaces. The if is at 4 spaces, and the body of the if is at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing line is at 8 spaces: \n        \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n  But the existing code has 4 spaces per level. The for loop body is indented by 4. The if is at 4, and the body of the if is 8.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py:\n\n        for elem in a:\n            lhs = elem   # 4 spaces\n            rhs = ...    # 4 spaces\n            if lhs == rhs:   # 4 spaces\n                # TODO:     # 8 spaces\n\n  So the missing code should be at 8 spaces: \n        \"    found = True\"\n        \"    break\"\n\n  But then we have two lines: \n        \"    found = True\\n    break\"\n\n  However, the problem says: the total of n over test cases is at most 500000, and the constraints are high, so we break as soon as we find one.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        program1: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n        program2: \"    found = True\\n    break\"\n\n  But wait, in program1.py, the line is inside the if and the for, so 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the code in program1.py uses 4 spaces per indent. The for loop is at 0, then the body of the for is 4, then the body of the if is 8.\n\n  But the TODO is at 8 spaces. So we output 8 spaces? \n\n  However, the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? It requires that the program runs. And the provided code has the TODO at 8 spaces.\n\n  We output:\n\n        program1: 8 spaces: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n        program2: 8 spaces: \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  But 8 spaces is two indents (if one indent is 4). \n\n  Alternatively, we can count the spaces in the provided code.\n\n  In program1.py, the line above the TODO: \n        \"            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\"\n\n  How many spaces? The entire code:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for loop starts at column 0, then the next lines are indented by 4. The if is at 4, and the body (the comment) is at 8.\n\n  So the missing line should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  Similarly in program2.py.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n        program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n        program2: \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the break is a separate line.\n\n  We output as a JSON string with a newline escape.\n\n  Final output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"        found = True\\n        break\"}\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code for program2 is two lines. We output the two lines as one string with a newline.\n\n  But the program2.py code after insertion should be:\n\n            if lhs == rhs:\n                found = True\n                break\n\n  with 8 spaces for the two lines.\n\n  But the existing condition is at 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the condition is at 4 spaces (inside the for loop). The if body should be at 8. \n\n  So the two lines are:\n\n        \"        found = True\"\n        \"        break\"\n\n  Combined with a newline: \"        found = True\\n        break\"\n\n  This will be 8 spaces for each line.\n\n  Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n  Note: the problem says the total of n over test cases in program1 is <= 500000, and the constraints are high, so the solution must be efficient. Our solution for program1 is O(n log n) and for program2 is O(n) per test case.\n\n  We believe the completions are correct."
