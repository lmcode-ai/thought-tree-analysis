    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe input has multiple test cases. The total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\nThe current code sets up:\n  data = (line.strip() for line in stdin.readlines()[1:])\n  Then for each test case, we read n and then n strings.\n\nWe have a counter for the strings we've seen so far in the current test case.\n\nThe current loop for each string ab (which is two characters) does:\n  ctr[ab] += 1\n  Then for each letter in LETTERS (from 'a' to 'k'):\n      if l != a: \n          ... (missing code)\n      if l != b:\n          s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut note: the problem says we want pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\nThere are two ways to differ in exactly one position:\n  1. The first character is the same and the second character differs.\n  2. The second character is the same and the first character differs.\n\nThe current code in the second part (if l != b) is counting the pairs where the first character is the same (because we are using the same a) and the second character is l (which is different from b). This counts the pairs for the second character differing.\n\nBut what about the first character differing and the second being the same? That is missing.\n\nIn the current code, the first if block (if l != a) is empty. We should fill that.\n\nWe can do:\n  For the first character differing: we consider the string (l, b) where l is any letter except a. Then we would add ctr[f'{l}{b}'] to s.\n\nBut note: the current code in the second if block is for the second character: we are adding ctr[f'{a}{l}'].\n\nSo we can complete the first if block similarly.\n\nTherefore, in the first if block (when l != a) we can do:\n  s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nBut wait: we are iterating over every letter l in LETTERS (which is 11 letters). For each string, we are going to do 11*2 = 22 iterations. And the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so 22*10^5 = 2.2e6 which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that the counter is being updated as we go. We are processing the strings one by one. When we process a string ab, we haven't added it to the counter for the current test case until after we update the counter? Actually, we update the counter at the beginning of the loop for ab.\n\nBut in the same loop, we are using the counter to add the counts for the strings that we have already processed (which are the ones before the current one). So the current ab is not in the counter when we do the s += ... because we just did ctr[ab] += 1, but then we are using the counter that now includes the current ab? Actually, we want to count pairs (i, j) with i<j. We are processing the current string (which will be j) and we are looking at the strings we have already processed (i.e., i from 0 to j-1). So when we add the current ab to the counter, then the counter now includes the current ab. But then when we process the next string, the current ab will be in the counter. However, in the current iteration, we are adding the counts of strings that we have already processed (which are the ones that are in the counter at the moment we start the inner loops). But note: we updated the counter at the beginning of the loop. So when we do the inner loops, the counter already includes the current string? That would be wrong because we would count the current string with itself? But we are looking for pairs (i, j) with i<j. We are processing the j-th string and we are counting the pairs (i, j) for i<j. We have already processed the previous j-1 strings and they are in the counter. We add the current string to the counter and then immediately use the counter to count pairs? Then the current string is included and we might count (j, j) if we are not careful? But note: we are generating strings that are different: for the first part, we are generating f'{l}{b}' which is different from ab (because l != a) so the current ab is not in the set of strings we are counting? Actually, the current ab is in the counter? But we are looking for the string f'{l}{b}' which is not ab (because l != a). So the current ab is not going to be counted in the first part? Similarly for the second part.\n\nBut wait: what if we have the same string appearing multiple times? Then the counter for that string would be more than one. And when we process the current ab, we are adding the entire count of the string f'{l}{b}' that we have seen so far (including the ones that are the same as the current ab? no, because the current ab is ab, and we are looking for f'{l}{b}' which is a different string). So it's safe.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says the strings are of two letters. We are counting pairs that differ in exactly one position. We are counting:\n\n  For the current string ab, we count:\n      - All strings that are of the form ?b (where ? is any letter except a) -> this covers the case where the first character is different and the second is the same.\n      - All strings that are of the form a? (where ? is any letter except b) -> this covers the case where the first character is the same and the second is different.\n\nBut note: we are not double counting? Because if a string differs in both positions, we don't count it. And if it differs in exactly one, we count it exactly once.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: what if the string we are comparing to is the same as the current string? Then we would not count it because we require l != a and l != b. So same string is not counted? But we are also not including the current string in the counter until we update it? Actually, we update the counter at the beginning of the loop. Then we do the inner loops. So when we look for f'{l}{b}' (for the first part) we are including the current string? But the current string is ab, and we are looking for f'{l}{b}' which is not ab (because l != a). So the current string is not included in the count for the first part? Similarly for the second part.\n\nBut wait: what if we have duplicate strings? For example, if we have two \"ab\" strings. When we process the second \"ab\", we have already added the first \"ab\" to the counter. Then in the inner loops for the second \"ab\", we will count the first \"ab\" in the second part? Actually, no: because in the second part we are looking for strings of the form a? with ? != b. The string \"ab\" is not of that form. Similarly, in the first part we are looking for ?b with ? != a -> again, \"ab\" is not of that form. So we are not counting the same string.\n\nBut note: we are counting pairs (i, j) with i<j. We are processing the j-th string and we are counting the pairs (i, j) for i from 0 to j-1. So we are not including the current string in the counter until after we have used it? Actually, we update the counter at the beginning of the loop. Then we do the inner loops. So when we process the j-th string, the counter already has the j-th string? Then when we do the inner loops, we are including the j-th string? But we are looking for pairs (i, j) with i<j. The counter at the moment of processing the j-th string includes the j-th string and all the previous ones. Then when we look for the string f'{l}{b}' (for the first part) we are including the j-th string? But the j-th string is ab, and we are looking for f'{l}{b}' which is not ab. So the j-th string is not included. Therefore, the count we get for the j-th string is only the previous strings (i from 0 to j-1) that form a pair with j.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n  For the current string ab (which we have just added to the counter, so the counter now has the current string as well as the previous ones, but we are only going to count the previous ones because the current string doesn't match the pattern we are looking for? because we are excluding the current letter) we do:\n\n      for l in LETTERS:\n          if l != a:\n              s += ctr.get(f'{l}{b}', 0)   # but note: the counter might not have that key? so we can use ctr[f'{l}{b}'] but if the key is absent, it returns 0 because of Counter? Actually, Counter returns 0 for missing keys.\n\n          if l != b:\n              s += ctr.get(f'{a}{l}', 0)\n\nBut wait: the current code uses: s += ctr[f'{a}{l}'] and that works because Counter returns 0 for missing keys? Actually, yes.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n      for l in LETTERS:\n          if l != a:\n              s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n          if l != b:\n              s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut note: this counts the pairs for the two cases. However, is there a possibility of double counting? Consider a string that differs in both positions? Actually, no: because we are only counting the pairs that differ in exactly one position. The two cases are disjoint: either the first character is the same and the second differs, or the second is the same and the first differs. There is no string that is counted in both because if a string has the same first character and same second character, it's the same string and we skip. If it has the same first and different second, then it is only in the second part. If it has different first and same second, then only in the first part. If it has both different, we skip.\n\nBut wait: what if we have a string that is, say, \"cb\" for the current string \"ab\"? Then:\n  For the first part: we look for strings of the form ?b (with ? != a). We would consider l='c', then we look for \"cb\", which is present? and we add one for the string \"cb\". \n  For the second part: we look for strings of the form a? (with ? != b). We would consider l='c'? but wait, the string \"ac\" is not the same as \"cb\". So we don't count \"cb\" again.\n\nSo no double counting.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is to add the line: \n    s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\nin the first if block.\n\nBut note: the current code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then the next if block. We must fill the first if block.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n    s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nBut wait: the current code already has the second if block. We are only missing the first if block.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to determine if a six-digit ticket is lucky (sum of first three equals sum of last three).\n\nWe are reading t test cases. Each test case is a string of six digits.\n\nThe current code sets:\n  s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\n  Then for each string i in s, we need to process.\n\nWe are to output \"YES\" if the ticket is lucky, else \"NO\".\n\nWe can do:\n  For a string tic, let first three digits: tic[0], tic[1], tic[2] -> convert to int and sum.\n  Last three: tic[3], tic[4], tic[5] -> convert to int and sum.\n\nThen compare.\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is a string of six digits.\n\nSo for each test case string i (which is six characters), we can do:\n\n  sum1 = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n  sum2 = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n  if sum1 == sum2:\n      r.append(\"YES\")\n  else:\n      r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the example: \"213132\" -> 2+1+3 = 6, 1+3+2=6 -> YES.\n\nWe can write that.\n\nBut the code currently has:\n  for i in s:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to replace the TODO with the above.\n\nBut note: the variable i is the string of six digits.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n  if i:  # in case there is an empty line? but the problem says one string of six digits per test case, and we stripped, so probably not. But the total test cases is t, and we have t lines. So we can assume each i is non-empty.\n      part1 = i[:3]\n      part2 = i[3:]\n      s1 = sum(int(x) for x in part1)\n      s2 = sum(int(x) for x in part2)\n      if s1 == s2:\n          r.append(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          r.append(\"NO\")\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n      if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])):\n          r.append(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the input has t test cases, and the first line is t. We have taken [1:] so s is the list of the next t lines.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n  for ticket in s:\n      if sum(int(x) for x in ticket[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in ticket[3:]):\n          r.append(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut the variable in the loop is named i, so:\n\n  for i in s:\n      if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]):\n          r.append(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is a string of six digits. We can assume that.\n\nAlternatively, we can do without an if for empty? because the input specification says each test case is one string of six digits.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]):\n          r.append(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says we can output in any case. We are outputting \"YES\" and \"NO\".\n\nNow, we must output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line: \"s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\" (with proper indentation). But note: the existing code has two if blocks. We are only replacing the first if block's TODO.\n\nBut the existing code for the first if block is:\n\n        if l != a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with: s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nBut note: the existing code for the second if block is:\n\n        if l != b:\n            s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nSo the entire block becomes:\n\n        if l != a:\n            s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n        if l != b:\n            s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program1.py, the missing code is the single line: \"s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\" (with the same indentation as the comment). However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the part that replaces the TODO. So for program1.py, we are only replacing the TODO line. We are not replacing the entire block.\n\nBut the TODO is a single line? Actually, the TODO is a comment and then we have to put a line of code. So the missing code for program1.py is the string: \"s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\" (with 8 spaces of indentation? because the for loop is inside the for ab, which is inside the for line, etc.)? But the problem says: output the missing code as a string that can be inserted.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in JSON.\n\nWe are to output:\n\n{ \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\nFor program1, the completion is the line that goes in place of the TODO. But note: the TODO is currently a comment. We are replacing the entire line? Actually, the line is:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with:\n\n            s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nBut note: the next line is \"if l != b:\". So we are only replacing that one line.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the TODO is:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with a block of code? Actually, we are replacing it with:\n\n        if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO. So for program2, we are replacing the TODO with the above 5 lines (with proper indentation). The current indentation level is 4 (because it's inside the for loop and the function). So the code we write should be indented by 4 more? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the variable r is defined in the function as r = [].\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else \"NO\")\n\nThis is one line and might be simpler.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is six digits, so we can use:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nThis is one line and fits.\n\nBut the problem does not require the most efficient, and t <= 1000, so either way is acceptable.\n\nSo for program2, the missing code can be:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(int(i[j]) for j in range(3)) == sum(int(i[j]) for j in range(3,6)) else 'NO')\n\nBut we can also break it down. However, the one-liner is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", so we can output the one line.\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\n\nBut we must be cautious: the variable i is the string. We can use i as the variable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n        if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So we can output either. However, the problem does not specify which one. We choose the one-liner for brevity.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only outputting the missing part.\n\nNow, we must format the output as JSON.\n\nThe missing code for program1 is a string: \"        s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\" (with 8 spaces). But note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the inner for loop. The for loop over l is at 8 spaces, and the if blocks are at 12 spaces. So the line we are adding is at 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        for l in LETTERS:\n            if l != a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if l != b:\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nSo the TODO is at 16 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n    for ab in islice(data, n):\n        a, b = ab\n        ctr[ab] += 1\n        for l in LETTERS:\n            if l != a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if l != b:\n                s += ctr[f'{a}{l}']\n\nThe for l loop is at 8 spaces (one level of indentation). The if statements are at 12 spaces. The TODO line is at 16 spaces.\n\nSo the line we add should be at 16 spaces: \"                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\"\n\nBut note: we are replacing the entire line that currently has the TODO comment. So we replace:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nwith:\n\n                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\n\nSo the string for program1 is: \"                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we are replacing:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nwith:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\n\nBut note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the for loop, and the TODO is at 8 spaces? Actually, the for loop is at 4 spaces (inside the function) and the TODO is at 8 spaces. So the replacement line should be at 8 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\n\nSo the string for program2 is: \"        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\"\n\nBut note: we must escape the string for JSON? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we are to output a JSON string. We must escape the quotes and backslashes.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in JSON. So we must format the JSON properly.\n\nBut the example output format is: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe can use double quotes for the JSON keys and values. But the completion strings contain single quotes. We can use single quotes for the outer JSON? Actually, the example uses curly quotes which are not standard. We should use standard double quotes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double quotes for the outer JSON and then escape the double quotes inside the completion strings. But the completion strings for program2 use single quotes, so we don't need to escape.\n\nBut for program1, we have an f-string that has single quotes: f'{l}{b}'. So we can represent that as a string without any issue.\n\nSo the JSON will be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\",\n  \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 string has a newline? No, it's one line. Similarly, program2 is one line.\n\nBut wait: the program2 code we are writing is one line. But the existing code after the TODO is:\n\n    return r\nprint(*main(), sep='\\n')\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with one line.\n\nSo we output the JSON as a string.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the JSON as described.\n\nLet me write the JSON:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\", \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\"}\n\nBut we must be cautious: the program1 string has a single quote inside. That is acceptable in a JSON string if we use double quotes for the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  \"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f\\\"{l}{b}\\\"]\"\n\nBut that would change the code? The original code uses single quotes. We must output the exact code.\n\nBut the problem does not require escaping? Actually, the JSON standard requires that we escape double quotes and backslashes. But our string does not have double quotes. It has single quotes, which are allowed.\n\nSo we can write the JSON as above.\n\nBut note: the program1 string has a format string: f'{l}{b}'. This is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n{\"program1\": \"                s += ctr[f'{l}{b}']\", \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else 'NO')\"}\n\nBut wait: the program2 code uses single quotes. That is acceptable in Python.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double quotes in the program2 code? But the problem does not care. We can write:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut then we have to escape the double quotes in the JSON string? \n\nWe can do either. Since the problem does not specify, we choose the one that is easier.\n\nBut the original program2 code uses single quotes for the string in the print? Actually, no, it uses double quotes in the example? The example output is \"YES\" and \"NO\". But in the code we can use either.\n\nTo avoid escaping in JSON, we can use single quotes in the code for the string. So we use the version with single quotes.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut note: the program1 code: the line we are adding is exactly as above.\n\nLet me check the indentation: \n  The for l loop is at 8 spaces, then the if l != a: is at 12 spaces, then the added line is at 16 spaces. So 16 spaces.\n\nWe have 16 spaces: \"                \" (16 spaces) then the code.\n\nSo we output that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the JSON object as above."
