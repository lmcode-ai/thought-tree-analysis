But the sequence becomes [1,2,1] -> then operation2: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,2,0] \n                then operation3: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> [1,1,0]\n                operation4: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0,0]\n                operation5: (1,0) -> (0,0) -> [0,0,0] -> 5 operations.

So [2::2] gives the lines: line2, line4, line6, ... which are the lines containing the arrays.

We want:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(set(a)) < b:\n                            ans = b\n                        else:\n                            ans = b+1\n\n                But the provided code has a while loop that pops a and then checks if the remaining list has q? We can do:\n\n                    # Remove the while loop and do:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(a) ! = len(set(a)):\n                            ans = b\n                        else:\n                            ans = b+1\n\n                But the provided code has a while loop and a TODO inside.

But the current print is: \n                    print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c) We want to print ans. So the block for program2.py:\n\n                    We replace from the line \"while a:\" to the print statement. We do:\n\n                    # Remove the while loop and the TODO, and then:\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                            ans = b+1\n                        else:\n                            ans = b\n                    print(ans)\n\n                But note: the variable b = len(a) = n. So we can write:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = n - c\n                    else:\n                        if has_duplicate = (len(a) ! = len(set(a))) then if has_duplicate: ans = n\n                        else: ans = n+1\n\n                But we can do:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:",

Then it considers a = i and a = div (which is half_perimeter//i). But note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of half_perimeter are not the same as the divisors of the entire boundary. For example, if half_perimeter = 6, then the divisors of half_perimeter are 1,2,3,6. But the entire boundary is 12, which has divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12. So the provided code is only iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter, not the entire boundary. And then it considers a = i and a = div, which are divisors of half_perimeter. But we need divisors of 2*half_perimeter.",

But wait: why is a=2 valid? Condition 3: because 2 divides (3-1)=2 and 2 divides (5-1)=4. So condition 3 holds. But note: condition 3 corresponds to the side breakdown: \n   top: w-1 = 2\n   bottom: w-1 = 2\n   left: l-1 = 4\n   right: l-1 = 4 Then we can use a=2: \n        top: 2/2=1 tile\n        bottom: 2/2=1 tile\n        left: 4/2=2 tiles\n        right: 4/2=2 tiles. So it works. But what about a=3? Condition 1: \n   top: w=3 -> divisible by 3 -> 1 tile\n   bottom: 3 -> 1 tile\n   left: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3 -> 1 tile\n   right: 3 -> 1 tile. So it works. Therefore, we can implement. But note: the provided code for program1.py already has:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        ... But we are going to replace that?",

However, we must be cautious: the modulo operation: \n        (w-2) % a might be 0, and l % a might be 0 -> then condition2 holds. So we can write the condition as above. But note: the condition for condition1: we require (l-2) % a == 0. But if l-2 is 0? but l>=3, so l-2>=1. Similarly, w-2>=1. Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is to replace the entire for-test-case body from the line \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the for loop? But the provided code has:\n\n        for w, l in zip(...):\n            half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n            solutions = {1,2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                ... \n            # then appends\n\n   We want to replace from \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the for loop (which is the inner for loop) with:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2) divisors_total = set()\n        #",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are tiling a bathroom of dimensions w x l.\nThe interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) tiles of 1x1.\nThe boundary uses tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, so effectively a can be the length in either dimension).\n\nThe boundary has a perimeter of 2*(w+l) - 4 (because the four corners are shared by two sides? Actually, note: the entire floor is covered. The boundary is the outer part. The interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The total tiles without the boundary would be w*l, so the boundary tiles count is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the boundary is to be tiled with 1xa tiles. However, the boundary is not a continuous strip? Actually, the boundary consists of four sides. The two sides of length w (top and bottom) and two sides of length l (left and right). But note the corners are shared. So the total boundary length (if we consider as a continuous strip) is 2*(w+l) - 4? Actually, the boundary is broken into four segments: two of length (w) and two of length (l). However, the corners are included in two adjacent sides? Actually, the entire boundary is 2*(w+l) - 4 because each corner is counted only once? Actually, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2*(w+l) and we have 4 corners? But note: the boundary for tiling is the outer edge. The total number of 1x1 tiles that would be on the boundary is: \n  total = w*l\n  interior = (w-2)*(l-2)\n  boundary = total - interior = w*l - (w*l - 2*w - 2*l + 4) = 2*w + 2*l - 4.\n\nSo the boundary has 2*(w+l-2) tiles? Actually, 2*(w+l-2) = 2*w+2*l-4.\n\nWe are to use 1xa tiles on the boundary. Since the tiles can be rotated, we can use them as 1xa or ax1. But note: the boundary is made of four straight segments. Each segment must be tiled by 1xa tiles (which can be placed horizontally or vertically). However, the entire boundary does not have to be contiguous? Actually, the four sides are independent.\n\nThe problem: for which positive integers a can we tile the boundary?\n\nConditions:\n1. The entire boundary must be divisible by a? Not exactly: because the boundary is broken into four segments: \n   - top: length w (from (0,0) to (w,0)) \n   - right: length l (from (w,0) to (w,l)) \n   - bottom: length w (from (w,l) to (0,l)) \n   - left: length l (from (0,l) to (0,0))\n\nBut note: the corners are shared? Actually, each corner is the meeting point of two sides. So each side has:\n   top: w, but the two corners are shared? Actually, the top side has w units, but the two ends are also the start of the right and left sides? So each side must be tiled independently.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require that the entire boundary is tiled as one contiguous strip. It is broken into four sides. Therefore, we require that each side can be tiled by 1xa tiles.\n\nBut note: the top side has length w. We can tile it with tiles of length a if a divides w? Actually, we can use tiles of length a (if placed horizontally) or tiles of length 1 (if placed vertically) but that doesn't make sense because the side is horizontal. However, the problem says the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. So a tile of size 1xa can be placed as 1xa (horizontal) or ax1 (vertical). But in a horizontal side, we can only use the tile as 1xa? Actually, if we place a vertical tile on a horizontal side, it would stick out? So we must use the tile as 1xa for the horizontal sides and as ax1 for the vertical sides? But wait: the boundary is 1 unit wide. So the tile must cover 1 unit in the direction perpendicular to the boundary. Therefore, for the horizontal sides (top and bottom) we must use the tile as 1xa (so the tile is placed horizontally, covering 1 in the vertical and a in the horizontal). Similarly, for the vertical sides (left and right) we must use the tile as a*1 (so the tile is placed vertically, covering a in the vertical and 1 in the horizontal). But note: the tile can be rotated so that it is 1xa regardless of direction? Actually, the problem says \"tiles of size 1xa\" and they can be rotated by 90 degrees, so we can use them as 1xa or as ax1. However, the boundary is 1 unit wide. So for the horizontal sides, we can use the tile as 1xa (so the a is along the length of the side) and for the vertical sides, we can use the tile as ax1 (so the a is along the length of the side). Therefore, for a horizontal side of length w, we require that a divides w? But note: we can also use the tile as ax1 on a horizontal side? That would cover 1 unit in the horizontal and a units in the vertical? But the boundary is only 1 unit wide in the vertical. So if we use a tile as ax1 on a horizontal side, it would cover 1 unit in the horizontal and a units in the vertical. However, the boundary is only 1 unit wide, so if a>1 then we would cover beyond the boundary? Therefore, we must use the tile as 1xa for the horizontal sides. Similarly, for the vertical sides we must use the tile as ax1? Actually, the problem does not specify the orientation of the boundary. The boundary is the outer 1 unit. So the top boundary is a row of width w and height 1. We can use the tile as 1xa (so the tile is placed horizontally: covering 1 row and a columns) and that is acceptable. Similarly, for the vertical side (height l and width 1) we can use the tile as ax1? But wait: if we use the tile as ax1, then it would cover a rows and 1 column. But the vertical side is only 1 column wide. So that is acceptable. However, note that the tile can also be placed as 1xa on the vertical side? Then it would cover 1 row and a columns. But the vertical side is only 1 column wide, so if a>1 then we would cover beyond? Therefore, on the vertical side we must use the tile as ax1 (so that the 1 is in the horizontal and a in the vertical). \n\nTherefore, the conditions for a side:\n- For a horizontal side (length w): we require that a divides w? But note: the side is of length w. We are using tiles of length a (if placed horizontally) or 1 (if placed vertically) but the vertical placement is not acceptable because it would cover more than the 1 row? Actually, we can break the side arbitrarily? The problem does not say we cannot mix? Actually, we can use both orientations? But wait: the boundary is 1 unit wide. If we use a tile vertically on a horizontal side, it would cover 1 unit in the horizontal and a units in the vertical. But the boundary is only 1 unit high, so if a>1 we cannot use a vertical tile on a horizontal side? Similarly, we cannot use a horizontal tile on a vertical side? \n\nTherefore, we must use:\n- On the top and bottom: tiles placed horizontally (so the tile is 1xa, and we require that a divides the length of the side, which is w?).\n- On the left and right: tiles placed vertically (so the tile is ax1, and we require that a divides the length of the side, which is l?).\n\nBut wait: what about the corners? The corners are shared by two sides. How do we cover the corners? The corner is a single 1x1 square. We can cover it by either the horizontal side or the vertical side? Actually, the problem does not specify. We have to cover the entire boundary. The corner must be covered by one tile? But if we use a tile for the horizontal side, it would cover the corner? Similarly, the vertical side would also want to cover the corner. So we have an overlap? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: the entire boundary is a cycle? But the problem breaks it into four sides. The corners are included in both adjacent sides? Actually, the problem says: \"on the floor boundary\". The boundary includes the four corners. \n\nHow to avoid double counting the corners? The problem does not specify how the tiling is done. But note: the boundary is 2*(w+l)-4. This is the total number of 1x1 squares. We are to cover it with 1xa tiles. The entire boundary must be divisible by a? Actually, the entire boundary is 2*(w+l)-4, so we require that a divides 2*(w+l)-4? But that is not sufficient because the boundary is broken into four sides. We must be able to tile each side independently. \n\nHowever, note that the four sides are independent? Actually, they are connected at the corners. But the corner is a single square. We can assign the corner to one of the sides? Typically, we assign the top-left corner to the top side? Then the top side would be from (0,0) to (w,0) but excluding (w,0) because that is the start of the right side? Then the top side has w-1? Similarly, the right side would be from (w,0) to (w,l) excluding (w,l) so that's l-1? Then the bottom side from (w,l) to (0,l) excluding (0,l) so that's w-1? The left side from (0,l) to (0,0) excluding (0,0) so that's l-1? Then the total boundary would be 2*(w-1+l-1) = 2*(w+l-2). This matches the total boundary count? Actually, no: because we have excluded the corners? Then the total boundary squares would be (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) + (l-1) = 2*(w+l-2). But note: the original boundary count was 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2). So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the four sides are:\n   top: w-1\n   right: l-1\n   bottom: w-1\n   left: l-1\n\nBut wait: the problem says the bathroom has width w and length l. The boundary includes the entire outer edge. The top side has w units? Actually, the top side has w units: from (0,0) to (w,0) includes w+1 points? But we are tiling by squares. The top side has w squares? Actually, the grid has w columns and l rows. The top boundary row (row 0) has w squares: from column0 to column w-1? Actually, the grid is from (0,0) to (w-1, l-1)? The problem does not specify. But note: the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). So the entire grid has w columns and l rows? Then the top boundary has w squares? Similarly, the right boundary has l squares? But then the bottom boundary has w squares and the left boundary has l squares? Then the total boundary squares would be 2*(w+l) - 4? Because the four corners are shared? Actually, the corners are included in two sides? So we have: top: w, right: l, bottom: w, left: l -> total = w+l+w+l = 2*(w+l). But then we have double counted the four corners? Actually, no: because each corner is a distinct square. The grid has w*l squares. The interior has (w-2)*(l-2). Then the boundary has w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4. So the boundary has 2*(w+l)-4 squares. Therefore, the sides are:\n   top: w\n   right: l-2   (because the top and bottom of the right side are already covered by the top and bottom boundaries? Actually, no: the top boundary covers the entire top row. The right boundary covers the rightmost column, but excluding the top and bottom squares? Then the right boundary has l-2 squares? Similarly, the bottom boundary has w-2? Then the total would be: top: w, bottom: w, left: l, right: l? But that would be 2*(w+l) which is too many. \n\nAlternatively, we break the boundary as:\n   top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0): w squares.\n   right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1,l-1): l-1 squares? But then (w-1,0) is already covered by the top? Then the right side would be from (w-1,1) to (w-1,l-1): l-1 squares? Similarly, the bottom: from (w-1,l-1) to (0,l-1): w-1 squares? and the left: from (0,l-1) to (0,0): l-1 squares? Then total = w + (l-1) + (w-1) + (l-1) = 2*(w+l-1.5) -> not an integer.\n\nActually, the standard way: the boundary has four sides, each side without the corners:\n   top: w - 2   (if we remove the two corners) -> but then the top has w, and we remove the two corners? then w-2? Then the left and right have l? but then we remove the two corners? so l-2? Then total = (w-2) + (w-2) + (l-2) + (l-2) + 4 corners? That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: the entire boundary is a cycle of 2*(w+l) - 4 squares. We require that a divides the entire boundary? But that is not sufficient because the boundary is broken into four sides. However, we can also use different orientations on different sides? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire boundary is tiled as one strip. We can tile each side independently. Therefore, we require that a divides the length of each side? But what are the lengths of the sides? \n\nActually, the problem does not specify how the corners are assigned. However, we can assign the corners arbitrarily to one of the adjacent sides? But then the side lengths become:\n   Option 1: \n        top: w (including both corners) -> then the right side would be l-2 (excluding the top and bottom corners) -> but then the bottom: w (including corners) -> but the corners are already covered? This is messy.\n\nAfter reading the sample: \n   First test case: w=3, l=5 -> valid a: 1,2,3.\n\nTotal boundary = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n\nIf a=1: then we use 12 tiles of 1x1 -> works.\nIf a=2: then we use 12/2=6 tiles -> works? How?\n   The boundary: \n        top: 3 -> 3/2? not integer? \n        bottom: 3 -> 3/2? not integer.\n        left: 5 -> 5/2? not integer.\n        right: 5 -> 5/2? not integer.\n\nBut note: we can break the sides arbitrarily? Actually, we can use the tiles on multiple sides? The entire boundary is 12, divisible by 2? Then 12/2=6 tiles. But we must be able to cover each side? \n\nAlternatively, we can cover the entire boundary as one cycle? Then we require that a divides 2*(w+l)-4. But then a=2: 12 is divisible by 2 -> works. Similarly, a=3: 12 divisible by 3 -> works. a=4: 12 divisible by 4? 12/4=3 -> but 4>min(w,l)? Actually, the tile of size 1x4 cannot be placed on a side of length 3? Because 4>3. So we must also require that a does not exceed the side lengths? \n\nBut note: the tile can be placed arbitrarily? Actually, the tile of size 1x4: if we try to place it on the top side (length 3) we cannot because 4>3. Similarly, on the left side (length 5) we can place it? But the entire boundary is a cycle? Then we can start a tile on the top and continue on the right? The problem does not say we have to tile each side independently. It says \"on the floor boundary\". So the entire boundary is one connected region? And we can use the tiles arbitrarily? \n\nHowever, the problem states: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\" and they are 1xa. So they are straight tiles. They cannot bend. Therefore, we cannot have a tile that goes around a corner? Because that would require the tile to be bent. \n\nTherefore, we must tile each side independently. Then the sides are:\n   top: w\n   right: l\n   bottom: w\n   left: l\n\nBut then the corners are included in two sides? That would double count the corners. \n\nAlternatively, we can define the sides without the corners? Then:\n   top: w-2\n   right: l\n   bottom: w-2\n   left: l\n\nThat doesn't work.\n\nThe correct breakdown: \n   The boundary has four sides. Each side is a straight segment. The top side has w squares? Actually, the grid has w columns and l rows. The top row has w squares. The bottom row has w squares. The left column has l squares, but the top and bottom squares of the left column are already covered by the top and bottom rows? So the left column has l-2 squares? Similarly, the right column has l-2 squares. Then the total boundary squares = w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*(w+l-2). \n\nTherefore, the sides are:\n   top: w\n   bottom: w\n   left: l-2\n   right: l-2\n\nBut wait: the top row has w squares? Then the bottom row has w squares? The left column has l squares? But the top-left and bottom-left are already covered? So the left column has l-2 squares? Similarly, the right column has l-2 squares. Then total = w + w + (l-2) + (l-2) = 2*(w+l-2). Correct.\n\nTherefore, we require that:\n   a must divide the length of the top side? -> a divides w? \n   a must divide the length of the bottom side? -> a divides w?\n   a must divide the length of the left side? -> a divides (l-2)?\n   a must divide the length of the right side? -> a divides (l-2)?\n\nBut wait: what if we assign the corners differently? Actually, the problem does not specify. The above breakdown is standard.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility: \n   We could assign the corners to the vertical sides? Then:\n        top: w-2\n        bottom: w-2\n        left: l\n        right: l\n\nThen we require:\n   a divides (w-2) and a divides l.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify how the corners are assigned. Therefore, we have two possibilities for the boundary breakdown:\n\nPossibility 1:\n   top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2.\n\nPossibility 2:\n   top: w-2, bottom: w-2, left: l, right: l.\n\nBut there is a third possibility: \n   Possibility 3: mix? \n        top: w-1, bottom: w-1, left: l-1, right: l-1.\n\nWhy? Because if we assign the top-left corner to the top, then the top side has w-1 (because the last square of the top is the top-right corner, which we assign to the right side). Similarly, the right side has l-1 (because the bottom-right corner is assigned to the bottom). Then the bottom has w-1 (because the bottom-left corner is assigned to the left) and the left has l-1. Then total = 2*(w-1+l-1) = 2*(w+l-2). Correct.\n\nTherefore, we have three possibilities for the side lengths:\n\nOption A: [w, w, l-2, l-2]\nOption B: [w-2, w-2, l, l]\nOption C: [w-1, w-1, l-1, l-1]\n\nBut note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So if a divides 2*(w+l-2), then we can cover the entire boundary? But that is not sufficient because the boundary is broken into sides. However, if we use the entire boundary as one cycle, then we require a divides 2*(w+l-2). But we cannot bend the tile. So we must break the boundary into sides. \n\nBut the problem does not require that the tiles are confined to one side. The entire boundary is connected. We can start a tile on the top and continue on the right? But the tile is straight and cannot bend. Therefore, we cannot have a tile that covers part of the top and part of the right. \n\nTherefore, we must tile each side independently. So we have three options for the side lengths. For a to be valid, it must be that for at least one of the options, a divides all four side lengths? Actually, no: because we can use different assignments for the corners? But the assignment of corners is fixed by the option. \n\nActually, for a given a, we require that:\n\n   Either:\n      (a divides w) and (a divides (l-2))   [Option A: top and bottom are w, left and right are l-2]\n   Or:\n      (a divides (w-2)) and (a divides l)   [Option B: top and bottom are w-2, left and right are l]\n   Or:\n      (a divides (w-1)) and (a divides (l-1))   [Option C: each side is reduced by 1]\n\nBut note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). And if a divides the entire boundary, then we can cover the entire boundary? But that is not sufficient because of the corners: the tile might cover two adjacent sides? Actually, we can design a tiling that goes around the corner? But the tile is straight and 1xa. It cannot cover two adjacent sides (which are perpendicular) without bending. Therefore, we must cover each side independently.\n\nTherefore, the valid a must satisfy one of the three conditions:\n\n   Condition 1: a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n   Condition 2: a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n   Condition 3: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n\nBut note: a must also be a divisor of the entire boundary? Actually, if condition 1 holds, then a divides w and l-2, so a divides 2*(w+l-2) because 2*(w+l-2) = 2*w + 2*(l-2) + 4? Not exactly: 2*(w+l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4 = 2*w + 2*(l-2) + 4? That doesn't factor. But note: condition 1 requires a|w and a|(l-2), then a divides w and l-2, so a divides any linear combination? In particular, a divides 2*w and 2*(l-2), so a divides 2*w+2*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2). Similarly for the others.\n\nBut note: we must also consider that a must be at least 1? and also, for condition 1: if l-2 is 0? but l>=3, so l-2>=1. Similarly, w>=3.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). The divisor a must be at most the length of the side? Actually, the tile of length a must fit on the side. But if a is greater than the side, then we cannot use it? However, if a divides the side, then a must be <= the side? Actually, no: if the side length is 0, then a can be any divisor? But we don't have zero. The smallest side is at least 1 (since w,l>=3). So a must be at most the side length? Actually, no: for example, if the side length is 3, then a=3 is acceptable (one tile) and a=1 is acceptable (three tiles). But a=6? 6 divides 3? no. So if a divides the side length, then a must be <= the side length? Actually, the divisors of a positive integer n are always <= n. So we don't have to worry.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integer a\". So a>=1.\n\nTherefore, the set of valid a is the union of:\n   S1: the divisors of w and divisors of (l-2) that are common? Actually, condition 1: a must divide both w and (l-2). So the common divisors of w and (l-2).\n   S2: the common divisors of (w-2) and l.\n   S3: the common divisors of (w-1) and (l-1).\n\nBut note: a=1 is always valid? because 1 divides everything. And indeed the sample includes a=1.\n\nHowever, we must avoid duplicates? The same a might appear in more than one set.\n\nAlso note: the problem says to output the sorted list of valid a.\n\nBut the constraints: w, l up to 10^9. The total number of divisors for a number up to 10^9 is about O(sqrt(n)) which is around 10^4.5, which is 31622. And we have three sets, so total divisors might be 3*31622 = 94866, which is less than 200000. So we can compute the divisors for each set and then take the union.\n\nBut note: the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. So we can do:\n\n   solutions = set()\n   Add all common divisors of (w, l-2) \n   Add all common divisors of (w-2, l)\n   Add all common divisors of (w-1, l-1)\n\nBut note: we must be cautious for non-positive divisors? \n   For condition 1: we require l-2>=1? yes, because l>=3 -> l-2>=1.\n   Similarly, w-2>=1? w>=3 -> w-2>=1.\n   w-1>=2, l-1>=2.\n\nBut what if w=3? then w-2=1 -> divisors of 1: {1}. Similarly, l-2=1 if l=3.\n\nHow to compute the common divisors of two numbers? We can compute the gcd and then the divisors of the gcd.\n\nSo:\n\n   g1 = gcd(w, l-2)\n   Then the divisors of g1 are the common divisors of w and l-2.\n\n   Similarly, g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n   Then the divisors of g2.\n\n   g3 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n   Then the divisors of g3.\n\nThen solutions = set(divisors of g1) \u222a set(divisors of g2) \u222a set(divisors of g3)\n\nBut note: we must also consider that the entire boundary must be divisible by a? Actually, we don't need to check that because if a divides w and a divides (l-2), then a divides 2*(w+l-2) as argued. Similarly for the others.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). But if a divides w and a divides (l-2), then a divides w and a divides (l-2), so a divides 2*(w+l-2) because 2*(w+l-2) = 2*w + 2*(l-2) + 4? Actually, 2*(w+l-2) = 2*w + 2*l - 4 = 2*w + 2*(l-2) + 4? That is not linear. \n\nBut note: \n   w = k1 * a\n   l-2 = k2 * a\n   Then 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(k1*a + k2*a + 2 - 2) = 2*(a*(k1+k2)) = 2*a*(k1+k2) -> divisible by a.\n\nSimilarly, for the other conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can compute:\n\n   s = set()\n   g1 = gcd(w, l-2)\n   for d in divisors of g1: s.add(d)\n\n   g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n   for d in divisors of g2: s.add(d)\n\n   g3 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n   for d in divisors of g3: s.add(d)\n\nBut note: we must also consider that the tile must cover the entire side? Actually, we have already ensured that a divides the side length for the sides in the chosen option. \n\nBut wait: what if a divides g1, then it divides w and l-2, so condition 1 holds. Similarly for the others.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the side lengths must be nonnegative? They are, as argued.\n\nBut note: what if l-2 is negative? The problem says l>=3, so l-2>=1. Similarly, w-2>=1.\n\nTherefore, we can compute the divisors for each gcd.\n\nBut the problem: how to compute the divisors of a number up to 10^9? We can do it in O(sqrt(n)).\n\nBut note: the total number of divisors we are storing is at most 3 * (number of divisors of the gcd) and the gcd is at most 10^9. The worst-case number of divisors for a number around 10^9 is about 1344 (for highly composite numbers). So we can do.\n\nBut note: the problem has multiple test cases (t<=100). The worst-case total divisors we store per test case is about 3*1344 = 4032, and then we do 100 test cases -> 100*4032 = 403200, which is acceptable? But the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. So worst-case 100 test cases * 4032 divisors per test case = 403200, which is more than 200000? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output contains at most 200000 integers\" (across all test cases). So we must be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid storing duplicates by using a set per test case? But the set for one test case might have up to 4032 elements. Then 100 test cases: 100*4032 = 403200 integers in the output? But the problem says at most 200000 integers. So we must be cautious.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the output contains at most 200000 integers\". So we must design to not exceed that. However, the worst-case 403200 is above 200000. Therefore, we must hope that the gcds are not highly composite? Or we can avoid generating duplicates by using a set per test case and then output the sorted list.\n\nBut the problem says \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers\". So we can assume that the total number of divisors we output over all test cases is <=200000.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   for each test case:\n        s = set()\n        g1 = gcd(w, l-2)\n        for d in all_divisors(g1):\n            s.add(d)\n        g2 = gcd(w-2, l)\n        for d in all_divisors(g2):\n            s.add(d)\n        g3 = gcd(w-1, l-1)\n        for d in all_divisors(g3):\n            s.add(d)\n\n        Then output: len(s) and then sorted(s)\n\nBut note: the problem also includes a=1? and we have it.\n\nHowever, we must also consider: what if the divisor is 0? The divisors of a positive integer are positive. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: what if w, l-2 are both zero? But w>=3, l>=3, so w>=3, l-2>=1. Similarly, w-2>=1, l>=3. w-1>=2, l-1>=2.\n\nTherefore, we can write a function to get the divisors of a positive integer n:\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n        i = 1\n        divisors = set()\n        while i*i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n            i += 1\n        return divisors\n\nBut note: we are only interested in positive divisors.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample: w=3, l=5.\n\n   Condition 1: gcd(3, 5-2)=gcd(3,3)=3 -> divisors: {1,3}\n   Condition 2: gcd(3-2,5)=gcd(1,5)=1 -> divisors: {1}\n   Condition 3: gcd(3-1,5-1)=gcd(2,4)=2 -> divisors: {1,2}\n\n   Then s = {1,2,3} -> sorted: [1,2,3] -> output: \"3 1 2 3\"\n\nBut the sample output is: \"3 1 2 3\"\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"For each test case, print an integer k (0<=k) \u2014 the number of valid values of a for the given test case \u2014 followed by k integers a1, a2, ..., ak \u2014 the valid values of a. The values a1, a2, ..., ak have to be sorted from smallest to largest.\"\n\nSo that matches.\n\nBut wait: why is a=2 valid? Condition 3: because 2 divides (3-1)=2 and 2 divides (5-1)=4. So condition 3 holds.\n\nBut note: condition 3 corresponds to the side breakdown: \n   top: w-1 = 2\n   bottom: w-1 = 2\n   left: l-1 = 4\n   right: l-1 = 4\n   Then we can use a=2: \n        top: 2/2=1 tile\n        bottom: 2/2=1 tile\n        left: 4/2=2 tiles\n        right: 4/2=2 tiles.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what about a=3? Condition 1: \n   top: w=3 -> divisible by 3 -> 1 tile\n   bottom: 3 -> 1 tile\n   left: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3 -> 1 tile\n   right: 3 -> 1 tile.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, we can implement.\n\nBut note: the provided code for program1.py already has:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        ...\n\nBut we are going to replace that? Actually, the provided code is incomplete. We are to complete the missing part.\n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\n   from math import sqrt, floor\n   from sys import stdin\n\n   data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n   res = []\n   for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n        half_perimeter = w + l - 2   # note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2) -> so half_perimeter is w+l-2? \n        solutions = {1, 2}   # why 2? and why 1? \n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n            if mod_i != 0:\n                continue\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\")\n   print('\\n'.join(res))\n\nThis code is incomplete and also seems to have a different approach. It only considers divisors of half_perimeter? But half_perimeter = w+l-2. And then it iterates i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter). Then for each divisor i, it considers a = i and a = half_perimeter // i. Then it checks w % a <= 2? \n\nThis approach does not match our three-condition approach.\n\nTherefore, we must replace the entire loop? Or complete the TODO? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\nThe provided code already has:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n\nWhy 2? In the sample, a=2 is valid. But what if a=2 is not valid? For example, w=4, l=4.\n\n   Condition 1: gcd(4,4-2)=gcd(4,2)=2 -> divisors: {1,2}\n   Condition 2: gcd(4-2,4)=gcd(2,4)=2 -> divisors: {1,2}\n   Condition 3: gcd(4-1,4-1)=gcd(3,3)=3 -> divisors: {1,3}\n   Then solutions = {1,2,3} -> so 2 is included.\n\nBut what if w=3, l=3? \n   Condition 1: gcd(3,1)=1 -> {1}\n   Condition 2: gcd(1,3)=1 -> {1}\n   Condition 3: gcd(2,2)=2 -> {1,2}\n   Then solutions = {1,2}\n\nSo 2 is included.\n\nBut what if w=5, l=3? \n   Condition 1: gcd(5,1)=1 -> {1}\n   Condition 2: gcd(3,3)=3 -> {1,3}\n   Condition 3: gcd(4,2)=2 -> {1,2}\n   Then solutions = {1,2,3}\n\nSo 2 is included.\n\nBut why does the provided code start with {1,2}? It might be that the author thought that 1 and 2 are always valid? But is 2 always valid? \n\nConsider w=3, l=4:\n   Condition 1: gcd(3,4-2)=gcd(3,2)=1 -> {1}\n   Condition 2: gcd(3-2,4)=gcd(1,4)=1 -> {1}\n   Condition 3: gcd(3-1,4-1)=gcd(2,3)=1 -> {1}\n   Then solutions = {1} -> so 2 is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we cannot assume 2 is always valid.\n\nSo we should not start with {1,2}. We should start with an empty set and then add the divisors from the three conditions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and the provided code already has:\n\n   solutions = {1, 2}\n\nWe are allowed to change that? Or only complete the TODO? \n\nThe problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We might need to change the entire for loop? \n\nBut note: the provided code also has a loop that iterates over divisors of half_perimeter? And then does something. \n\nAlternatively, the provided code might be trying to use the condition that a must divide the entire boundary? Because the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). Then a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). But that is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nThe provided code:\n\n   for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n        for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                ...   # TODO\n\nWhat is the condition mod_a <= 2? \n\nIt might be trying to check one of the conditions? \n\nBut note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So if a divides 2*(w+l-2), then we have a candidate. But then we must check that the candidate a works for one of the three conditions.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   total_boundary = 2*(w+l-2)\n   For each divisor a of total_boundary (including 1 and total_boundary), we check if a satisfies one of the three conditions.\n\nBut the total_boundary can be up to 2*(10^9+10^9) = 4e9, and the number of divisors of a number up to 4e9 can be about 1344? Then 100 test cases * 1344 = 134400, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. So we can do:\n\n   solutions = set()\n   total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n   # get all divisors of total_boundary\n   divisors = set()\n   i = 1\n   while i*i <= total_boundary:\n        if total_boundary % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(total_boundary//i)\n        i += 1\n\n   for a in divisors:\n        if a <= 0: continue   # but a is positive\n        # Check condition 1: a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n        if w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n            solutions.add(a)\n        # Check condition 2: a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n        elif (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n            solutions.add(a)\n        # Check condition 3: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n        elif (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   # But note: a=1 is always included? \n\nBut wait: what if a satisfies more than one condition? Then we add it once.\n\nBut is this efficient? The total_boundary divisors: about 1344 per test case, and 100 test cases -> 100*1344 = 134400, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers. So 134400 is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the provided code already has:\n\n   solutions = {1,2}\n\n   and then a loop that iterates i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) (which is sqrt(w+l-2)) and then for each divisor i of half_perimeter? Actually, the code does:\n\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n   But half_perimeter = w+l-2, and then it checks if mod_i==0. Then it considers a = i and a = div (which is half_perimeter//i). But note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter. So the divisors of half_perimeter are not the same as the divisors of the entire boundary.\n\n   For example, if half_perimeter = 6, then the divisors of half_perimeter are 1,2,3,6. But the entire boundary is 12, which has divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n   So the provided code is only iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter, not the entire boundary.\n\n   And then it considers a = i and a = div, which are divisors of half_perimeter. But we need divisors of 2*half_perimeter.\n\n   Therefore, we must change the approach.\n\n   Given the constraints, we can generate the divisors of the entire boundary = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter.\n\n   But note: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter can be generated from the divisors of half_perimeter? \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        divisors_total = set()\n        # First, get the divisors of half_perimeter\n        for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1):\n            if half_perimeter % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(half_perimeter//i)\n        # Then also consider the divisors that include the factor 2? \n        # But 2*half_perimeter might have divisors that are not divisors of half_perimeter? \n        # For example, if half_perimeter=6, then divisors of 6: {1,2,3,6}. Then divisors of 12: {1,2,3,4,6,12}. \n        # We can generate by:\n        #   divisors_total = set()\n        #   for d in divisors of half_perimeter:\n        #        divisors_total.add(d)\n        #        divisors_total.add(2*d)\n        #   But that is not correct: because 4 is not 2 times a divisor of 6? 4 is not 2*? \n        #   Actually, 4 is a divisor of 12, but 4 is not a divisor of 6 and 2*2=4, but 2 is a divisor of 6.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can generate the divisors of 2*half_perimeter by iterating over i from 1 to sqrt(2*half_perimeter). \n\n   Given the time, we can do:\n\n        total = 2 * half_perimeter\n        divisors_total = set()\n        i = 1\n        while i*i <= total:\n            if total % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total//i)\n            i += 1\n\n   Then we iterate over divisors_total.\n\n   But the problem: w and l up to 10^9, then total = 2*(w+l-2) can be up to 4e9. The loop i from 1 to sqrt(total) is about 63246 iterations per test case. And 100 test cases: 100 * 63246 = 6.3e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n   But note: worst-case 6.3e6 iterations per test case? Actually, no: the inner loop per test case is about sqrt(4e9) which is about 63245.5, so 63246 iterations per test case. Then 100 test cases: 6324600 iterations, which is acceptable in Pyton in C++ but in Python might be borderline? But 6e6 iterations in Python might run in a few seconds.\n\n   However, the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers, so the total number of divisors we consider over all test cases is at most 200000? But that is the output integers, not the iterations.\n\n   Alternatively, we can generate the divisors from the factorization? But that is more complex.\n\n   Given the constraints, we can do the divisor generation for each test case by iterating to sqrt(total).\n\n   But the provided code already has a loop that iterates to sqrt(half_perimeter) and then does something. We are to complete the TODO. \n\n   We can change the code to:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n        # We will generate all divisors of total_boundary\n        divisors_total = set()\n        i = 1\n        # We go up to the integer square root of total_boundary\n        # But note: total_boundary might be 0? but w,l>=3 -> total_boundary>=2*(3+3-2)=8, so safe.\n        while i * i <= total_boundary:\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n            i += 1\n\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            # a must be positive, which it is.\n            if a <= 0:\n                continue\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        # But note: the provided code started with solutions = {1,2}. We are replacing that.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" \n\n   The provided code already has:\n\n        solutions = {1, 2}\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            ... \n\n   We are not using that loop. So we should remove that loop and replace with the above.\n\n   Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n        divisors_total = set()\n        i = 1\n        # We need to iterate i from 1 to sqrt(total_boundary)\n        # But note: the provided code had a loop from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))? \n        # We are doing a new loop.\n\n        # We can do:\n        #   from math import isqrt\n        #   but the code uses floor(sqrt(...)), so we can use the same.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use:\n        #   sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        #   for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n        #        if total_boundary % i == 0:\n        #            divisors_total.add(i)\n        #            divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n\n        # But the provided code used a while loop? We can do a for loop or while.\n\n        # Let's do a while loop to be safe for large numbers.\n\n        # But note: the total_boundary can be as large as 4e9, then sqrt(4e9)=63245.5, so we iterate i from 1 to 63245.\n\n        # We'll do:\n\n        #   i = 1\n        #   while i*i <= total_boundary:\n        #        if total_boundary % i == 0:\n        #            divisors_total.add(i)\n        #            divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n        #        i += 1\n\n        # Then we check the three conditions.\n\n   But the problem: the provided code already imported sqrt and floor. We can use:\n\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n\n   However, the range in Python for 1 to 63245 is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the range(1, 63246) is 63245 elements, which is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem: the provided code had a loop that started at 2. We start at 1.\n\n   So for program1.py, we replace from the line \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the for loop with:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n        divisors_total = set()\n        # If total_boundary is 0, skip, but w,l>=3 so not zero.\n        # We'll iterate i from 1 to the integer square root of total_boundary.\n        # Using the same method as the provided code: floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        # But note: we have to import math.sqrt and math.floor, but we already did.\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            # a is positive by construction\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        # But note: we must include a=1? It will be included because 1 is a divisor.\n\n   However, we removed the initial solutions = {1,2}. So we are building solutions from scratch.\n\n   Let's test with w=3, l=5: total_boundary = 2*(3+5-2)=12.\n        divisors_total = {1,2,3,4,6,12}\n        Check each a:\n          a=1: (3%1==0 and 3%1==0) -> condition1: (0 and 0) -> but 0? Actually, any number mod 1 is 0. So condition1 holds? \n                condition1: w%a=3%1=0, (l-2)%a=3%1=0 -> true.\n          a=2: condition1: 3%2=1 !=0 -> skip. condition2: (3-2)%2=1%2=1 !=0 -> skip. condition3: (3-1)%2=2%2=0, (5-1)%2=4%2=0 -> true.\n          a=3: condition1: 3%3=0, 3%3=0 -> true.\n          a=4: condition1: 3%4=3 !=0, condition2: (3-2)=1 %4=1 !=0, condition3: 2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> false.\n          a=6: condition1: 3%6=3 !=0, condition2: 1%6=1 !=0, condition3: 2%6=2, 4%6=4 -> false.\n          a=12: similarly false.\n\n        Then solutions = {1,2,3}\n\n   So it works.\n\n   But note: the condition in the if statement: we have three conditions ORed.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the modulo operation: \n        (w-2) % a might be 0, and l % a might be 0 -> then condition2 holds.\n\n   So we can write the condition as above.\n\n   But note: the condition for condition1: we require (l-2) % a == 0. But if l-2 is 0? but l>=3, so l-2>=1. Similarly, w-2>=1.\n\n   Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is to replace the entire for-test-case body from the line \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the for loop? \n\n   But the provided code has:\n\n        for w, l in zip(...):\n            half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n            solutions = {1,2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                ... \n            # then appends\n\n   We want to replace from \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the for loop (which is the inner for loop) with:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n        divisors_total = set()\n        # If total_boundary is 0, skip, but it won't be.\n        # Compute the integer square root of total_boundary\n        # We can use: sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the range in the for-loop for i: the provided code had a loop that started at 2. We start at 1.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" \n\n   We are replacing a block. The block we are replacing is from the line \"solutions = {1,2}\" to the end of the inner for-loop (which is the one that iterates i). But the provided code has an inner for-loop that is not completed. We are replacing that entire block.\n\n   But the provided code has:\n\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n            if mod_i != 0:\n                continue\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are not using that. So we remove that.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the completion is:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n        divisors_total = set()\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the range for i: the original code used half_perimeter = w+l-2, but we are using total_boundary = 2*(w+l-2). So the sqrt_total is for total_boundary.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the variable half_perimeter is defined but not used. We can remove it? But the problem says to output only the missing block. We are replacing the block that starts with \"solutions = {1,2}\" and includes the for-loop. We are not using half_perimeter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter\n\n   But we already have half_perimeter.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter\n\n   Then the block becomes:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter\n        divisors_total = set()\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the range for i: from 1 to sqrt_total (inclusive). \n\n   However, the original code had a loop that started at 2. We start at 1. That is fine.\n\n   But note: the original code had a loop that went to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) (which is the square root of half_perimeter). We are using floor(sqrt(total_boundary)) which is the square root of total_boundary.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But what if total_boundary is 0? but w,l>=3 -> half_perimeter>= (3+3-2)=4, so total_boundary>=8.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above block for program1.py.\n\n   But note: the problem says to output in json: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n   We must be careful with quotes and newlines.\n\n   We'll write the block as a string.\n\n   However, the block is:\n\n        total_boundary = 2 * half_perimeter\n        divisors_total = set()\n        sqrt_total = floor(sqrt(total_boundary))\n        for i in range(1, sqrt_total+1):\n            if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                divisors_total.add(i)\n                divisors_total.add(total_boundary // i)\n        solutions = set()\n        for a in divisors_total:\n            if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: the condition is long. We can break it? But the problem says to output the code.\n\n   We'll write it as one line? Or break it? The problem does not specify.\n\n   We can break it for readability, but the output is a string in json.\n\n   Alternatively, we can assign to a variable:\n\n        cond1 = (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0)\n        cond2 = ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0)\n        cond3 = ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)\n        if cond1 or cond2 or cond3:\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   But that is more lines.\n\n   We'll keep it as one line.\n\n   But note: the condition might be long.

We are in a loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n            solutions.add(a)\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Now, for program2.py.\n\n   The description: \n        Tokitsukaze has a sequence a.

So the total nonzero count reduces by 1.\n\n   Step 2: For distinct numbers, we can reduce two distinct numbers to one number (the minimum) and then later we might match that minimum with another to do a type1.\n\n   However, we can also consider:\n\n        Operation 1: if there are duplicate nonzero numbers, we can do type1 to create a zero and then use that zero to do type2 operations? \n\n        But note: if we have a zero and a nonzero, then we can do:\n            select (0, x) with x>0: they are distinct -> change both to min(0,x)=0. So one operation removes one nonzero.\n\n        So zeros are very useful.\n\n   Therefore, the strategy:\n\n        We want to create zeros as early as possible.\n\n        How many type1 operations can we do? Each type1 operation requires two equal nonzero numbers. And after a type1, we have one zero and one number remains (which might be used again?).\n\n        But note: after a type1, we have one zero. Then we can use that zero to clear other numbers: by pairing the zero with any nonzero, we can turn the nonzero to zero in one operation (because min(0, x)=0, and then we set both to 0). But note: the operation changes both: \n            (0, x) -> both become 0.\n\n        So if we have one zero, then we can clear any other number in one operation per number.\n\n        However, we can also clear two numbers at once if we pair two nonzeros? \n\n        Actually, if we have one zero, then to clear k nonzeros we need k operations (each operation: pair the zero with one nonzero).\n\n        But if we don't have a zero initially, we have to create at least one zero.\n\n        How to create the first zero?\n\n            Option 1: use a type1 operation: if there is a duplicate, we can do: (x,x) -> (x,0). Then we have one zero.\n\n            Option 2: use type2 operations to create duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3] (no duplicates and no zero). \n            We can do: \n                Operation1: (1,2) -> (1,1)  [because min(1,2)=1] -> now [1,1,3]\n                Operation2: (1,1) -> (1,0)  [type1] -> [1,0,3]\n                Operation3: (0,1) -> (0,0)  -> [0,0,3]\n                Operation4: (0,3) -> (0,0)  -> [0,0,0]\n\n            Total: 4 operations.\n\n        Alternatively:\n                Operation1: (1,3) -> (1,1) -> [1,2,1] -> but wait, we have to choose two indices: we choose a1 and a3: [1,2,1] becomes [1,2,1] -> we can choose the two 1's? \n                But the sequence becomes [1,2,1] -> then operation2: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,2,0] \n                then operation3: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> [1,1,0]\n                operation4: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0,0]\n                operation5: (1,0) -> (0,0) -> [0,0,0] -> 5 operations.\n\n        So the first way is better.\n\n        Therefore, the strategy:\n\n            Let c0 = count of zeros initially.\n\n            We are going to simulate:\n\n            We want to create at least one zero. \n\n            Steps:\n\n            Let n = len(a)\n            Let zeros = c0\n\n            We need to clear n - zeros numbers.\n\n            If we already have at least one zero (zeros>=1), then we can clear the rest in (n-zeros) operations: because we can use the existing zero to clear one nonzero per operation.\n\n            But what if we have more than one zero? Then we can clear multiple at once? \n\n            Actually, if we have two zeros, then we can clear two nonzeros in one operation: \n                Operation: (0,0) -> they are equal, so we change one to 0 -> then we still have one zero? That doesn't help.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use one zero to clear two nonzeros? \n                We have: [0,0,x,y] \n                Operation1: (0,x) -> (0,0) -> [0,0,0,y]  (cleared x, now we have two zeros)\n                Operation2: (0,y) -> (0,0) -> done.\n\n            So it takes two operations to clear two nonzeros.\n\n            In general, if we have at least one zero, then we can clear one nonzero per operation.\n\n            Therefore, total operations = (number of operations to create the first zero) + (n - zeros - (number of nonzeros cleared in the process of creating the first zero?)) \n\n            But wait: when we create the first zero, we reduce the nonzero count by 1 (because we turn one nonzero to zero) and we create one zero. Then we use that zero to clear the rest.\n\n            So if we start with zeros = c0, and we have to clear n - c0 nonzeros.\n\n            If c0>0, then we don't need to create a zero: we can clear the nonzeros in (n - c0) operations.\n\n            If c0==0, then we must create at least one zero. How?\n\n                We can create a zero by a type1 operation: if there is a duplicate, we can do one type1 operation to create one zero and leave the other number. Then we have one zero and n-2 nonzeros (because we turned one of the duplicates to zero and the other remains) and one zero. Then we clear the remaining n-2 nonzeros with n-2 operations (using the zero). Total = 1 + (n-2) = n-1.\n\n                But what if there are no duplicates? Then we cannot do type1. Then we must do type2 operations to create duplicates.\n\n                How many operations to create a duplicate?\n\n                    We can do one type2 operation: (x,y) with x<y -> then we change both to x. Then we have two x's. Then we can do a type1 operation: (x,x) -> (x,0). Then we have one zero. Then we clear the rest.\n\n                    Steps: \n                        1: (x,y) -> (x,x) [operation1]\n                        2: (x,x) -> (x,0) [operation2]\n                        3: use the zero to clear the rest: (n-2) operations? \n                    Total = 1 + 1 + (n-2) = n.\n\n                But wait: after step2, we have one zero and one x? and the rest? Actually, we started with n nonzeros. We used two of them: one operation turned two nonzeros (x,y) into two x's. Then the next operation turned one of the x's to zero and left the other x. So we have one zero, one x, and n-2 nonzeros? Then we clear the n-2 nonzeros and the one x? \n                    Clearing the x: we do (0,x) -> (0,0) -> one operation.\n                    Clearing the n-2 nonzeros: n-2 operations.\n                    Total = 1 (to create two x's) + 1 (to create a zero) + 1 (to clear the x) + (n-2) (to clear the others) = n+1? \n\n                But note: after step2, we have:\n                    We started with: [a1, a2, ..., an] (all nonzero, no duplicates)\n                    Step1: choose two distinct numbers, say a1 and a2: set both to x = min(a1,a2). Then the array becomes [x, x, a3, ..., an] -> n numbers: two x's and the rest.\n                    Step2: choose the two x's: set one to 0 and leave the other x. Then we have [x, 0, a3, ..., an] -> n numbers: one zero, one x, and n-2 others.\n                    Then we can clear the x by pairing it with the zero: one operation -> [0,0, a3, ..., an] -> then we have n-2 nonzeros and two zeros.\n                    Then we clear the n-2 nonzeros: each by pairing with a zero: n-2 operations.\n\n                    Total = 1 (step1) + 1 (step2) + 1 (clear the x) + (n-2) = n+1.\n\n                But the sample: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations, which is 3+1? n=3 -> 4 = 3+1.\n\n                However, the sample in the note: \n                    Input: [1,2,3] -> output: 4.\n\n                So the formula for c0=0: \n                    If there is a duplicate: then we can do it in n-1 operations.\n                    If no duplicate: then we need n+1 operations? \n\n                But wait: the sample [1,2,3] has no duplicate, and we did 4 operations.\n\n                However, the problem says: the first test case: \n                    n=3, a=[1,2,3] -> output 4.\n\n                But the sample also had: \n                    In the first test case, one of the possible ways: 4 operations.\n\n                So the minimum number of operations for [1,2,3] is 4.\n\n                But is there a way to do it in 3? \n\n                Operation1: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> [1,1,3]\n                Operation2: (1,3) -> (1,1) -> [1,1,1]  (because min(1,3)=1)\n                Operation3: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0,1]\n                Operation4: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> but we don't have two ones? we have one 1 and one 0 and one 1? \n                    Actually, we have [1,0,1] -> we can do (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0,0] -> then operation5: (1,0) -> (0,0).\n\n                Or after [1,1,1]: \n                    Operation3: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> [0,1,1]\n                    Operation4: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> [0,0,1]\n                    Operation5: (0,1) -> (0,0)\n\n                So 5 operations.\n\n                Alternatively, after [1,1,1]:\n                    Operation3: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> [0,1,1]\n                    Operation4: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> [0,0,1]\n                    Operation5: (0,1) -> (0,0)\n\n                So 5 operations.\n\n                Therefore, 4 is the minimum.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for a test case:\n\n                Let c0 = count of zeros in the initial array.\n                Let n = total numbers.\n\n                If c0>0:\n                    Then we can clear the nonzeros in (n - c0) operations.\n\n                Else (c0==0):\n                    If there is any duplicate in the nonzeros:\n                        Then we can create a zero in 1 operation (which clears one nonzero and creates one zero) and then clear the remaining n-2 nonzeros in (n-2) operations? \n                        But note: after creating the zero, we have one zero and n-1 nonzeros? But we did one operation to create the zero: we turned two duplicates into (one zero and one remains). So we have one zero and n-2 nonzeros? \n                        Then we clear the n-2 nonzeros in (n-2) operations.\n                        Total = 1 + (n-2) = n-1.\n\n                    Else (no duplicate in nonzeros):\n                        We need to create a zero by first creating a duplicate: \n                            Operation1: create a duplicate by a type2: 1 operation -> now we have one duplicate (and n numbers, but two of them are the same) and no zero.\n                            Operation2: use the duplicate to create a zero: 1 operation -> now we have one zero and n-2 nonzeros (because we turned one of the duplicates to zero and left the other) and one zero.\n                            Then we clear the n-2 nonzeros and the one duplicate that remains? \n                                The duplicate that remains is one nonzero. So we have one zero and n-1 nonzeros? \n                                But wait: after operation2, we have: \n                                    We started with n nonzeros (no duplicates) -> after operation1: we have n nonzeros but now there is a duplicate? \n                                    Actually, operation1: we change two distinct numbers to the minimum. So we reduce two numbers to the same value. Then we have n-2 numbers unchanged and two numbers set to the minimum. So we have one duplicate? \n                                    Then operation2: we use the two duplicates to create one zero and leave one of the duplicates. Then we have: \n                                        the n-2 unchanged numbers, one duplicate (nonzero), and one zero.\n                                    Total nonzeros: (n-2) + 1 = n-1.\n                                Then we clear the n-1 nonzeros with n-1 operations (using the zero).\n                            Total = 1 (operation1) + 1 (operation2) + (n-1) = n+1.\n\n            Therefore:\n\n                if c0>0:\n                    ans = n - c0\n                else:\n                    if there is any duplicate in the array (which is all nonzeros) then ans = n-1\n                    else: ans = n+1\n\n            But wait: the sample [1,2,3] (n=3, c0=0, no duplicate) -> ans = 3+1 = 4.

Then we get [1,1,1] (because we changed the 2 to 1) and the other 1 remains? \n                    The array becomes: [1,1,1] (if we changed the 2 to 1 and the 1 we paired remains 1) -> but we changed both? So the array becomes: [1,1,1] (because we changed the two we selected to 1).\n\n                Then Operation2: choose two 1's: change one to 0 -> [1,0,1]\n                Operation3: choose the two 1's: change one to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n                Operation4: choose the 1 and a 0: distinct -> change both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,0]\n\n            That's 4.\n\n            How about:\n\n                Operation1: choose the two 1's: change one to 0 -> [0,1,2]\n                Operation2: choose the 0 and the 1: distinct -> change both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,2]\n                Operation3: choose the 0 and the 2: distinct -> change both to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\n            That's 3.\n\n            So the minimum for [1,1,2] is 3.\n\n            Therefore, our formula for the duplicate case: \n                We said: if there is a duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation, and then clear the rest in (n-2) operations? -> 1 + (n-2) = n-1 = 3-1=2, but we need 3.\n\n            What went wrong?\n\n            After creating the zero, we have one zero and n-1 nonzeros? But we only removed one nonzero (by turning it to zero) and we created one zero. So the count of nonzeros becomes n-1? Then we clear them in n-1 operations? total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n            So for [1,1,2]: n=3, then 3 operations.\n\n            But then what is the role of duplicates? \n\n            Actually, after the first operation (which used a duplicate) we create one zero, but we still have two nonzeros: the other 1 and the 2. Then we clear them in two operations: total=3.\n\n            So the formula for c0=0 and has duplicate: \n                ans = n   (because 1 + (n-1) = n)\n\n            For no duplicate: \n                ans = n+1\n\n            And if c0>0: \n                ans = n - c0   (because we clear one nonzero per operation)\n\n            But wait: if we have multiple zeros, we can clear one nonzero per operation. So if we have c0 zeros, then we have to clear n-c0 nonzeros, and that takes n-c0 operations.\n\n            Now, test with the sample in the note: \n                [1,2,3] (n=3, c0=0, no duplicate) -> ans = 3+1 = 4. Matches.\n\n            Test with [1,1,2] (n=3, c0=0, has duplicate) -> ans = 3. Matches.\n\n            Test with [1,1,1] (n=3, c0=0, has duplicate) -> \n                Operation1: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0,1] -> then we have one zero and two nonzeros.\n                Then we need two more operations: \n                    Operation2: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> [1,0,0]\n                    Operation3: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> done.\n                Total=3 -> matches n=3.\n\n            Test with [1,1] (n=2, c0=0, has duplicate) -> \n                Operation1: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> then we have one nonzero and one zero.\n                Operation2: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> done.\n                Total=2 = n.\n\n            Test with [1,2] (n=2, c0=0, no duplicate) -> \n                Operation1: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> [1,1]\n                Operation2: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> [1,0]\n                Operation3: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> done.\n                Total=3 = n+1.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for a test case is:\n\n                c0 = count of zeros in the array.\n                n = len(a)\n\n                if c0 > 0:\n                    ans = n - c0\n                else:\n                    if there is at least one duplicate in the array (meaning there is a nonzero that appears at least twice), then ans = n\n                    else:\n                        ans = n+1\n\n            But note: zeros are not considered in the duplicate? because if we have two zeros, then we can use them? \n                However, if we have two zeros, then we can clear a nonzero in one operation: (0, x) -> (0,0). So we don't need to clear the zeros.\n\n            The condition for the duplicate: we only care about duplicates among the nonzeros? \n\n            Example: [0,0,1] -> c0=2, then ans = 3-2 = 1. \n                Operation: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> done. 1 operation. Correct.\n\n            Example: [0,1,1] -> c0=1, then ans = 3-1=2. \n                Operation1: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> [0,0,1] -> then we have two zeros and one 1.\n                Operation2: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> done. 2 operations. Correct.\n\n            But what if we have [0,0,0]? then c0=3, ans=0? Correct.\n\n            Now, the duplicate condition: in the else branch (c0==0), we need to check if there is a duplicate among the entire array? But the array has no zeros, so we are checking duplicates in the nonzeros.\n\n            How to check for duplicate in the nonzeros? \n\n                We can do: \n                    if len(set(a)) < n: \n                        then there is a duplicate.\n\n                But note: if there is a duplicate, then the set size is less than n.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n                for each test case:\n                    n = int from the first line of the test case? \n                    then the next line is the list a.\n\n                But the provided code:\n\n                    for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n\n                Here, n is a string from the input? Actually, the loop variable is named n, but it is the string of the second line? \n\n                The input: \n                    t\n                    then t test cases: \n                        first line: n\n                        second line: list of n integers\n\n                The code: [*open(0)] is a list of all lines.\n\n                Then [2::2] means: start at index2 (the third line) and take every second line. So it takes the second line of each test case? \n\n                For the first test case: \n                    line0: t\n                    line1: n1\n                    line2: a1\n                    line3: n2\n                    line4: a2\n                    ...\n\n                So [2::2] gives the lines: line2, line4, line6, ... which are the lines containing the arrays.\n\n                Then the code:\n\n                    *a, = map(int, n.split())   # n is the string of the array line\n                    b = len(a)   # which is n (the length of the array)\n                    c = a.count(0)\n\n                Then:\n\n                    while a:\n                        q = a.pop()\n                        if a.count(q)>0:\n                            # TODO\n\n                Then print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\n\n                This doesn't match our formula.\n\n                We want:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(set(a)) < b:\n                            ans = b\n                        else:\n                            ans = b+1\n\n                But the provided code has a while loop that pops a and then checks if the remaining list has q? \n\n                We can do:\n\n                    # Remove the while loop and do:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(a) != len(set(a)):\n                            ans = b\n                        else:\n                            ans = b+1\n\n                But the provided code has a while loop and a TODO inside. We are not using that.\n\n                Therefore, we can replace the while loop and the TODO with our condition.\n\n                But the problem says: output only the missing block? \n\n                The provided code has:\n\n                    while a:\n                        q=a.pop()\n                        if a.count(q)>0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                We can remove that and do:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(set(a)) < b:\n                            ans = b\n                        else:\n                            ans = b+1\n\n                Then print(ans) instead of the current print.\n\n                But the current print is: \n                    print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\n                We want to print ans.\n\n                So the block for program2.py:\n\n                    We replace from the line \"while a:\" to the print statement.\n\n                We do:\n\n                    # Remove the while loop and the TODO, and then:\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n                        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                            ans = b+1\n                        else:\n                            ans = b\n                    print(ans)\n\n                But note: the variable b = len(a) = n.\n\n                So we can write:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = n - c\n                    else:\n                        if has_duplicate = (len(a) != len(set(a)))\n                        then if has_duplicate: ans = n\n                        else: ans = n+1\n\n                But we can do:\n\n                    if c>0:\n                        ans = b - c\n                    else:\n"
