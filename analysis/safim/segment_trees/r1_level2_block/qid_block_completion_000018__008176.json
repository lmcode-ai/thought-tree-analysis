So it works. How to compute a2? We have constraint (2,3,3): so a2|a3=3. We also have constraint (1,2,3): a1|a2=3. The known solution:\n\n            Let M[0]=3, M[1]=3, M[2]=3, M[3]=3? But the second constraint: (2,3,3) -> so M[2] &=3, M[3]&=3.

Then we get [0,0,3,0] -> which does not work: a1|a2=0|3=3 -> holds; a2|a3=3|0=3 -> holds. But lexicographically smallest?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that reads n and q, then q lines of (i, j, x) meaning a_i | a_j = x.\nWe have two arrays: m (which will be the answer) and M (which initially is set to all ones (2^30-1)).\nWe also have a list L of lists, where L[i] will store tuples (j, x) for each constraint involving i.\n\nThe current code does:\n  For each constraint (i, j, x):\n      M[i] = M[i] & x\n      M[j] = M[j] & x\n      and appends (j, x) to L[i] and (i, x) to L[j].\n\nThen, for each index i, we iterate over its constraints (j, x) in L[i]:\n   if j != i:\n        m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\n   else: \n        # This is the missing part for the self-loop (when i==j)\n\nNote: The self-loop constraint (i, i, x) would mean a_i | a_i = x -> a_i = x? But note: the OR of a_i with itself is a_i, so we must have a_i = x. However, note that the problem says the statements are for indices i and j (which can be the same). \n\nSo, in the self-loop case, we must set m[i] to x? But note: the problem says the array must satisfy all constraints. However, we are building the lexicographically smallest array.\n\nBut observe: the current code sets M[i] = m[i] at the end of the loop for each i. And then we print m.\n\nWhat should we do for the self-loop?\nWe must set m[i] to at least the value of x? Actually, the constraint a_i | a_i = x forces that a_i must be a subset of the bits in x. But note: the OR of a_i with itself is a_i, so we must have a_i = x. However, wait: what if there are multiple constraints? Actually, if we have a constraint (i,i,x), then we must have a_i = x. But note: the problem says the statements hold for at least one array.\n\nSo, in the self-loop, we should set m[i] = x? However, note that we are in the loop that is iterating over constraints. And we are building m[i] by ORing some values. But if we have a self-loop, then we know exactly what a_i must be: x. So we can set m[i] = x.\n\nBut note: what if there are multiple self-loops? Then we must set m[i] to the OR of all these x? Actually, no: each self-loop constraint (i,i,x) must be satisfied. Since a_i must equal x for each such constraint, then we must have a_i = x1 and a_i = x2, so x1 must equal x2? But the problem says the statements hold for at least one array, so if we have two self-loops (i,i,x1) and (i,i,x2) then x1 must equal x2? Actually, if they are different, then there is no solution. But the problem states that the statements hold for at least one array. So we can assume that all self-loops for the same i have the same x? \n\nHowever, note: the problem does not guarantee that the constraints are consistent? Actually, it says \"It is guaranteed that all q statements hold for at least one array.\" So we can assume consistency.\n\nBut note: the current code does not check for consistency. We are only required to output the lexicographically smallest array.\n\nSo, for the self-loop, we can set:\n   m[i] = x   (because we know a_i must be x)\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple self-loops? Then we are iterating over them. We should set m[i] to the OR of all the x's? Actually, no: because each constraint forces that a_i must be exactly x. So if we have two constraints (i,i,x1) and (i,i,x2), then we must have a_i = x1 and a_i = x2, so x1 must equal x2. Therefore, we can set m[i] = x (any one of them) because they are the same.\n\nBut note: what if we have a self-loop and then a constraint with j != i? Then we have to set m[i] to x (from the self-loop) and then also OR the other constraints? However, the self-loop already sets a_i to x. Then the constraint (i,j,x') must satisfy x = a_i and a_i | a_j = x'. So we have x | a_j = x'. \n\nBut in the current code, we are processing the constraints in L[i]. The self-loop is processed in the else branch. Then we set m[i] = x. Then we set M[i] = m[i] at the end. However, note that the next constraint for the same i (if any) would be processed in the same loop? Actually, the loop for i is fixed and we are iterating over all constraints in L[i]. So if we have a self-loop and then a constraint with j != i, then the self-loop sets m[i] to x, and then the constraint with j != i does:\n   m[i] |= x' ^ M[j]\n\nBut note: M[j] at this point is the value we computed in the first pass (the AND of all constraints for j). However, we are in the process of building m. This algorithm is known from known problems (like https://codeforces.com/contest/1107/problem/F or similar) but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, note that the self-loop constraint is the strongest: it forces a_i to be exactly x. Therefore, we don't need to do the OR for the self-loop? Actually, we can set m[i] to x and then break? But we cannot break because we have to process all constraints? Actually, we must set m[i] to x and then the other constraints might add more bits? But wait: if a_i is fixed to x, then we cannot add more bits. So we should set m[i] = x and then skip the rest? But the code does not break.\n\nAlternatively, we can set m[i] = x and then the other constraints (with j != i) might try to set more bits? But that would break the constraint because a_i is fixed. Therefore, we must not set any more bits. However, the problem says the constraints are consistent. So the other constraints should not require any more bits? Actually, the constraint (i,j,x') must have x' having at least the bits of x (because a_i = x, so x | a_j must be x', so x must be a subset of x'). And the OR operation for the constraint with j != i: \n   m[i] |= x' ^ M[j]\n\nBut if we have already set m[i] to x, then we are ORing (x' ^ M[j]). But note: the constraint (i,j,x') is also processed for j (so M[j] has been set to the AND of all constraints for j). However, the algorithm is building the array in two passes: first it sets M[i] for each index i to the AND of all x in constraints that involve i. Then, for each index i, it sets m[i] to the OR of (x ^ M[j]) for each constraint (i,j,x) with j != i, and for j==i, we set m[i] to x.\n\nBut note: the self-loop constraint is processed in the else branch. So we can do:\n\n   if j == i:\n        m[i] = x   # because we know a_i must be x\n\nBut what if we have multiple self-loops? Then we would set m[i] to the last self-loop x? That would be wrong because we must satisfy all. We should set m[i] to the AND of all self-loop x? Actually, no: because each self-loop constraint says a_i must be x. So they must all be the same. Therefore, we can set m[i] to the first self-loop x and then if we see a different one, it would break? But the problem guarantees consistency.\n\nHowever, note: the constraints for the same i might be given multiple times? But the problem does not say they are distinct. So we must accumulate? Actually, we don't need to: because if we have two self-loops (i,i,x1) and (i,i,x2), then we must have x1==x2. So we can set m[i] to x1 (or x2) arbitrarily.\n\nBut what if we have both a self-loop and non-self-loop constraints? Then we set m[i] to x (from the self-loop) and then the non-self-loop constraints might try to add bits? That would break the constraint. Therefore, we must not add any bits from non-self-loop constraints if we have a self-loop? Actually, the self-loop constraint forces a_i to be exactly x. Then the non-self-loop constraint (i,j,x') must satisfy: x | a_j = x'. This constraint is already taken into account in the M array: M[j] was set to the AND of all constraints for j, including this one. Then when we process the constraint for j, we will set m[j] appropriately. But for i, we don't need to add any bits from the non-self-loop constraint because we already set a_i to x. So we can skip the non-self-loop constraints? But the code does not skip: it does the OR for every constraint.\n\nSo we must avoid ORing the non-self-loop constraints if we have a self-loop? But note: the self-loop is processed in the else branch. The non-self-loop constraints are processed in the if branch. We are iterating over all constraints. We can do:\n\n   if j != i:\n        if we have not seen a self-loop? then do the OR.\n   else:\n        set m[i] = x   # and note that we have a self-loop\n\nBut the code does not have a flag. Alternatively, we can do: if we have a self-loop, then we set m[i] to x and then break out of the loop? But we cannot break because we have to process the constraints for the other indices? Actually, no: we are in the loop for index i. We are iterating over the constraints for i. If we have a self-loop, then we set m[i] to x and then we don't need to process the other constraints for i? Because the self-loop fixes a_i. However, note: the constraints for i might also be used to set bits for j? But no, we are only setting m[i] here. The constraints for j are processed when we are at index j.\n\nBut wait: the constraint (i,j,x) is stored in L[i] and L[j]. We are processing L[i] for index i. The constraint (i,j,x) is processed at index i and at index j. At index i, we are setting m[i] based on the constraint. Similarly, at index j, we set m[j] based on the constraint. But if we break at index i after the self-loop, then we skip the constraints for j? No, because we are at index i, and we are only processing L[i]. The constraints for j are processed when we are at index j.\n\nSo we can break after the self-loop? But note: we might have multiple self-loops? Actually, we can break after the first self-loop? Because if we have two self-loops, they must be the same, so we set m[i] to x and then the next self-loop would set m[i] to x again (same value). But then we don't break. Alternatively, we can break the inner loop after we set m[i] to x? But that would skip the other constraints for i. And that is what we want: because the self-loop fixes a_i, so we don't need to add any more bits from other constraints? Actually, the other constraints (with j != i) might require that a_i has some bits? But the self-loop already sets a_i to x. So we don't need to add any more bits. However, the constraint (i,j,x') might have x' having bits that are not in x? Then that would be a problem because a_i is fixed to x. But the problem states the constraints are consistent. So if we have a self-loop (i,i,x) and a constraint (i,j,x') then we must have x | a_j = x'. Since a_i = x, then we require that x | a_j = x'. This constraint will be used to set a_j (when we process j). But for a_i, we are done.\n\nTherefore, we can break the inner loop for i as soon as we see a self-loop? But note: what if the self-loop is not the first constraint? Then we have already ORed some bits from non-self-loop constraints? That might have set some bits that are not in x? Then we set m[i] = x, which would clear those bits? That would be incorrect.\n\nSo we must avoid ORing any constraint if we have a self-loop? We can do:\n\n   We can pre-check: if there is any self-loop for i? Then we set m[i] to the value of the self-loop (which must be the same for all) and skip the rest.\n\nBut the code does not pre-check. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   In the else branch, we set m[i] = x, and then we do nothing for the rest? But we are in the loop. We cannot break out of the loop from the else branch without affecting the other constraints? We can set a flag and then skip the rest? But the code does not have a flag.\n\nAlternatively, we can restructure the loop? But we are not allowed to change the existing code? We are only allowed to fill the missing part.\n\nThe missing part is only the else branch. So we must write code that works even if we have multiple constraints and self-loops.\n\nIdea: if we have a self-loop, then we set m[i] to x, and then we break the inner loop? But we are not allowed to break the outer loop? We can break the inner loop? Then we skip the remaining constraints for i.\n\nBut note: the code after the inner loop sets M[i] = m[i]. So we can break the inner loop by using a break statement? But we are in the else branch. We can do:\n\n   else:\n        m[i] = x\n        break   # break out of the inner for-loop over L[i]\n\nBut what if there are multiple self-loops? Then we break at the first self-loop and skip the others? But that is okay because they are the same.\n\nBut what if we have a self-loop and then a non-self-loop? Then we break and skip the non-self-loop? That is what we want.\n\nBut what if we have a non-self-loop and then a self-loop? Then the non-self-loop is processed first: we set m[i] to some value (by ORing x ^ M[j]). Then we see the self-loop and set m[i] = x and break. But that overwrites the previous value? And that is correct because the self-loop forces a_i to be x, so we set it to x and break.\n\nBut note: the non-self-loop constraint might have set some bits that are not in x? Then we set m[i] to x, which clears those bits. But that is required by the self-loop. And the problem is consistent, so the non-self-loop constraint must not require bits beyond x? Actually, the constraint (i,j,x') must have x' having at least the bits of x? But the non-self-loop constraint might have set bits that are in x? Then we set m[i] to x, which is the union of the required bits? Actually, the self-loop constraint is stronger: it forces a_i to be exactly x. So we must set m[i] to x and ignore the non-self-loop constraints.\n\nTherefore, we can break in the else branch.\n\nBut note: what if we have two self-loops? Then we break at the first one and skip the second? But the second one must be the same as the first? So it's okay.\n\nSo the missing code for the else branch in program1.py is:\n   m[i] = x\n   break\n\nBut wait: what if we have no self-loop? Then we don't break and we process all constraints. That is the normal case.\n\nTherefore, we write in the else branch:\n   m[i] = x\n   break\n\nBut note: what if we have multiple self-loops? The problem says the constraints are consistent, so they are the same. So we can break at the first one.\n\nHowever, what if we have a self-loop and then another self-loop? The first one sets m[i]=x and breaks, so the second one is never processed. That is acceptable.\n\nBut what if we have a self-loop and then a non-self-loop? The break will skip the non-self-loop. That is acceptable because the self-loop fixed the value.\n\nBut what if we have a non-self-loop and then a self-loop? Then the non-self-loop is processed (setting some bits) and then the self-loop sets m[i]=x and breaks. That is acceptable because the self-loop overrides and sets the value to x.\n\nHowever, note: the non-self-loop constraint might have set bits that are not in x? Then we set m[i] to x, which clears those bits. But that is required by the self-loop. And the problem is consistent, so the non-self-loop constraint must not require bits beyond x? Actually, the constraint (i,j,x') must be satisfied: a_i | a_j = x'. Since a_i is forced to x, then we require x | a_j = x'. This constraint will be used to set a_j (when we process j). But for a_i, we are done.\n\nTherefore, the code for the else branch is:\n   m[i] = x\n   break\n\nBut note: the problem says the array must be lexicographically smallest. How does this algorithm work?\n\nThe algorithm:\n   First, set M[i] = AND of all x in constraints that involve i. This sets the maximum possible bits that i can have? Actually, for each constraint (i,j,x), we have a_i must be a subset of x, so M[i] is the set of bits that are forced to be in a_i? Actually, no: the AND of all x for constraints that involve i: because if a constraint (i,j,x) says that a_i | a_j = x, then a_i must be a subset of x. So M[i] is the set of bits that are present in every constraint that involves i? Actually, it is the set of bits that must be present in a_i? Not exactly: because a_i can have a bit only if it is in x, but it doesn't have to have every bit of x. However, note: if a bit is not in x, then it cannot be in a_i. So M[i] is the set of bits that are allowed? Actually, no: it is the set of bits that are present in every x that involves i? But that is not the same as the bits that must be present.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from known problems like \"OR constraints\") is:\n\n   Let M[i] = (2^30-1) initially.\n   For each constraint (i, j, x):\n        M[i] &= x\n        M[j] &= x\n\n   Then, for each index i, we set a[i] = 0.\n   Then, for each bit from high to low? Actually, the known solution is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j, x in constraints[i]:\n                if j == i:\n                    a[i] = x\n                    break\n                else:\n                    a[i] |= (x & ~a[j])\n\n   But note: the sample code we are given is:\n\n        for i in range(0, n):\n            for (j, x) in L[i]:\n                if j != i:\n                    m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\n                else:\n                    # TODO\n\n        M[i] = m[i]\n\n   And then we print m.\n\n   The line: m[i] |= x ^ M[j]   is equivalent to: \n        m[i] |= (x & ~M[j])\n\n   Why? Because x ^ M[j] is the bits that are in x but not in M[j]? Actually, no: XOR is not the same as set difference. But note: M[j] is the AND of all constraints for j. And the known solution for the non-self-loop constraint is: \n        a[i] |= (x & ~a[j])\n\n   But in our code, we are using M[j] (which is the AND of constraints for j) and not a[j]. However, note that after we process an index, we set M[i] = m[i]. And we are processing indices in order. So when we process i, we have not processed j? Actually, we are processing i in increasing order? And we are using M[j] which was computed in the first pass (the AND of constraints) and not the updated m[j]. \n\n   This might be the problem. The known solution (from Codeforces problems) often uses:\n\n        a = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j, x in g[i]:\n                if j == i:\n                    a[i] = x\n                    break\n                else:\n                    a[i] |= x & ~a[j]\n\n   But note: in our code, we are using M[j] (which is the AND of constraints for j) and not a[j]. And then we set M[i] = m[i] at the end. This is different.\n\n   Actually, the known solution uses the current value of a[j] (which is the array we are building). But in our code, we are using M[j] which is fixed from the first pass.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm we are given might be different.\n\n   Let me check the known problem: \"Nauuo and Portals\" or \"OR in Matrix\"? Actually, I recall a problem: \"Guess the Array\" (Codeforces). \n\n   Alternatively, note: the sample input:\n\n        n=4, q=2\n        constraints: \n            1 2 3\n            2 3 3\n\n        The lexicographically smallest array is [0,3,2,2]? But the sample lists multiple arrays.\n\n   How does the algorithm work for the sample?\n\n        M[0] = 3, M[1] = 3, M[2] = 3, M[3] = (2^30-1) [because no constraint?]\n        Then for each index i, we look at L[i]:\n            i=0: L[0] = [(1,3)] -> j=1, x=3 -> m[0] |= 3 ^ M[1] = 3 ^ 3 = 0 -> m[0]=0.\n            i=1: L[1] = [(0,3), (2,3)] -> \n                  for (0,3): m[1] |= 3 ^ M[0] = 3^3=0 -> still 0.\n                  for (2,3): m[1] |= 3 ^ M[2] = 3^3=0 -> m[1]=0.\n            i=2: L[2] = [(1,3)] -> m[2] |= 3^M[1]=0 -> m[2]=0.\n            i=3: L[3] is empty -> m[3]=0.\n\n        Then we output [0,0,0,0] -> but that is not in the sample.\n\n        The sample arrays: [0,3,2,2] is one.\n\n        What went wrong?\n\n        The known solution: \n            a[0] = 0\n            Then for constraint (0,1,3): a[0]|a[1]=3 -> 0|a[1]=3 -> a[1]=3.\n            Then constraint (1,2,3): 3|a[2]=3 -> a[2] can be 0,1,2,3? but we want lexicographically smallest -> so set a[2]=0? but then 3|0=3 -> works. Then a[3] can be 0? -> [0,3,0,0] is lexicographically smaller than [0,3,2,2]? but the sample lists [0,3,2,2] and [2,1,0,0] etc.\n\n        Actually, the sample output in the problem is: [2,1,0,0]? but the sample input is:\n\n            Input: 4 2\n                    1 2 3\n                    2 3 3\n\n        And the sample lists 9 arrays. The lexicographically smallest is [0,3,0,0]? but that is not in the list? \n\n        The sample arrays listed: \n            [0, 3, 2, 2], [2, 1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 2, 0], [2, 1, 2, 2], [2, 3, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0, 2], [2, 3, 2, 0], [2, 3, 2, 2]\n\n        The lexicographically smallest is [0,3,2,2]? because 0<2.\n\n        How to get [0,3,2,2]? \n            a0=0, a1=3, a2=2, a3=2.\n\n        How does the constraint (2,3,3) hold? 2|2 = 2, not 3 -> fails.\n\n        Actually, the constraints are:\n            a1 | a2 = 3 -> 0|3=3 -> holds.\n            a2 | a3 = 3 -> 2|2=2 -> fails.\n\n        So [0,3,2,2] does not work.\n\n        The sample says: \"these are all the arrays satisfying the statements\". So [0,3,2,2] is listed? but it fails the second constraint.\n\n        Let me check: the problem says: \"each of them being three integers i, j, x\", meaning the first constraint is for indices 1 and 2, and the second for indices 2 and 3.\n\n        In [0,3,2,2]:\n            a1=0, a2=3 -> 0|3=3 -> holds.\n            a2=3, a3=2 -> 3|2 = 3 (because 3 in binary is 11, 2 is 10, OR is 11=3) -> holds.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        How to compute a2? \n            We have constraint (2,3,3): so a2|a3=3.\n            We also have constraint (1,2,3): a1|a2=3.\n\n        The known solution:\n\n            Let M[0]=3, M[1]=3, M[2]=3, M[3]=3? \n            But the second constraint: (2,3,3) -> so M[2] &=3, M[3]&=3.\n\n            Then for i=0: \n                constraint: (1,3) -> j=1, x=3 -> m[0] |= 3 ^ M[1] = 3^3=0 -> m[0]=0.\n            i=1: \n                constraint: (0,3) -> m[1] |= 3^M[0]=0 -> 0; then constraint (2,3): m[1] |= 3^M[2]=0 -> m[1]=0 -> then set M[1]=0.\n            i=2:\n                constraint: (1,3) -> m[2] |= 3^M[1]=3^0=3 -> m[2]=3; then constraint (3,3): m[2] |= 3^M[3]=3^3=0 -> still 3; then set M[2]=3.\n            i=3:\n                constraint: (2,3) -> m[3] |= 3^M[2]=3^3=0 -> m[3]=0.\n\n            Then we get [0,0,3,0] -> which does not work: a1|a2=0|3=3 -> holds; a2|a3=3|0=3 -> holds. But lexicographically smallest? [0,0,3,0] is lex smaller than [0,3,2,2]? \n            But [0,0,3,0] is lex smaller than [0,3,2,2] because the second element is 0<3.\n\n            However, the sample lists [0,3,2,2] and not [0,0,3,0]. Why?\n\n            The sample arrays: \n                [0, 3, 2, 2] -> 0,3,2,2\n                [2, 1, 0, 0] -> 2,1,0,0 -> lex smaller than [0,0,3,0]? \n                    Compare first element: 0 vs 2 -> 0<2 -> so [0,3,2,2] is lex smaller than [2,1,0,0]? \n                But [0,0,3,0] is [0,0,3,0] -> first element 0, second element 0 -> which is smaller than [0,3,2,2] (which has second element 3). \n\n            So [0,0,3,0] should be in the list? but it is not.\n\n            Let me check if [0,0,3,0] satisfies:\n                a1|a2 = 0|0=0, but we need 3 -> fails.\n\n            So [0,0,3,0] does not work.\n\n            What went wrong in the computation? \n                For i=1: \n                    constraints: (0,3) and (2,3)\n                    m[1] = 0 initially.\n                    For (0,3): j=0, x=3 -> m[1] |= 3 ^ M[0] = 3^3=0 -> still 0.\n                    For (2,3): j=2, x=3 -> m[1] |= 3 ^ M[2] = 3^3=0 -> still 0.\n                Then we set M[1]=0.\n\n            But then for i=2: \n                constraint (1,3): j=1, x=3 -> m[2] |= 3 ^ M[1] = 3^0=3 -> m[2]=3.\n\n            Then for i=3: \n                constraint (2,3): j=2, x=3 -> m[3] |= 3^M[2]=3^3=0.\n\n            So we get [0,0,3,0]. Why is this not valid? \n                a1=0, a2=0, a3=3, a4=0.\n                Constraint1: a1|a2 = 0|0=0, but should be 3 -> fails.\n\n            So the algorithm is not correct.\n\n        The known solution (from a known problem) is:\n\n            Let ans = [0]*n\n            must = [0]*n   # or we can use the M array as the AND of all x for the index\n\n            for each constraint (i, j, x):\n                must[i] |= x\n                must[j] |= x\n\n            # But wait, that is OR, not AND.\n\n        Another known solution (from Codeforces submission for a similar problem):\n\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            a = [0] * n\n            constraints = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n            for _ in range(q):\n                i, j, x = map(int, input().split())\n                i -= 1\n                j -= 1\n                if i > j:\n                    i, j = j, i\n                constraints[i].append((j, x))\n                a[i] |= x\n                a[j] |= x\n\n            # But then they do something else.\n\n        The intended solution for the problem \"OR constraints\" is to use the following for lex smallest:\n\n            a = [0] * n\n            for bit in range(0, 30):\n                # create an array b of ones (meaning we try to set the bit to 0 if possible)\n                b = [1] * n\n                # for each constraint, if the bit is not set in x, then we know both a_i and a_j cannot have the bit.\n                # if the bit is set in x, then at least one of a_i or a_j must have the bit.\n                # but we want lex smallest, so we try to set the bit to 0 in a_i whenever possible.\n                # we can set a_i to 0 for the bit if for every constraint (i,j,x) that has the bit set, we can rely on a_j having the bit.\n                # but we haven't fixed a_j yet? so we do it in two passes? or by propagation.\n\n            This is complicated.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the problem is non\u2010trivial, and that the provided code has a specific structure, I think the intended missing part for the self-loop is to break. And hope that the algorithm is correct for the non-self-loop part.\n\n        But the sample [0,0,3,0] is not valid. So the algorithm might be flawed.\n\n        Let me try to understand the line: m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\n\n            x is the OR constraint value.\n            M[j] is the AND of all x that involve j.\n\n            What is x ^ M[j]? \n                It is the bits that are in x or in M[j] but not in both.\n\n            But we want to set in a_i the bits that are in x and not in a_j? because if the bit is in a_j, then we don't need to set it in a_i. But we don't know a_j yet.\n\n        The known solution in the sample code might be:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                a[i] = 0\n                for (j, x) in constraints[i]:\n                    if i == j:\n                        a[i] = x\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        a[i] |= x & ~a[j]\n\n        But this requires knowing a[j] for j that have been processed? But we are processing in increasing order? and for j>i, a[j] is not set yet.\n\n        So they might do:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):   # from last to first\n\n        But the given code processes i from 0 to n-1.\n\n        Given the time, and that the problem says to output only the missing part, and the sample input might not be covered by the provided code, I will output the break.\n\n        For program1.py: in the else branch, we do:\n            m[i] = x\n            break\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        We are given multiple test cases. The first integer is t. Then for each test case:\n            first integer n, then a list of n integers.\n\n        The current code has:\n\n            input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n            n = input_arr[0]\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to read t test cases.\n\n        Each test case has:\n            first integer: n\n            then n integers.\n\n        So the structure:\n\n            t = input_arr[0]\n            pos = 1\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                pos += n_i\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But the variable 'n' is already used for the number of test cases? Actually, the first integer is t, and then the next is the first test case's n.\n\n        The current code sets:\n            n = input_arr[0]   # which is t\n\n        But then we have:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO\n\n        We should not use 'n' for the number of test cases because the function diff_ops uses arr[0] for modulus. We have a global variable n (the number of test cases) and then inside the test case, n is the length of the array.\n\n        Let me change: the first integer is t, not n. The variable n is used for the number of test cases? Actually, the code does:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # this is the number of test cases, t\n\n        Then in the while loop, we read the next integer which is the n for the test case.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            t = input_arr[0]\n            pos = 1\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                pos += n_i\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But the while condition: while pos <= len_input-1. And we are doing exactly t test cases.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):   # but n is the number of test cases\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                pos += n_i\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But the variable n is set to input_arr[0] (which is the number of test cases). So we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        This is safe because the total number of integers is 1 (for t) + for each test case: 1 (for n_i) + n_i, and we are reading t test cases.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases. And we are using it to loop.\n\n        However, the function diff_ops is defined as:\n\n            def diff_ops(arr):\n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    result = result and (arr[i] % arr[0] == 0)\n\n        This function is called for each test case.\n\n        What is the logic of diff_ops? \n            It checks that for every i from 1 to len(arr)-1, arr[i] is divisible by arr[0]? \n\n        But the problem: \n            We are allowed to choose an index i (from 2 to n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. We can do any number of times. We want to make a_i=0 for all i>=2.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        We note that the operations only change one element at a time. And we can do in any order and any number of times.\n\n        Insight: \n            The operation: choose i and set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1]. \n            This is similar to the Euclidean algorithm for gcd. \n\n        We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2. What about a_1? It remains unchanged.\n\n        Consider the last element: a_n. To make a_n=0, we must be able to subtract multiples of a_{n-1} from a_n until it becomes 0. This is possible if and only if a_n is a multiple of a_{n-1}? But note: we can also change a_{n-1} first.\n\n        Actually, the operations can be done in any order and multiple times. We can also change a_{n-1} by subtracting a_{n-2} (if n-1>=2), and so on.\n\n        However, note that the problem does not require a_1 to become 0. Only a_i for i>=2.\n\n        Known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n            We can only make the array [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0] if we can make all from index2 to n to 0.\n\n            The necessary and sufficient condition is that a1 must divide every element in the array? \n\n            But consider: \n                [5, 10] -> \n                    Operation1: i=2: [5, 5] \n                    Operation2: i=2: [5,0] -> done.\n\n                [1,2,3]:\n                    Operation1: i=3: [1,2,1] \n                    Operation2: i=2: [1,1,1]\n                    Operation3: i=3: [1,1,0]\n                    Operation4: i=2: [1,0,0]\n\n                [1,0,0] -> then we can also do i=3: [1,0,0] (but it is already 0) and i=2: [1,0,0] (already 0).\n\n            How about [2, 3]?\n                Operation1: i=2: [2, 1] \n                Operation2: i=2: [2, -1] -> but then we can keep subtracting? but the problem says positive integers? but after the operation, the number might become negative? \n\n            The problem says: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\". And the array consists of positive integers initially. But after an operation, a_i might become non-positive.\n\n            The problem does not restrict to positive integers after operations. So negative is allowed.\n\n            But then [2,3] can be:\n                [2,3] -> [2,1] (3-2=1) -> [2,-1] (1-2=-1) -> [2, -3] (-1-2=-3) -> ... never zero? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n                [2,3] -> [2,1] -> [2, -1] -> then we can do i=2: [2, -1] -> [2, -1-2 = -3] -> ... we never get to 0.\n\n            So how did [5,10] work? because 10 is a multiple of 5.\n\n            How about [2,4]? \n                [2,4] -> [2,2] -> [2,0] -> works.\n\n            So it works if a2 is a multiple of a1? \n\n            But consider [1,2,3]: \n                We made it work. But 2 is not a multiple of 1? and 3 is not a multiple of 1? \n                Actually, 2 % 1 == 0, and 3 % 1 == 0? because any integer is divisible by 1.\n\n            So the condition in the function diff_ops is: \n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    if arr[i] % arr[0] != 0, then return False.\n\n            But wait: in [1,2,3]: \n                arr[0]=1, then 2%1=0, 3%1=0 -> returns True.\n\n            In [5,10]: 10%5==0 -> True.\n\n            In [2,3]: 3%2=1 !=0 -> False -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n            But consider [3, 5, 2] (n=3): \n                We want to make a2 and a3 to 0.\n\n                We can do:\n                    First, for a3: we can do: \n                         [3,5,2] -> [3,5,2-5 = -3] -> [3,5,-3] \n                    Then for a2: [3,5-3=2,-3] -> [3,2,-3]\n                    Then for a3: [3,2,-3-2 = -5] -> [3,2,-5]\n                    Then for a2: [3,2-3=-1,-5] -> [3,-1,-5]\n                    Then for a3: [3,-1,-5-(-1)= -4] -> ... not zero.\n\n                Alternatively, can we make it?\n\n                Known solution: \n                    We can simulate backwards? \n\n                Insight from known problems: \n                    The operation is linear and can be represented as a combination of the initial values. \n                    We require that the entire array (except a1) becomes 0. \n                    The operations are: \n                         We can subtract any multiple of a1 from a2? \n                         But also, we can subtract any multiple of a1 from a3? but only after fixing a2? \n\n                Actually, the known solution is that the answer is \"YES\" if and only if a1 = gcd(a1, a2, ..., an)\n\n                Why? \n                    Because the operations are essentially the Euclidean algorithm. The final state is [a1,0,0,...,0]. \n                    The gcd of the entire array must remain invariant? \n\n                But note: \n                    Operation: \n                         We can only change a_i (for i>=2) by subtracting a_{i-1}. \n                    This is not the same as the Euclidean algorithm for the whole array.\n\n                However, we can do:\n\n                    We can make a2 = a2 mod a1, then a3 = a3 mod a1, ...? \n\n                But consider: \n                    [3, 5, 2] -> \n                         We can do on a2: \n                            5 mod 3 = 2, so we do: 5 - 3 = 2 -> [3,2,2]\n                         Then on a3: \n                            2 mod 3 = 2 -> but we cannot change a3 by subtracting a2 (which is 2) because 2-2=0? \n                            So we do: [3,2,0]\n                         Then on a2: 2 mod 3: we can do 2-3 = -1 -> [3,-1,0] -> then we can do a2 again: -1-3 = -4 -> ... \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    [3,5,2] -> \n                         a3: 2 - 5 = -3 -> [3,5,-3]\n                         a2: 5 - (-3) = 8 -> [3,8,-3]   (but we can also do a2 first: 5-3=2 -> [3,2,2])\n\n                It is complex.\n\n            After checking known problems (like Codeforces Round 752, or similar), the solution is:\n\n                We can make all elements from index2 to n become 0 if and only if for every i (from 1 to n-1), the gcd of the first i+1 elements remains a1? \n\n            Actually, a known solution for the same problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    g = a[0]\n                    for i in range(1, n):\n                        g = gcd(g, a[i])\n                    if g == a[0]:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n\n            But that is not the same: because the sample [1,2,3] has gcd=1, and a[0]=1 -> YES.\n\n            [5,10] has gcd=5, a[0]=5 -> YES.\n\n            [2,3] has gcd=1, a[0]=2 -> 1!=2 -> NO.\n\n            [3,5,2]: gcd(3,5,2)=1, a[0]=3 -> 1!=3 -> NO.\n\n            But the sample [1,2,3] is YES, and [2,3] is NO.\n\n            However, the sample [3,5,2] is NO? but is there a solution?\n\n            Let me try to make [3,5,2] into zeros:\n\n                We can only change indices 2 and 3 (if n=3, then indices 2 and 3, but note: the index in the problem: i from 2 to n, so for n=3, we can change index2 (which is the second element, a1=3, a2=5, a3=2) and index3.\n\n                Operation on index2 (i=2): \n                    a2 = a2 - a1 = 5-3=2 -> [3,2,2]\n                Operation on index3 (i=3): \n                    a3 = a3 - a2 = 2-2=0 -> [3,2,0]\n                Operation on index2: \n                    a2 = a2 - a1 = 2-3 = -1 -> [3,-1,0]\n                Operation on index3: \n                    a3 = a3 - a2 = 0 - (-1) = 1 -> [3,-1,1]\n                ... not working.\n\n            Alternatively:\n\n                [3,5,2] -> \n                    i=3: a3 = a3 - a2 = 2-5 = -3 -> [3,5,-3]\n                    i=2: a2 = a2 - a1 = 5-3=2 -> [3,2,-3]\n                    i=3: a3 = a3 - a2 = -3-2 = -5 -> [3,2,-5]\n                    i=2: a2 = a2 - a1 = 2-3 = -1 -> [3,-1,-5]\n                    i=3: a3 = a3 - a2 = -5 - (-1) = -4 -> ... \n\n            It seems impossible.\n\n            Therefore, the gcd solution might work? \n\n            But the sample [1,2,3] works and gcd=1 equals a0=1 -> YES.\n\n            However, the problem says: \n                \"In the third test case, you can choose indices in the order 4, 3, 2.\"\n\n            The third test case in the sample input is not provided in the note. But the sample input has t=100 test cases.\n\n            The known problem in Codeforces: \"Make All Equal to Zero\" or similar? \n\n            Actually, the problem is: https://codeforces.com/contest/1607/problem/F\n\n            But I recall a recent problem: \n\n            After checking, the intended solution is to check that every element is divisible by a0? \n\n            Why did [1,2,3] work? because 2 and 3 are divisible by 1? \n\n            But then [3,5,2]: 5 and 2 are not divisible by 3 -> NO.\n\n            And [2,3]: 3 is not divisible by 2 -> NO.\n\n            And [5,10]: 10 is divisible by 5 -> YES.\n\n            But wait: the sample [1,2,3] is divisible by 1 -> YES.\n\n            And the sample [2,1,0,0] in the first sample output of program1 is not related.\n\n            Therefore, the function diff_ops is:\n\n                def diff_ops(arr):\n                    result = True\n                    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                        result = result and (arr[i] % arr[0] == 0)\n                    return result\n\n            This is exactly what we have.\n\n            But note: what if a[0] is 0? \n                The problem states: \"a1, a2, ..., an (1<=a_i<=10^9)\" -> so a[0]>=1.\n\n            Therefore, the function is safe.\n\n            So the program2.py is correct as long as we read the test cases properly.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases (t)\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But note: the variable 'n' is the first integer (the number of test cases). And we are using it to loop.\n\n        However, the variable name 'n' is already used for the number of test cases. And then inside the loop, we use 'size' for the n of the test case.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        So the final answer:\n\n        program1: in the else branch: \n            m[i] = x\n            break\n\n        program2: in the while loop: \n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is \"while pos <= len_input-1\". We are reading exactly the next n test cases. So we can replace the while loop with a for loop.\n\n        However, the code says \"while pos <= len_input-1\", and we are reading until we have processed all integers. But the number of test cases is n, so we know exactly how many.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for _ in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        This is better.\n\n        But the code has a while loop. We can change it to a for loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break out of the while loop by condition, but the for loop is simpler.\n\n        Since the TODO is inside the while loop, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                if pos > len_input-1: \n                    break   # but should not happen\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But the problem says the input has exactly the integers.\n\n        We can simply do the for loop.\n\n        Therefore, I will output:\n\n        program1: \"m[i] = x\\n            break\"\n        program2: \"for i in range(n):\\n        size = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        pos += size\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code has an indentation level of 4 for the while loop body. The for loop should be at the same level.\n\n        However, the existing code has:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the for loop? But that would be a loop inside the while loop. We want to replace the while loop with the for loop? \n\n        Actually, we can remove the while loop and put the for loop in its place.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        The TODO is inside the while loop. We are to fill the block. But the block should read all test cases. We can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]; pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        and then break out of the while loop? because we are done. Or we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                ... \n            break   # to break the while loop after one iteration\n\n        But the while loop condition is \"while pos<=len_input-1\", and after reading n test cases, we break out of the for loop and then the while loop condition might not hold? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # Read one test case per iteration of the while loop? \n\n        But the problem has exactly n test cases.\n\n        Given the structure, I think the intended solution is to read one test case per while loop iteration. But the for loop is simpler.\n\n        However, the problem says: the input consists of multiple test cases. The first integer is t (which we stored in n). Then t test cases.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]; pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        and then we break out of the while loop? But the while loop will run only once? \n\n        Actually, we can simply do:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]; pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        and then the while loop condition will be checked: pos might be beyond the end, so it breaks.\n\n        But we can also break after the for loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can replace the while loop with the for loop.\n\n        Since the problem allows a block, we can write:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        and then break   # to break the while loop\n\n        But then the while loop runs only once.\n\n        Or we can do without the break? The while loop condition: after the for loop, pos might be beyond len_input-1, so the while loop will not run again.\n\n        But to be safe, we can break after the for loop.\n\n        However, the problem says: the input has exactly the integers. So we don't need to break.\n\n        I will output for program2:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        This is the block.\n\n        But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases, which is the first integer.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"m[i] = x\\n            break\",\n          \"program2\": \"for i in range(n):\\n        size = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        pos += size\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1 code has 12 spaces of indentation for the else branch, and then we write 12 spaces for \"m[i] = x\" and 12 spaces for \"break\"? \n\n        Actually, in the given code:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The else branch is indented by 8 spaces (from the for loop) and the comment is indented by 12. So we write:\n\n            else:\n                m[i] = x\n                break\n\n        But the break must be at the same level as the assignment. So:\n\n            else:\n                m[i] = x\n                break\n\n        In the string, we can write: \"m[i] = x\\n                break\" with 12 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        But the existing code has 12 spaces for the body of the for loop. So we write:\n\n            \"                m[i] = x\\n                break\"\n\n        But the else branch is already at 8 spaces, and the body should be 12. So:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO becomes:\n                m[i] = x\n                break\n\n        So the string for program1: \"m[i] = x\\n                break\"\n\n        But the program2 block: the while loop body is indented by 4. The for loop should be indented by 8? \n\n        Actually, the existing code:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at 8 spaces. We replace it with:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But the for loop body is 12 spaces.\n\n        So we write for program2:\n\n            \"    for i in range(n):\\n        size = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n        pos += size\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\"\n\n        But wait, the while loop body is already at 4 spaces. Then the for loop should be at 8 spaces, and the for loop body at 12.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without extra indentation? \n\n        Actually, the code in the TODO is at the same level as the comment. We are to replace the comment with the block.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        and the indentation level for the while loop body is 4, so the for loop is at 4, and the body of the for loop is 8.\n\n        But the existing code has:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        which is at 8 spaces. So we write the for loop at 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body is:\n\n            while ...:\n                [4 spaces] ... \n\n        The TODO is at 8 spaces. We are to replace the TODO line with the for loop. The for loop should be at 4 spaces? \n\n        But the while loop body is one level: 4 spaces. The for loop is a block that replaces the TODO, so it should be at 4 spaces? \n\n        However, the TODO is a comment at 8 spaces. We are to replace that one line with a block of code at the same level? \n\n        The code after replacement:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                for i in range(n):\n                    size = input_arr[pos]\n                    pos += 1\n                    arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                    pos += size\n                    test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But this is not what we want: we want to read n test cases, not n test cases for every while loop iteration.\n\n        We must break out of the while loop after reading the test cases. \n\n        Given the confusion, I will output the for loop at 8 spaces? \n\n        But then the while loop will run once and read all test cases, and then the condition at the top of the while loop will be checked: if pos is beyond, then it breaks.\n\n        Actually, after the for loop, pos will be at the end, so the while loop condition fails and we break.\n\n        So we can write the for loop at 8 spaces? \n\n        The program2 code currently has:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                size = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        But then the for loop is at 8 spaces, and the body of the for loop is 12 spaces.\n\n        So the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"for i in range(n):\\n                size = input_arr[pos]\\n                pos += 1\\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n                pos += size\\n                test_cases.append(arr)\"\n\n        But the while loop body is 4 spaces, and the for loop is 8 spaces, and the for loop body is 12 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without newlines? \n\n        Given the complexity, I will output the code as:\n\n        program1: \n            \"m[i] = x\\n                break\"\n\n        program2:\n            \"for i in range(n):\\n                size = input_arr[pos]\\n                pos += 1\\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\\n                pos += size\\n                test_cases.append(arr)\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code has a while loop that runs only once? and reads all test cases.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
