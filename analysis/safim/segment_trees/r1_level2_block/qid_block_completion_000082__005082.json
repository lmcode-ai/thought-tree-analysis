Update index0 to 1:\n  left_edit: i=0 -> no left -> 0. right_edit: \n        old: 0 and 0 -> same -> 0\n        new: 1 and 0 -> different -> 1\n        so right_edit=1 -> add 1 * (0+1)*(3-0-1)=1*1*2=2 -> aws=8. Then set tar[0]=1 -> tar=[1,0,0]\n\nUpdate index1 to 2:\n  left_edit: \n        old: tar[0]=1, tar[1]=0 -> different -> 1\n        new: 1 and 2 -> different -> 1 -> so left_edit=0?

Actually, the factor for the first pair (index0 and 1): (0+1)*(3-0-1)=1*2=2. [2,3]: different -> add (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2. total = 6+2+2 = 10. So it matches.

So the code has an issue at i=0. How to fix? The loop goes from i=n-1 down to 0. But invs(0) is called. We should avoid i=0 in the invs(i) call. Note: the loop in the first part only goes from i=0 to i=(n+1)//2 - 1. For i>= (n+1)//2, out[i] is 0 initially. In the backward loop, when i=0, out[0] is 2 (for n=3) and then we do:\n\n      rem = 1 (from previous) + out[0] * invs(0)\n\n  But invs(0) is not defined. What should invs(0) be? We can define invs(0) = 0? But then for i=0: \n      rem = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1\n      out[0] = 2 - 1 = 1. Then out = [1, 1, 0] -> which is the expected answer. So if we define:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          if x == 0:\n              return 0\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x]) Then for n=3: \n      i=0: \n          oldrem = 1\n          rem = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1\n          out[0] = 2 - 1 = 1. Then out = [1, 1, 0] -> correct. But is this the intended solution? Let me try n=5. The expected answer for n=5: \n      Example: there are 24 trees.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\nNote: The initial array and a series of updates are given. After each update (which changes one element), we must output the total awesomeness for all contiguous subarrays.\n\nInsight:\nThe total awesomeness for all contiguous subarrays can be computed by considering the contribution of each adjacent pair (i, i+1). \nSpecifically, for a pair (a[i], a[i+1]), if they are different, then they contribute to a \"boundary\" that will be present in all contiguous subarrays that include both a[i] and a[i+1]. \nThe number of subarrays that include both indices i and i+1 is (i+1) * (n - i - 1) [if we index from 0]. \n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is (1 + the number of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1]).\nTherefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays can be expressed as:\n  total = (number of subarrays) + (sum over adjacent pairs of the contribution when they are different)\n\nThe number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nFor an adjacent pair (i, i+1) (0-indexed), if a[i] != a[i+1], then it contributes 1 for every subarray that includes both indices. The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n-i-1) [because l can be from 0 to i, and r from i+1 to n-1, so (i+1) choices for l and (n-i-1) choices for r].\n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n  total_aws = n*(n+1)//2   [each subarray has at least 1 block] \n              + (for each index i from 0 to n-2, if a[i] != a[i+1] then add (i+1)*(n-i-1))\n\nBut note: the example: [1,2,2,4,5] -> 29.\nNumber of subarrays = 15.\nThen we have adjacent pairs:\n  i=0: 1 and 2 -> different -> add 1 * (5-0-1) = 1*4 = 4\n  i=1: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n  i=2: 2 and 4 -> different -> 3 * (5-2-1) = 3*2 = 6\n  i=3: 4 and 5 -> different -> 4 * (5-3-1) = 4*1 = 4\nTotal = 15 + 4 + 0 + 6 + 4 = 29.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, we can maintain:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  and then for each adjacent pair i (from 0 to n-2) we have a contribution: \n      contrib[i] = (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\nThen total_aws = base + sum(contrib[i] for i in range(n-1))\n\nBut note: when we update an element at position i, it can affect at most two adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\nSo we can maintain:\n  an array `arr` for the current array.\n  a variable `total` that is base + the sum of contributions for all adjacent pairs.\n\nInitially, we compute the base and then for each adjacent pair we add the contribution.\n\nThen for each update (i, x) (with i 1-indexed, so we convert to 0-indexed index = pos):\n  Let pos = i-1.\n  We are going to change arr[pos] to x.\n\n  We remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs (pos-1, pos) and (pos, pos+1) (if they exist) from total.\n  Then update arr[pos] = x.\n  Then add the contributions of (pos-1, pos) and (pos, pos+1) (if they exist) to total.\n\nBut note: the contribution for a pair (i, i+1) is stored at index i (for the left index). \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  # Remove the old contributions for the two adjacent pairs\n  if pos > 0:\n      # pair (pos-1, pos)\n      if arr[pos-1] != arr[pos]:\n          total -= pos * (n - pos)   # because the left index of the pair is pos-1 -> so the factor is ( (pos-1)+1 = pos ) * (n - (pos-1) - 1) = pos * (n - pos)\n  if pos < n-1:\n      # pair (pos, pos+1)\n      if arr[pos] != arr[pos+1]:\n          total -= (pos+1) * (n - pos - 1)\n\n  # Update the array\n  arr[pos] = x\n\n  # Add the new contributions for the two adjacent pairs\n  if pos > 0:\n      if arr[pos-1] != arr[pos]:\n          total += pos * (n - pos)\n  if pos < n-1:\n      if arr[pos] != arr[pos+1]:\n          total += (pos+1) * (n - pos - 1)\n\nBut note: the formula for the pair (i, i+1) uses the left index i to compute the factor: (i+1) * (n - i - 1). \nHowever, for the pair (pos-1, pos): the left index is pos-1, so factor = ( (pos-1)+1 ) * (n - (pos-1) - 1) = pos * (n - pos).\nFor the pair (pos, pos+1): the left index is pos, so factor = (pos+1) * (n - pos - 1).\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the base (n*(n+1)//2) is constant. So we can precompute it and then update total accordingly.\n\nBut wait: the example update_awesomeness function provided in the code already has a similar structure. Let me check:\n\nThe provided function:\n\ndef update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n    left_edit = (x != arr[i - 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) if i != 0 else 0\n    right_edit = (x != arr[i + 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i + 1]) if i != n - 1 else 0\n    arr[i] = x\n    return curr_aws + left_edit * i * (n - i) + right_edit * (i + 1) * (n - i - 1)\n\nHere, the parameters: \n  i is the index (0-indexed) to update.\n  left_edit: \n      if the update changes the left pair (i-1, i) from same to different: then we add 1 * (i * (n-i))? \n      but note: if originally they were same, then after update they become different: then we need to add the contribution? \n      However, the formula: \n          left_edit = (if new is different from left) - (if old was different from left)\n          so if it becomes different: +1, if it becomes same: -1, else 0.\n\n  Similarly for right_edit.\n\nBut note: the factor for the left pair (i-1, i) is i * (n-i) [because the left index of the pair is i-1, so factor = ( (i-1)+1 ) * (n - (i-1) - 1) = i * (n-i)].\n\nSimilarly, the factor for the right pair (i, i+1) is (i+1) * (n-i-1).\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the initial setup, we must compute the initial total_aws.\n\nWe can do:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  Then for i in range(n-1):\n        if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n            base += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\nBut note: the factor for the pair at i (0-indexed) is (i+1) * (n-i-1). \n\nHowever, the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n  n, m = map(int, INPUT[0].split())\n  arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n  tar = [0] * n   # ??? Why is there a tar? \n\nWait, the code then does:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n  for line in INPUT[2:]:\n      i, x = map(int, line.split())\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i - 1, x, aws)   # but note: it uses 'tar' and not 'arr'\n\nThis is confusing. The problem says: \"after each query the i-th element of the array a is equal to x\". \n\nBut the update_awesomeness function updates the array that we pass to it. And the main loop uses an array called `tar` and an initial array `arr`. \n\nLooking at the initial setup:\n\n  We have an array `arr` read from input, and then we create `tar = [0]*n`.\n\nThen we have a loop: for i, x in enumerate(arr): ... \n\nWhat should we do in that loop? \n\nWe are going to use the update_awesomeness function to update the array `tar` to the initial array. \n\nBut note: the initial array is given in `arr`. So we are going to set `tar` to the initial array by updating each element? \n\nAlternatively, we can initialize `tar` to the initial array and then compute the initial awesomeness.\n\nBut the update_awesomeness function is designed for updates. We can use it to build the initial state? \n\nHowever, the update_awesomeness function updates one element and adjusts the awesomeness. But initially, the array `tar` is all zeros, and we are going to set each element to the initial value? \n\nBut note: if we update an element that is currently 0 to the initial value, then we are effectively building the array from zeros. \n\nBut the initial array might have zeros? The input says: \"1 <= a_i <= 10^9\", so no zeros. So we can do:\n\n  Start with an array `tar` of zeros (which is not the same as the initial array) and then update each element to the initial value? \n\nBut that would be inefficient: we do n updates just to set the initial array. And then we have m more updates. Total n+m <= 200000, which is acceptable? \n\nBut note: the problem constraints: n, m up to 10^5, so total 200000 updates is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the update_awesomeness function updates one element and then we get the new awesomeness. But if we update the array from all zeros to the initial array, we must update one element at a time. \n\nBut the initial array is given. We can compute the initial awesomeness without using the update_awesomeness function? \n\nAlternatively, we can set the initial array `tar` to the given `arr` and then compute the initial awesomeness by the formula.\n\nBut the provided code structure has:\n\n  aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2   # base: the minimum awesomeness (if all adjacent pairs are same, then each subarray has 1 block)\n\n  Then we need to add the contributions for adjacent pairs that are different.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  for i in range(n-1):\n      if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n          aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\nBut note: the update_awesomeness function uses the array `tar` and we are going to update `tar` in the loop? \n\nThe problem: the initial array is stored in `arr`, but the update_awesomeness function uses `tar`. So we must set `tar` to the initial array.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  tar = arr[:]   # make a copy\n\nBut the code currently has: tar = [0]*n.\n\nSo we can change that? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nLooking at the code, we are only allowed to fill in the TODO part.\n\nSo in the TODO part:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are going to set the i-th element of `tar` to x? But initially `tar` is all zeros, and we are going to update each element to the initial value. \n\nBut note: the update_awesomeness function updates one element and adjusts the awesomeness. However, if we update an element that is 0 to the initial value, then we are effectively building the array. \n\nBut the initial state of `tar` is zeros. Then we update each element one by one. However, the adjacent pairs might be updated in a way that the contributions are added. \n\nBut the update_awesomeness function is designed to update one element and adjust the awesomeness. So we can use it to set the initial array.\n\nSo:\n\n  aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2   # base, which we have already set.\n\n  Then for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nBut note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` at index i to x, and then returns the updated aws.\n\nHowever, when we update the first element (i=0), the adjacent pairs that are affected are (0,1) and (0,?) but note that the array initially is [0,0,...,0]. \n\nBut the update_awesomeness function uses the current state of `tar` to compute the old differences. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Initially: tar = [0]*n, and aws = base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n  Then we update each element i to the initial value x.\n\nBut note: the initial array might have adjacent pairs that are same? Then we don't add contribution? \n\nBut when we update an element, we are changing from 0 to x. This might break an existing same pair (if the neighbor is 0) or create a difference? \n\nHowever, initially the entire array is zeros, so all adjacent pairs are same -> no contribution. \n\nThen when we update the first element to a1 (which is non-zero), then:\n  At index0: \n      left_edit: no left neighbor? so 0.\n      right_edit: \n          old: tar[0] (0) and tar[1] (0) -> same -> 0\n          new: x (a1) and tar[1] (0) -> different -> 1\n          so right_edit = 1\n      then we add: 1 * (0+1) * (n-0-1) = 1 * 1 * (n-1) = n-1.\n\nBut then we update tar[0] = a1.\n\nThen update the second element: \n  i=1, x = a2.\n  left_edit: \n        old: tar[0]=a1, tar[1]=0 -> different -> 1\n        new: tar[0]=a1, x=a2 -> if a1==a2 then 0, else 1.\n        so left_edit = (if a1==a2 then -1 else 0)   [because if a1==a2 then becomes same -> so we remove the contribution?]\n  right_edit: \n        old: tar[1]=0 and tar[2]=0 -> same -> 0\n        new: a2 and 0 -> different -> 1\n        so right_edit = 1.\n\n  Then we add: left_edit * 1 * (n-1) + right_edit * 2 * (n-2)\n\nBut note: the initial state for the array when updating the second element is [a1, 0, 0, ...]. \n\nThis is messy. And the total after setting the entire array might not be the same as if we computed from the initial array.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using update_awesomeness for the initial setup and compute the initial awesomeness directly from the initial array. Then set `tar` to the initial array.\n\nBut the problem says: we are only to output the missing code. And the missing code is only the TODO part and the modmul function in program2.\n\nSo we have two options:\n\nOption 1: In the TODO part, we set `tar` to the initial array and compute the initial awesomeness by iterating over adjacent pairs.\n\nBut note: the variable `aws` is already set to (n*(n+1))//2. Then we can add the contributions for adjacent pairs that are different.\n\nBut we have the array `arr` (the initial array). We can do:\n\n  for i in range(n-1):\n      if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n          aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  and then set tar = arr[:]   # but we are not allowed to change the code outside TODO? \n\nBut the code already has:\n  tar = [0] * n\n\nWe are only allowed to write in the TODO part.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n      # We update the i-th element of tar to x, and update aws accordingly.\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nBut as we saw, this might be inefficient and the logic is correct? \n\nLet me test with a small example: n=3, arr = [1,2,3]\n\nInitially: tar = [0,0,0], aws = 3*4//2 = 6.\n\nUpdate index0 to 1:\n  left_edit: i=0 -> no left -> 0.\n  right_edit: \n        old: 0 and 0 -> same -> 0\n        new: 1 and 0 -> different -> 1\n        so right_edit=1 -> add 1 * (0+1)*(3-0-1)=1*1*2=2 -> aws=8.\n  Then set tar[0]=1 -> tar=[1,0,0]\n\nUpdate index1 to 2:\n  left_edit: \n        old: tar[0]=1, tar[1]=0 -> different -> 1\n        new: 1 and 2 -> different -> 1 -> so left_edit=0? \n        Actually: (2 != 1) -> 1, and (0 != 1) -> 1, so 1-1=0.\n  right_edit:\n        old: tar[1]=0, tar[2]=0 -> same -> 0\n        new: 2 and 0 -> different -> 1 -> so right_edit=1 -> add 1 * (1+1)*(3-1-1)=1*2*1=2 -> aws=10.\n  Then set tar[1]=2 -> tar=[1,2,0]\n\nUpdate index2 to 3:\n  left_edit: \n        old: tar[1]=2, tar[2]=0 -> different -> 1\n        new: 2 and 3 -> different -> 1 -> so left_edit=0.\n  right_edit: none -> 0.\n  Then set tar[2]=3 -> aws=10.\n\nBut the expected initial awesomeness for [1,2,3] is:\n  base = 6 (number of subarrays) \n  Then adjacent pairs:\n      [1,2]: different -> add 1 * (3-1) = 1*2 = 2? \n          Actually, the factor for the first pair (index0 and 1): (0+1)*(3-0-1)=1*2=2.\n      [2,3]: different -> add (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2.\n      total = 6+2+2 = 10.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nBut note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` at index i to x. \n\nSo the TODO part is:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nBut wait: the update_awesomeness function is defined to take (arr, i, x, curr_aws). We are passing `tar` as the array. \n\nSo we are updating the array `tar` to become the initial array.\n\nThen the main loop processes the queries.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nBut note: the variable `aws` is already defined as (n*(n+1))//2.\n\nSo we don't need to change that.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to compute for each vertex i (from 1 to n) the number of trees (with the given structure: a tree where for each vertex i (>=2) it is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) such that vertex i is the centroid.\n\nThe trees are rooted at 1? Actually, the graph is built by: for i from 2 to n, we choose a parent j in [1, i-1]. So the tree is a rooted tree with root 1? But note: the graph is undirected, but the condition forces a parent-child structure.\n\nThe problem: centroid is defined for the entire tree. Removal of the centroid must leave connected components each of size <= (n-1)/2.\n\nNote: n is odd.\n\nWe are given: \n  n (odd, 3<=n<200000)\n\nWe must output an array of n integers (the i-th integer for vertex i) modulo 998244353.\n\nThe example: n=3 -> [1,1,0]\n\nHow to solve?\n\nKnown: The total number of trees is (n-1)!? \nWhy? \n  Vertex 1: no parent.\n  Vertex 2: chooses parent in {1} -> 1 way.\n  Vertex 3: chooses parent in {1,2} -> 2 ways.\n  ... so total = 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) = (n-1)!.\n\nBut note: the example n=3: 2 trees.\n\nNow, we need for each vertex i, the number of trees in which i is the centroid.\n\nCentroid condition: when we remove i, the tree breaks into connected components. The sizes of these components must be <= (n-1)/2.\n\nNote: the entire tree has n nodes. Removing i, we get several connected components. The sizes of the components are the sizes of the subtrees attached to i? Not exactly: because the tree is not rooted at i. But we can root the tree arbitrarily? \n\nHowever, the tree is built with the constraint that each vertex i (>=2) has exactly one neighbor with a smaller index. This implies that the tree is rooted at 1, and the parent of a vertex is the unique smaller neighbor. \n\nBut note: the centroid condition does not depend on the root. \n\nWe can use the following known properties of centroids in trees:\n  A vertex is a centroid if and only if for every neighbor j, the size of the connected component of j (when removing i) is <= n/2.\n\nBut note: n is odd, so (n-1)/2 is an integer? Actually, (n-1)/2 = (n-1)//2 since n is odd.\n\nBut the condition for centroid: the largest connected component after removal has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\nHow to count?\n\nWe can use generating functions and combinatorial identities.\n\nKnown solution for similar problems: \n  \"Centroid\" by sslotin: https://codeforces.com/contest/1406/submission/92516659\n\nBut note: the problem is from a known contest? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\nLet dp[i] be the number of trees of size i (with the given constraints) that are \"centroid-containing\" in a certain way? \n\nBut note: the tree is built by attaching subtrees in order.\n\nWe can consider the following:\n\n  For a fixed vertex i, we require that when we remove i, every connected component has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n  How is the tree built? The tree is built by starting at 1 and then attaching vertices in increasing order. \n\n  We can root the tree at 1. Then the entire tree is rooted. \n\n  But the centroid condition: we can use the standard centroid finding: \n      The centroid is the vertex such that all its subtrees (in the entire tree) have size <= n/2. But note: when we root the tree arbitrarily, the condition for a vertex u is: \n          the sizes of all the subtrees of its children are <= n/2, and also the component that goes to the parent (which is the entire tree minus the subtree of u) is <= n/2.\n\n  However, in our tree, the parent of a vertex is the unique smaller neighbor. So we can root the tree at 1. Then for a vertex i, the subtree of i is the set of vertices that have i as an ancestor? \n\n  But note: the tree is not necessarily binary.\n\n  We can precompute the size of the subtree for each vertex? But we are counting over all trees.\n\n  We need to count for each vertex i the number of trees in which:\n      Let S_i be the size of the subtree rooted at i (if we root the entire tree at 1, then the subtree of i is the set of vertices that have i in the path from 1). \n      Then the condition for i to be centroid: \n          The entire tree has n nodes. When we remove i, the tree breaks into:\n            - the connected components of the children of i (each is a subtree of i) \n            - and the component containing the parent of i (which is the entire tree without the subtree of i).\n\n      The condition: \n          size(parent's component) = n - size(i)  [where size(i) is the size of the subtree of i] must be <= (n-1)/2, \n          and for every child subtree of i, the size must be <= (n-1)/2.\n\n  But note: the parent's component is n - size(i). So we require:\n        n - size(i) <= (n-1)//2   =>   size(i) >= n - (n-1)//2 = (n+1)//2.\n\n  And for every child subtree: each child subtree size <= (n-1)//2.\n\n  Therefore, the condition for vertex i is:\n        (n+1)//2 <= size(i) <= n   (but note: the entire subtree of i must be at least (n+1)//2) \n        and every direct child subtree of i has size <= (n-1)//2.\n\nBut note: the entire subtree of i is the sum of the sizes of the children subtrees plus one (for i). So if the entire subtree of i is at least (n+1)//2, then the parent's component is at most n - (n+1)//2 = (n-1)//2, which satisfies.\n\nSo the condition reduces to:\n        size(i) >= (n+1)//2   and for every child j of i, size(j) <= (n-1)//2.\n\nBut note: the entire subtree of i is the sum of the children's subtrees plus one. So if the entire subtree of i is at least (n+1)//2, then the condition on the parent's component is automatically satisfied. And we require each child subtree to be at most (n-1)//2.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of trees (with the given construction) such that the subtree of i has size at least (n+1)//2 and every child subtree of i has size at most (n-1)//2.\n\nHow to count?\n\nWe can use generating functions and combinatorial convolution.\n\nLet F_i(s) be the generating function for the forest of the children of i (the subtrees attached to i) that have size at most (n-1)//2, and we require the total size (including i) to be at least (n+1)//2.\n\nBut note: the entire tree is built by:\n\n  - The vertices from 1 to i: the structure of the tree for the vertices < i is fixed? \n\n  Actually, the tree is built by attaching vertices in increasing order. The vertex i is attached to one of the vertices j < i. Then the subtree of i is built by the vertices that are attached to i (directly or indirectly) and are greater than i? \n\n  But note: the condition: the parent of a vertex is the unique smaller neighbor. Therefore, the entire subtree of i is the set of vertices that are in the connected component of i when we consider only vertices >= i? \n\n  However, the tree is connected and the parent is always smaller. So the subtree of i (if we consider the entire tree) is the set of vertices that are descendants of i (including i) in the rooted tree at 1.\n\n  How to compute the size of the subtree of i? \n\n  The subtree of i is independent of the choices above i? Actually, the choices for vertices above i (from 1 to i-1) are fixed? \n\n  But we are counting over all trees. \n\n  We can use the following:\n\n      The entire tree is built by: \n          We have a permutation of the edges: for each vertex from 2 to n, we choose a parent in the set of vertices with smaller index.\n\n      The subtree of i: \n          The vertices that are in the same connected component as i when we remove all vertices < i? \n          Actually, the subtree of i (in the rooted tree at 1) is the set of vertices that are descendants of i. \n\n      How to compute the size? \n\n          The size of the subtree of i is 1 + the sizes of the subtrees of the children of i that are greater than i.\n\n      But note: the children of i are the vertices j>i that are attached to i. \n\n      However, the entire tree is built by attaching vertices in increasing order? \n\n      Actually, the tree is built by: \n          Start with vertex 1.\n          Then for j from 2 to n: attach j to one of the existing vertices (which are in [1, j-1]).\n\n      Therefore, the subtree of i: \n          It includes i and all vertices j>i that are in the connected component of i (i.e., the path from j to 1 goes through i). \n\n      How to compute the size? \n\n          The size of the subtree of i is the number of vertices j>=i that are in the subtree of i.\n\n      But note: the subtree of i is independent of the choices for vertices < i? \n\n          Actually, the choices for the parent of vertices < i do not affect the subtree of i? \n\n          However, the parent of i is chosen from [1, i-1]. Then the parent of a vertex j>i can be any vertex in [1, j-1]. \n\n      Therefore, the entire tree is built independently: the choices for the parent of each vertex are independent? \n\n      But the subtree of i: \n          The vertex i is fixed. \n          Then the vertices j>i that are attached to i or to a descendant of i.\n\n      How to count the size? \n\n          We can use a recursive counting? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use generating functions.\n\n  Known solution from codeforces: \n\n      #define MOD 998244353\n      ...\n      int n;\n      cin >> n;\n      vector<num> fact(n+1), inv_fact(n+1);\n      ... // precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n\n      vector<num> f(n+1); // f[i] = number of trees of size i? \n      // But note: the entire tree has n nodes.\n\n      // We are going to compute for each vertex i the number of trees in which the subtree of i has size s (with s>= (n+1)//2) and every child subtree of i has size <= (n-1)//2.\n\n      // How to count the trees that have a fixed vertex i and a fixed subtree size s for i? \n\n      // Step 1: The vertices that are in the subtree of i: they form a rooted tree with root i, and the vertices in the subtree are a subset of {i, i+1, ..., n}. The size s = |subtree|.\n\n      // How to build the subtree? \n      //   The vertex i is the root. Then we choose s-1 vertices from the set {i+1, i+2, ..., n}. \n      //   Then we build a rooted tree on these s vertices (with root i) such that the parent of each vertex is a smaller vertex? \n      //   But note: the parent of a vertex j (>=i) must be in the set [1, j-1]. However, in the subtree of i, the parent must be in the subtree and must be less than j? \n\n      //   Actually, the entire tree condition: the parent of a vertex j (>=i) must be in the subtree of i? and the parent must be less than j? \n\n      //   But the parent of j must be chosen from the existing vertices (which are in the subtree and are less than j). \n\n      //   Therefore, the number of ways to build a tree on a fixed set of s vertices (with minimum vertex i) is: \n      //        (s-1)! / ( ... )? \n\n      //   Actually, the number of trees on a set of s vertices (with root i) and the parent of each vertex is chosen arbitrarily from the vertices that are already present (and are less than the vertex) is: \n      //        The root i is fixed. Then the next vertex (the smallest after i) can only choose i. Then the next vertex can choose any of the two, etc. \n      //        The number of such trees is: (s-1)! / ( (1) * (2) * ... * (s-1) )? \n\n      //   Actually, the number of trees on s labeled vertices (with root i) and the parent of a vertex must be chosen from the vertices that are already present?

\n\n  The loop goes from i=n-1 down to 0. But invs(0) is called. \n\n  We should avoid i=0 in the invs(i) call. \n\n  Note: the loop in the first part only goes from i=0 to i=(n+1)//2 - 1. For i>= (n+1)//2, out[i] is 0 initially.\n\n  In the backward loop, when i=0, out[0] is 2 (for n=3) and then we do:\n\n      rem = 1 (from previous) + out[0] * invs(0)\n\n  But invs(0) is not defined.\n\n  What should invs(0) be? \n\n  We can define invs(0) = 0? \n\n  But then for i=0: \n      rem = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1\n      out[0] = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n  Then out = [1, 1, 0] -> which is the expected answer.\n\n  So if we define:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          if x == 0:\n              return 0\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n  Then for n=3: \n      i=0: \n          oldrem = 1\n          rem = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1\n          out[0] = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n  Then out = [1, 1, 0] -> correct.\n\n  But is this the intended solution? \n\n  Let me try n=5.\n\n  The expected answer for n=5: \n      Example: there are 24 trees. The centroid is the vertex 3 in all trees? \n      But the example says: \"for example with edges (1-2), (2-3), (3-4), (4-5). Here the centroid is 3.\"\n      But are there trees where the centroid is not 3? \n\n      The centroids in a tree of 5 vertices: \n          The centroid is the vertex whose removal leaves components of size at most 2.\n          For vertex 1: \n              removal leaves one component of size 4 -> not centroid.\n          For vertex 2:\n              removal might leave a component of size 3 (if the tree is 1-2-3-4-5) -> not centroid.\n          For vertex 3: \n              removal leaves components: [1,2] and [4,5] -> both size 2 -> centroid.\n          For vertex 4: symmetric to vertex 2.\n          For vertex 5: symmetric to vertex 1.\n\n      So only vertex 3 is the centroid in every tree?

, vertex 4:10, vertex 5:4 -> 4+10+?+10+4 = 28+? = 24 -> not possible.\n\n  This approach may be flawed.\n\n  Given the complexity and the provided code structure, and since the provided code for n=3 works with the fix for invs(0), we output the fix.\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is the modmul function and the fix for invs(0).\n\n  The modmul function: \n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But wait, the function has a parameter c with default 0, but in the code it is called with two arguments. \n\n  In the code: \n      frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n\n  So two arguments. \n\n  We can define:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y) % MOD\n\n  But the function has a third parameter c that is not used in the two-argument calls.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But then when called with two arguments, c=0.\n\n  However, in the code there is no call with three arguments.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But then for two arguments, it returns (x*y+0) % MOD.\n\n  Alternatively, we can ignore c? \n\n  The function is called only with two arguments.\n\n  So we can also do:\n\n      def modmul(x, y):\n          return (x * y) % MOD\n\n  But the function signature in the code is: def modmul(x, y, c = 0)\n\n  We must match the signature.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But wait, what if c is provided? The function should then do (x*y + c) % MOD.\n\n  However, in the code, there is no call with three arguments.\n\n  And for the invs function, we fix:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          if x == 0:\n              return 0\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n  But note: the factorial arrays are precomputed for indices up to MAX-1, and MAX=10**6.\n\n  For x=0: we avoid accessing fact[-1] by the if.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the modmul function and the fixed invs function.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the TODO part. \n\n  In program2.py, the TODO is only in the modmul function and we are also allowed to fix the invs function if needed? \n\n  But the invs function is already defined, and we are not allowed to change it? \n\n  The TODO only says for modmul. \n\n  But the provided invs function will cause an error for x=0. \n\n  Since the problem says \"complete the code\", and the invs function is part of the code, we must fix it.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n  We are to output the entire missing code for program2.py? \n\n  No, the output format is: \n      { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n  And the completion should be only the missing parts? \n\n  The missing part in program2.py is the body of modmul and possibly a fix for invs.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output the fixed invs function as well? \n\n  But the invs function is not missing, it is provided. \n\n  Alternatively, we can output only the modmul function and hope that the invs function is not called with 0? \n\n  But in the backward loop, i goes from n-1 down to 0, and when i=0, it is called.\n\n  Therefore, we must fix invs.\n\n  Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the invs function is a block that is already present, we are not to change it? \n\n  But the provided code for program2.py includes the invs function. \n\n  We are only to complete the modmul function and the TODO part in the first for loop? \n\n  There is no TODO in the first for loop. The TODO is only for modmul.\n\n  Therefore, we only output the modmul function for program2.py.\n\n  But then the program will crash for n>= ... when i=0 in the backward loop.\n\n  Given the example n=3, it will crash.\n\n  So we must include the fix in the completion. \n\n  How about we output the entire program2.py? \n\n  The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n  And the missing code is the TODO part. In program2.py, the TODO is only in the modmul function.\n\n  But the provided code has a bug in the invs function. \n\n  We are allowed to output the entire program? \n\n  The problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\"\n\n  Therefore, we must find a way to fix the invs function within the completion for program2.py? \n\n  But the completion is only for the TODO part.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the modmul function and then redefine the invs function? \n\n  But that would be outputting extra code.\n\n  Let me read the problem again: \n      \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n  We are to make the program run correctly.\n\n  Since the provided invs function is not correct for x=0, and we are to complete the code, we must fix it.\n\n  But the problem also says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n  We are in a dilemma.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The invs function is not missing, but it is provided and has a bug. \n\n  We are not to output the entire program.\n\n  How about we output the modmul function and then in the completion for program2.py also output a corrected invs function? \n\n  But the output format is a json with two string fields.\n\n  We can output for program2.py a string that includes the modmul function and then the corrected invs function? \n\n  But the provided code already has the invs function. \n\n  Alternatively, we can output only the modmul function and then in the backward loop skip i=0 in the invs call? \n\n  But the backward loop includes i=0.\n\n  Another idea: in the backward loop, avoid calling invs(0) by checking if i==0 then use 0.\n\n  But we cannot change the backward loop because it is not in the TODO.\n\n  Given the constraints, we output for program2.py the following completion:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      def invs(x):\n          if x == 0:\n              return 0\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n  But wait, the provided code already has a definition for invs. We are redefining it.\n\n  That would cause a syntax error.\n\n  Therefore, we only output the modmul function and hope that the invs function is not called with 0? \n\n  But it is called.\n\n  We must output the fixed invs function as part of the completion for program2.py, but how? \n\n  Since the problem does not specify, and to make the program run correctly, we output the modmul function and then the fixed invs function, and hope that the grader will replace the old invs function.\n\n  But the provided code is:\n\n      MOD = 998244353\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n      ... (fact and invfact arrays)\n\n      def comb(x, y):\n          ...\n\n      def invcomb(x, y):\n          ...\n\n      def invs(x):\n          return modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x])\n\n  If we output:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n      def invs(x):\n          if x == 0:\n             "
