Bob has eaten from r+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1 - (r) candies? So total = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r. However, in the first test case: [1,1] -> \n          Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we do: a< b? no, so we go to else: b += arr[1]=1, r=0 -> then a==b? 0==1? no -> then next: l=0, r=0 -> then a<=b? 0<=1 -> a+=arr[0]=1, l=1 -> then a==b? 1==1 -> then ans = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+ (1)=2 -> correct. Second test case: [2,1,4,1,5,3] -> \n          We want to get 6? meaning they eat all? Then we must have a==b at the end? Total sum = 2+1+4+1+5+3=16 -> so each must be 8? How? Alice: [2,1,4,1] = 8? Bob: [5,3] = 8? Then total candies: 4+2=6. How does the known solution work?\n          l=0, r=5\n          a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=2, l=1 -> a=2, b=0 -> a> b -> then b=3, r=4 -> a=2, b=3 -> a<=b -> a=2+1=3, l=2 -> a=3, b=3 -> set ans = 2 (l) + (6-1 -4) = 2 + (1) = 3? -> but we want 6 at the end. Then we continue: Now a==3, b==3 -> then we do: a<=b -> a=3+4=7, l=3 -> a=7, b=3 -> then b< a -> b=3+5=8, r=3 -> a=7, b=8 -> a<=b -> a=7+1=8, l=4 -> then a==8, b==8 -> set ans = 4 + (6-1-3) = 4+ (2)=6 -> that's the answer. So the known solution is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip()) arr = list(map(int, input().split())) l = 0\n            r = n-1\n            a = 0\n            b = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if a <= b:\n                    a += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    b += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n            print(ans)\n\n      Now, comparing with the given program1.py:",

We must output the missing parts in a JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code already sets up:\n  n = number of candies\n  a = list of weights, then converted to prefix sums (a[0] = w0, a[1] = w0+w1, ...)\n  b = same list, then converted to suffix sums (b[i] = sum from i to the end, but note the loop: \n        for i in range(n-1,0,-1): b[i-1] += b[i]\n        This means b becomes the suffix sum from index i to the end? Actually, let's see:\n        Initially, b is a copy of the weights.\n        Then, we do: for i from n-1 down to 1: b[i-1] += b[i]\n        So b[0] becomes the total sum, and b[i] becomes the sum from i to n-1.\n\nBut note: the code then uses:\n  l = 0, r = n-1\n  while r-l>=1:\n      if a[l] == b[r]: \n          sol = l + n - r + 1   # because l is 0-indexed index (so l+1 candies from left) and from the right: n - r candies (because r is the starting index from right, so the right part has n-1 - r + 1 = n - r candies? Actually, if Bob starts at r, then he eats from r to the end: that's n - r candies? But note: the candy at r is included. So the number of candies Bob eats is (n-1 - r + 1) = n - r. Then total candies = (l+1) + (n - r). But in the code: sol = l + n - r + 1 -> which is (l+1) + (n - r) because l is the index (so 0-indexed, meaning the left part has l+1 candies) and the right part has n - r candies? Actually, the code uses l as the last index Alice has eaten (so she has eaten from 0 to l, which is l+1 candies). Similarly, Bob has eaten from r to n-1, which is n - r candies. So total = (l+1) + (n - r) = l + n - r + 1.\n\nThen, if a[l] < b[r]: we move l to the right (to include more candies for Alice).\nOtherwise, we should move r to the left (to include more candies for Bob) because the suffix sum at r is too big.\n\nBut the code currently has:\n  else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete the else block. Since if a[l] > b[r], then we need to reduce the suffix sum by moving r to the left.\n\nSo we do: r -= 1\n\nBut note: the condition is while r-l>=1, meaning at least one candy in between.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the code already has an if for a[l]==b[r] and then an if for a[l]<b[r]. The next condition is else (which is a[l] > b[r]). So:\n\n  else:\n      r -= 1\n\nBut note: after updating, we don't break the loop. The loop continues until l and r meet.\n\nBut also note: when we update in the case of equality, we do l+=1. Then we continue. However, we must also consider that after updating l in the equality case, we then check the next conditions? Actually, the code has two ifs and an else. So after the first if (equality) we do the assignment and then we do l+=1. Then we check the next condition: if a[l] < b[r] (with the updated l) and then else.\n\nBut wait: what if after the equality update we break the condition? Actually, the code is structured as:\n\n  while r-l>=1:\n      if a[l]==b[r]:\n          sol = ... \n          l += 1\n      if a[l] < b[r]:   # note: this is a separate if, not elif\n          l += 1\n      else:\n          r -= 1\n\nThis might cause multiple operations in one iteration? Actually, after the first if, we then check the second if. That is not what we want. We want to do only one operation per iteration.\n\nLooking at the problem: we are trying to find the maximum total candies. We are traversing from the two ends. The idea is to have two pointers: l for the left (Alice) and r for the right (Bob). We have prefix sums in a and suffix sums in b.\n\nBut note: the suffix array b: b[r] is the sum from r to the end? Actually, the way we built b: \n  We started with the original array, then we did:\n      for i in range(n-1,0,-1): b[i-1] += b[i]\n  So b[0] is the total sum. And for index r, b[r] is the sum from r to n-1.\n\nBut in the while loop, we are comparing a[l] (prefix sum from 0 to l) and b[r] (suffix sum from r to n-1). We want to make these two equal.\n\nThe algorithm:\n  We start with l=0 and r=n-1.\n  We traverse until l and r cross (or meet). We are going to:\n      - if the current prefix a[l] equals suffix b[r], then we record the total candies (l+1 + n - r) and then we move l to the right (to see if we can get a longer sequence with the same sum? But note: we are moving both? Actually, we only move l. Then in the next iteration, we might then move r? But note: after we record, we move l. Then we check again? \n\nHowever, the problem is that after we record a solution, we move l. Then we might break the condition? Also, we are not moving r. So we might get a new solution with the same r? \n\nBut note: the problem asks for the maximum total candies. We are traversing and updating sol to the maximum total candies we have seen.\n\nBut the current code might not be optimal. However, the note in the problem says that the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do a two-pointer.\n\nBut the issue: the code has two ifs. So after the first if (equality) we update sol and then we do l+=1. Then we check the next if: if a[l] < b[r] (with the new l) then we do l+=1 again? That would be two moves in one iteration. That might be incorrect.\n\nActually, we should do only one move per iteration. We should change the structure to:\n\n  while r-l>=1:\n      if a[l] == b[r]:\n          sol = l + n - r + 1   # because we have l+1 from left and n-r from right\n          l += 1\n          r -= 1   # ??? But note: the example: [1,1] -> if we only move l, then we have l=1, r=1 -> then the next iteration we break. But we have recorded sol=2. Then we break. But what if we have [1,2,3,1]? \n          # Actually, after we find an equality, we can move both pointers because the current candies are used and we want to see if we can extend the sequence? But note: the problem does not require contiguous in the middle? Actually, the candies are contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right, but the two segments are disjoint.\n\n      elif a[l] < b[r]:\n          l += 1\n      else:\n          r -= 1\n\nBut the example in the problem: \n  Fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> Alice: [7,3,20] (30), Bob: [10,8,11,1] (30). Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\nHow would the two-pointer work?\n  We have:\n      a (prefix): [7,10,30,35,45,53,64,65]\n      b (suffix): [65,58,55,35,30,25,17,1]   -> but wait, how did we build b? \n          Original: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n          Step1: i=7: b[6] += b[7] -> b[6]=11+1=12 -> then [7,3,20,5,10,8,12,1]\n          Step2: i=6: b[5] += b[6] -> 8+12=20 -> [7,3,20,5,10,20,12,1]\n          Step3: i=5: b[4] += b[5] -> 10+20=30 -> [7,3,20,5,30,20,12,1]\n          Step4: i=4: b[3] += b[4] -> 5+30=35 -> [7,3,20,35,30,20,12,1]\n          Step5: i=3: b[2] += b[3] -> 20+35=55 -> [7,3,55,35,30,20,12,1]\n          Step6: i=2: b[1] += b[2] -> 3+55=58 -> [7,58,55,35,30,20,12,1]\n          Step7: i=1: b[0] += b[1] -> 7+58=65 -> [65,58,55,35,30,20,12,1]\n\n      Now, we start: l=0, r=7 (n=8, so r from 0 to 7? but note: our array b has 8 elements, and we are using index r=7? \n          a[0]=7, b[7]=1 -> 7>1 -> so we do r-=1 -> r=6: b[6]=12 -> 7<12 -> l+=1 -> l=1: a[1]=10, then 10<12 -> l+=1 -> l=2: a[2]=30, and b[6]=12 -> 30>12 -> r-=1 -> r=5: b[5]=20 -> 30>20 -> r-=1 -> r=4: b[4]=30 -> now 30==30 -> sol = 2 (l=2) + 8 - 4 (r=4) + 1? -> 2+8-4+1=7 -> that matches.\n\n      Then we do: l becomes 3, r becomes 3? Actually, after we set sol=7, we do l+=1? (so l=3) and then we break the condition? because r-l = 3-3=0 -> which is not >=1 -> so we break.\n\n      But note: the code only does l+=1 in the equality case. Then we break? Actually, the condition is while r-l>=1, and after l becomes 3 and r is 4? Actually, no: we did r-=1 only in the else? In the equality case we only did l+=1? Then r is still 4? Then we have l=3, r=4 -> then we check: a[3]=35, b[4]=30 -> 35>30 -> so we do r-=1 -> r=3 -> then l=3, r=3 -> break.\n\n      So the code does not do r-=1 in the equality case? That might be a problem because we have already used the candy at r? Actually, when we have an equality, we have a solution that uses the left part [0..l] and the right part [r..n-1]. Then we want to move both pointers to consider the next candy? But note: if we move only l, then the left part becomes [0..l+1] and the right part remains [r..n-1]. But that might break the equality? And similarly, if we move only r, then the right part becomes [r-1..n-1] and the left part remains [0..l]. \n\n      However, the problem does not require that we use contiguous segments that are adjacent? They can be disjoint. So we can move both? Actually, we can. Because the candy at l+1 is not used in the left part until we move l, and the candy at r-1 is not used until we move r. But if we found an equality at (l, r), then we can try to extend by moving both? Actually, we are not extending the same segment. We are starting a new segment? \n\n      But note: the problem: we are allowed to take contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right. The two segments are disjoint. So after we have taken [0..l] and [r..n-1], the next candidate would be to take [0..l+1] and [r-1..n-1]? But that would include the candy at l+1 and the candy at r-1? And we have to see if we can get the same sum again? \n\n      However, the problem asks for the maximum total candies. We are already recording the total candies at the moment of equality. Then we can move both pointers to see if we can get a larger total? Actually, if we move both, then we are adding one candy to the left and one candy to the right? Then the total candies would be (l+1+1) + (n - (r-1)) = (l+2) + (n - r + 1) = (l+1) + (n - r) + 2? That is more than the previous? But we are not sure the sums will be equal again.\n\n      Alternatively, we can move one pointer? The known solution for this problem (Fair Candy) is to use two pointers and when the sums are equal, we record and then we move both. Otherwise, we move the pointer with the smaller sum.\n\n      Actually, the example in the problem: the fourth test case: we found one solution at l=2, r=4 -> total 7. Then we move both: l=3, r=3. Then we break. But we don't get another solution. So 7 is the answer.\n\n      But what about the second test case: [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6] -> no, the example is: \n          Second test case: [1,1] -> answer=2? \n          Third test case: [1,2,3] -> answer=0? \n          Fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\n      Actually, the second test case in the note: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n      The array: [1,1] is the first test case? The second test case must be: [2,1,4,1,5,3]? Actually, the note says: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      So the array is: [2,1,4,1,5,3]? \n          prefix: [2,3,7,8,13,16]\n          suffix: [16,14,13,9,8,3]   -> because:\n              [2,1,4,1,5,3] -> \n                  i=5: b[4]=5+3=8 -> [2,1,4,1,8,3]\n                  i=4: b[3]=1+8=9 -> [2,1,4,9,8,3]\n                  i=3: b[2]=4+9=13 -> [2,1,13,9,8,3]\n                  i=2: b[1]=1+13=14 -> [2,14,13,9,8,3]\n                  i=1: b[0]=2+14=16 -> [16,14,13,9,8,3]\n\n          Now, we start: l=0, r=5: a[0]=2, b[5]=3 -> 2<3 -> l=1: a[1]=3, b[5]=3 -> 3==3 -> sol = 1 (left: 1 candy) + 6-5 (right: 1 candy) + 1? -> 1+1=2? but the code: sol = l + n - r + 1 = 1 + 6 - 5 + 1 = 3? that doesn't match.\n\n      Actually, the note says the answer is 6. How do we get 6? \n          Alice eats the first three: [2,1,4] -> 7\n          Bob eats the first three from the right: [1,5,3] -> 1+5+3=9? not 7.\n\n      Correction: the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the last three: [4,1,5,3]? but that's four. Actually, the note says: \"the first three from the right\" meaning the three that are at the rightmost: [5,9,2,6] -> wait, the example in the note is different? \n\n      The note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" and then \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\".\n\n      So the array must be: [2,1,4,1,5,3]? and the first three from the left: [2,1,4] = 7, and the first three from the right: [1,5,3]? but that's 9. \n\n      Actually, the problem says: Bob eats from the right. So the rightmost three: [3,5,1]? but that's 3+5+1=9? \n\n      Let me check the example: \n          \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n      The sample input: \n          t=?\n          n=6\n          weights: 2,1,4,1,5,3\n\n      How can we get 6? \n          Alice: [2,1,4] -> 7\n          Bob: [1,5,3] -> 9 -> not equal.\n\n      Alternatively, Bob: [3,5,1] -> same as above.\n\n      Or Bob: [3,5] -> 8, then [3,5,1] -> 9? \n\n      The note says: Bob eats the first three from the right. So the three candies at the right: positions 5,4,3: weights 3,5,1 -> 9.\n\n      But the note says they both have 7. \n\n      Actually, the example in the problem statement: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      So the array must be: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]? but that's 7 candies? \n\n      The note says: \"the answer is 6\", meaning 6 candies in total. So they each eat 3? \n\n      Actually, the example: \n          \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n      And the array: \n          The first test case: [1,1] -> n=2 -> answer=2.\n          The second test case: n=6 -> [2,1,4,1,5,3] -> but that doesn't yield 7 and 7.\n\n      After checking the problem statement again: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n      And then: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n      So the array must be: [2,1,4,1,5,3] is not the one. \n\n      Actually, the sample test cases are:\n\n        Test case 1: n=2, [1,1] -> output=2.\n        Test case 2: n=6, [2,1,4,1,5,3] -> output=6? but how?\n\n      The known solution: \n          We can use two pointers: \n            l=0, r=n-1\n            left_sum=0, right_sum=0\n            ans=0\n            while l<=r:\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    ans = l + (n-1 - r)   # because l candies from left and (n-1 - r) from right? but total candies = l + (n-1 - r) + 1? \n                    # Actually, the total candies = (l) [0..l-1] and (n-1 - r + 1) = n - r? \n                    # So total = l + (n - r) - 1? \n                    # But note: we are at a state where we haven't added the current candy? \n                if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                    left_sum += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n            if left_sum == right_sum:\n                ans = l + (n-1 - r)   # then update\n\n      But the known solution for the problem \"Fair Candy\" (which is the same as Codeforces Round #693 (Div. 3) problem C) is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            l = 0\n            r = n-1\n            a = b = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if a < b:\n                    a += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    b += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = l + (n-1 - r)\n            print(ans)\n\n      But note: the total candies: \n          Alice has eaten l candies (from 0 to l-1) -> so l candies.\n          Bob has eaten from r+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1 - (r) candies? \n          So total = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r.\n\n      However, in the first test case: [1,1] -> \n          Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we do: a< b? no, so we go to else: b += arr[1]=1, r=0 -> then a==b? 0==1? no -> then next: l=0, r=0 -> then a<=b? 0<=1 -> a+=arr[0]=1, l=1 -> then a==b? 1==1 -> then ans = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+ (1)=2 -> correct.\n\n      Second test case: [2,1,4,1,5,3] -> \n          We want to get 6? meaning they eat all? \n          Then we must have a==b at the end? \n          Total sum = 2+1+4+1+5+3=16 -> so each must be 8? \n          How? \n          Alice: [2,1,4,1] = 8? \n          Bob: [5,3] = 8? \n          Then total candies: 4+2=6.\n\n      How does the known solution work?\n          l=0, r=5\n          a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=2, l=1 -> a=2, b=0 -> a> b -> then b=3, r=4 -> a=2, b=3 -> a<=b -> a=2+1=3, l=2 -> a=3, b=3 -> set ans = 2 (l) + (6-1 -4) = 2 + (1) = 3? -> but we want 6 at the end.\n\n      Then we continue:\n          Now a==3, b==3 -> then we do: a<=b -> a=3+4=7, l=3 -> a=7, b=3 -> then b< a -> b=3+5=8, r=3 -> a=7, b=8 -> a<=b -> a=7+1=8, l=4 -> then a==8, b==8 -> set ans = 4 + (6-1-3) = 4+ (2)=6 -> that's the answer.\n\n      So the known solution is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            l = 0\n            r = n-1\n            a = 0\n            b = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if a <= b:\n                    a += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    b += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n            print(ans)\n\n      Now, comparing with the given program1.py:\n\n        The given program1.py uses prefix and suffix arrays and then two pointers without adding one by one. Instead, it uses the precomputed prefix and suffix. \n\n        How does it work?\n          We have a = prefix: a[i] = arr[0]+...+arr[i]\n          We have b = suffix: b[i] = arr[i]+...+arr[n-1]\n\n          Then we set l=0, r=n-1.\n          Then while r-l>=1:\n                if a[l] == b[r]: \n                    sol = l + n - r + 1   # total candies = (l+1) + (n - r) = l+1+n-r\n                    l += 1\n                if a[l] < b[r]:\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    r -= 1\n\n        But in the known solution, we update the pointers and then check for equality. And we update the answer only when we have equality.\n\n        The known solution does not precompute the entire prefix and suffix? \n\n        However, the given program1.py precomputes the prefix and suffix. \n\n        The issue: in the known solution, we update the pointers and then check. In program1.py, we are using the precomputed arrays and then moving the pointers. \n\n        But note: the precomputed prefix a[l] is the sum from 0 to l. The suffix b[r] is the sum from r to n-1. \n\n        The condition: we want to see if the left part [0..l] and the right part [r..n-1] have the same sum? \n\n        But note: the two parts are disjoint? Only if l < r. \n\n        The known solution does not require disjoint? Actually, the two pointers l and r: the left part is [0, l-1] and the right part is [r+1, n-1]. And the middle is [l, r] is not eaten. \n\n        But in program1.py, the left part is [0..l] (inclusive) and the right part is [r..n-1] (inclusive). So they are disjoint only if l < r. \n\n        The known solution: the left part is [0, l-1] and the right part is [r+1, n-1]. \n\n        So they are different. \n\n        How to fix program1.py? \n\n        We want: \n          Alice: [0, l-1] -> sum = a[l-1]? \n          Bob: [r+1, n-1] -> sum = b[r+1]? \n\n        But the given program1.py uses:\n          a[i] = prefix sum from 0 to i (inclusive)\n          b[i] = suffix sum from i to n-1 (inclusive)\n\n        Then the left part [0, l] -> a[l] (if we take l as the last index taken by Alice) -> but then the right part [r, n-1] -> b[r]. \n\n        But the two parts must be disjoint. So we require l < r. \n\n        The condition: while r-l>=1 -> meaning at least one candy in between? \n\n        Then when we have a[l] == b[r], then the total candies = (l+1) + (n - r) = l+1+n-r.\n\n        Then we move l to l+1? But then the next a[l] is the prefix including the next candy? \n\n        But the known solution moves the pointer and then checks. \n\n        The known solution does not precompute the entire arrays? \n\n        Given the constraints (n up to 200000, but total n over test cases <=200000) -> we can do the two-pointer without precomputation? \n\n        However, the program1.py is already written with precomputation. \n\n        The problem in the current program1.py: \n          In the known solution, we update the sums as we move the pointers. But in program1.py, we have the entire prefix and suffix arrays. \n\n        How to simulate? \n          We start with l=0, r=n-1.\n          Then we compare a[l] (which is the sum of the first l+1 candies) and b[r] (which is the sum of the last n-r candies). \n          If they are equal, we record the total candies = (l+1) + (n - r) and then we move l to l+1? \n          But then the next a[l] is the prefix including the next candy? \n\n          However, we are not removing the candy at r? \n\n        Actually, the known solution moves one pointer per step. \n\n        The known solution does:\n\n          if a <= b: \n              a += arr[l]; l+=1\n          else:\n              b += arr[r]; r-=1\n\n        Then if a==b: record.\n\n        In program1.py, we are not accumulating the sums. We are using the precomputed arrays. \n\n        The precomputed arrays are fixed. \n\n        The condition: \n          We want to find indices l and r (with l < r) such that the prefix a[l] equals the suffix b[r]. And we want to maximize (l+1)+(n-r).\n\n        We can do: \n          l from 0 to n-1, r from n-1 down to 0, and we want to find a pair (l, r) with l < r and a[l]==b[r] and maximize (l+1)+(n-r).\n\n        We can use two pointers: \n          Start l=0, r=n-1.\n          We move l and r: \n            if a[l] < b[r]: then we move l to the right (to get a larger prefix)\n            if a[l] > b[r]: then we move r to the left (to get a smaller suffix)\n            if equal: we record and then we move l to the right? or both? \n\n        But note: we want to find all pairs? and take the maximum. \n\n        The current program1.py does:\n\n          sol=0\n          while r-l>=1:\n              if a[l]==b[r]:\n                  sol = l + n - r + 1   # record the current total candies\n                  l += 1\n              if a[l] < b[r]:\n                  l += 1\n              else:\n                  r -= 1\n\n        But after we record, we then do l+=1 and then we check the next condition? \n\n        For the first test case [1,1]:\n          n=2\n          a = [1, 2]   (prefix: [1, 1+1=2])\n          b = [2,1]    (suffix: [1+1=2, 1])\n\n          l=0, r=1: \n              a[0]=1, b[1]=1 -> equal -> sol = 0+2-1+1 = 2 -> then l becomes 1.\n              Then the condition r-l = 1-1=0 -> break.\n\n          So it returns 2 -> correct.\n\n        Second test case: [2,1,4,1,5,3] (n=6)\n          We want to find a pair (l, r) such that a[l] = b[r] and maximize (l+1)+(n-r).\n\n          The known solution found two equalities: \n            First: at l=1 (so a[1]=2+1=3) and r=4 (b[4]=5+3=8) -> not equal.\n            Then: at l=3 (a[3]=2+1+4+1=8) and r=3 (b[3]=1+5+3=9) -> not equal.\n            Then: at l=3, r=2: but we break the condition? \n\n          How about we compute the prefix and suffix:\n\n          prefix a: \n            a0=2\n            a1=3\n            a2=7\n            a3=8\n            a4=13\n            a5=16\n\n          suffix b (computed as described in program1.py):\n            Start: [2,1,4,1,5,3]\n            Step1: i=5: b[4]=5+3=8 -> [2,1,4,1,8,3]\n            Step2: i=4: b[3]=1+8=9 -> [2,1,4,9,8,3]\n            Step3: i=3: b[2]=4+9=13 -> [2,1,13,9,8,3]\n            Step4: i=2: b[1]=1+13=14 -> [2,14,13,9,8,3]\n            Step5: i=1: b[0]=2+14=16 -> [16,14,13,9,8,3]\n\n          Now, we want to find l and r such that a[l] = b[r] and l < r.\n\n          We see:\n            a[0]=2, is there a b[r]=2? -> no.\n            a[1]=3, b[5]=3 -> but l=1, r=5 -> l<r -> total = 1+1 + (6-5) = 1+1+1=3? -> but the total candies = (l+1) + (n-r) = 2 + (6-5) = 2+1=3.\n            a[2]=7 -> no b[r]=7.\n            a[3]=8 -> b[4]=8 -> l=3, r=4 -> total = 3+1 + (6-4) = 4+2=6 -> that's the answer.\n\n          How does the while loop work?\n            l=0, r=5: \n                a[0]=2, b[5]=3 -> 2<3 -> then we do the next if: a[0]<b[5] -> true -> l+=1 -> l=1.\n            l=1, r=5:\n                a[1]=3, b[5]=3 -> equal -> sol = 1+6-5+1 = 3 -> then l becomes 2.\n                Then we check: a[2]=7, b[5]=3 -> 7>3 -> else: r-=1 -> r=4.\n            l=2, r=4:\n                a[2]=7, b[4]=8 -> 7<8 -> l+=1 -> l=3.\n            l=3, r=4:\n                a[3]=8, b[4]=8 -> equal -> sol = 3+6-4+1 = 3+2+1=6 -> then l becomes 4.\n            Then condition: r-l = 4-4=0 -> break.\n\n          So it returns 6 -> correct.\n\n          But note: the code records the last equality (which is 6) and that is the maximum.\n\n        However, the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] (n=8)\n          We want to find: \n            a: [7,10,30,35,45,53,64,65]\n            b: [65,58,55,35,30,25,17,1]   -> as computed earlier.\n\n          We want to find a[l] = b[r] with l<r? \n            We found at l=2, r=4: a[2]=30, b[4]=30 -> total = 2+1 + (8-4) = 3+4=7.\n\n          How does the loop go?\n            l=0, r=7: a[0]=7, b[7]=1 -> 7>1 -> else: r-=1 -> r=6.\n            l=0, r=6: a[0]=7, b[6]=17 -> 7<17 -> l+=1 -> l=1.\n            l=1, r=6: a[1]=10, b[6]=17 -> 10<17 -> l+=1 -> l=2.\n            l=2, r=6: a[2]=30, b[6]=17 -> 30>17 -> else: r-=1 -> r=5.\n            l=2, r=5: a[2]=30, b[5]=25 -> 30>25 -> else: r-=1 -> r=4.\n            l=2, r=4: a[2]=30, b[4]=30 -> equal: sol = 2+8-4+1 = 2+4+1=7 -> then l becomes 3.\n            Then condition: r=4, l=3 -> 4-3=1>=1 -> continue.\n            l=3, r=4: a[3]=35, b[4]=30 -> 35>30 -> else: r-=1 -> r=3.\n            Then condition: r=3, l=3 -> break.\n\n          So it returns 7 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing part in program1.py is in the else block: we need to do r -= 1.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is: \n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the code has:\n\n            else: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We should write: \n            r -= 1\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the code has two ifs. The first if is for equality, then the second if for a[l] < b[r] and then else. \n\n        But the else is only executed if the first if was not? Actually, no: the first if and the second if are independent. \n\n        But note: after the first if (equality) we do l+=1. Then we check the second if: which uses the updated l. \n\n        This might be intended? \n\n        But in the example above, it worked. \n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"r -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the code has an indentation. The else block is at the same level as the ifs. \n\n        We write: \n            else:\n                r -= 1\n\n        But the TODO is inside the else. So we only need to write the statement: \"r -= 1\"\n\n        However, the code already has the else: and then a comment. We replace the comment with \"r -= 1\".\n\n        So for program1.py: \"r -= 1\"\n\n        But wait: the code has:\n\n            while r-l>=1:\n                if a[l]==b[r]:sol=l+n-r+1;l+=1\n                if a[l]<b[r]:l+=1\n                else: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must complete the else block. We can write: r -= 1\n\n        But note: the else is attached to the second if. So if the second if condition fails, we do the else.\n\n        This is correct: if a[l] is not less than b[r], then we do r-=1.\n\n        But note: if we had an equality and then we updated l, then we check the second if: if the new a[l] (with the updated l) is less than b[r]? if not, we do the else.\n\n        This is what we did in the examples.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        The code:\n\n            for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n                a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n                while l<=r:\n                    if a<=b:\n                        a+=n[l]\n                        l+=1\n                    elif b<a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if a==b:\n                        f=len(n)-r+l-1\n                print(f)\n\n        We see that the known solution is:\n\n            while l<=r:\n                if a <= b:\n                    a += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    b += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = l + (n-1 - r)\n\n        In the given program2.py, we have:\n\n            a,b,l,f = [0]*4   -> so a=0, b=0, l=0, f=0\n            r = len(n)-1\n\n            while l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a += n[l]\n                    l += 1\n                elif b<a:   # note: this is the same as else for the condition a<=b? because the condition is if a<=b, then elif b<a -> which is the same as else.\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if a==b:\n                    f = len(n) - r + l - 1   # but what is this? \n\n        The expression for f: \n            In the known solution: ans = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r.\n\n            Here: len(n) is the number of candies in the test case, say n_val.\n            Then: f = n_val - r + l - 1 = l + (n_val - r - 1) = l + (n_val - 1 - r) -> which is the same as the known solution.\n\n        So the missing part: in the elif block, we should do:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the variable name: the array is called 'n' in the current scope. And the index for the right pointer is r.\n\n        So we write: \n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        However, the code has: \n            elif b<a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the comment with two lines? But note: the code is in a while loop and we want to do two things. We can write:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        But we must be careful with the indentation. The TODO is at the same indentation as the if block. So we write two lines with the same indentation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write in one line? \n\n        But the known solution does two operations.\n\n        So for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        But note: the variable is 'n' (the list of weights) and the index is 'r'. \n\n        However, the code uses 'n' for the list, but originally the input was read into a variable named 'n'. Then we did: n = [*map(int, n.split())]. So n is now the list.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But note: the known solution does the update and then after that (outside the if/else) it checks for equality. The given program2.py does the same: after the if/elif, it checks if a==b.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is two lines: \n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        And the output format: JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        So:\n\n          program1: \"r -= 1\"\n          program2: \"b += n[r]\\nr -= 1\"\n\n        But note: in program2, we have two statements. We must output them as two lines? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\n        For program1, the TODO is in an else block and we only need one statement.\n\n        For program2, the TODO is in an elif block and we need two statements.\n\n        We output:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"r -= 1\", \"program2\": \"b += n[r]\\nr -= 1\"}\n\n        But note: the program2 code must be exactly as it would appear. The newline is important.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a single line with a semicolon? But the original code uses multiple lines. We should use two lines.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the style. We output two lines.\n\n        But note: the program2 code has an elif block and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines of code.\n\n        So we write: \n            \"program2\": \"    b += n[r]\\n    r -= 1\"\n\n        But wait: the existing code has:\n\n            elif b<a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the comment with two lines that are indented. The current indentation level is 8 spaces? or 4? \n\n        The problem does not specify. But we are to output only the code that goes in the TODO, so we output the two lines at the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n        Since the TODO is at the same level as the previous if block, we output the two lines without extra indentation? \n\n        Actually, the code we are completing is:\n\n            elif b<a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the comment with:\n\n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n        But the existing code has 8 spaces for the body of the while loop? \n\n        We don't know the exact indentation, but we assume that the code we output will be inserted at the TODO, so we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO line. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO. \n\n        The TODO is at a certain indentation level. We output the two lines with the same indentation.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the number of spaces. So we output the two lines with the same relative indentation as the surrounding code. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we output the two lines with no extra leading spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the previous if block. The previous if block has:\n\n            if a<=b:\n                a+=n[l]\n                l+=1\n\n        So the body of the if is two lines. Similarly, the body of the elif should be two lines. \n\n        We output:\n\n            \"b += n[r]\"\n            \"r -= 1\"\n\n        But we must separate them by a newline.\n\n        So we write: \"b += n[r]\\nr -= 1\"\n\n        This will be interpreted as two lines when inserted.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a literal newline.\n\n        We'll use a literal newline.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n          program1: \"r -= 1\"\n          program2: \"b += n[r]\\nr -= 1\"\n\n        But note: in program2, the variable name is 'n' for the list. And we are using the current value of r.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Let me test program2 with the first test case [1,1]:\n          n = [1,1] (list)\n          a=0, b=0, l=0, f=0, r=1.\n          while l<=r (0<=1 -> true):\n              a<=b (0<=0) -> true: \n                  a += n[0] = 1 -> a=1, l=1.\n              then check a==b: 1==0? false.\n          next: l=1, r=1 -> true.\n              a<=b: 1<=0? false -> so we go to elif: b<a (0<1) -> true.\n                  then we do: b += n[r] = n[1] = 1 -> b=1, then r-=1 -> r=0.\n              then check a==b: 1==1 -> true: f = len(n) - r + l - 1 = 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2.\n          then l=1, r=0 -> false -> break.\n          print(f)=2 -> correct.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"r -= 1\", \"program2\": \"b += n[r]\\nr -= 1\"}"
