We can try to set gcd(a,b)=2, and lcm(c,d)=2. For gcd(a,b)=2: we can take a=2, b=2. For lcm(c,d)=2: we can take c=2, d=1 -> then lcm(2,1)=2. Then total = 2+2+2+1 = 7 -> but we are for n=5. For n=5: \n            We have a1=4 (which is divisible by 4) -> then we are in this branch. We need: a+b+c+d=5. We can try: \n            a=2, b=2, c=1, d=0 -> not positive. How about: \n            a=1, b=1, c=2, d=1 -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(2,1)=2 -> not equal. Or: \n            a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works! and sum=1+2+1+1=5. So we can output: 1,2,1,1. But how to generalize? We can do: \n            a = 1, b = a1//2, c = a1//4, d = 1? But then the sum: 1 + (a1//2) + (a1//4) + 1 = 2 + a1*(3/4) = 2 + (a-1)*(3/4) -> which is not a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            a = 1, b = a-3, c=1, d=1 -> then gcd(1, a-3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But then the numbers: 1, a-3, 1, 1 -> sum = 1+(a-3)+1+1 = a, and they are positive if a-3>=1 -> a>=4 -> but a>=4, and a is odd? -> a>=5. So for a1%4==0, we can do: \n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1) But wait: a1 = a-1, and a1%4==0 -> a-1 is divisible by 4 -> so a = 4k+1, for k>=1 (since a>=5). Then a-3 = 4k+1-3 = 4k-2 = 2(2k-1) -> positive for k>=1. Example: \n            a=5: then output: 1, 5-3=2, 1, 1 -> 1,2,1,1 -> works. But is this always valid? \n            gcd(1, a-3) = 1.\n            lcm(1,1)=1. So it works. But the code already has a branch for a1%3==0: For a=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 !=0, so we go to the next condition: a1%4!=0 -> 4%4==0 -> so we don't go there. Then we go to a1%4==0. So we do:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says: output any solution. However, the example in the note: \n            n=10: \n                The example output: 3,5,1,1 -> which uses the condition a1%3==0? \n                a=10, a1=9 -> 9%3==0 -> so they output: 9//3=3,3,3,1 -> 3,3,3,1 -> but the example output is 3,5,1,1? The provided code for a1%3==0: \n            print(a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1) So for n=10: a1=9, then output: 3,3,3,1 -> sum=3+3+3+1=10.\n\n        And gcd(3,3)=3, lcm(3,1)=3 -> works. But the example output in the note is 3,5,1,1 -> which is also valid. So both are valid. Therefore, for the branch a1%4==0, we output: 1, a-3, 1, 1. But wait: what if a-3 equals 1? a=5: a-3=2 -> not 1. a=9: a-3=6 -> not 1.\n            a=13: a-3=10 -> not 1. But what if a=7? \n            a=7: a1=6 -> 6%4!=0 -> so we go to the condition: \n                if a%2==1: \n                    a1=6 -> then we check: \n                        6%3==0 -> so we output: 6//3=2,2,2,1 -> 2+2+2+1=7 -> valid. So we never get to the a1%4==0 branch for a=7. Only when a1%4==0 and a1%3!=0? But the conditions are:\n                if a1%3==0: \n                    ...\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    ... elif a1%4==0:\n                    ... So for a1=4: we do the last branch.",

But the example in the note for a=10: output 3,5,1,1 -> which is also valid. So we are done.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The provided code uses two pointers (e from left, r from right) and two variables (lowest for Alice's current sum, highest for Bob's current sum). The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (index) such that the sums are equal.\n\nThe provided code has a while loop that runs while the total candies eaten (h+g) is <= m (the total number of candies). Inside, it adjusts the sums by moving the pointers. The missing part is in the condition when the two sums are equal.\n\nIn the note, we see that when the sums are equal, we record the current total candies (h+g) and then try to extend the solution by moving the pointers.\n\nWe note that the variable `index` is used to record the maximum number of candies eaten when the sums are equal. So in the condition `highest == lowest`, we should update `index` to be the current total candies (h+g) and then try to extend by moving one pointer? However, note that the problem asks for the maximum total candies.\n\nBut observe: the condition in the while loop is `h+g <= m`. We are moving either the left or the right until we break. However, when the sums are equal, we can record the current total (h+g) and then try to move one step from either side? Actually, we can move both? But note: we cannot move both at the same time because then the sums would become unequal. However, the problem says that they eat from left and right independently, but the candies are contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right and non-overlapping.\n\nThe idea is to use two pointers and two prefix sums. We start with Alice having eaten nothing (but then we start with the first candy) and Bob having eaten nothing (but then we start with the last candy). Then we try to balance the sums.\n\nIn the provided code, when the sums are equal, we should record the current total candies (h+g) as a candidate. Then we can try to move one step from the left (so that Alice eats one more) and then continue? But note: the problem says we want the maximum total candies. We can record the candidate and then try to extend? Actually, we can break the condition by moving one pointer? However, the problem does not require contiguous segments to be maximal? Actually, the segments are contiguous from the left and from the right, and they are disjoint.\n\nBut note: the provided code already has a while loop that moves the pointers until the sums are not equal. When they become equal, we record the candidate and then we must move one of the pointers to try to find a longer sequence? However, the problem says we want the maximum total candies. We can try to move both? But that would break the balance.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that when the sums are equal, we record the total candies eaten so far (h+g) and then we move the left pointer (so Alice eats one more) and then continue? But then the sums become unequal and we will adjust by moving the right pointer until the sums are at least as large as the left? Actually, the provided code does that: after the condition, the loop continues.\n\nBut the provided code does not have a break in the condition. So we must update the candidate and then move one pointer? How?\n\nActually, the note in the problem says: For the fourth test case, Alice eats [7,3,20] (which are the first, second, and fourth candy? Actually, the candies are: [3, 7, 3, 20, 10, 8, 11, 1] -> but note: the example says Alice eats [7,3,20] and Bob eats [10,8,11,1]. How does that match? The array is: \nindex0: 3, index1:7, index2:3, index3:20, index4:10, index5:8, index6:11, index7:1.\n\nAlice eats from left: she can eat any contiguous from the left? Actually, the problem says: she can eat any number of candies from the left (in a row). So she must take a contiguous segment starting at the left. Similarly, Bob takes a contiguous segment from the right.\n\nBut note: the example: Alice: [7,3,20] -> that would be index1, index2, index3? But then Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> index4,5,6,7. Then the candy at index0 (3) is not eaten? That's allowed.\n\nSo the algorithm: we can use two pointers. Let left=0, right=n-1. Let sumA=0, sumB=0. We want to have sumA = sumB and then record the total candies eaten (left_count + right_count). We can start by having Alice eat nothing and Bob eat nothing, but then we must start by having at least one candy on one side? Actually, we can start by having Alice eat the first candy and Bob eat the last candy? The provided code starts with:\n   e=0 -> so Alice has eaten the first candy? (because lowest = lst[0])\n   r=m-1 -> Bob has eaten the last candy? (because highest = lst[m-1])\n   g=1 (count for Alice) and h=1 (count for Bob)\n\nThen the while loop condition: h+g <= m -> meaning we haven't eaten all candies.\n\nIn the condition when the sums are equal, we record the total candies (h+g) as a candidate. Then we can try to move the left pointer to the next candy (so Alice eats one more) and update the left sum? Why? Because we want to see if we can extend the solution? But note: if we move only one pointer, the sums become unequal and then we adjust by moving the other until we get a balance again? And we record the candidate again? So we do:\n\n   index = h+g   # because we want the total candies when they are equal\n   then we move the left pointer: because we have to continue the loop? Actually, we must break the balance to try to find a longer sequence? But note: we cannot move both at the same time because then we break the condition? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   if lowest == highest:\n        index = h+g   # record the candidate\n        # Then we move the left pointer to the next (if we can) to try to get a longer sequence? \n        # But note: we are in the middle of the loop. We must update one of the sums to break the equality and then continue.\n        # We can move the left pointer: so that we add the next candy to Alice.\n        if e+1 < r:   # there is at least one candy in between?\n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]\n            g += 1\n        else:\n            break   # because we have no more candy to add? But the condition h+g<=m should break anyway? \n   ... \n\nBut wait: the example test case 4: [3,7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=8. The answer is 7. How do we get that?\n\nWe start:\n   Alice: [3] -> sum=3, Bob: [1] -> sum=1 -> Bob is less -> so we add the next from Bob: [1+11] -> 12 -> still less? Then [12+8]=20 -> then [20+10]=30. Now Alice:3, Bob:30 -> so Alice is less -> we add next: [3+7]=10 -> then [10+3]=13 -> then [13+20]=33. Now Alice=33, Bob=30 -> Bob is less? Then we add the next from Bob? But we are at the 4th candy (index4:10) and we have already added the next ones? Actually, the pointers: \n   Initially: e=0, r=7 -> Alice has [0] and Bob has [7]? But the code starts with:\n        lowest = lst[0] = 3\n        highest = lst[7] = 1\n   Then since 3>1, we do: \n        highest += lst[6] -> 1+11=12, r becomes 6, h becomes 2.\n   Then 3<12 -> so we add next left: e becomes 1, lowest=3+7=10, g=2.\n   Then 10<12 -> add next left: e=2, lowest=10+3=13, g=3.\n   Then 13<12? no, 13>12 -> so we add next from Bob: highest=12+8=20, r=5, h=3.\n   Then 13<20 -> add next left: e=3, lowest=13+20=33, g=4.\n   Then 33>20 -> add next Bob: highest=20+10=30, r=4, h=4.\n   Then 33>30 -> add next Bob? but r-1=3, and e is at 3 -> so we have e==r? then we break? \n   But we never recorded the candidate? \n\nWe need to record when the sums are equal. When were they equal? \n   After we had Alice: [3,7,3] = 13 and Bob: [1,11,8] = 20 -> not equal.\n   Then we added Bob: [10] -> 30 -> then Alice: [20] -> 33 -> not equal.\n\nBut the example solution: Alice: [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20=30, Bob: [10,8,11,1]=10+8+11+1=30. How do we get that?\n\nWe must start differently? The provided code starts with the first candy and the last candy. But the example solution does not include the first candy (3) and the last candy (1) is included? Actually, Bob eats the last candy (1) and also the next ones? But the first candy (3) is not eaten by either? \n\nSo the algorithm: we are allowed to skip candies at the left? Actually, Alice must eat a contiguous segment from the left, but she can choose how many. Similarly Bob. And they don't have to eat until they meet? They can leave some in the middle.\n\nThe intended solution: use two pointers and two prefix sums. We start with Alice having eaten 0 candies and Bob having eaten 0. Then we can have:\n   i = 0, j = n-1\n   sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while i <= j:\n        if sumA < sumB:\n            sumA += w[i]\n            i += 1\n        elif sumA > sumB:\n            sumB += w[j]\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            # record candidate: the total candies eaten so far is (i) from Alice and (n-1-j) from Bob -> total = i + (n-1-j)\n            ans = i + (n-1-j)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i-1] -> i candies, Bob has eaten [j+1, n-1] -> n-1 - j candies\n            # Then we add one from the left to break the tie? because we want to see if we can get a longer total?\n            # Actually, we can add one from the left to try to extend? \n            sumA += w[i]\n            i += 1\n\n   But note: we might break the condition and then never come back? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   i = -1, j = n\n   sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n   ans = 0\n   while i < j:\n        if sumA == sumB:\n            ans = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because Alice has eaten [0,i] -> i+1 candies, Bob has eaten [j, n-1] -> n - j candies\n            # Then we move one step from the left? because we want to try to extend? \n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                sumA += w[i]\n            else:\n                break\n        elif sumA < sumB:\n            i += 1\n            if i < j:\n                sumA += w[i]\n            else:\n                break\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                sumB += w[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\n   Then we output ans.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total candies eaten is the number of candies by Alice and Bob. And when we have equality, we record the candidate and then we move the left pointer? \n\nBut the provided code in program1.py has a different structure. We must complete the provided code.\n\nIn the provided code:\n\n   We have:\n        e = 0 -> so Alice has eaten the first candy? (index0)\n        r = m-1 -> Bob has eaten the last candy? (index m-1)\n        lowest = lst[0]\n        highest = lst[m-1]\n        g = 1 (Alice count), h = 1 (Bob count)\n\n   Then the while loop: while h+g <= m\n\n   Inside, we have three conditions.\n\n   We are missing the code for the condition when they are equal.\n\n   We must update the candidate index to the current total candies (h+g). Then we must break the tie by moving the left pointer? Why? Because if we don't move, we are stuck. And we want to see if we can get a longer sequence? But note: we are not guaranteed that we can get a longer sequence. We must continue the loop until we have covered the entire array.\n\n   So in the condition when they are equal, we do:\n\n        index = h+g   # record the current total as candidate? But note: we might have a larger candidate later? So we should record the maximum candidate? \n\n        Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? But we must be cautious: if we move the left pointer, we add the next candy to Alice? \n\n        However, we cannot move the left pointer if we are at the boundary? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between the current Alice and Bob\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break   # because we cannot add more without overlapping\n\n   But note: we might have a candidate that we just recorded, and then we break. But what if there is a possibility to get a larger candidate? Actually, we are moving the left pointer and then the condition becomes lowest > highest? Then we will move the right pointer? \n\n   However, the problem says the total candies eaten cannot exceed n, and we are moving until we break the condition h+g<=m? \n\n   But we must record the candidate every time we have equality? And we want the maximum candidate? \n\n   So we should do:\n\n        if highest == lowest:\n            # update the candidate: the current total candies is h+g, and we want the maximum candidate over the entire run.\n            index = h+g   # but note: we might have multiple equalities, and we want the last one? or the maximum? Actually, we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum candidate.\n\n        Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? Why left? Why not right? Actually, we can move either? But we must move one to continue. Let's move the left.\n\n        So:\n            if e+1 < r:   # there is at least one candy in between\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break   # no more candy to add, so we break.\n\n   But wait: what if we move the left and then we get a candidate that is larger? \n\n   However, note: we are increasing the total candies by one. And we are breaking the tie. Then the loop will continue and we might get another equality? \n\n   But we must record the candidate every time we have equality? So we should do:\n\n        if highest == lowest:\n            index = h+g   # because we are going to break the tie and then the total candies will be h+g+? later? But note: we are going to add one more to Alice, so the total becomes h+g+1? but then we break the equality? \n\n        Actually, we want the maximum total candies for which the sums are equal. So we should record the candidate at the moment of equality. And then we break the tie to try to get a longer sequence? \n\n        But note: when we break the tie by adding one to Alice, the total candies becomes h+g+1? Actually, we are adding one candy to Alice: so g becomes g+1, and the total becomes h+g (which is now h+g_old+1). But we haven't recorded that? \n\n        We record the candidate at the moment of equality: that candidate is the current h+g (which is the total candies so far). Then we add one to Alice and then the loop continues? \n\n        But we might get a larger candidate later? \n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1,1] \n          Start: \n            Alice: [1] -> g=1, Bob: [1] (last) -> h=1 -> equal -> candidate=2.\n            Then we move Alice: e becomes 1, Alice=1+1=2, g=2.\n            Then 2>1 -> we move Bob: Bob=1+1 (the next from the right) = 2, h=2 -> equal -> candidate=4 (which is 2+2).\n            Then we move Alice: e becomes 2, Alice=3, g=3 -> then we move Bob: Bob=2+1=3, h=3 -> equal -> candidate=6? but that would be 3+3=6, but n=5 -> so we break the condition? \n\n        Actually, the condition: h+g<=m -> 3+3=6>5 -> so we break the loop? \n\n        But we recorded candidate=4? but the maximum candidate is 4? because we cannot have 6? \n\n        However, the example: [1,1,1,1,1] -> Alice can eat the first two: [1,1] and Bob can eat the last two: [1,1] -> total 4 candies. \n\n        But note: we also had candidate=2 and then candidate=4. We want the maximum candidate. So we should update the candidate only when we have a larger total? \n\n        We can do: \n            if highest == lowest:\n                if h+g > index:\n                    index = h+g\n\n        Then we break the tie.\n\n   However, the provided code initializes index=0. And if we never have equality, we output 0.\n\n   But the problem says: For the third test case, there is no way so answer=0.\n\n   So we update the code in the condition:\n\n        elif highest == lowest:\n            # update the candidate to the maximum total candies so far\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            # Then we break the tie: we move the left pointer if possible\n            if e+1 < r:   # there is at least one candy in between\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break   # we break the loop because we cannot add more\n\n   But note: what if we can move the left pointer but then the next candy is 0? Then we might get an equality again? But the weights are positive. So we don't have zeros.\n\n   However, the problem says: weights are at least 1.\n\n   But what if we break the tie by moving the left and then we get an even larger candidate? \n\n   Example: [1,1,1,1] \n        Start: \n            Alice:1, Bob:1 -> equal -> candidate=2, then we move Alice: Alice=1+1=2, g=2.\n            Then 2>1 -> we move Bob: Bob=1+1=2, h=2 -> equal -> candidate=4 (which is 2+2=4) -> then we try to move Alice: e+1=2, r=1 -> but e+1 (2) is not < r (1) -> so we break? \n        Then we output 4.\n\n   But what if we break the tie by moving the right? Actually, we can choose arbitrarily. The problem does not specify. But we must be consistent.\n\n   However, the provided code already has conditions for when lowest < highest and highest < lowest. So we are only moving one pointer at a time. \n\n   But note: we are in the condition of equality and we choose to move the left. Then the next step we will have lowest > highest? (if we moved the left) or if we moved the right we would have highest > lowest? \n\n   We choose to move the left. \n\n   But what if we cannot move the left? then we break. \n\n   However, we might be able to move the right? But the condition: we are in the middle of the loop and we have equality. We break the tie by moving the left. If we cannot move the left, we break. But we could also break the tie by moving the right? \n\n   Actually, we can move either? But we are only allowed to move one? \n\n   The problem: we want to continue the loop until we have covered the entire array? \n\n   But note: if we break the tie by moving the left, then we have increased the left sum. Then in the next iteration, we will be in the condition that lowest > highest? and then we will move the right? \n\n   So we do:\n\n        elif highest == lowest:\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e+1 < r:   # we can move the left?\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n   But what if we can move the left but we are at the boundary? Actually, the condition e+1 < r: we require that there is at least one candy between the current Alice and Bob? Because if e+1 == r, then we are adjacent and we cannot add without overlapping? \n\n   However, note: the next candy for Alice is at e+1, and Bob is at r. We require that e+1 < r so that the candy at e+1 is not the same as Bob's current candy? \n\n   But the candies are distinct in index? \n\n   Actually, the indices: Alice has eaten [0, e] and Bob has eaten [r, m-1]. We require that the next candy for Alice is at e+1 and for Bob at r-1, and they must not overlap. So we require that e+1 <= r-1? \n\n   The condition in the while loop: h+g <= m -> which is the total candies eaten so far (g for Alice, h for Bob) is <= m. But if we add one more to Alice, we get g+1, and then the total becomes h+g+1. We require that h+g+1 <= m? \n\n   But note: the condition in the while loop is h+g<=m, so we are safe to add one? \n\n   However, we must also check that the index e+1 is strictly less than r? because if e+1 == r, then we are about to eat the same candy? \n\n   Actually, the candies are distinct. We have not eaten the candy at e+1? and Bob has not eaten the candy at r-1? \n\n   But if e+1 == r, then we are at the adjacent candy. Then we cannot add to Alice without overlapping? \n\n   So the condition: if e+1 < r -> then we can add to Alice. \n\n   Alternatively, we could also check if we can add to Bob? But we choose to add to Alice arbitrarily. \n\n   But note: the problem does not require to maximize the candidate in a particular way. We are scanning the entire array. \n\n   However, we must be cautious: if we break the tie by moving the left, we might miss a candidate that we could get by moving the right? \n\n   Actually, we are going to continue the loop: after we move the left, we will have an imbalance and then we will adjust by moving the right? and then we might get another equality? \n\n   So we do:\n\n        elif highest == lowest:\n            # record candidate\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            # Then we break the tie by moving the left if possible? \n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break   # because we cannot add without overlapping\n\n   But what if we break the tie by moving the left and then we get stuck? We might not get another equality? \n\n   But we are scanning the entire array. The algorithm is standard for this problem (two pointers). \n\n   However, note: the problem constraints and the note that the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we must do O(n) per test case? \n\n   This algorithm is O(n) per test case.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: [1,1] -> t=1, n=2, candies=[1,1]\n        e=0, r=1 -> g=1, h=1 -> total=2, which is <=2 -> enter loop.\n        lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal -> candidate=2 (so index=2) -> then we check: e+1=1, r=1 -> 1<1? false -> break -> output 2.\n\n   Example 2: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=7? Actually, the example says n=8? The example: [3,7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=8.\n\n   We'll do the example [3,7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=8) and see if we get candidate=7.\n\n   Start:\n        e=0 -> lowest=3, g=1\n        r=7 -> highest=1, h=1\n        total=2<=8 -> enter loop: 3>1 -> so we do: \n            highest += lst[6] = 1+11=12, r=6, h=2\n        Now: 3<12 -> so we do: \n            e=1, lowest=3+7=10, g=2\n        Now: 10<12 -> e=2, lowest=10+3=13, g=3\n        Now: 13>12 -> highest += lst[5] = 12+8=20, r=5, h=3\n        Now: 13<20 -> e=3, lowest=13+20=33, g=4\n        Now: 33>20 -> highest += lst[4]=20+10=30, r=4, h=4\n        Now: 33>30 -> highest += lst[3]? but r=4, so r-1=3 -> but then we would be adding the candy at index3 which is 20? but that is already eaten by Alice? \n\n        Actually, we have e=3 (so Alice has eaten [0,1,2,3]) and Bob has eaten [7,6,5,4]? \n        But the candy at index3 (20) is eaten by Alice, and the candy at index4 (10) is eaten by Bob? \n\n        Now: 33>30 -> we do: \n            highest += lst[r-1] -> but r=4, so r-1=3 -> but that candy (index3) is already eaten by Alice? -> we cannot do that? \n\n        The problem: we are storing the entire array and we are using two pointers that move independently? \n\n        Actually, the pointers: \n            Alice: from 0 to e (inclusive) -> so e=3: indices0,1,2,3 -> [3,7,3,20] -> sum=33.\n            Bob: from r to 7 (inclusive) -> r=4: indices4,5,6,7 -> [10,8,11,1] -> sum=30.\n\n        Then we do: \n            highest<lowest -> so we do: \n                highest += lst[r-1] -> but r-1=3 -> which is the candy at index3? but that candy is already eaten by Alice? -> that's a problem.\n\n        We must not add a candy that is already eaten? \n\n        The code: \n            highest += lst[r-1]   # and then r-=1\n\n        But note: the candy at r-1 is the next candy to the left of Bob's current segment? and it hasn't been eaten by Alice? \n\n        How? The segments: \n            Alice: [0, e] -> e=3\n            Bob: [r, m-1] -> r=4 -> [4,7]\n            The candy at index3 is at e=3, which is adjacent to Bob's segment? and not eaten by Bob? \n\n        But we are about to add it to Bob? \n\n        However, the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. So we must not add a candy that is already eaten by the other? \n\n        The condition: we are moving the pointers and the candies between e and r are not eaten? \n\n        So the next candy for Alice is at e+1 (if e+1 < r) and the next candy for Bob is at r-1 (if r-1 > e). \n\n        In the state: e=3, r=4 -> the next candy for Bob is at r-1=3 -> but that is the same as e? \n\n        Actually, the candy at index3 is the last candy of Alice? \n\n        This is a problem: we are about to add the candy at index3 to Bob? but it's already eaten by Alice? \n\n        So we must not do that. \n\n        The condition: we must only add a candy from Bob if r-1 > e? \n\n        But the condition in the code for Bob: \n            elif highest<lowest:   # actually the condition is: if lowest < highest -> then we add to Alice? and if highest<lowest -> we add to Bob? \n            highest<lowest: \n                highest += lst[r-1]   # but we must check that r-1 > e? \n\n        Actually, the condition in the while loop: h+g<=m -> but that doesn't check the indices? \n\n        We should break the loop when e and r become adjacent? \n\n        Actually, the condition in the while loop: h+g<=m -> but that doesn't account for the fact that we might have no more candies to add? \n\n        We should break when e+1 >= r? meaning there are no candies in between? \n\n        But the while condition is h+g<=m -> which is the total candies eaten so far. \n\n        How do we avoid adding the same candy? \n\n        The problem: the two pointers e and r: \n            Alice has eaten [0, e] -> so the next available for Alice is e+1 (if e+1 < r) \n            Bob has eaten [r, m-1] -> so the next available for Bob is r-1 (if r-1 > e)\n\n        So in the condition for adding to Alice: we require e+1 < r? \n        Similarly, for adding to Bob: we require r-1 > e? \n\n        But note: if we are at e and r, and we want to add to Alice: we require e+1 < r -> meaning there is at least one candy between e and r? \n        Similarly, for Bob: r-1 > e -> same condition? \n\n        Actually, e+1 < r  <=> r-1 > e.\n\n        So we can check in the conditions for Alice and Bob? \n\n        But the provided code does not check that? \n\n        In the provided code for the conditions:\n\n            if lowest < highest:\n                # we add to Alice: but we must check if we can? \n                if e+1 < r:\n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break   # cannot add, so break\n\n            elif highest < lowest:\n                if r-1 > e:   # same as e < r-1\n                    highest += lst[r-1]\n                    r -= 1\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            else: # equal\n                ... \n\n        But the provided code does not have that check? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            if lowest<highest:\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g +=1\n            elif highest<lowest:\n                highest+=lst[r-1]\n                r-=1\n                h+=1\n\n        This will crash if e+1 is out of bounds? \n\n        Actually, the condition in the while loop: h+g<=m -> but that doesn't prevent e+1 from being out of the array? \n\n        We have e from 0 to m-1, and r from m-1 down to 0. \n\n        We must check that e+1 is within [0, m-1] and also that e+1 < r? \n\n        But the condition h+g<=m: \n            Initially, g=1, h=1 -> total=2, then we add one -> 3, then 4, ... until we reach m.\n            But we might run out of candies in the middle? \n\n        So we must add bounds checks in the conditions for Alice and Bob? \n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do bounds checks.\n\n        But the provided code does not have bounds checks? \n\n        We are to complete the code only in the condition for equality? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> we are only to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        However, the provided code might crash without bounds checks? \n\n        But the note: the condition in the while loop: h+g<=m -> and we are adding one candy at a time, so we are safe? \n\n        But what if e+1 is beyond the array? \n\n        Actually, e starts at 0 and increases, and r starts at m-1 and decreases. The condition h+g<=m ensures that we haven't eaten all candies? \n\n        But the next candy for Alice is at e+1, which must be at most m-1? and we have e+1 <= r? \n\n        Actually, we have e < r because we are in the loop? \n\n        But the condition: we are in the loop and we are about to add a candy. The condition h+g<=m -> we have at least one candy left? \n\n        However, the candy we are going to add is the next one for Alice: at e+1. We require that e+1 is strictly less than r? \n\n        But note: the next candy for Alice is at e+1, and Bob has not eaten that candy? because Bob's segment starts at r and goes to the right, and e+1 < r -> so it's available.\n\n        But what if e+1 == r? then that candy is the first candy of Bob's segment? -> we cannot eat it twice.\n\n        So we must not add if e+1 >= r? \n\n        Therefore, we must add bounds checks in the conditions for Alice and Bob? \n\n        But the problem says: we are only to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        However, the provided code for the other conditions does not have bounds checks? \n\n        We are not allowed to change the other conditions? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> it might be that the entire block for the condition of equality is missing, but the other conditions are already written? \n\n        We are only to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        But the provided code might be flawed? \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        We are to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        So we do:\n\n            elif highest == lowest:\n                if h+g > index:\n                    index = h+g\n                if e+1 < r:\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        And hope that the other conditions have bounds checks? \n\n        But the provided code for the other conditions does not have bounds checks? \n\n        Actually, the condition for Alice: \n            if lowest<highest:\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]   # if e+1 is beyond the array? \n                e+=1\n                g +=1\n\n        This will crash if e+1 is out of bounds? \n\n        But the while condition: h+g<=m -> and we are adding one candy at a time, so we will not exceed the array? \n\n        However, the index e+1 must be in the range [0, m-1]? \n\n        Initially, e=0 -> e+1=1 -> valid if m>=2.\n        Then we increment e until e becomes m-1? \n\n        But the condition: we break the loop when h+g>m -> which happens when we have eaten more than m candies? \n\n        But we are adding one at a time and we break when h+g>m? \n\n        Actually, the condition is h+g<=m -> so we break when h+g>m -> so we never add when h+g>m. \n\n        But what if we are at the last candy? \n\n        Example: n=1 -> but the problem says n>=1, and the first line of the test case is n, then a list of n integers. \n\n        But the while loop condition: h+g<=m -> initially h+g=2, and if m=1, then 2<=1 -> false -> skip. \n\n        So for n=1, we skip the loop and output index=0 (which is initialized to 0) -> which is correct? because they cannot both eat the same candy? \n\n        But the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. So for n=1, they cannot eat? \n\n        Now, for n>=2: \n            e starts at 0 -> e+1=1 -> which is valid? \n            then e becomes 1 -> then e+1=2 -> valid until e becomes m-2? \n\n        But when e becomes m-2, then e+1 = m-1 -> which is the last candy? \n\n        But Bob's segment: initially r = m-1. Then if we add to Alice at e+1 = m-1, then we are eating the candy at m-1? which is the same as Bob's first candy? \n\n        How do we avoid that? \n\n        The condition: we are in the condition for Alice: we only add if e+1 < r? \n\n        But the provided code does not check that? \n\n        Therefore, the provided code might be flawed. \n\n        But the problem says: we are only to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        We must not change the other conditions? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> it might be that the entire block for the condition of equality is missing, but the other conditions are already written? \n\n        We are to output only the missing code for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        So for program1.py, we output the code for the condition of equality.\n\n        We do:\n\n            elif highest == lowest:\n                if h+g > index:\n                    index = h+g\n                if e+1 < r:\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        And hope that the other conditions are fixed? \n\n        But the example [3,7,3,20,10,8,11,1] failed because when e=3 and r=4, we try to add to Bob: \n            highest<lowest: 30<33 -> then we do: \n                highest += lst[r-1] = lst[3] = 20 -> but that candy is at index3, which is already eaten by Alice? \n\n        So we must not do that. \n\n        Therefore, the provided code for the other conditions must be fixed to check bounds? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change them? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the segments do not overlap? and the condition h+g<=m ensures that? \n\n        But the condition h+g<=m does not ensure that the next candy for Alice is not in Bob's segment? \n\n        We must check that e+1 < r for Alice and r-1 > e for Bob? \n\n        Since we are only to complete the condition for equality, we cannot change the other conditions? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" -> it might be that the entire program is provided and we are to fill in the missing part? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for each program.\n\n        And the provided code for program1.py has the other conditions without bounds checks? \n\n        We must assume that the provided code for the other conditions is correct? \n\n        But the example fails.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition for the other parts? but the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n        So we only output the code for the condition of equality.\n\n        And hope that the bounds are checked in the while condition? \n\n        Actually, the condition in the while loop: h+g<=m -> and we are about to add one candy, so we will have h+g+1<=m? -> but that doesn't ensure that the candy is available? \n\n        We must break the loop when there are no more candies to add? \n\n        But the problem says: the total candies eaten is h+g, and we are about to add one more -> then we require that there is at least one candy available? \n\n        The available candies are from e+1 to r-1? \n\n        So the number of available candies is (r-1 - e) >= 1? \n\n        But the condition h+g<=m-1 would ensure that? \n\n        The while condition is h+g<=m -> which is the same as the total candies eaten so far is at most m. \n\n        We are going to add one more -> then we require h+g+1<=m -> which is the same as h+g<=m-1. \n\n        But the condition in the while loop is h+g<=m -> which is true even if h+g==m -> then we would try to add and then h+g becomes m+1 -> which breaks the condition? \n\n        But the condition is at the start of the loop. \n\n        So we are allowed to enter the loop only if h+g<=m. \n\n        Then inside, we might add one more -> then we break the condition for the next iteration? \n\n        But we are not checking the next iteration until we finish the current.\n\n        So the provided code might access an out-of-bound index? \n\n        Therefore, we must add bounds checks in the conditions for Alice and Bob? \n\n        But we are only allowed to complete the condition for equality? \n\n        This is a dilemma.\n\n        Given the constraints, and that the total n over test cases is <=200000, and that the while loop runs at most m times, we might get an index error.\n\n        But the problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000, so we can do bounds checks.\n\n        However, we are only to complete the condition for equality.\n\n        We decide to complete only the condition for equality as described.\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n        We are to complete the code for the four integers problem.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                a=int(input())\n                if a%4==0:\n                    print(a//4,a//4,a//4,a//4)\n                else:\n                    if a%2==1:   # odd\n                        a1=(a-1)\n                        if a1%3==0:\n                            print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                        elif a1%4!=0:\n                            a1=a-2\n                            print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\n                        elif a1%4==0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        What to do when a1%4==0? \n\n        Note: a1 = a-1, and a1%4==0 -> so a-1 is divisible by 4.\n\n        We need to find four positive integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d = n, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n        Example: n=5 -> a1=4 -> 4%4==0 -> then what? \n            We have to output four positive integers that sum to 5, and satisfy the condition.\n\n        But 5: we cannot do (1,1,1,2) because then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal.\n\n        The example in the note: n=10 -> output: 3,5,1,1 -> gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        How about n=5? \n            We try: \n                a1 = 4 -> divisible by 4 -> then we can do: \n                    a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 2? -> but that doesn't work.\n                or a = 2, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 -> then gcd(2,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works? \n                    and sum=2+1+1+1=5.\n\n        But the code in the else branch for a%2==1 (odd) has already handled a1%3==0 and a1%4!=0, and now a1%4==0.\n\n        We can do: \n            We want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d)=x.\n\n        We know that x must be at least 1.\n\n        We can try: \n            Let x = 1.\n            Then we can have a=1, b=1, c=1, d = n-3.\n            But then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1, n-3)=n-3. We require 1 = n-3 -> n=4 -> but n>=4 and n=5 -> 1 != 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            a = a1//2, b = a1//2, c = 1, d = 1 -> but then gcd(a1//2, a1//2)=a1//2, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> so we require a1//2=1 -> a1=2 -> but a1=4 -> a1//2=2.\n\n        How about: \n            a = a1//4 * 2, b = a1//4 * 2, c = a1//4, d = 1? \n            Then gcd(a,b) = a1//4 * 2? (if a1//4 is even) -> not necessarily.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            a = a1//2, b = a1//2, c = 1, d = 1 -> but then the gcd is a1//2, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> so we need a1//2=1 -> a1=2, but a1=4 -> a1//2=2.\n\n        We can try to set gcd(a,b)=2, and lcm(c,d)=2.\n\n        For gcd(a,b)=2: we can take a=2, b=2.\n        For lcm(c,d)=2: we can take c=2, d=1 -> then lcm(2,1)=2.\n        Then total = 2+2+2+1 = 7 -> but we are for n=5.\n\n        For n=5: \n            We have a1=4 (which is divisible by 4) -> then we are in this branch.\n\n        We need: a+b+c+d=5.\n\n        We can try: \n            a=2, b=2, c=1, d=0 -> not positive.\n\n        How about: \n            a=1, b=1, c=2, d=1 -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(2,1)=2 -> not equal.\n\n        Or: \n            a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works! and sum=1+2+1+1=5.\n\n        So we can output: 1,2,1,1.\n\n        But how to generalize? \n\n        We can do: \n            a = 1, b = a1//2, c = a1//4, d = 1? \n            But then the sum: 1 + (a1//2) + (a1//4) + 1 = 2 + a1*(3/4) = 2 + (a-1)*(3/4) -> which is not a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            a = 1, b = a-3, c=1, d=1 -> then gcd(1, a-3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n            But then the numbers: 1, a-3, 1, 1 -> sum = 1+(a-3)+1+1 = a, and they are positive if a-3>=1 -> a>=4 -> but a>=4, and a is odd? -> a>=5.\n\n        So for a1%4==0, we can do: \n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But wait: a1 = a-1, and a1%4==0 -> a-1 is divisible by 4 -> so a = 4k+1, for k>=1 (since a>=5).\n\n        Then a-3 = 4k+1-3 = 4k-2 = 2(2k-1) -> positive for k>=1.\n\n        Example: \n            a=5: then output: 1, 5-3=2, 1, 1 -> 1,2,1,1 -> works.\n\n        But is this always valid? \n            gcd(1, a-3) = 1.\n            lcm(1,1)=1.\n            So it works.\n\n        But the code already has a branch for a1%3==0: \n            For a=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 !=0, so we go to the next condition: a1%4!=0 -> 4%4==0 -> so we don't go there. \n            Then we go to a1%4==0.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says: output any solution.\n\n        However, the example in the note: \n            n=10: \n                The example output: 3,5,1,1 -> which uses the condition a1%3==0? \n                a=10, a1=9 -> 9%3==0 -> so they output: 9//3=3,3,3,1 -> 3,3,3,1 -> but the example output is 3,5,1,1? \n\n        The provided code for a1%3==0: \n            print(a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1)\n\n        So for n=10: a1=9, then output: 3,3,3,1 -> sum=3+3+3+1=10.\n\n        And gcd(3,3)=3, lcm(3,1)=3 -> works.\n\n        But the example output in the note is 3,5,1,1 -> which is also valid.\n\n        So both are valid.\n\n        Therefore, for the branch a1%4==0, we output: 1, a-3, 1, 1.\n\n        But wait: what if a-3 equals 1? \n            a=5: a-3=2 -> not 1.\n            a=9: a-3=6 -> not 1.\n            a=13: a-3=10 -> not 1.\n\n        But what if a=7? \n            a=7: a1=6 -> 6%4!=0 -> so we go to the condition: \n                if a%2==1: \n                    a1=6 -> then we check: \n                        6%3==0 -> so we output: 6//3=2,2,2,1 -> 2+2+2+1=7 -> valid.\n\n            So we never get to the a1%4==0 branch for a=7.\n\n        Only when a1%4==0 and a1%3!=0? \n            But the conditions are:\n                if a1%3==0: \n                    ...\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    ...\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    ...\n\n        So for a1=4: we do the last branch.\n\n        Therefore, we complete the branch with:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the problem says: output 4 positive integers. And a-3 must be at least 1? \n            a>=5 -> a-3>=2 -> so it's positive.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        However, the example in the note: n=4 -> handled by the first condition (a%4==0) -> output 1,1,1,1.\n\n        n=5: output 1,2,1,1.\n        n=9: a1=8 -> 8%4==0 -> output 1,9-3=6,1,1 -> 1,6,1,1 -> sum=9, and gcd(1,6)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        But the example in the note: n=9 -> output: 2,4,2,1 -> which is different.\n\n        The problem says: output any solution.\n\n        So we output 1, a-3, 1, 1.\n\n        But wait: the condition a1%4==0: a1 = a-1, and a1%4==0 -> so a = 4k+1.\n\n        We output: 1, 4k+1-3, 1, 1 = 1, 4k-2, 1, 1.\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, we complete the branch with:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But note: the code in the else branch for a%2==1 has an extra condition: \n            if a%2==1:\n                a1=(a-1)\n                if a1%3==0:\n                    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    a1=a-2\n                    print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        And for even a (a%2==0) but not divisible by 4, we have:\n\n            else:\n                a1=a-2\n                print(a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1,1)\n\n        Example: a=6 (even, not divisible by 4) -> then output: (6-2=4) -> 4//2=2 -> then 2-1=1, 2+1=3, 1,1 -> 1,3,1,1 -> sum=6, and gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        But the example in the note: a=7 (handled in the odd branch: a1=6, which is divisible by 3 -> output 2,2,2,1).\n\n        a=8: divisible by 4 -> output 2,2,2,2.\n\n        a=9: odd, a1=8 -> 8%4==0 -> output 1,6,1,1.\n\n        a=10: odd, a1=9 -> 9%3==0 -> output 3,3,3,1.\n\n        But the example in the note for a=10: output 3,5,1,1 -> which is also valid.\n\n        So we are done.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code for the condition of equality is:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code for the condition a1%4==0 is:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        We output in JSON format:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if h+g > index:\\n                index = h+g\\n            if e+1 < r:\\n                e += 1\\n                lowest += lst[e]\\n                g += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the code for program1.py has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" -> we replace that with the above block.\n\n        And for program2.py, we replace the comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" with the print statement.\n\n        We output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We output in the specified JSON.\n\n        Let me format the string for program1: we have newlines and spaces.

The TODO is at a certain indentation level. We output the code exactly as it should appear at that level.\n\n        The TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We output the code with 12 spaces of indentation for the outer block, and 16 for the inner? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the block that replaces the TODO.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And we represent this as a string in JSON with newlines and spaces.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"            if h+g > index:\\n                index = h+g\\n            if e+1 < r:\\n                e += 1\\n                lowest += lst[e]\\n                g += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\"\n\n        But the number of spaces: the current line at the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        The provided code: \n\n            while h+g <= m:\n                ... \n                elif highest == lowest:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at 12 spaces (because the while body is 8, the if-elif is 8, and the body of the elif is 12).\n\n        We replace the TODO with our code, which should be at 12 spaces. \n\n        But our code has multiple lines. The first line: \"if h+g > index:\" should be at 12 spaces, then the next line \"index = h+g\" should be at 16 spaces, then \"if e+1 < r:\" at 12 spaces, etc.\n\n        We output the code as a string that, when inserted at the TODO, has the correct indentation.\n\n        We insert:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e+1 < r:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And we indent each line by 12 spaces? \n\n        But then:\n\n            Line1: 12 spaces + \"if h+g > index:\"\n            Line2: 16 spaces + \"index = h+g\"\n            Line3: 12 spaces + \"if e+1 < r:\"\n            Line4: 16 spaces + \"e += 1\"\n            Line5: 16 spaces + \"lowest += lst[e]\"\n            Line6: 16 spaces + \"g += 1\"\n            Line7: 12 spaces + \"else:\"\n            Line8: 16 spaces + \"break\"\n\n        But the provided code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n        We output the string:\n\n            s = \"            if h+g > index:\\n                index = h+g\\n            if e+1 < r:\\n                e += 1\\n                lowest += lst[e]\\n                g += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\"\n\n        This has 12 spaces at the beginning of the first line, then 16 for the inner, and 12 for the next if and else.\n\n        But the total: \n            \"            if ...\" -> 12 spaces.\n\n        How many spaces? 12.\n\n        We can count: \n            The while loop body is indented by 4 (from the while) -> 4 spaces.\n            The if-elif block: each condition is indented by 4 more -> 8 spaces.\n            The body of each condition: 4 more -> 12 spaces.\n\n        So the code we insert should be at 12 spaces for the outer if, and 16 for the inner.\n\n        We output the string exactly as above.\n\n        For program2.py, we output:\n\n            \"print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\"\n\n        But note: the branch is:\n\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        And the indentation: the if-elif block is at 4 spaces (from the for) and the body of the elif is 8 spaces? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            for ...:\n                if ...:\n                    ...\n                else:\n                    if ...:\n                        ...\n                    elif ...:\n                        ...\n                    elif ...:\n                        # TODO\n\n        The TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\n        Actually:\n\n            for: 0\n            if: 4\n            else: 4\n                if: 8\n                    if: 12\n                    elif: 12\n                    elif: 12 -> then the body of this elif: 16 spaces.\n\n        But the provided code in the other branches in the else: \n\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(...)   -> at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                a=int(input())\n                if a%4==0:\n                    print(a//4,a//4,a//4,a//4)\n                else:\n                    if a%2==1:\n                        a1=(a-1)\n                        if a1%3==0:\n                            print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                        elif a1%4!=0:\n                            a1=a-2\n                            print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\n                        elif a1%4==0:\n                            # TODO\n\n        The TODO is at 20 spaces? \n\n        We output the code for the TODO: \n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        at 20 spaces? \n\n        But we output only the code, not the spaces? \n\n        The problem: the missing code is inserted at the TODO, and the code should be at the same indentation level as the other print statements in the branch.\n\n        We output the string: \"print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\" \n\n        And when inserted at 20 spaces, it will be:\n\n                        print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        But we don't need to output the spaces? \n\n        The problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the statement: \n\n            print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\n\n        So we output that string.\n\n        Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            if h+g > index:\\n                index = h+g\\n            if e+1 < r:\\n                e += 1\\n                lowest += lst[e]\\n                g += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n                \"program2\": \"print(1, a-3, 1, 1)\"\n            }\n\n        But wait: the program1 code has a variable 'index' that is being updated. And we break out of the loop when we cannot move.\n\n        We hope this is correct.\n\n        Let me test program1 with the example [1,1]: \n            n=2, lst=[1,1]\n            e=0, r=1, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1, index=0.\n            while 1+1<=2 -> true.\n            condition: 1==1 -> \n                if 1+1>0 -> true, so index=2.\n                then check: e+1=1, r=1 -> 1<1? false -> break.\n            then print(index)=2.\n\n        Example [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5): \n            We want to record candidate=4.\n            Steps:\n                Start: e=0, r=4 -> g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal: index=2, then we move Alice: e=1, lowest=1+1=2, g=2.\n                Then 2>1 -> move Bob: highest=1+1=2, r=3, h=2.\n                Then 2==2 -> candidate: h+g=4 -> update index=4, then we move Alice: e=2, lowest=2+1=3, g=3.\n                Then 3>2 -> move Bob: highest=2+1=3, r=2, h=3.\n                Then 3==3 -> candidate: h+g=6 -> but 6>5 -> the while condition: h+g=6>5 -> break the loop? \n                But we are in the loop? Actually, we are in the loop because we are in the condition of equality? \n                Then we update index=6? but that's not possible.\n\n            But note: the while condition is at the start of the loop. We are in the loop for the state (g=3, h=3) -> total=6>5 -> we break the loop? \n\n            Actually, the condition is at the start of the while. So we break the loop and output index=4.\n\n            But we recorded 4, then we moved and then we had 6? but we break the loop? \n\n            How did we get into the loop for the state (g=3, h=3)? \n\n            The state after moving Bob to get h=3: \n                g=3, h=3 -> total=6>5 -> so we break the while loop? \n\n            But we are in the body of the loop for the previous state (g=2, h=2) -> which had total=4<=5 -> we entered.\n\n            Then we did the condition for equality and then we moved Alice to get g=3, and then we break the inner if-else and then the while loop condition is checked at the next iteration? \n\n            But the code: after the condition of equality, we break the tie and then the loop body ends? Then we go to the next iteration? \n\n            The next iteration: h+g=3+3=6>5 -> so we break the while loop.\n\n            So we output index=4.\n\n            But the expected answer for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON as above."
