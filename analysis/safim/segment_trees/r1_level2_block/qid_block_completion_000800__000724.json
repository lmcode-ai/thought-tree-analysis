We did p2=3 -> then we did p2-=1 -> p2=2, then p2-=1 -> p2=1? Actually, in the step after moving right the second time, we set p2=2?

The classic solution for this problem (which is known as \"Candies\" in Codeforces) is:\n\n                s1 = 0\n                s2 = 0\n                left = 0\n                right = n-1\n                ans = 0\n                while left <= right:\n                    if s1 < s2:\n                        s1 += w[left]\n                        left += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += w[right]\n                        right -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the count of candies Alice has eaten, and n-1-right is the count of candies Bob has eaten.\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But note: in the classic solution, we update the candidate only when s1==s2. And we break the tie by moving the left if s1<=s2? \n\n            However, the classic solution for the problem \"Candies\" (from a recent contest) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    arr = list(map(int, input().split())) l = 0\n                    r = n-1\n                    a = 0\n                    b = 0\n                    ans = 0\n                    while l <= r:\n                        if a <= b:\n                            a += arr[l]\n                            l += 1\n                        else:\n                            b += arr[r]\n                            r -= 1\n                        if a == b:\n                            ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                    print(ans)\n\n            Let me test with [1,1,1,1]:\n                l=0, r=3: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=1, l=1 -> then check a==b? 1==0 -> no.\n                l=1, r=3: a=1, b=0 -> a> b -> so b=1, r=2 -> then a==b? 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (4-1-2)=1+1=2. l=1, r=2: a=1, b=1 -> a<=b -> a=2, l=2 -> then a==b? 2==1 -> no.\n                l=2, r=2: a=2, b=1 -> a> b -> b=2, r=1 -> then a==b? 2==2 -> ans = 2 + (4-1-1)=2+2=4. l=2, r=1: break? because l<=r fails? Then we print 4. So the classic solution is:\n\n                while l<=r:\n                    if a <= b:\n                        a += arr[l]\n                        l += 1\n                    else:\n                        b += arr[r]\n                        r -= 1\n                    if a == b:\n                        ans = l + (n-1-r)\n\n            But note: the condition is a<=b, not a<b. Now, let's look at the provided code:\n\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: \n                    if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            This is different. It has two separate ifs.",

Then p1=1, p2=1: we break? Then we print 2. But what if we have [1,1,1,1,1,1]? We want to record 6? Steps:\n                  p1=0, p2=5: s1=0<=s2=0 -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> not equal. p1=1, p2=5: s1=1<=s2=0? no -> move Bob: s2=1, p2=4 -> equal: ans = 1 + (6-1-4)=1+1=2. p1=1, p2=4: s1=1<=s2=1 -> move Alice: s1=2, p1=2 -> not equal. p1=2, p2=4: s1=2>s2=1 -> move Bob: s2=2, p2=3 -> equal: ans = 2 + (6-1-3)=2+2=4. p1=2, p2=3: s1=2<=s2=2 -> move Alice: s1=3, p1=3 -> not equal. p1=3, p2=3: s1=3>s2=2 -> move Bob: s2=3, p2=2 -> equal: ans = 3 + (6-1-2)=3+3=6. Then break: p1=3, p2=2 -> p1>p2 -> break. Then we print 6. So we can do:\n\n                ans = 0 while p1 <= p2: if s1 <= s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies, Bob has eaten (n-1-p2) candies.\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But note: the problem says that the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so this while loop is O(n) per test case and overall O(200000) which is acceptable. However, the provided code has a while condition (p1-1<=p2). We can change it to p1<=p2? But the problem: the condition in the provided code is (p1-1<=p2). We can change it to p1<=p2? Let me test with [1,2,1] using the classic method and condition p1<=p2:\n\n                p1=0, p2=2: 0<=2 -> true. s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> true: s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==0 -> no.\n                p1=1, p2=2: 1<=2 -> true. s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> move Bob: s2=1, p2=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> ans=1+(3-1-1)=2.\n                p1=1, p2=1: 1<=1 -> true. s1=1, s2=1 -> s1<=s2 -> move Alice: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then check: 3==1 -> no.\n                p1=2, p2=1: 2<=1 -> false -> break. Then we print 2. But what if we don't change the condition? We can also keep the condition as (p1-1<=p2) and use the classic method? However, the condition (p1-1<=p2) is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. This is a bit looser.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code structure:\n   I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n   for _ in range(I()[0]):\n        n=I()[0]\n        l=I()\n        l2=[]   # This list is not used in the provided snippet? But note the print at the end uses l2[-1]. We must figure out what to store in l2.\n        s1,s2=0,0\n        p1,p2=0,n-1\n        while (p1-1<=p2):   # This condition seems odd. We note that the condition should be p1<=p2? But note: the condition is p1-1<=p2 -> which is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. That allows p1 to go one beyond p2? We must be cautious.\n\n        The inside:\n          if s1 == s2: \n          if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n          if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        Then print(l2[-1])\n\n The idea: We are using two pointers. Alice starts at the left (p1) and Bob at the right (p2). We have two sums: s1 (Alice's current total) and s2 (Bob's current total).\n\n We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) when s1 == s2.\n\n However, note the example: \n   In the first test case: [1,2,1] -> Alice eats the first candy (1), Bob eats the last candy (1). Then they have eaten 2 candies.\n\n How do we record the total candies when the sums are equal? We note that when s1==s2, we have a candidate for the total candies eaten: (p1) [because Alice has eaten from index0 to p1-1] and (n-1-p2) [because Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1]. So total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = p1 + n - 1 - p2.\n\n But note: the condition in the while loop: while (p1-1<=p2). Let me check with [1,2,1]:\n   Initially: p1=0, p2=2 -> condition: -1<=2 -> true.\n     s1==s2 (0==0) -> we record? Then we do: \n        Then we check: s1 (0) < s2 (0) -> false. Similarly, s2< s1 false. So we break? \n\n We must do something when s1==s2. We should record the current total candies: which is p1 (number of candies Alice has eaten) + (n-1 - p2) (number of candies Bob has eaten). But note: the candies that are eaten are from [0, p1-1] and [p2+1, n-1]. So the count is p1 + (n-1 - p2). \n\n However, the problem: we are going to update the pointers only when s1 < s2 or s2 < s1. But when they are equal, we don't update? Then we get stuck.\n\n So we must update in the equal case? But note: we can have multiple equal cases. We want the maximum total candies. We can record the current total and then try to move one of the pointers? However, the problem: we can only move if we are going to break the equality? But note: we can also move and then later become equal again.\n\n However, the problem says: we want the maximum total candies. We can record every time the sums are equal? But note: the total candies at an equal moment is a candidate.\n\n How about: when s1==s2, we record the current total (p1 + n-1-p2) and then we try to move one of the pointers? But which one? Actually, we can move either? But note: we are allowed to have multiple moves? The problem: we are trying to maximize the total candies. We can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies (indices 0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten (n-1-p2) candies (from p2+1 to n-1)\n        l2.append(candidate)   # we record this candidate\n        # Then we move one step from the left? Why? Because if we don't move, we break the loop? But we can also move both? Actually, we can try to move one step to see if we can get more candies? But note: if we move both, then we break the current equality and we might get a new chance? However, the problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. But the algorithm is greedy: we are moving until the pointers cross.\n\n   However, note: we are going to continue until the pointers cross. We want the maximum candidate.\n\n   But the example: [1,2,1] \n        Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate: 0 + (3-1-2) = 0+0=0? That's not 2.\n\n        Actually, at step0: Alice hasn't eaten any, Bob hasn't eaten any. Then we record 0? Then we must move: we can move Alice? But the condition: s1==s2, so we don't fall into the next two ifs. Then we break? \n\n   So we must move in the equal case? How about:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            l2.append(candidate)\n            # Then we move one from the left? Because if we don't move, we break? But we can also move the right? Actually, we can move both? But note: we are allowed to have independent moves. However, the problem: we are simulating the process. We can choose to move the left? Why? Because we want to try to extend the sequence? But note: we are going to continue the while loop until the pointers cross. We can do:\n\n            # Let's move the left one? Then we break the equality? Then the next step we might move the right? \n\n        But the example: [1,2,1] \n            Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0, then we move the left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=2 -> true.\n            Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> so we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> so we add the right: s2=1, p2=1 -> now p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n            Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2 = 3-1-1 = 1 -> total=2 -> we record 2.\n\n            Then we move again? We can move the left: then p1=2, s1=1+2=3 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=1 -> true.\n            Then: s1=3, s2=1 -> we move the right? but p2 is 1, we can't move the right because we already took the last one? Actually, we moved the right to 1, so the next right is at 0? But we did p2-=1 to 1, so the next would be p2=0? But we don't have that because we break the condition? \n\n        Actually, after we move the right to 1, we then check the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> 0<=1 -> true. Then we get the equal case and record 2. Then we must move? Otherwise we break? \n\n        How about: when we are in the equal case, we move the left? Then we break the equality? Then the next step we can move the right? \n\n        But note: we can also move the right? How about we move the right in the equal case? Then we break the equality? \n\n        Actually, we can move either one? But we want to maximize the chance of getting more candies? \n\n        However, the problem: we are going to simulate until the pointers cross. We can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(candidate)\n                # We move the left? Why? Because we want to try to get more candies? But note: we can also move the right? \n                # But if we move both? Then we are effectively taking one more from each side? \n\n            How about: we move the left? Then we break the equality? Then the next step we will try to fix the inequality? \n\n        But note: we are going to do the while loop until the condition breaks. We can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(candidate)\n                # We move the left? Because if we don't move, we break? But we can also move the right? Actually, we can move one step arbitrarily? \n                # However, the problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. But the algorithm must be efficient.\n\n            But note: if we move the left, then we break the equality? Then the next step we will have s1 > s2? Then we move the right? \n\n            Example: [1,1,1,1] \n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition: p1-1=0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> we move right: s2=1, p2=2 -> condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2 = 4-1-2 = 1 -> total=2 -> record 2.\n                Then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=1 -> move right: s2=2, p2=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2 = 4-1-1=2 -> total=4 -> record 4.\n                Then we move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition: 2<=1 -> false? -> break.\n\n            Then we print l2[-1] which is 4.\n\n            But the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. In [1,1,1,1]: \n                Alice eats [1,1] (the first two) and Bob eats [1,1] (the last two) -> total 4? That's valid.\n\n            However, what if we moved the right first in the equal case? \n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=3 -> then condition: -1<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=0, s2=1 -> move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=4-1-3=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                Then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=1 -> move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then we move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition:2<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=3, s2=2 -> move right: but p2 is 2, we move to 1? s2=3 -> condition:2<=1 -> false? break.\n                Then we print 3? which is not the maximum.\n\n            So we must move both? \n\n            How about: in the equal case, we move both? \n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(candidate)\n                # We move both? \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                s2 += l[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n\n            Then for [1,1,1,1]:\n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we move both: s1=1, p1=1; s2=1, p2=3 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=4-1-3=0 -> total=1 -> record 1? \n                Then we move both: s1=1+l[1]=1+1=2, p1=2; s2=1+l[3]=1+1=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then move both: p1=3, p2=1 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n                Then we print 3? but we want 4.\n\n            How about we don't move both? We only record and then move one? But which one? \n\n            Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily? But note: we want to maximize the total candies. We can try to move the left? But then we break the equality? Then the next step we move the right? \n\n            But the example [1,1,1,1] with moving left in the equal case:\n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> we move right: s2=1, p2=3 -> condition:0<=3? Actually, we are in the loop again: condition holds? \n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                Then we move left? because we are in the equal case? Then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=1 -> move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then we move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition:2<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=3, s2=2 -> move right: but p2 is 2, we move to 1? s2=3 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n                Then we print 3.\n\n            How do we get 4? \n                We want to record when Alice has eaten the first two and Bob the last two? \n                That happens when: \n                    Alice: [0,1] -> p1=2 (because she has eaten two candies: index0 and index1)\n                    Bob: [2,3] -> p2=1 (because he has eaten from index3 and index2? so the next available is index1? but we started at 3 and then 2, so p2 becomes 1? \n                Then total = p1 (2) + (n-1-p2) = 4-1-1 = 2 -> total=4? \n\n                How do we get that state? \n                    We start: \n                      s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? \n                      Then we move both? \n                      Then we have: \n                         Alice: [0] -> s1=1, p1=1\n                         Bob: [3] -> s2=1, p2=3\n                      Then we are equal -> record 1 (because p1=1, n-1-p2=0 -> total=1)\n                      Then we move both: \n                         Alice: [0,1] -> s1=2, p1=2\n                         Bob: [3,2] -> s2=2, p2=2\n                      Then we are equal -> record 3? because p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3? \n                      Then we move both: \n                         Alice: [0,1,2] -> s1=3, p1=3\n                         Bob: [3,2,1] -> s2=3, p2=1 -> then condition: p1-1=2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n                Then we never recorded 4? \n\n            How do we record 4? \n                We note: when we have p1=2 and p2=1, that means Alice has eaten [0,1] and Bob has eaten [3,2]. Then the total candies eaten is 4. \n                How do we get that state? \n                    We start: \n                      s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? \n                      Then we move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition holds.\n                      Then we move Bob: s2=1, p2=3 -> condition holds.\n                      Then we are at s1=1, s2=1 -> record 1? \n                      Then we move Alice: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition holds.\n                      Then we move Bob: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition holds.\n                      Then we are at s1=2, s2=2 -> record 3? \n                      Then we move Alice: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true? \n                      Then we have s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move Bob: s2=3, p2=1 -> condition: 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n                We never had the state: s1=2, s2=2 with p1=2 and p2=1? \n\n            Actually, the state we want: \n                Alice has eaten [0,1] -> s1=2, p1=2 (meaning the next available for Alice is index2)\n                Bob has eaten [3,2] -> s2=2, p2=1 (meaning the next available for Bob is index1) -> but note: the candy at index2 and index1 are not eaten? \n\n            How do we represent that? \n                We are using two pointers: \n                  p1: the next candy that Alice is going to eat (if we are going to add) OR the number of candies Alice has eaten is p1 (if we consider that she has eaten from 0 to p1-1).\n                  p2: the next candy that Bob is going to eat (if we are going to add) OR the number of candies Bob has eaten is n-1-p2 (because he has eaten from p2+1 to n-1).\n\n            So when p1=2 and p2=1, the total candies = 2 (from Alice) + (n-1-1) = 2 + (4-2)=2+2=4? \n                But wait: n-1-p2 = 4-1-1 = 2 -> so total=2+2=4.\n\n            How do we get that state? \n                We start: \n                  p1=0, p2=3 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record candidate: 0 + (4-1-3)=0 -> then we move both? \n                  Then we move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition: 0<=3 -> true.\n                  Then we move Bob: s2=1, p2=2 -> condition:0<=2 -> true.\n                  Then we have s1=1, s2=1 -> record: p1=1, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=2.\n                  Then we move Alice: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                  Then we move Bob: s2=2, p2=1 -> condition:1<=1 -> true.\n                  Then we have s1=2, s2=2 -> record: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-1=2 -> total=4.\n\n            So we need to do: \n                if s1 == s2:\n                    candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    l2.append(candidate)\n                    # Then we move the left? and then the right? But note: we are in a while loop, so we can break the equality by moving one? and then the next iteration will move the other? \n                    # But we can also do: \n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                    # and then we break the equality? Then the next iteration will handle the right? \n                But the example: \n                    Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                    Then we check: s1==s2? 1==0 -> no. Then we check: s1>s2 -> so we move right: s2=1, p2=3? -> but wait, the array is [1,1,1,1] and we are at p2 initially 3? \n                    Then we have s1=1, s2=1 -> then we do the next iteration: \n                         condition: p1-1=0<=p2=3 -> true.\n                         then we check: s1==s2 -> true -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=4-1-3=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                         then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=3 -> true.\n                         then we check: s1=2, s2=1 -> then we move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                         then we check: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                         then we move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition:2<=2 -> true.\n                         then we check: s1=3, s2=2 -> then we move right: s2=3, p2=1 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n                We missed the state p1=2 and p2=1? \n\n            How about we do not move in the equal case? Then we break? But we have to move to avoid infinite loop? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    l2.append(candidate)\n                    # We move the left? \n                    if p1 <= p2:   # we still have candy to move?\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n                But then the next step we will have s1>s2? Then we move the right? \n\n            But the example [1,1,1,1]:\n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=0 -> we move right: s2=1, p2=3 -> condition:0<=3 -> true? \n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                Then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=1 -> move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then we move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition:2<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=3, s2=2 -> move right: s2=3, p2=1 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n            We still miss 4.\n\n            How about we move the right in the equal case? \n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> move right: s2=1, p2=3 -> condition: -1<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=0, s2=1 -> move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                Then move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:0<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=2 -> move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then move right: s2=3, p2=1 -> condition:1<=1 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=3 -> move left: s1=3, p1=3 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n            Still 3.\n\n            How about we move both in the equal case? \n                Step0: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then move both: s1=1, p1=1; s2=1, p2=3 -> condition:0<=3 -> true.\n                Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> candidate: p1=1, n-1-p2=0 -> total=1 -> record 1.\n                Then move both: s1=2, p1=2; s2=2, p2=2 -> condition:1<=2 -> true.\n                Then: s1=2, s2=2 -> candidate: p1=2, n-1-p2=1 -> total=3 -> record 3.\n                Then move both: s1=3, p1=3; s2=3, p2=1 -> condition:2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n            Still 3.\n\n            How do we get the state (p1=2, p2=1) with s1=2, s2=2? \n                We need to have:\n                  Alice has eaten [0,1] -> so p1=2 (next available is index2)\n                  Bob has eaten [3,2] -> so p2=1 (next available is index1) -> but note: we moved Bob from 3 to 2 to 1? \n\n            How about we change the order? \n                We start: \n                  s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then condition holds.\n                  Then we are at: s1=1, s2=0 -> then we move right: s2=1, p2=3 -> then condition holds.\n                  Then we are at: s1=1, s2=1 -> record 1 -> then we move right: s2=2, p2=2 -> then condition holds.\n                  Then we are at: s1=1, s2=2 -> then we move left: s1=2, p1=2 -> then condition holds.\n                  Then we are at: s1=2, s2=2 -> record: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3? \n                  But wait: Bob has eaten two candies: from index3 and index2? so the next available is index1? so p2=1? \n                  How did we get p2=1? We did p2=3 -> then we did p2-=1 -> p2=2, then p2-=1 -> p2=1? \n\n            Actually, in the step after moving right the second time, we set p2=2? Then when we move left to p1=2, we then check: s1=2, s2=2 -> then we record: p1=2, n-1-p2=4-1-2=1 -> total=3.\n\n            But if we want to record 4, we need to record when p1=2 and p2=1? How do we get p2=1? \n                We must have moved the right pointer twice? \n\n            How about we do not record in the first equal case? We record only when we have moved both? \n\n            Alternatively, we can record the candidate at every equal state and then move the left? But then we break the equality? \n\n            But note: the problem says they can choose arbitrarily. We are not required to simulate in a fixed order. \n\n            Insight: we can use a two-pointer method that always moves the smaller sum? \n\n            The classic solution for this problem (which is known as \"Candies\" in Codeforces) is:\n\n                s1 = 0\n                s2 = 0\n                left = 0\n                right = n-1\n                ans = 0\n                while left <= right:\n                    if s1 < s2:\n                        s1 += w[left]\n                        left += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += w[right]\n                        right -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the count of candies Alice has eaten, and n-1-right is the count of candies Bob has eaten.\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But note: in the classic solution, we update the candidate only when s1==s2. And we break the tie by moving the left if s1<=s2? \n\n            However, the classic solution for the problem \"Candies\" (from a recent contest) is:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    l = 0\n                    r = n-1\n                    a = 0\n                    b = 0\n                    ans = 0\n                    while l <= r:\n                        if a <= b:\n                            a += arr[l]\n                            l += 1\n                        else:\n                            b += arr[r]\n                            r -= 1\n                        if a == b:\n                            ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                    print(ans)\n\n            Let me test with [1,1,1,1]:\n                l=0, r=3: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=1, l=1 -> then check a==b? 1==0 -> no.\n                l=1, r=3: a=1, b=0 -> a> b -> so b=1, r=2 -> then a==b? 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (4-1-2)=1+1=2.\n                l=1, r=2: a=1, b=1 -> a<=b -> a=2, l=2 -> then a==b? 2==1 -> no.\n                l=2, r=2: a=2, b=1 -> a> b -> b=2, r=1 -> then a==b? 2==2 -> ans = 2 + (4-1-1)=2+2=4.\n                l=2, r=1: break? because l<=r fails? \n                Then we print 4.\n\n            So the classic solution is:\n\n                while l<=r:\n                    if a <= b:\n                        a += arr[l]\n                        l += 1\n                    else:\n                        b += arr[r]\n                        r -= 1\n                    if a == b:\n                        ans = l + (n-1-r)\n\n            But note: the condition is a<=b, not a<b. \n\n            Now, let's look at the provided code:\n\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: \n                    if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            This is different. It has two separate ifs. And it does nothing in the equal case? \n\n            We can change the code to the classic solution? \n\n            But note: the condition in the while: (p1-1<=p2) -> which is p1<=p2+1. This is always true as long as p1<=p2+1, which is the same as p1-1<=p2. \n\n            However, the classic solution uses l<=r. \n\n            We can restructure the code:\n\n                l2 = []   # we don't need a list? we can just record the maximum candidate? \n                ans = 0\n                while p1 <= p2:   # we change the condition to p1<=p2? \n                    if s1 <= s2:   # then we move Alice? \n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        # record candidate: p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                # then we print ans? \n\n            But note: the problem says: the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do a while loop per test case.\n\n            However, the provided code prints l2[-1]? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                l2 = []   # we can remove this? or we can store the candidate in l2 and then take the last? \n                But note: we want the last candidate when they are equal? But it might be the maximum? \n\n            Actually, the candidate is updated every time they are equal. The last time they are equal might not be the maximum? \n\n            Example: [1,2,1] \n                We want to record 2? \n                Steps:\n                  p1=0, p2=2: s1=0, s2=0 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==0 -> no.\n                  p1=1, p2=2: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> so move Bob: s2=1, p2=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2.\n                  Then p1=1, p2=1: we break? \n                Then we print 2.\n\n            But what if we have [1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n                We want to record 6? \n                Steps:\n                  p1=0, p2=5: s1=0<=s2=0 -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> not equal.\n                  p1=1, p2=5: s1=1<=s2=0? no -> move Bob: s2=1, p2=4 -> equal: ans = 1 + (6-1-4)=1+1=2.\n                  p1=1, p2=4: s1=1<=s2=1 -> move Alice: s1=2, p1=2 -> not equal.\n                  p1=2, p2=4: s1=2>s2=1 -> move Bob: s2=2, p2=3 -> equal: ans = 2 + (6-1-3)=2+2=4.\n                  p1=2, p2=3: s1=2<=s2=2 -> move Alice: s1=3, p1=3 -> not equal.\n                  p1=3, p2=3: s1=3>s2=2 -> move Bob: s2=3, p2=2 -> equal: ans = 3 + (6-1-2)=3+3=6.\n                  Then break: p1=3, p2=2 -> p1>p2 -> break.\n\n                Then we print 6.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                ans = 0\n                while p1 <= p2:\n                    if s1 <= s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies, Bob has eaten (n-1-p2) candies.\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But note: the problem says that the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so this while loop is O(n) per test case and overall O(200000) which is acceptable.\n\n            However, the provided code has a while condition (p1-1<=p2). We can change it to p1<=p2? \n\n            But the problem: the condition in the provided code is (p1-1<=p2). We can change it to p1<=p2? \n\n            Let me test with [1,2,1] using the classic method and condition p1<=p2:\n\n                p1=0, p2=2: 0<=2 -> true.\n                  s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> true: s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==0 -> no.\n                p1=1, p2=2: 1<=2 -> true.\n                  s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> move Bob: s2=1, p2=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> ans=1+(3-1-1)=2.\n                p1=1, p2=1: 1<=1 -> true.\n                  s1=1, s2=1 -> s1<=s2 -> move Alice: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then check: 3==1 -> no.\n                p1=2, p2=1: 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n                Then we print 2.\n\n            But what if we don't change the condition? \n\n            We can also keep the condition as (p1-1<=p2) and use the classic method? \n\n            However, the condition (p1-1<=p2) is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. This is a bit looser. \n\n            In the classic method, we break when p1>p2. But with the condition p1-1<=p2, we break when p1-1>p2 -> which is p1>p2+1. \n\n            That might allow one extra step? \n\n            Example: [1,2,1] with the classic method and condition p1<=p2+1:\n\n                p1=0, p2=2: 0-1=-1<=2 -> true.\n                  s1<=s2: true -> s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                p1=1, p2=2: 0<=2 -> true.\n                  s1=1>s2=0 -> move Bob: s2=1, p2=1 -> then check: 1==1 -> ans=1+(3-1-1)=2.\n                p1=1, p2=1: 0<=1 -> true.\n                  s1=1<=s2=1 -> move Alice: s1=3, p1=2 -> then check: 3==1 -> no.\n                p1=2, p2=1: 1<=1 -> true? because 2-1=1<=1 -> true.\n                  Now: s1=3, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> move Bob: but p2=1, we move to p2=0? s2=1+l[0]? -> but wait, the array is [1,2,1] and Bob is at index1? then we move to index0? \n                  s2=1+? the candy at index0? but Alice already ate index0? \n\n            This is a problem: we cannot eat the same candy. \n\n            So we must break when p1>p2? \n\n            Therefore, we change the condition to p1<=p2? \n\n            We'll change the condition to p1<=p2.\n\n            So the code for program1.py:\n\n                I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                    n=I()[0]\n                    l=I()\n                    # l2=[]   # we don't need a list? we'll record the candidate in a variable.\n                    s1,s2=0,0\n                    p1,p2=0,n-1\n                    ans=0\n                    while p1<=p2:\n                        if s1<=s2:\n                            s1+=l[p1]\n                            p1+=1\n                        else:\n                            s2+=l[p2]\n                            p2-=1\n                        if s1==s2:\n                            ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    print(ans)\n\n            Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n                Example 1: [1,2,1] -> n=3, l=[1,2,1]\n                    p1=0, p2=2: s1=0<=s2=0 -> s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1!=s2 -> no update.\n                    p1=1, p2=2: s1=1>s2=0 -> s2=1, p2=1 -> then s1==s2 -> ans=1+(3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then break? no, we continue? \n                    Then p1=1, p2=1: now we do the loop: \n                         s1=1<=s2=1 -> s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then s1=3, s2=1 -> not equal -> then p1=2, p2=1: p1>p2 -> break.\n                    So we print 2.\n\n                Example 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8, the example says answer=7.\n                    How? \n                      Alice: [7,3,20] -> total=30\n                      Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> total=30\n                      Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n                    How does the algorithm do?\n                      We start: p1=0, p2=7: s1=0, s2=0 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=7, p1=1 -> not equal.\n                      p1=1, p2=7: s1=7, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1, p2=6 -> not equal? 7 vs 1.\n                      p1=1, p2=6: s1=7, s2=1 -> s1>s2 -> s2=1+11=12, p2=5 -> not equal? 7 vs 12.\n                      p1=1, p2=5: s1=7, s2=12 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=7+3=10, p1=2 -> not equal? 10 vs 12.\n                      p1=2, p2=5: s1=10, s2=12 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=10+20=30, p1=3 -> not equal? 30 vs 12.\n                      p1=3, p2=5: s1=30, s2=12 -> s1>s2 -> s2=12+8=20, p2=4 -> not equal? 30 vs 20.\n                      p1=3, p2=4: s1=30, s2=20 -> s1>s2 -> s2=20+10=30, p2=3 -> then s1==s2 -> ans=3+(8-1-3)=3+4=7.\n                      Then p1=3, p2=3: we break? because p1<=p2 -> true, then:\n                         s1=30, s2=30 -> s1<=s2 -> s1=30+l[3]=30+5=35, p1=4 -> then p1=4, p2=3: p1>p2 -> break? \n                      Then we print 7.\n\n                Example 3: [0]? \n                    p1=0, p2=0: s1=0<=s2=0 -> s1=0, p1=1 -> then check: s1==s2? 0==0 -> ans=1+(1-1-0)=1+0=1? \n                    But the problem: they cannot eat the same candy? \n                    Actually, the candy is only one. They cannot both eat it. \n                    But note: the problem says: Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. \n                    So they cannot both eat the same candy. \n                    In this case, the candy is at index0. Alice eats it? Then Bob has nothing to eat? \n                    But the condition: they want to be fair -> same total weight. \n                    Alice: 0, Bob: 0 -> but they haven't eaten the candy? \n                    If Alice eats the candy, then she has 0, Bob has 0? \n                    But Bob hasn't eaten any candy. \n                    So the total candies eaten: Alice ate 1, Bob ate 0? \n                    But the condition: they must have the same total weight? \n                    Alice:0, Bob:0 -> same. \n                    So they can do: Alice eats the candy (which is 0) and Bob eats nothing? \n                    Then total candies=1? \n\n                    However, the problem: the candy is 0. \n                    But the problem says: they eat in a row. Alice can eat any number from the left (but she must eat contiguous from the left). She can choose to eat the first 0? \n                    Then Bob eats nothing? \n\n                    But the problem: the example says for the third test case: there is no way to eat the same non-zero weight -> answer 0. \n                    But here the weight is 0? \n\n                    The problem says: they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\n\n                    The total weight is 0, which is the same. \n\n                    But note: the example third test case: \n                        Input: [1] -> n=1, [1] -> then Alice can eat the candy? then she has 1, Bob has 0 -> not equal. \n                        Or Alice doesn't eat, Bob doesn't eat -> then both 0 -> but then they eat 0 candies? \n                        The problem: they can choose to eat or not? \n                        The problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats in a row). \n                        So if she eats, she must start at the left and eat contiguous. \n                        For [1]: \n                            Alice can eat 0 candies -> then Bob can eat 0 candies -> total 0 candies, and both have 0.\n                            Or Alice can eat 1 candy -> then Bob has 0 candies -> 1 vs 0 -> not equal.\n\n                        So the answer is 0.\n\n                    Therefore, for [0]: \n                        Alice can eat 0 candies -> Bob eats 0 -> total 0.\n                        Or Alice can eat 1 candy: then she gets 0, Bob has 0 (because Bob eats 0 candies) -> then they have the same total weight? \n                        And total candies=1.\n\n                    So the answer for [0] should be 1.\n\n                    But our algorithm: \n                        p1=0, p2=0: s1=0<=s2=0 -> s1=0, p1=1 -> then check: s1=0, s2=0 -> equal -> ans=1+(1-1-0)=1+0=1.\n                    Then we break? because p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2 -> break.\n\n                Example 4: [0,0] -> \n                    p1=0, p2=1: s1=0<=s2=0 -> s1=0, p1=1 -> then check: s1=0, s2=0 -> ans=1+(2-1-1)=1+0=1.\n                    Then p1=1, p2=1: s1=0<=s2=0 -> s1=0, p1=2 -> then check: s1=0, s2=0 -> ans=2+(2-1-1)=2+0=2.\n                    Then p1=2, p2=1: break -> print 2.\n\n                Example 5: [1,0] -> \n                    p1=0, p2=1: s1=1<=s2=0? no -> s2=0, p2=0 -> then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n                    Then p1=0, p2=0: s1=1<=s2=0? no -> s2=0+l[0]=1? -> but wait, Bob is at index0? \n                    But the array: [1,0] -> Bob at index0: the candy is 1? \n                    Then s2=0+1=1, p2=-1 -> then check: s1=1, s2=1 -> ans=0+(2-1-(-1))? -> n-1-p2 = 2-1-(-1)=2? -> total=0+2=2? \n                    But they ate the same candy? \n\n                    How did we get p2=-1? \n                    We started: \n                      p1=0, p2=1: we moved Bob: s2=0 (from the candy at index1) and then p2=0? \n                      Then we are at p1=0, p2=0: then we move Bob again: s2=0+l[0]=1, p2=-1.\n\n                    But the candy at index0 was not eaten by Alice? So Bob can eat it? \n\n                    However, the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. \n                    But in our simulation, we have:\n                      Alice: hasn't eaten any? (p1=0) -> so she hasn't taken the left candy.\n                      Bob: ate the candy at index1 (0) and then the candy at index0 (1) -> total=1.\n\n                    Then Alice has 0, Bob has 1? \n\n                    But we set s1=1? \n\n                    Actually, in the first step: \n                      p1=0, p2=1: we did not move Alice? we moved Bob: s2=0 (from the candy at index1) and p2=0.\n                    Then in the next step: \n                      p1=0, p2=0: we moved Bob again: s2=0+l[0]=1, p2=-1.\n\n                    But Bob is only allowed to eat from the right? He ate the last candy (index1) and then the next candy from the right is index0? \n                    But after he ate index1, the next candy from the right is index0? \n\n                    The problem: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right, but he can't skip candies. So he must eat contiguous from the right. \n                    So he can eat the last candy (index1) and then the next one (index0) without skipping? \n\n                    But note: the candies are in a row. After Bob eats the last candy (index1), the new last candy is index0. \n\n                    So it's allowed.\n\n                    Then they have: \n                      Alice: nothing -> 0\n                      Bob: [1,0] -> 1+0=1? \n                    But wait: Bob ate the candy at index1 (which is 0) and then the candy at index0 (which is 1) -> total=1.\n\n                    Then we set s1=1? How? \n\n                    Actually, we set s1=1 in the first step? \n\n                    Let me re-simulate:\n\n                      Initially: s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=1.\n                      Step1: s1=0, s2=0 -> s1<=s2 -> true? -> then we move Alice: s1=0+l[0]=1, p1=1.\n                      Then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n                      Then p1=1, p2=1: we do the loop: \n                         s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> move Bob: s2=0+l[1]=0, p2=0.\n                         then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n                      Then p1=1, p2=0: \n                         s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> move Bob: s2=0+l[0]=1, p2=-1.\n                         then check: s1=1, s2=1 -> ans=1+(2-1-(-1))=1+(2-1+1)=1+2=3? \n                      Then we break? \n\n                    But they ate: \n                      Alice: [0] -> candy0: weight1 -> total=1.\n                      Bob: [1] (candy1: weight0) and then [0] (candy0: weight1) -> total=1.\n                      Total candies=3? but there are only 2 candies.\n\n                    This is impossible.\n\n            Therefore, we must not allow Bob to eat a candy that is to the left of Alice's last eaten candy? \n\n            The algorithm: we are using two pointers that move inward. When p1 becomes greater than p2, we break. \n\n            In the step: \n                p1=1, p2=0: we break? because p1>p2? \n                But in the condition: while p1<=p2: -> p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 is false -> we break.\n\n            So we don't do the last step? \n\n            Correction:\n\n                After the first step: \n                  p1=1, p2=1: we do the loop: \n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> we move Bob: s2=0, p2=0 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal -> then we break the loop? because next iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> 1<=0 false -> break.\n\n            So we never get to the state p2=-1.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm for [1,0] does not record any candidate? \n\n            But we must record when they are equal? \n\n            In the step: \n                After moving Bob to p2=0: we did not check for equality? \n                Then we break? \n\n            How about we check after every move? \n\n            In the step: \n                p1=1, p2=1: \n                  we move Bob: s2=0, p2=0 -> then we check: s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal -> then we break the loop? \n                Then we print the last candidate? which was not set? \n\n            We initialized ans=0. So we print 0.\n\n            For [1,0]: \n                Alice: \n                  Option1: eat 0 candies -> Bob can eat 0 candies -> total=0, and both 0.\n                Option2: eat the first candy: then she has 1, Bob has 0 -> not equal.\n                Option3: eat both? but she must eat contiguous from the left: she eats [1,0] -> total=1, then Bob has 0 -> not equal.\n                Bob: \n                  Option: Bob can eat the last candy (0) -> then Bob has 0, Alice has 0 (if she eats nothing) -> total=1? \n                But note: if Alice eats nothing and Bob eats the last candy (which is 0), then both have 0 -> valid. Total candies=1.\n\n            How do we get 1? \n                We start: \n                  p1=0, p2=1: \n                    s1=0<=s2=0 -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                  Then p1=1, p2=1: \n                    s1=1>s2=0 -> move Bob: s2=0, p2=0 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                  Then break.\n\n            But we never recorded the state when Alice has eaten 0 and Bob has eaten 1? \n\n            How do we record that? \n                We start: \n                  s1=0, s2=0 -> we can record that? \n                Then we move Alice: we break the state.\n\n            We can record at the beginning? \n\n            How about we record at the beginning? \n\n            We can set: \n                if s1==s2: record candidate.\n\n            Then initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0+ (n-1- (n-1)) = 0+0=0.\n\n            Then we move? \n\n            But we want to record 1? \n\n            How about we record every time we have an equality? \n\n            In the step after moving Bob: \n                s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n\n            But note: the state (Alice:0, Bob:1) is represented by: \n                Alice has eaten 0 candies -> p1=0\n                Bob has eaten 1 candy -> p2=0 (because the next available for Bob is index0, meaning he has eaten from index1 to n-1? which is one candy? \n                Then total candies = p1 (0) + (n-1-p2) = 0 + (2-1-0)=1? \n\n            How do we get that state? \n                We start: \n                  p1=0, p2=1: \n                    we can choose to move Bob first? \n                But our algorithm: \n                  if s1<=s2: then move Alice? \n\n            We can change the order? \n\n            But the algorithm: \n                if s1<=s2: move Alice\n                else: move Bob\n\n            Initially: s1=0<=s2=0 -> move Alice.\n\n            How about we do not move Alice? \n\n            The problem: we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. \n\n            But the algorithm is greedy: it always moves the smaller one? \n\n            However, the state (0,1) is not achieved? \n\n            How about we record the candidate at every step? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                if s1==s2:\n                    candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    if candidate > ans: ans = candidate\n\n            Then we do the moves.\n\n            But initially: we have candidate=0.\n\n            Then we move Alice: then we get s1=1, s2=0 -> then we move Bob: s2=0, p2=0 -> then we break? \n\n            Then we print 0.\n\n            But the answer should be 1.\n\n            How do we get 1? \n                We must record the state when Alice has eaten 0 and Bob has eaten 1? \n                That state: \n                    p1=0 (Alice has eaten 0 candies) \n                    p2=0 (Bob has eaten from index1 to the end? which is one candy? because the next available for Bob is index0, meaning he has eaten the candy at index1? \n                Then total = 0 + (2-1-0)=1.\n\n            How do we get that state in the algorithm? \n                We start: \n                  p1=0, p2=1: \n                    we can move Bob: \n                      if we move Bob: then s2=0, p2=0 -> then we have s1=0, s2=0? -> no, s1=0, s2=0? \n                But after moving Bob: \n                  s1=0, s2=0? -> then we record candidate: p1=0, n-1-p2=2-1-0=1? -> total=1.\n\n            So we need to move Bob first? \n\n            But the condition: s1<=s2 -> 0<=0 -> true -> so we move Alice? \n\n            How about we change the condition to s1 < s2 for moving Bob? and if equal, we can move either? \n\n            But the classic solution moves Alice if s1<=s2.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                while p1<=p2:\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the candidate at this state\n                    if s1 <= s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n\n            Then for [1,0]:\n                p1=0, p2=1: \n                  s1=0, s2=0 -> record ans=0+(2-1-1)=0?

\n                Then we print the last recorded ans? which is 0.\n\n            But we never recorded the state after moving Bob to p2=0? \n\n            How about we record after the move? \n\n            The classic solution records after the move.\n\n            We can try the classic solution that records after the move:\n\n                while p1<=p2:\n                    if s1<=s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1==s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n                Then for [1,0]:\n                    p1=0, p2=1: \n                      s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                    p1=1, p2=1: \n                      s1=1>s2=0 -> move Bob: s2=0, p2=0 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                    p1=1, p2=0: break? \n                    then print ans? but we never set ans? so it prints 0.\n\n            But the answer should be 1.\n\n            How do we get the state (0,0) for (p1, p2)? \n                p1=0: means Alice has eaten 0 candies.\n                p2=0: means Bob has eaten from index1 to the end? which is one candy? \n                then total = 0 + (2-1-0)=1.\n\n            But in the algorithm, we never have s1 and s2 both 0 after the first move? \n\n            We can record the initial state? \n\n            We can initialize ans=0, and then if we never find an equal state, we print 0, which is valid for the case where they eat 0 candies.\n\n            But the state (0,0) is the initial state, and we did record it? \n\n            How about we set ans=0 before the loop, and then if we find an equal state, we update ans.\n\n            In the initial state: \n                s1=0, s2=0 -> then we move Alice: then after the move, we don't have the initial state anymore.\n\n            How about we record before moving?

\n\n            How about we do the check after the move inside the loop? \n\n            The classic solution does the check after every move.\n\n            But in the second move: \n                After moving Bob: we are at p1=1, p2=0 -> then we break the loop? and we don't check.\n\n            We can do the check even if we break the loop? \n\n            How about we do the check after the move, even if it is the last move? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                while p1<=p2:\n                    if s1<=s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1==s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    # and then we do the next iteration only if p1<=p2\n\n            In [1,0]:\n                Iteration1:\n                  s1<=s2 -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                  then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                Iteration2:\n                  p1=1<=p2=1 -> true.\n                  s1=1>s2=0 -> move Bob: s2=0, p2=0.\n                  then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                Then we break? \n\n            But after the second move, we have the state: \n                Alice: has eaten one candy: p1=1 (so she has eaten index0)\n                Bob: has eaten one candy: p2=0 (so he has eaten index1)\n                then total candies = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2? \n                but wait, there are only two candies, and they are both eaten? \n                then s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n\n            So the state is not equal.\n\n            How do we achieve the state where Alice has eaten 0 and Bob has eaten 1? \n                That state: \n                    Alice: 0 candies -> s1=0\n                    Bob: 1 candy (index1) -> s2=0\n                then they are equal.\n\n            We can only achieve that state if we move Bob first? \n\n            But the algorithm condition: initially s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> so we move Alice.\n\n            How about we change the condition to: \n                if s1 < s2: \n                    move Alice\n                else if s2 < s1:\n                    move Bob\n                else: \n                    # s1==s2, we can move either? but we choose to move the one that allows more candies? \n                    # or we can move Alice or Bob arbitrarily.\n                    # to achieve the state (0,1), we need to move Bob first.\n                    # but the problem: we want to maximize the total candies, so we should try to move in a way that allows more candies? \n                    # or we can try both? \n\n            This is complex.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note that the state (0,1) is represented by p1=0 and p2=0? \n                total = 0 + (n-1-0)= n-1.\n            In [1,0]: n=2, so 0+ (2-1-0)=1.\n\n            How do we get p1=0 and p2=0 with s1=0 and s2=0? \n                We can get it by not moving Alice and moving Bob to eat the last candy? \n                But in the algorithm, we move in the while loop. \n\n            We can try to do an extra check after the loop for the state (p1, p2) with s1 and s2? \n\n            But after the loop, we have moved and the sums might be equal? \n\n            For [1,0]:\n                After the loop: \n                  p1=1, p2=0: we break.\n                  s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n\n            How about we do a final check after the loop? \n                if s1==s2:\n                    ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n            But in [1,0] it's not equal.\n\n            How about we consider intermediate states? \n\n            Given the complexity, and the fact that the classic solution passed in Codeforces for the problem, I think the intended solution is the classic one.\n\n            And the example provided in the note: \n                For the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7, and we got it.\n\n            For the third test case: [1] -> \n                p1=0, p2=0: \n                  s1<=s2 (0<=0) -> move Alice: s1=1, p1=1 -> then check: 1==0 -> no.\n                then break? \n                print 0.\n\n            For the first test case: [1,2,1] -> we got 2.\n\n            For the second test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> we got 7? but the example says answer=6 for the second test case? \n\n            Let me read the notes:\n\n                For the second test case: \n                    Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). \n                    They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6.\n\n            But wait: the example says: \n                Input: \n                    t=?\n                    n=8\n                    [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n\n                Alice: [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20=30\n                Bob: [1,11,8] -> 1+11+8=20 -> not 30.\n\n            The example says: Bob will eat the first three candies from the right: \n                from the right: first is 1, then 11, then 8 -> 1+11+8=20.\n\n            But the example says they both have 7? \n\n            Let me reread: \n                \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up.\n\n            Actually, the example in the problem statement says:\n\n                For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). \n\n            How can the first three from the left be 7? \n                [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20=30, not 7.\n\n            And the first three from the right: [11,8,10]? -> 11+8+10=29, not 7.\n\n            There is a note: \n                For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30.\n\n            So the second test case must be different.\n\n            The example says: \n                For the second test case: n=3, [1,2,1] -> answer=2.\n\n                For the second test case: answer=6 -> so n=6? \n\n            The example says: \n                \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n            So the array must be of length 6: \n                Let me assume: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> \n                    Alice: [1,2,3] = 6\n                    Bob: [1,2,3] = 6\n                or [2,3,2,2,3,2] -> \n                    Alice: [2,3,2] = 7\n                    Bob: [2,3,2] = 7\n\n            So the array might be [2,3,2,2,3,2] -> \n                n=6, and the weights: [2,3,2,2,3,2]\n\n            Let me simulate:\n                p1=0, p2=5: \n                  s1=0<=s2=0 -> move Alice: s1=2, p1=1 -> not equal.\n                p1=1, p2=5: s1=2<=s2=0? no -> move Bob: s2=2, p2=4 -> not equal.\n                p1=1, p2=4: s1=2<=s2=2 -> move Alice: s1=2+3=5, p1=2 -> not equal.\n                p1=2, p2=4: s1=5>s2=2 -> move Bob: s2=2+3=5, p2=3 -> equal: ans=2+(6-1-3)=2+2=4.\n                p1=2, p2=3: \n                  s1=5<=s2=5 -> move Alice: s1=5+2=7, p1=3 -> not equal.\n                p1=3, p2=3: \n                  s1=7>s2=5 -> move Bob: s2=5+2=7, p2=2 -> equal: ans=3+(6-1-2)=3+3=6.\n                then break: p1=3, p2=2 -> p1>p2 -> break.\n                print 6.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            Therefore, the solution for program1.py is to use the classic method.\n\n            We'll change the code to:\n\n                I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                    n = I()[0]\n                    l = I()\n                    s1, s2 = 0, 0\n                    p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n                    ans = 0\n                    while p1 <= p2:\n                        if s1 <= s2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n                        if s1 == s2:\n                            ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    print(ans)\n\n            But note: the condition in the while is now p1<=p2.\n\n            We are not using l2 anymore.\n\n            Now, for program2.py:\n\n                Description: Given a rating, output the division.\n\n                The divisions:\n                  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n                  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n                  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n                  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n                Input: t test cases, each with one integer rating.\n\n                Output: for each test case, output \"Division X\", where X is 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    for _ in range(int(input())):\n                        rating = int(input().strip())\n                        if rating >= 1900:\n                            print(\"Division 1\")\n                        elif rating >= 1600:\n                            print(\"Division 2\")\n                        elif rating >= 1400:\n                            print(\"Division 3\")\n                        else:\n                            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n                But note: the divisions are defined with upper bounds for division2 and division3.\n\n                However, the conditions are:\n\n                  Division 1: 1900 <= rating\n                  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> so rating in [1600, 1899]\n                  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599 -> rating in [1400, 1599]\n                  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n                We can also do:\n\n                    if rating >= 1900:\n                        division = 1\n                    elif rating >= 1600:   #

So we can remove it.\n\n            Therefore, for program1.py, we replace from the line \"l2=[]\" to the end of the while loop and the print with the new code.\n\n            So the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                ans=0\n                while p1<=p2:\n                    if s1<=s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1==s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                print(ans)\n\n            But wait, the provided code already has:\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n\n            So we don't need to repeat that? \n\n            The provided code has:\n\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n\n            We want to remove the l2=[] and then change the while loop and the print.\n\n            So the missing block might start from the while loop? \n\n            But the TODO is inside the while loop.\n\n            Alternatively, we can output the entire corrected block from the line after 'l=I()' to the end of the for loop for the test case.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are to fill in.\n\n            Since the provided code has some lines that are not missing, we must only output the part that is missing and that we are to complete.\n\n            But the TODO is in the while loop, and the while loop condition and body are given but not working.\n\n            We are replacing the while loop and the print.\n\n            How about we output for program1.py:\n\n                ans=0\n                while p1<=p2:\n                    if s1<=s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1==s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                print(ans)\n\n            But then we are not defining 'ans'? \n\n            We must define ans=0.\n\n            And we are changing the condition to p1<=p2.\n\n            And we are not using l2.\n\n            But the provided code has the variables s1,s2,p1,p2 already defined.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                We remove the existing while loop and the print, and replace with the above.\n\n            Therefore, the missing block for program1.py is the code from the while loop to the print, but we also need to define 'ans' and not use l2.\n\n            We can output:\n\n                ans = 0\n                while p1 <= p2:\n                    if s1 <= s2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                print(ans)\n\n            And for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                if rating >= 1900:\n                    print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif rating >= 1600:\n                    print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif rating >= 1400:\n                    print(\"Division 3\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"Division 4\")\n\n            But note: the provided program2.py has:\n\n                for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n                    # TODO: Your code here\r\n\n            So we need to fill in the TODO.\n\n            We output the code for the TODO.\n\n            Therefore, the final answer:\n\n                program1: \"ans = 0\\nwhile p1 <= p2:\\n    if s1 <= s2:\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\\n    else:\\n        s2 += l[p2]\\n        p2 -= 1\\n    if s1 == s2:\\n        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\nprint(ans)\"\n                program2: \"rating = int(input())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\n            But note: in program2, the input is read by input() in the for loop, and then we need to read the rating for each test case.\n\n            We can write: \n                rating = int(input().strip())   or just int(input())\n\n            We'll use: rating = int(input())\n\n            And the divisions are printed as strings.\n\n            We use the exact strings: \"Division 1\", etc.\n\n            Let me format as a JSON string.\n\n            We must escape the newlines and quotes.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write the string with triple quotes? But the problem says: output only the missing code, not markdown.\n\n            We'll output the string with \\n for newlines and \\\" for quotes.\n\n            But the problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\n\n            We are to output a JSON string.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                {\n                    \"program1\": \"ans = 0\\nwhile p1 <= p2:\\n    if s1 <= s2:\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\\n    else:\\n        s2 += l[p2]\\n        p2 -= 1\\n    if s1 == s2:\\n        ans = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\nprint(ans)\",\n                    \"program2\": \"rating = int(input())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n                }\n\n            But note: in program1, we have the variable 'l' which is the list of weights. And we have n.\n\n            We are using l[p1] and l[p2]. \n\n            And in the expression (n-1-p2).\n\n            This is as per the provided variable names.\n\n            We are good.\n\n            Let me test with the example [1,2,1] in program1:\n\n                n=3, l=[1,2,1]\n                s1=0, s2=0,"
