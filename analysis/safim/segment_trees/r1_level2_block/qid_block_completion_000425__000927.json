    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about determining if we can obtain an array `a` by performing operations that:\n   - Start with an array of zeros and a pointer at the first element.\n   - Operations: \n        1. If not at last element: increase current element by 1 and move to next.\n        2. If not at first element: decrease current element by 1 and move to previous.\n   - After all operations, the pointer must be at the first element.\n\n We note:\n   - The operations are reversible? Instead, we can think of the constraints.\n\n Important observations from known solutions to similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems like \"Array Restoration\" or \"Zero Array\"):\n\n Insight:\n   Let the operations be thought of as:\n        Operation 1: (forward) at position i: we do a_i = a_i + 1 and move to i+1.\n        Operation 2: (backward) at position i: we do a_i = a_i - 1 and move to i-1.\n\n   We start at index0 and end at index0.\n\n   Consider the effect of the operations as a sequence of moves. We can break the entire sequence into segments that go forward and backward.\n\n   However, note that the problem constraints and the fact that the total n over test cases is 200,000 suggests an O(n) solution.\n\n   Known solution approach for this problem (from similar problems on Codeforces, e.g., Round #782 (Div. 2) problem A) is:\n\n        We traverse the array from left to right, maintaining a variable `b` (which represents the \"balance\" of operations that have been started but not yet closed?).\n\n        Conditions:\n          1. The total sum of the array must be zero? (But note: the operations: each forward operation adds 1 to an element and then moves to next, and each backward operation subtracts 1 and moves to previous. However, note that the entire sequence must end at the first element. So the net effect: the first element is increased by the number of times we started a forward move and then eventually we have to come back? Actually, the entire process can be modeled as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0, and the moves are: right moves (which add 1 to the current and then move right) and left moves (which subtract 1 and then move left). \n\n        Actually, we can model the array as:\n          Let d[0] = a[0] (the starting element) and then for each step, the operations that pass through an element leave a net effect.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known solution:\n\n          b = 0\n          valid = True\n          for i in range(n):\n              b += a[i]\n              if b < 0:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if b == 0:\n                  # Then from i+1 to the end must be all zeros? Why?\n                  # Because if we have reached a point where the balance is zero, that means we have effectively closed all operations that started at the beginning? So the rest of the array must be zeros because we cannot have any more operations that start after this without breaking the balance?\n                  for j in range(i+1, n):\n                      if a[j] != 0:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  break\n\n          And then we also require that the total sum is zero? Actually, the condition at the end is: if valid and b==0? But note the break: we break when we first get b==0 and then check the rest.\n\n        However, the provided code has:\n            if v and sum(a)==0: print('YES') else 'NO'\n\n        But note: the example test case: \n            Example 1: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> but wait, the example in the note is: \n                <0,0,0,0> -> ... -> <2, -1, -1, 0> and then the pointer is at the first element? \n                However, the example output for the second test case is \"Yes\", but the example array is [2, -1, -1, 0] and the total sum is 0.\n\n        But the example in the note also says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so that test case is invalid? Actually, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\". So the first test case in the note (which is the second test case in the example) is valid.\n\n        The example test cases from the problem:\n\n          Input: \n            4\n            4\n            2 -1 -1 0\n            3\n            1 -2 0\n            3\n            0 0 1\n            2\n            0 1\n\n          Output:\n            Yes\n            No\n            No\n            No\n\n        How does the algorithm work?\n\n          For the first test case: [2, -1, -1, 0]\n            n=4, a = [2, -1, -1, 0]\n\n            We traverse:\n              i=0: b = 2 -> positive, not zero -> continue.\n              i=1: b = 2 + (-1) = 1 -> positive, not zero -> continue.\n              i=2: b = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> then we break and check the rest: from index3 to the end: only a[3]=0 -> so the inner loop does nothing? Then we break and then the condition: v is True and sum(a)=0? \n                    2 -1 -1 +0 = 0 -> so we print \"YES\".\n\n          But the example output is \"Yes\", so that matches.\n\n          Second test case: [1, -2, 0]\n            i0: b=1 -> continue.\n            i1: b=1-2 = -1 -> v becomes False -> break. Then we print \"NO\".\n\n          Third test case: [0,0,1]\n            i0: b=0 -> then we break and check the rest: from index1 to the end: [0,1] -> we see a[2]=1 !=0 -> set v=False and break the inner loop. Then we break the outer loop. Then condition: v is False -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n          Fourth test case: [0,1]\n            i0: b=0 -> then we check the rest: from index1: [1] -> which is not zero -> set v=False. Then we break. Then we print \"NO\".\n\n        However, note that the condition at the end: `if v and sum(a)==0: ...` \n          For the first test case: v is True and sum(a)==0 -> YES.\n          For the second: v becomes False -> NO.\n          For the third: v becomes False -> NO.\n          For the fourth: v becomes False -> NO.\n\n        But wait: what if we don't break in the outer loop? The break in the outer loop only happens when we hit a zero balance? What if we never hit a zero balance until the end?\n\n        Example: [1, -1] \n          i0: b=1 -> not zero -> continue.\n          i1: b=1-1=0 -> then we break and check the rest: there is no rest -> so v remains True. Then condition: v is True and sum(a)=0 -> YES.\n\n        But what about [1, -1, 1, -1]? \n          i0: b=1 -> continue.\n          i1: b=0 -> then we break and check the rest: [1,-1] -> which is not zero? So we set v=False? Then we output NO.\n\n        However, is [1,-1,1,-1] possible?\n\n          We start at index0: \n            Operation1: index0 becomes 1, move to index1.\n            Operation2: index1 becomes -1, move to index0 -> but then we are at index0? But we are not done because we have to get the array [1,-1,1,-1] and we haven't done the last two.\n\n          How to get the last two?\n            We are at index0. Then we do:\n              Operation1: index0 becomes 2, move to index1.\n              Operation1: index1 becomes 0, move to index2.\n              Operation1: index2 becomes 1, move to index3.\n              Then we are at index3. Now we have to get back to index0? \n                Operation2: index3 becomes 0, move to index2.\n                Operation2: index2 becomes 0, move to index1.\n                Operation2: index1 becomes -1, move to index0.\n\n          Then the array becomes [2, -1, 0, 0] -> not [1,-1,1,-1].\n\n          Alternatively, we might do:\n\n            Start: [0,0,0,0] at index0.\n            Operation1: [1,0,0,0] at index1.\n            Operation1: [1,1,0,0] at index2.\n            Operation2: [1,1,-1,0] at index1.\n            Operation1: [1,2,-1,0] at index2.\n            Operation1: [1,2,-1,1] at index3.\n            Operation2: [1,2,-1,0] at index2 -> then we have to get back? \n            Operation2: [1,2,-2,0] at index1 -> then Operation2: [1,1,-2,0] at index0.\n\n          This doesn't work.\n\n          Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if a[0] < 0:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n                total = 0\n                valid = True\n                for i in range(n):\n                    total += a[i]\n                    if total < 0:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    if total == 0:\n                        # then the rest must be zeros\n                        for j in range(i+1, n):\n                            if a[j] != 0:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                        break\n                if valid and total == 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n          But note: the example [1, -1, 1, -1] would be:\n            i0: total=1 -> continue.\n            i1: total=0 -> then we break and check the rest: [1,-1] -> non-zero -> set valid=False -> NO.\n\n          And indeed, it is impossible? Because the entire process must end at the first element, and the operations that go beyond the first segment of zeros would require that we leave the first element and then come back, but the balance condition must hold.\n\n        However, the problem states: the total n over test cases is 200,000, but the inner loop in the worst case might be O(n) and then the entire worst-case might be O(n^2) if we don't break the outer loop? But note: the inner loop only runs when we break the outer loop (because of the break after the inner loop). And the outer loop breaks when we first get total==0. So the entire loop runs at most 2*n? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so worst-case 200,000 test cases? Actually, the constraint says: the sum of n over test cases <= 200,000. So worst-case we have one test case with n=200,000. Then the inner loop in the worst-case scenario (when we break at the very end) would run 0 times? Actually, if we break at the end, then we don't run the inner loop? \n\n        But what if we never break? Then we run the outer loop for the entire array without breaking? Then we don't run the inner loop? So worst-case O(n) per test case, and total n<=200,000 -> acceptable.\n\n        However, the provided code has:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                b += a[i]\n                if b<0:\n                    v = False\n                    break\n                elif b==0:\n                    for j in range(i+1,n):\n                        if a[j] != 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                    break   # break the outer loop after the inner loop\n\n        The TODO part: if we find a non-zero in the rest, we set v=False and break the inner loop. Then we break the outer loop.\n\n        So the missing code in the inner loop is:\n\n            if a[j] != 0:\n                v = False\n                break\n\n        But note: the break in the inner loop will break the inner for-loop, then we break the outer for-loop (because of the break after the inner loop). So we set v=False and then break the inner, then break the outer.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        However, we must be cautious: we are already in the inner loop and we want to set the flag and break the inner loop, then the outer loop will break because of the 'break' after the inner loop.\n\n        So the code for program1.py's missing part is:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        But note: the example [0,0,1] would set v=False and break the inner loop, then break the outer loop. Then we check: v is False -> then we print \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        However, what if we have multiple segments? Actually, the condition is: once we get a zero balance at index i, then the rest of the array (from i+1 to the end) must be all zeros. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        But note: the code already has a break after the inner loop? So we break the inner loop and then the outer loop.\n\n        Now, what if we never break the outer loop? That is, we never get b==0? Then we go through the entire array without breaking. Then at the end, we check: if v and sum(a)==0.\n\n        However, note: if we never break, then we never set v to False in the inner loop, but we might have set v to False if we encountered a negative balance. Also, we require that the total sum is zero? Because the condition at the end: `if v and sum(a)==0`.\n\n        But note: the variable `b` at the end of the loop is the total sum? Because we added all the elements. So we can use `b` as the total sum? Actually, the condition at the end is `sum(a)==0`? But we are reading the entire array and then doing `sum(a)`, which is O(n). And we already did a loop that is O(n). But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so doing two passes (one for the loop and one for the sum) would be 400,000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can avoid the extra sum by using `b` at the end? Because we broke the loop only when we encountered a negative or when we encountered a zero and then checked the rest? But if we broke because of a negative, then we break and then we don't use the entire array. So we cannot use `b` as the total sum? \n\n        Actually, the condition at the end is: `if v and sum(a)==0: ...`\n\n        But if we broke the loop early, then we didn't compute the entire `b`. So we must compute the total sum separately? Or we can avoid it by noting:\n\n          If we broke because of a negative, then we don't care about the total sum? Because we already set v=False.\n\n          If we broke because we found a zero and then the rest is non-zero, then we set v=False and break, and then we don't need the total sum? \n\n          Only when we break because we found a zero and the rest is zeros, then we break and then we have the total sum? Actually, in that case, we broke at the first zero, but we haven't added the entire array? \n\n        Example: [1, -1, 0, 0] \n          i0: b=1 -> continue.\n          i1: b=0 -> then we break and check the rest: [0,0] -> so we set v remains True? Then we break the outer loop. Then we check: v is True and sum(a)=0? -> 1-1+0+0=0 -> YES.\n\n        But note: in the loop, we only added the first two elements? Then the variable `b` is 0. But the condition at the end uses `sum(a)`, which is 0. So it works.\n\n        However, if we break at the first zero, we haven't computed the entire `b`? But the condition at the end uses `sum(a)`, which is the entire array. So we are safe.\n\n        But what if we don't break? Then we have traversed the entire array and `b` is the total sum. Then we check: if v (which is True) and sum(a)==0? But we can avoid the extra sum by using `b`? Because we did:\n\n            for i in range(n): \n                b += a[i]\n\n          so at the end, b is the total sum.\n\n        Therefore, we can change the condition to: `if v and b==0: ...`\n\n        But the provided code uses `sum(a)==0`. Since the array `a` is the entire array, and we are breaking early, we must compute the entire array? Actually, we read the entire array. The problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so doing a sum for each test case that we didn't break early might be acceptable? But worst-case we break early only in some, and in others we do the entire loop? Then we do the entire loop and then we do a sum? That would be two passes? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the extra pass by storing the total sum in a variable? But the problem does not require that. We can leave it as is? \n\n        However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so even if we do two passes per test case, the total operations would be 400,000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the provided code already has `sum(a)`. So we leave it.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        But wait: the code already has:\n\n            elif b==0:\n                for j in range(i+1,n):\n                    if a[j] != 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                break   # break the outer loop\n\n        We need to set v to False and break the inner loop? Then the break in the inner loop will break the inner for-loop, and then we break the outer for-loop.\n\n        So the TODO part is two lines:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        But note: the inner break breaks the inner for-loop, then we break the outer for-loop (because of the break after the inner loop). So we set v=False and then break the inner, then break the outer.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the variable `v` is already defined as True at the beginning. We set it to False only when we find a non-zero in the rest.\n\n        This matches the logic.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  The problem: stamping two adjacent cells to be either BR or RB, and the stamp must fit entirely. We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. We start with all white (W) and want to achieve a given string of R, B, and W.\n\n  Known solution approach:\n\n      We note that the stamping operation always colors two adjacent cells as one R and one B. Therefore, the entire picture must be partitioned into segments of non-white cells that are of even length? Actually, no: because we can overlap.\n\n      Insight: \n        - The operation does not change the parity of the number of R and B? Actually, each operation adds one R and one B. So the entire picture must have the same number of R and B? But wait: we can cover a cell multiple times. Each time we cover a cell, we flip its color? \n\n        Actually, the operation is reversible? And we can model the problem as: we can assign to each stamping operation a pattern of BR or RB. But note that the same cell can be stamped multiple times. \n\n        Alternate approach: \n          We can split the string by 'W' (white cells). Each contiguous segment of non-white cells must be independently stampable.\n\n          Conditions for a contiguous segment of non-white cells (without any W in between):\n            - The segment must have even length? Why? Because each stamp covers two cells. But note: we can cover the same cell multiple times? Actually, the problem does not require that the entire segment is covered by non-overlapping stamps. We can have overlapping.\n\n          However, note: the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So the entire segment must be of even length? Actually, no: because we can cover a single cell multiple times? But the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So the entire segment must be contiguous and the operations can overlap arbitrarily. But the key is: the entire segment must be colorable by a sequence of operations that cover adjacent pairs.\n\n          Known solution from Codeforces (e.g., Round #784 (Div. 4) problem E) is:\n\n            We split the string by 'W'. For each segment (which is a contiguous string of non-white characters):\n                - If the segment is empty, skip.\n                - Otherwise, we check:\n                    * The segment must have at least one character? Actually, the split might give empty strings at the ends? \n                - Conditions:\n                    * If the segment has length 1 -> impossible? because we cannot stamp a single cell? \n                    * Also, if the segment has length>=2, then we require that the segment is not all the same? Actually, no: because we can have \"RR\" by:\n                         stamping the first two as RB? then stamping the first two again as BR? -> then the first becomes R (from R then B? actually, each stamping flips the color?).\n\n          Actually, the colors flip: \n            Initially: W -> then we stamp: becomes R and B? Then if we stamp again the same two, then the R becomes B and the B becomes R? \n\n          Therefore, the entire segment must be such that it is possible to form the pattern by a sequence of flips? \n\n          Alternate known solution:\n\n            We note that the entire picture must satisfy:\n              - The number of R and B in the entire picture must be such that ...? Actually, no: because we can have any number? \n\n          However, after splitting by 'W', we can check each segment:\n\n            Condition 1: the segment must have at least one element? Actually, if the segment is empty, we skip.\n\n            Condition 2: if the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n\n            Condition 3: if the segment has length>=2, then we require that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? Why? \n                Because if the entire segment is all 'R', then how? \n                  Example: \"RR\" -> \n                    We can do: \n                      Start: WW -> stamp the two: becomes RB? \n                      Then we stamp the same two again: becomes BR? \n                      Then again: becomes RB? \n                    We can never get RR.\n\n                Similarly, we cannot get all 'B'.\n\n            Therefore, for a segment, we require that it is not monochromatic? \n\n          But note: what about \"RBRB\" or \"BRBR\"? \n\n          Actually, we can get any pattern as long as the segment is non-empty and not monochromatic? \n\n          However, consider a segment of length 2: \n            \"RR\" -> impossible? \n            \"RB\" -> possible (one stamp).\n            \"BR\" -> possible (one stamp).\n            \"BB\" -> impossible.\n\n          So the condition: the segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          But note: what about a segment of length 3? \n            Example: \"RRB\" -> \n              We can do:\n                Step1: stamp the first two: becomes RB? -> then we have RBW -> but wait, we have three? \n                Actually, we can stamp the last two: \n                  Start: WWW -> \n                  Stamp the last two: becomes W and then RB? -> so we have W, R, B? -> but we want RRB? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Start: WWW\n            Stamp the first two: RBW -> then we have R, B, W.\n            Then stamp the first two again: BRW -> then we have B, R, W.\n            Then stamp the last two: B and then stamp the last two: becomes B, R, then stamp the last two: but the last two are R and W? -> we cannot stamp a W and a R? because the stamp must cover two adjacent non-white? Actually, we can stamp only if the two are adjacent? and we can stamp over a white? No, initially white, but after stamping we have non-white? \n\n          Actually, the problem states: the stamp must completely fit on the given n cells. And we can stamp multiple times on the same cell. The stamping operation: each usage recolors both cells that are under the stamp. So we can stamp on any two adjacent cells, regardless of their current color? \n\n          How does the color change? \n            The stamp has two colors: one R and one B. When we apply the stamp, it sets the two cells to the two colors (one R and one B) in the order of the stamp? \n\n          But note: the stamp can be applied in two ways: \n            Way1: left becomes R, right becomes B? \n            Way2: left becomes B, right becomes R?\n\n          And if we apply the stamp multiple times to the same cell, the color flips: \n            Example: a cell that is W: \n              First stamp (as the left in a BR stamp): becomes B? \n              Then if we stamp again as the left in a BR stamp: becomes R? \n              Then becomes B, then R, ... \n\n          Actually, the operation on a single cell: \n            Each time the cell is stamped, it flips: \n              W -> B (if stamped as the blue part) or R (if stamped as the red part)? \n            But note: the stamp always sets the two cells to a fixed pattern? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So it doesn't flip, it sets. \n\n          Therefore, we can set the two cells arbitrarily to either (R,B) or (B,R) regardless of the previous state? \n\n          Then the problem becomes: we can assign to each adjacent pair (i, i+1) a choice of either (R,B) or (B,R). And each cell can be covered by multiple pairs. The color we see at a cell is the last stamp that covered it.\n\n          But note: the operations can be done in any order? and the last stamp that covers a cell determines its color.\n\n          This is complex.\n\n        Known solution from Codeforces (from the same problem) is:\n\n          We split the string by 'W'. For each segment in the split:\n            if the segment is empty: skip.\n            else:\n                if the length of the segment is 1: then impossible -> return \"NO\" for the entire test case.\n                else:\n                    if the segment has only 'R' or only 'B': then impossible -> return \"NO\".\n            If we pass all segments, then \"YES\".\n\n        But note: what about a segment that has both R and B? Then it's possible.\n\n        However, consider a segment \"RBR\" (length 3): \n          We require that the segment has at least one R and one B -> it does. \n          But is it possible? \n            We can do:\n              Start: WWW\n              Stamp the first two: RBW -> then we have R, B, W.\n              Then stamp the last two: the second and third: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B? -> not RBR.\n\n          Alternatively:\n              Start: WWW\n              Stamp the last two: WRB -> then we have W, R, B.\n              Then stamp the first two: the first and second: set to BR? -> then we have B, R, B -> not RBR.\n\n          How to get RBR?\n            We can do:\n              Step1: stamp the first two: RBW -> [R, B, W]\n              Step2: stamp the second and third: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> [R, R, B] -> not RBR.\n\n          Alternatively, we can stamp the same pair multiple times? \n            Step1: stamp the first two: RBW -> [R, B, W]\n            Step2: stamp the first two again: BRW -> [B, R, W]\n            Step3: stamp the second and third: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> [B, R, B] -> not RBR.\n\n          It seems difficult.\n\n        Actually, known solution from Codeforces for problem \"Stamp\" (E. Stamp) in Round #784 (Div. 4) is:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              s = input().strip()\n              # Split by W\n              arr = s.split('W')\n              flag = True\n              for seg in arr:\n                  if seg == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(seg)==1:\n                      flag = False\n                      break\n                  # Check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B?\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      flag = False\n                      break\n              print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what about a segment \"RRB\"? \n          It has both R and B -> so it passes the condition? \n          But is it possible? \n\n        Actually, the known solution above was accepted in the contest? \n\n        However, there is a known counterexample? \n\n        The problem examples:\n\n          Example 5: \"RBB\" -> the example says: \n            n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> output \"YES\"?\n          But wait, the example in the note: \n            \"WWW\" -> then stamp the last two: \"WRB\" -> then stamp the first two: \"BRB\" -> which is not RBB.\n\n          Actually, the example in the note for the fifth test case: \n            \"WWW\" -> \"W RB\" (stamping the last two) -> then \"BRB\" (by stamping the first two as BR) -> so we get \"BRB\", but the example says the fifth test case is \"RBB\"? \n\n          The example says: \n            \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> BRB\"\n\n          But the example output for the fifth test case is \"RBB\"? Actually, the example input for the fifth test case is \"RBB\", but the example sequence produces \"BRB\". \n\n          Correction: the example says: \n            \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> BRB\"\n\n          and then the example says: \n            \"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> RBB\"\n\n          How? \n            Step1: WWW -> stamp the last two: so we get W and then RB -> so the string is \"WRB\"?\n            Step2: then stamp the first two: the first is W and the second is R -> we can stamp? \n            The stamp sets the two to either BR or RB? \n              If we use the stamp as RB: then the first becomes R, the second becomes B -> so we get R, B, B -> \"RBB\".\n\n          So the sixth test case is \"RBB\", and we can get it.\n\n          Therefore, the segment \"RBB\" is possible? \n\n          But note: the segment \"RBB\" has both R and B -> so the condition passes.\n\n          However, the known solution above would pass \"RBB\" because it has both R and B and length>=2? \n\n          But what about a segment of length 1? -> fails.\n\n          And a segment that is all R? -> fails.\n\n          So the known solution is:\n\n            flag = True\n            for seg in s.split('W'):\n                if seg == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    flag = False\n                    break\n\n          Then output \"YES\" if flag, else \"NO\".\n\n        Now, the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        How does this work?\n\n          The input: \n            The first line is t, then for each test case: \n                first line: n\n                second line: the string s\n\n          The code: \n            [*open(0)] reads all lines.\n            [2::2] takes every second line starting from index2 (0-indexed: the first line is index0, then the next two lines for the first test case: index1 and index2? Actually, the first test case: \n                line0: t\n                line1: n1\n                line2: s1\n                line3: n2\n                line4: s2\n                ... \n            So [2::2] takes the lines at index2, index4, ... which are the strings s.\n\n          Then for each s (which is a string including the newline), we do:\n\n            s[:-1] to remove the newline? Then split by 'W'.\n\n          Then we have a loop: for i in ... \n\n          Then we set a variable b? and then print: 'YNEOS'[b::2] -> this is a trick to print \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n            If b=0, then 'YNEOS'[0::2] = 'Y' then skip 2 -> 'Y' then 'E' then 'S'? -> [0::2] takes the characters at index0, index2 -> \"YE\" -> but wait, that would be \"YE\", not \"YES\".\n\n          Actually, the trick: \n            'YNEOS'[b::2] \n            If b=0: then it becomes 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> take every other character starting at 0: \n                index0: 'Y'\n                index2: 'E'\n                index4: 'S' -> but wait, the string is 'YNEOS' -> \n                    index0: 'Y'\n                    index1: 'N'\n                    index2: 'E'\n                    index3: 'O'\n                    index4: 'S'\n                So [0::2] -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\"?\n                Actually, no: in Python, stepping by 2: \n                    s = 'YNEOS'\n                    s[0::2] -> starts at 0, then 0+2=2, then 2+2=4 -> \"Y\", \"E\", \"S\" -> \"YES\"\n\n            If b=1: \n                s[1::2] -> starts at index1: 'N', then 1+2=3 -> 'O', then 5 -> out of bounds -> \"NO\"?\n\n          But \"NO\" is two letters: 'N' and 'O'? -> \"NO\". \n\n          So the trick: \n            if b=0 -> \"YES\"\n            if b=1 -> \"NO\"\n\n          How do we set b? \n\n          We start with b=0. Then we iterate over the segments. For each segment, if we find a segment that is invalid, we set b=1? \n\n          The code:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                # i is a segment (a string of non-W characters)\n\n          We need to check: \n            if the segment is empty: skip.\n            else if len(segment)==1 -> invalid, so set b=1 and break? \n            else if the segment has only 'R' or only 'B' -> invalid, set b=1 and break.\n\n          But note: we might have multiple segments. We can break as soon as we find one invalid segment.\n\n          So the code for the loop:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, note: the condition for a segment to be invalid is: \n            either length==1 OR (the segment does not contain at least one 'R' OR at least one 'B')? \n\n          Actually, the condition: \n            if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n            if the segment has length>=2 but is monochromatic (only R or only B) -> invalid.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            if len(seg)==1:\n                b=1\n                break\n            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:   # which means the segment is either all R or all B?\n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: if the segment is empty, we skip.\n\n          However, we can combine:\n\n            if seg != '' and (len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg): \n                b=1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg is equivalent to: the segment is not containing both R and B? Actually, it is equivalent to: the segment is either all R or all B? \n\n          However, if the segment is empty, we skip. So:\n\n            for seg in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if seg != '': \n                    if len(seg)==1:\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg: \n                        b=1\n                        break\n\n          But note: the condition 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg is not exactly \"the segment is monochromatic\". It could be that the segment has no R? then it's all B? or no B? then it's all R? \n\n          So that condition is correct.\n\n        However, what if we have a segment that is \"RRR\" (length>=2 and no B) -> invalid -> set b=1.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if seg != '':\n                if len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg is a bit tricky? \n          It is true if either there is no R OR there is no B? \n          So if the segment has no R -> then it's all B? -> invalid.\n          If the segment has no B -> then it's all R? -> invalid.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        However, we can write it as:\n\n            if seg and (len(seg)==1 or set(seg)=={'R'} or set(seg)=={'B'}):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n        But the condition with 'in' is efficient? because the segment can be long? but the total n over test cases is 100,000, and the split segments are parts of the entire string? and the entire string length is n, so the total over segments is n. And the condition 'R' not in seg: this is O(n) per segment? but the entire string is split, so the total length of all segments is n. So worst-case O(n) per test case? and the total n over test cases is 100,000 -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if seg != '':\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition can be written without parentheses? \n\n          if seg and (len(seg)==1 or 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg):\n\n        However, the condition: \n          (len(seg)==1) OR ('R' not in seg) OR ('B' not in seg)\n\n        This is true if any of the three holds. That is:\n          if the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n          or if the segment has no R -> invalid.\n          or if the segment has no B -> invalid.\n\n        But note: if the segment has no R and no B? Then it's empty? but we already skipped empty? Actually, we have seg non-empty. So if the segment has no R and no B? that cannot happen because the segment is non-white? and the only non-white are R and B? \n\n        Actually, the segment is split by 'W', so it only contains R and B? So if the segment is non-empty, then it must contain at least one R or one B? \n\n        Therefore, the condition \"if the segment has no R\" means it has only B? and \"if the segment has no B\" means it has only R? \n\n        So the condition is correct.\n\n        However, we can write:\n\n            if seg:   # non-empty\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg: \n          Example: seg = \"RRR\" -> 'R' not in seg? False, but 'B' not in seg? True -> so the condition is True -> invalid -> correct.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if seg:\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But we can break the condition into two if's? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if seg and (len(seg)==1 or set(seg) in [{'R'}, {'B'}]):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n        But the set(seg) might be O(n) per segment? and the total n is 100,000 -> worst-case 100,000 per test case? and the total n over test cases is 100,000 -> worst-case 100,000 test cases? Actually, the total n over test cases is 100,000, so worst-case one test case with n=100,000 -> then the set(seg) for one segment of 100,000 is O(100,000) and then we do one segment -> acceptable? \n\n        But the condition with 'in' and set is more expensive? \n\n        The condition with 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg is O(n) per segment? but we can break early: \n          'R' not in seg: we scan until we find an R? worst-case we scan the entire segment? \n          Similarly for 'B' not in seg.\n\n        But we can do:\n\n            hasR = 'R' in seg\n            hasB = 'B' in seg\n            if not (hasR and hasB):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n        Then we don't need the or condition? \n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n            if seg:\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                hasR = 'R' in seg\n                hasB = 'B' in seg\n                if not (hasR and hasB):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n        This is two passes? But the two passes (for 'R' and for 'B') are O(n) each? so total O(2n) per segment? and the entire string is n, so worst-case O(2n) per test case? acceptable.\n\n        However, we can do one pass? \n\n        But the provided code is for a contest and the constraints are acceptable.\n\n        But the problem says the total n over test cases is 100,000, so we can do:\n\n            if seg:\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n                if 'R' in seg and 'B' in seg:\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n        This is the same.\n\n        However, the original condition: \n            if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg)\n\n        We can write:\n\n            if len(seg)==1 or not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg):\n\n        So:\n\n            if seg and (len(seg)==1 or not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg)):\n                b=1\n                break\n\n        This is efficient? \n\n        We can break the condition: \n          if len(seg)==1: then we break.\n          else: we check if both R and B are present? if not, then break.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if seg:\n                if len(seg)==1 or not ('R' in seg and 'B' in seg):\n                    b=1\n                    break\n\n        This is one condition.\n\n        But note: the condition 'R' in seg and 'B' in seg is O(n) for the entire segment? \n\n        We'll use this.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i:   # i is the segment (the variable in the loop is i, but the split gives segments, and we named it seg? but the loop variable is i)\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the loop variable is `i` (as in `for i in ...`). So we use `i` for the segment.\n\n        So:\n\n            if i:   # non-empty string\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        This will break the inner loop (the for-loop over segments) as soon as we find one invalid segment.\n\n        Then the print statement: \n            print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        If we never break, then b remains 0 -> prints \"YES\".\n        If we break and set b=1, then prints \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition can be written without parentheses? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if i and (len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition `not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)` is equivalent to `'R' not in i or 'B' not in i`? by De Morgan.\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"v = False\\n            break\"\n            program2: \"if i:\\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                    b = 1\\n                    break\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code is in a single line? Actually, we have to write it as multiple lines? \n\n        The entire program2.py code after completion:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                    if i:\n                        if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                            b = 1\n                            break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code, and in the format: \n            { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n        And the completion should be the exact code that fills the TODO part.\n\n        For program1.py, the TODO part is:\n\n            if a[j] != 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We fill:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        For program2.py, the TODO part is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We note: the TODO is at the end of the for-loop header? Then we need to write the body of the for-loop? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we must write the body of the for-loop? \n\n        The body is:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the code already has the print statement after the for-loop? \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire body of the for-loop? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the indentation? The for-loop is at the same level as the b=0? \n\n        The body of the for-loop should be indented. But in the output, we must write the code as it would appear in the program? \n\n        Since the TODO is at the end of the for-loop header, we write the body with the same indentation as the surrounding code? \n\n        The surrounding code: \n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        We need to indent the body of the inner for-loop by 8 spaces? or 4? The code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n        Actually, the code uses 4 spaces. \n\n        So the body of the inner for-loop should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if i:\n                    if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n        But note: the entire body is one block? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the break in the same line? \n\n        We write:\n\n            program2: \"    if i:\\n        if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n            b = 1\\n            break\"\n\n        But the exact code that goes in the TODO part is the body of the for-loop? \n\n        Since the for-loop header is already written, we just write the body? \n\n        The body is:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        And we must indent it by one level (4 spaces) relative to the for-loop? \n\n        But the for-loop is already at an indentation level of 4 (inside the outer for-loop). So the body of the inner for-loop should be 8 spaces? \n\n        The current code:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        We need to replace the TODO comment with the body? Actually, the TODO comment is at the end of the for-loop header. We can remove the comment and write the body? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We write the entire block that is the body of the for-loop? \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if i:\n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        And we must indent it by 4 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the for-loop header is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop at 4 spaces? Actually, the outer for-loop is at 0, then the inner for-loop is at 4, then the body of the inner for-loop should be at 8? \n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        The line `b=0` is at 4 spaces. The inner for-loop is at 4 spaces? and the body of the inner for-loop should be at 8 spaces? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            program2: \"    if i:\\n        if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n            b = 1\\n            break\"\n\n        But note: the break breaks the inner for-loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the break? But we need to break.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"v = False\\n            break\"\n            program2: \"    if i:\\n        if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n            b = 1\\n            break\"\n\n        But note: in program1, the break is already at the same indentation? The TODO is inside the inner for-loop. The inner for-loop is:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We write:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        And we must indent it by 4 more spaces? \n\n        The current code for program1.py:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        And we indent by 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the if condition is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for-loop at 4, then the inner for-loop at 8, then the if at 12). Then the body of the if should be at 16? \n\n        But the code already has the if condition at 12? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            program1: \"            v = False\\n            break\"\n\n        But note: the break must be at the same level as the v=False? \n\n        Alternatively, we write:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        with 12 spaces of indentation? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n        Because the if block is already indented by 4 more? \n\n        But the if condition is at 12 spaces (if we use 4 per level: \n            level0: for h in ... \n            level1: for i in ... -> 4 spaces\n            level2: for j in ... -> 8 spaces\n            level3: if a[j]!=0: -> 12 spaces\n            then the body of the if: 16 spaces? \n\n        But the code in the TODO part is the body of the if? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            program1: \"        v = False\\n        break\"\n\n        But wait, the code already has:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We write:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n        So the missing code is two lines: \n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        with the same indentation as the if condition? \n\n        Actually, the if condition is at 8 spaces (if the outer for-loop is at 4, then the inner for-loop at 8, then the if at 12? but the code we are given uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n        The provided program1.py code:\n\n            for h in range(t):\n                n = int(stdin.readline())\n                a = list(map(int,stdin.readline().split(' ')))\n                b = 0\n                v = True\n                for i in range(n):\n                    b += a[i]\n                    if b<0:\n                        v = False\n                        break\n                    elif b==0:\n                        for j in range(i+1,n):\n                            if a[j] != 0:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                        break\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the inner for-loop? \n\n        Actually, the inner for-loop is at 12 spaces (because the outer for-loop is at 8, then the inner for-loop at 12, then the if at 16). \n\n        So the body of the if should be at 20? \n\n        But we write:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        with 20 spaces? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation? But we must match the surrounding.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the indentation? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\n        We write the two lines with the same indentation as the surrounding code? \n\n        The surrounding code: the if condition is at 16 spaces? \n\n        We write:\n\n            program1: \"                v = False\\n                break\"\n\n        But that might be too many? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The if condition is at 4 spaces relative to the for-loop? \n\n        In the entire program, the for-loop is at 4 spaces (from the outer for-loop). Then the inner for-loop is at 8, then the if is at 12. Then the body of the if should be at 16? \n\n        But the code we are given uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\n        So:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):   # 8 spaces\n                if a[j] != 0:         # 12 spaces\n                    ...                # 16 spaces\n\n        Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n        with 16 spaces? \n\n        But we can write:\n\n            program1: \"        v = False\\n        break\"\n\n        with 8 spaces? That would be 8 spaces per indent? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify. But we can count the existing indentation: \n\n            The line above: \"if a[j] != 0:\" is at 12 spaces? \n\n        How many spaces? The problem does not specify. But the code we are given uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\n        We'll assume 4 per indent. Then:\n\n            for j ...:  # 8 spaces (indent level 2)\n            if ...:     # 12 spaces (indent level 3)\n            then the body: 16 spaces (indent level 4)\n\n        So we write:\n\n            program1: \"        v = False\\n        break\"   -> but that is 8 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we write without specifying the exact spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\n        We write the two lines with one more indent than the if condition? \n\n        Since the if condition is at 12 spaces, we write the body at 16 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? \n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n            v = False\n            break\n\n        and let the user put the correct indentation? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code, and it must run correctly.\n\n        We must output the code with the correct indentation? \n\n        How? \n\n        We note: the existing code in program1.py uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\n        The if condition is at 12 spaces (because: \n            for h: 0\n            for i: 4\n            for j: 8\n            if: 12\n        )\n\n        So the body of the if should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            program1: \"                v = False\\n                break\"\n\n        because 16 spaces? \n\n        But 16 spaces is 4*4? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            program1: \"\\t\\t\\t\\tv = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\"\n\n        but the problem uses spaces.\n\n        We'll use 16 spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n        We write:\n\n            program1: \"                v = False\\n                break\"\n\n        and for program2: we write the body of the for-loop with 8 spaces? \n\n        For program2: \n            The outer for-loop: 0\n            then b=0: 4\n            then inner for-loop: 4\n            then the body of the inner for-loop: 8\n\n        So:\n\n            program2: \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n\n        But note: the condition in the if for program2 is long? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without newlines? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\n        We write as multi-line strings.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"                v = False\\n                break\",\n                \"program2\": \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 code has three lines? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write the program2 code as a single string with embedded newlines.\n\n        We do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"                v = False\\n                break\",\n            \"program2\": \"        if i:\\n            if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n\n        This should work.\n\n        Let me test the program2 code:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                    if i:\n                        if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                            b = 1\n                            break\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        And program1:\n\n            for j in range(i+1,n):\n                if a[j] != 0:\n                    v = False\n                    break\n\n        But note: the break breaks the inner for-loop? Then we break the outer for-loop? because after the inner for-loop there is a break? \n\n        The code:\n\n            elif b==0:\n                for j in range(i+1,n):\n                    if a[j] != 0:\n                        v = False\n                        break\n                break   # this breaks the outer for-loop (the one with i)\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON."
