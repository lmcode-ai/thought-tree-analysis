Then we can do:\n                Operation2: set one of the 1's to zero (by pairing the two 1's) -> [0,0,1] \n                Operation3: set the last 1 to zero by pairing with a zero -> [0,0,0] -> total 3 operations = n.\n\n            Alternatively, we could do: Operation1: set one to zero -> [0,1,1]\n                Operation2: use the zero and one 1 -> set to zero -> [0,0,1]\n                Operation3: use the zero and the last 1 -> set to zero -> [0,0,0] -> same.",

Note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is equal to 1 (if all are the same) plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\n\nIn fact, note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is:\n  1 + (number of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1])\n\nTherefore, the total sum over all contiguous subarrays is:\n  Sum_{l=0}^{n-1} Sum_{r=l}^{n-1} [1 + (# of indices j from l to r-1 with a[j]!=a[j+1])]\n\nWe can split this into two sums:\n  = (number of contiguous subarrays) + Sum_{l=0}^{n-1} Sum_{r=l}^{n-1} [ (# of indices j from l to r-1 with a[j]!=a[j+1]) ]\n\nThe first term is T1 = n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThe second term: note that each adjacent pair (i, i+1) (for i from 0 to n-2) that is different (a[i]!=a[i+1]) will be counted in every subarray that includes both i and i+1. How many subarrays include the adjacent pair (i, i+1)? \n  - The subarray must start at any index from 0 to i, and end at any index from i+1 to n-1.\n  - So the count is (i+1) * (n-1-i).\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n  T1 + Sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (if a[i]!=a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i) else 0) ]\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the initial array to be processed only once. There are updates.\n\nWe are given an initial array and then m queries. After each query, we update an element and then we must output the current total sum.\n\nThe initial total sum is computed as:\n  ans = n*(n+1)//2\n  for i in range(0, n-1):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          ans += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\nBut note: the term (i+1)*(n-1-i) is for the adjacent pair at (i, i+1). However, when we update an element at index i, it can affect at most two adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1).\n\nSo the program1.py code we are given has:\n\n  n, m = ... \n  li = ... \n  ans = n*(n+1)//2   [which is the base T1]\n\n  Then for i from 1 to n-1 (i.e., index from 1 to n-1 in the array, which is the adjacent pair (i-1, i) in the array? Actually, note: the loop is for i in range(1, n): \n      if li[i] != li[i-1]:\n          ans += i * (n-i)   [But note: the adjacent pair at (i-1, i) is at index i-1 and i. The count for this adjacent pair is: \n          The starting index can be from 0 to i-1 -> i choices (because 0..i-1: i numbers) and the ending index from i to n-1 -> (n-i) choices. So the term is i*(n-i).]\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the loop variable i (in the initial computation) is from 1 to n-1 (so i is the index of the second element in the adjacent pair). The adjacent pair is (i-1, i). The contribution is i*(n-i). \n\nBut note: i in the code is the index of the second element. The starting indices for the subarray that includes this adjacent pair can be from 0 to i-1 (which is i choices) and the ending indices from i to n-1 (which is n-i choices). So that is correct.\n\nNow, when we update an element at index i (0-indexed), we must:\n\n1. Remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) if they currently exist (i.e., if the two elements were different) and then add back the contributions for the new adjacent pairs after the update.\n\n2. Then update the element.\n\nThe code structure:\n\n  for each query:\n      i, x = ... \n      i -= 1   (to 0-indexed)\n\n      if i>0: \n          if li[i] != li[i-1]:   # then we are going to remove the adjacent pair (i-1, i) because we are changing li[i] and it might become same as li[i-1] or not? Actually, we remove the current contribution because the current state has a difference at (i-1,i). Then we check the new state: if the new x is not equal to li[i-1] then we add the contribution for (i-1,i) with the new value? But note: we are going to update li[i] to x. So we remove the current contribution and then if the new value x is different from li[i-1] we add the same term.\n\n          Similarly for the adjacent pair (i, i+1) if i+1 < n.\n\nSo the code does:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i] != li[i-1]:\n          ans -= i*(n-i)   # because the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1 and i, and the term for that pair is i*(n-i) [because the starting indices: 0 to i-1 -> i choices, and ending indices: i to n-1 -> n-i choices]\n\n      if x != li[i-1]:\n          ans += i*(n-i)   # then the new adjacent pair (i-1, i) will be different, so we add the same term.\n\n  Similarly, for the adjacent pair (i, i+1):\n\n      if i+1 < n:\n          if li[i] != li[i+1]:\n              ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)   # because the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is at index i and i+1. The starting indices: 0 to i -> i+1 choices, and ending indices: i+1 to n-1 -> n-i-1 choices.\n\n          if x != li[i+1]:\n              ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\n  Then update: li[i] = x\n\nBut note: the provided code has a TODO in the first if block (for i>0) after removing the current contribution. It does:\n\n      if i>0:\n          if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n              ans-=i*(n-i)\n          if x!=li[i-1]:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe see that the TODO is in the block for the adjacent pair (i-1, i). We need to add the new contribution if the new value x is different from the left neighbor. So we should add: ans += i*(n-i)\n\nBut wait, the code already has the next part for the right adjacent pair? Actually, the code after the TODO is:\n\n      if i+1<n:\n          if li[i]!=li[i+1]:\n              ans-=(i+1)*(n-i-1)\n          if x!=li[i+1]:\n              ans+=(i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nSo the TODO is only for the left adjacent pair. We should add the same term: ans += i*(n-i)\n\nTherefore, the missing line in program1.py is: \n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nBut note: the variable i in the code is the index (0-indexed). The term for the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is i*(n-i). \n\nSo we complete the TODO with: \n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nHowever, let me check the example: \n  Initial array: [1,2,3,4,5] -> n=5\n  Initial ans = 15 (from 5*6//2) \n  Then we add for adjacent pairs:\n      i=1: 2!=1 -> add 1*(5-1)=4 -> ans=19\n      i=2: 3!=2 -> add 2*(5-2)=6 -> ans=25\n      i=3: 4!=3 -> add 3*(5-3)=6 -> ans=31\n      i=4: 5!=4 -> add 4*(5-4)=4 -> ans=35\n\nBut the example says after the first query (changing index 3 to 2, so array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]) the answer is 29.\n\nSo what is the initial total? The example says 29 after the first query. But our initial total for [1,2,3,4,5] is 35? \n\nWait, the example input is:\n  5 5\n  1 2 3 4 5\n  3 2   -> update index 3 (which is 0-indexed index 2) to 2 -> so array becomes [1,2,2,4,5]\n\nBut the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5]. The initial total we computed is 35. Then we do the update at index2 (0-indexed) from 3 to 2.\n\nWe must update the adjacent pairs at index1 and index2 (i.e., (1,2)) and at index2 and index3 (i.e., (2,3)).\n\nFor the left adjacent pair (index1 and index2): \n  Currently: a[1]=2, a[2]=3 -> different -> so we remove the contribution for (1,2): 2*(5-2)=6 -> ans=35-6=29.\n  Then we check the new value: x=2, and a[1]=2 -> same? So we do not add back for the left adjacent pair.\n\nFor the right adjacent pair (index2 and index3):\n  Currently: a[2]=3, a[3]=4 -> different -> remove (2+1)*(5-2-1)=3*2=6 -> ans=29-6=23.\n  Then check: new value 2 and a[3]=4 -> different -> add 3*2=6 -> ans=23+6=29.\n\nSo the first update gives 29. Then the code appends 29 to the list and then prints.\n\nTherefore, the missing line for the left adjacent pair is: ans += i*(n-i)   but only if the condition holds? Actually, the condition is already checked: we do that in the if block.\n\nSo the missing line is: \n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nBut note: the variable i in the code is the index (0-indexed). The term for the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is i*(n-i). \n\nSo we write: \n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to compute the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 0.\n\nThe operation: choose two distinct indices i and j.\n  - If a[i] == a[j]: then we can set one of them to 0.\n  - Otherwise (a[i] != a[j]): we set both to min(a[i], a[j]).\n\nWe are given that the sequence a has n integers (n between 2 and 100) and each a[i] is between 0 and 100.\n\nWe note that the problem says: It can be proved that the answer always exists.\n\nWe are to solve t test cases (t up to 1000).\n\nThe provided code for a test case:\n\n  if 0 in a:\n      print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n\nBut what if there are zeros? Then we can ignore the zeros? Actually, the operation does not require the zeros to be operated? However, note:\n\n  The operation: we can choose any two distinct indices. If we have a zero and a non-zero, then we can set the non-zero to zero? But wait:\n\n  Operation: \n      If a[i] = a[j]: then set one of them to 0. \n      Otherwise, set both to min(a_i, a_j).\n\n  If we have (0, x) with x != 0 and x != 0? Then we are in the \"otherwise\" case: \n      min(0, x) = 0, so we set both to 0.\n\n  But note: if we have two zeros? Then we can set one of them to 0? That doesn't change anything.\n\n  So the idea:\n\n  We can use zeros to our advantage. \n\n  How about we try to count the number of non-zero elements? But the provided code: if there is at least one zero, then the answer is (n - count_zeros). Why?\n\n  Because we can use the existing zero to clear one non-zero per operation? But note: we can clear two non-zeros at once if we pair two non-zeros that are not equal? \n\n  Actually, the provided code does not cover the case when there is no zero.\n\n  The note in the problem: \n      In the first test case: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\n  How do we solve?\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Step 1: We can try to create zeros as quickly as possible.\n\n  Observation:\n\n  - If we have two identical non-zero numbers, we can set one of them to zero in one operation (by pairing them: since they are equal, we set one to zero). Then we have one zero and one non-zero? Actually, we set one to zero and the other remains? \n\n      Operation: (a, a) -> (a,0) or (0,a). Then we have one zero.\n\n  - Then we can use that zero to clear the rest? How? \n        For any non-zero x, we can pair (0, x): then we set both to min(0,x)=0. So one operation per non-zero.\n\n  So if we have k distinct numbers? \n\n  But note: we might have duplicates. \n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  We can break the problem into two types of operations:\n\n      Type1: when we choose two equal non-zeros: we set one to zero. This leaves one non-zero and one zero. (But note: we can also set the other to zero? Actually, the operation says: change one of them to zero. So we can choose which one to set to zero. So we can set one to zero and leave the other as the same non-zero.\n\n      Type2: when we choose two distinct non-zeros: we set both to the minimum of the two. This might not set to zero immediately.\n\n  However, the goal is to set everything to zero.\n\n  We can think greedily:\n\n      We want to create at least one zero. How?\n\n        - If there is already a zero, then we can use it to clear others: one operation per non-zero.\n\n        - If there is no zero, then we must create one.\n\n          How to create a zero?\n\n          Option A: if there is a duplicate, we can set one of the duplicates to zero (Type1 operation). Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros (with one duplicate now having one occurrence? because we set one to zero and left the other). Then we can use the zero to clear the rest: (n-1) operations? total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n          Option B: if there are no duplicates, then we cannot use Type1. We must use Type2. \n\n          How to create a zero with Type2? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3] \n            Operation1: choose (1,2) -> set both to 1 -> [1,1,3] (cost 1)\n            Now we have duplicates: [1,1,3]. Then we can do:\n            Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3] (cost 2)\n            Then Operation3: choose (0,1) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,3] (cost 3)\n            Operation4: choose (0,3) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] (cost 4)\n\n          Alternatively, we could have done:\n            Operation1: (1,3) -> set both to 1 -> [1,2,1] \n            Then we have duplicates? [1,2,1] -> duplicates at index0 and index2? \n            Operation2: (1,2) -> set both to 1? -> [1,1,1] (if we choose the two 1's? but wait: we have two 1's? then we can set one to zero? \n            Then Operation3: set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,1] \n            Then Operation4: set (0,1) -> [0,0,1] and then Operation5: set (0,1) -> [0,0,0] -> 5 operations? not optimal.\n\n          The example says 4.\n\n          How about:\n\n            Operation1: (2,3) -> set both to 2? -> [1,2,2] \n            Operation2: (2,2) -> set one to 0 -> [1,2,0]\n            Operation3: (1,2) -> set both to 1? -> [1,1,0] \n            Operation4: (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,0] \n            Operation5: (0,1) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 5 operations.\n\n          So the first way is better.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations for [1,2,3] is 4.\n\n          How to generalize?\n\n          We note:\n\n          - If there is at least one zero, then we can clear each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero). So the answer is the number of non-zeros.\n\n          - If there is no zero:\n\n            Step 1: create a zero.\n\n            How?\n\n            If there is a duplicate: then we can create a zero in one operation (by pairing two duplicates: set one to zero). Then we have one zero and (n-1) non-zeros. Then we can clear the rest in (n-1) operations. Total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n            If there is no duplicate: then we must create a duplicate first? and then create a zero? \n\n            How many operations to create a duplicate? \n\n            We can do:\n\n              Operation1: choose two distinct numbers, say a and b (a<b), then set both to a. Now we have two a's? So we have created a duplicate. Then we can set one of the a's to zero in the next operation. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros? Then we clear the rest in (n-1) operations? \n\n              Total = 1 (to create duplicate) + 1 (to create zero) + (n-1) (to clear the rest) = n+1.\n\n            But wait: in the example [1,2,3] we did 4 operations and n=3 -> 4 = 3+1? \n\n            However, note: after the first operation we set two numbers to 1, so we have [1,1,3]. Then we set one of the 1's to zero: [0,1,3]. Then we clear the 1 and the 3: each requires one operation? that would be 2 more operations? total 4.\n\n            So the count: \n                Operation1: create duplicate -> 1 op\n                Operation2: create zero from the duplicate -> 1 op\n                Then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 3 -> two more operations -> total 4.\n\n            But note: after creating the zero, we have two non-zeros: 1 and 3. We can clear them in two operations? \n                Operation3: use the zero and the 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,3] -> now we have one non-zero: 3.\n                Operation4: use the zero and the 3 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0].\n\n            So the total is 4.\n\n            Therefore, the formula for the no-zero case:\n\n              if there is at least one duplicate: then we can create a zero in 1 op and then clear the rest in (n-1) ops -> total n.\n\n              if there are no duplicates: then we need 1 op to create a duplicate, then 1 op to create a zero, then (n-1) ops to clear the rest? but wait: after creating the zero, we have n-1 non-zeros? Actually, we started with n non-zeros. Then:\n\n                Operation1: we set two distinct numbers to a (which is the min). This reduces the distinct set? and we now have a duplicate. But note: we did not reduce the total non-zero count? we still have n non-zeros? because we set two numbers to a non-zero value. \n\n                Then Operation2: we set one of the duplicates to zero. Now we have n-1 non-zeros and one zero.\n\n                Then we need n-1 operations to clear the non-zeros? \n\n                Total = 1 + 1 + (n-1) = n+1.\n\n            However, in the example [1,2,3] we had n=3 and total 4 = 3+1? \n\n            But wait: after the first operation we set two numbers to 1, so we have [1,1,3] -> now we have two 1's and one 3. Then we set one of the 1's to zero: [0,1,3]. Now we have two non-zeros: 1 and 3. Then we need two operations to clear them. So total 4.\n\n            So the count of non-zeros after the first two operations is (n-1) because we set one to zero? \n\n            Actually, the two operations: \n                Operation1: we set two numbers to the same non-zero -> non-zero count remains the same? (because we replaced two non-zeros by two non-zeros) but then Operation2: we set one of them to zero -> so we reduced the non-zero count by one.\n\n            Therefore, after two operations we have n-1 non-zeros. Then we need n-1 operations? \n\n            But wait: we have one zero already. Then we can clear each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with the zero). So we need (n-1) operations. \n\n            Total = 2 + (n-1) = n+1.\n\n            However, the example n=3: 2+2 = 4? but 2+(3-1)=4 -> that matches.\n\n            But wait: in the example, after the first two operations we have two non-zeros? and then we do two operations -> total 4.\n\n            So the formula: \n                if there is at least one zero: answer = (n - count_zeros)   [because we can clear each non-zero in one op]\n                else:\n                    if there is a duplicate: then we can create a zero in one op and then clear the rest in (n-1) ops -> total n\n                    else: (no duplicate and no zero) -> we need 1 op to create a duplicate, then 1 op to create a zero, then (n-1) ops to clear the rest -> total n+1\n\n          However, note: we might have multiple duplicates? but we only need one duplicate to create a zero.\n\n          But wait: what if we have more than one duplicate? that doesn't change the count.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the else branch (no zero) is:\n\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                # no duplicate -> distinct numbers\n                print(n+1)\n            else:\n                print(n)\n\n          However, let me test with the example [1,2,3]: distinct -> so we output 3+1 = 4 -> correct.\n\n          Another example: [1,1,2] (with no zero initially). \n            We have a duplicate (the two 1's). So we do:\n                Operation1: set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2 -> then we need two operations: \n                    Operation2: (0,1) -> set to 0 -> [0,0,2]\n                    Operation3: (0,2) -> set to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> total 3 operations = n (which is 3) -> correct.\n\n          But what about [1,1,1]? \n            We have duplicates. \n            Operation1: set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,1] -> then we have two non-zeros: 1 and 1. \n            Then we can do:\n                Operation2: set one of the 1's to zero (by pairing the two 1's) -> [0,0,1] \n                Operation3: set the last 1 to zero by pairing with a zero -> [0,0,0] -> total 3 operations = n.\n\n            Alternatively, we could do:\n                Operation1: set one to zero -> [0,1,1]\n                Operation2: use the zero and one 1 -> set to zero -> [0,0,1]\n                Operation3: use the zero and the last 1 -> set to zero -> [0,0,0] -> same.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the else branch is:\n\n            if len(set(a)) == n: \n                print(n+1)\n            else:\n                print(n)\n\n  However, note: the array might have zeros? we already handled the case with zeros. So the entire function:\n\n      if 0 in a:\n          # count the non-zeros: we can clear each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero that already exists)\n          non_zeros = n - a.count(0)\n          print(non_zeros)\n      else:\n          if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n              print(n+1)\n          else:\n              print(n)\n\n  But wait: what if we have multiple zeros? \n\n  Example: [0,1,2] -> we have one zero. Then we can clear the two non-zeros in two operations -> total 2.\n\n  How about [0,0,1,2]? \n      We have two zeros. We can clear the two non-zeros in two operations: \n          Operation1: use a zero and the 1 -> set to 0 -> [0,0,0,2] \n          Operation2: use a zero and the 2 -> set to 0 -> [0,0,0,0] -> total 2.\n\n      The formula: non_zeros = 4 - 2 = 2 -> so we output 2 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) == n:\n            print(n+1)\n        else:\n            print(n)\n\nBut note: the array a might have duplicates? and we are checking the entire array. The condition: if the length of the set of a is n, then there are no duplicates -> distinct. Otherwise, there is at least one duplicate.\n\nHowever, note: the array might have duplicates and also zeros? but we are in the else branch (no zero) so we don't have to worry.\n\nBut wait: what if the array has no zero and has duplicates? then we output n.\n\n  Example: [1,1,2] -> n=3, set(a) = {1,2} -> len=2 != 3 -> so we output 3.\n\n  Example: [1,2,3] -> set(a) = {1,2,3} -> len=3 == n=3 -> output 4.\n\n  So the code is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(n+1)\n        else:\n            print(n)\n\nBut note: the variable n is the length of the array. We can use n.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) == n:\n            print(n+1)\n        else:\n            print(n)\n\nHowever, note: the array might have zeros? we are in the else branch (no zero) so we don't have zeros. \n\nBut wait: what if the array has a zero? we are in the first branch. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says the array elements are between 0 and 100. And we are counting zeros. \n\nBut what if the array has a zero and duplicates? Then we are in the first branch: we output the count of non-zeros. \n\n  Example: [0,0,1,2] -> non_zeros = 2 -> output 2.\n\n  Example: [0,1,1,2] -> non_zeros = 3 -> output 3.\n\n  How many operations for [0,1,1,2]? \n      We have one zero. \n      Operation1: use the zero and the 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1,2] -> now we have two non-zeros: 1 and 2? \n      Then Operation2: use the zero and the 1 -> set to 0 -> [0,0,0,2]\n      Operation3: use the zero and the 2 -> set to 0 -> [0,0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\n  So the formula holds.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py is complete.\n\n  But note: the problem says the array a in the test case is read as:\n\n        input()\n        a = [*getInts()]\n\n  And then we check if 0 in a.\n\n  So we write:\n\n        if 0 in a:\n            print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n        else:\n            if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  However, we have the variable n? Actually, we did:\n\n        input()   # skip the first line of the test case? \n        a = [*getInts()]\n\n  But the variable n is not defined in the function? \n\n  The code:\n\n        def solve():\n            input()\n            a = [*getInts()]\n\n  So we don't have n? We have a. So we can use len(a).\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n        n = len(a)\n        if 0 in a:\n            print(n - a.count(0))\n        else:\n            if len(set(a)) == n:\n                print(n+1)\n            else:\n                print(n)\n\n  But the problem says the first line of the test case is n. We read it and then throw it away? \n\n  Actually, we do:\n\n        input()   # this reads the integer n\n\n  Then we read the next line: the list a.\n\n  But the list a has n elements. So we can use len(a) to get n.\n\n  So the code is:\n\n        def solve():\n            input()   # we skip the integer n\n            a = list(getInts())\n            if 0 in a:\n                non_zeros = len(a) - a.count(0)\n                print(non_zeros)\n            else:\n                if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n                    print(len(a)+1)\n                else:\n                    print(len(a))\n\n  However, the provided code already has:\n\n        if 0 in a:\n            print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we only need to fill the else branch.\n\n  We can write:\n\n            if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  But note: the array a might be large? but n<=100, so set(a) is efficient.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\n  However, we can write it in one line? But the problem says to output the missing code.\n\n  So we output:\n\n        if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut note: the indentation. The existing code in the else branch is at the same level as the comment. We must indent properly.\n\n  The existing code:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n        else:\n            if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  But we can also write without an extra else:\n\n        else:\n            n_val = len(a)\n            if len(set(a)) == n_val:\n                print(n_val+1)\n            else:\n                print(n_val)\n\n  However, we can use the same variable a.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  This is clear.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  But note: the variable a is the list.\n\n  We output the two completions in JSON format.\n\n  Summary:\n\n    program1: the missing line is: \"ans += i*(n-i)\" (without quotes)\n\n    program2: the missing block is: \n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\n  However, note: in program1.py, the missing line is in the context:\n\n        if i>0:\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans-=i*(n-i)\n            if x!=li[i-1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must write the line: ans += i*(n-i) at the TODO.\n\n  And in program2.py, the missing block is in the else branch.\n\n  We output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"ans += i*(n-i)\", \"program2\": \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\\\n            else:\\\\n                print(len(a))\"}\n\n  But note: the program2 code must be a string that when printed is valid Python code. We must escape newlines? Actually, the problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And the output format is JSON.\n\n  We can use newlines and tabs? But the example output format is a string.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write the program2 part as a single string with newline characters.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\".\n\n  We'll use literal newlines and proper indentation.\n\n  But note: the existing code in program2.py has 4-space indentation. The else branch is at the same level as the previous if. The missing code should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n  The existing code:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  So the entire else branch becomes:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  Therefore, the string for program2 should be:\n\n        \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\n            else:\\n                print(len(a))\"\n\n  But note: the existing code has 12 spaces at the beginning of the line for the TODO? Actually, the code:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The else is at 8 spaces (if the function is indented by 4 and the else is at 4 more) and the comment is at 12 spaces.\n\n  We are replacing the comment with:\n\n            if ...   -> at 12 spaces of indentation? and then the print statements at 16 spaces.\n\n  But the code we are writing is:\n\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n  The first line: 12 spaces, then the if condition. Then the next line: 16 spaces for the print. Then 12 spaces for the else, and 16 for the next print.\n\n  How many spaces? \n\n  The existing code:\n\n        def solve():\n            input()\n            a = [*getInts()]\n            if 0 in a:\n                print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n            else:\n                # TODO\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                    print(len(a)+1)\n                else:\n                    print(len(a))\n\n  So the indentation: the if after else is at 12 spaces (because the else is at 8, and the block inside else is 12). Then the print is at 16.\n\n  Therefore, the string for program2 should be:\n\n        \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\\\n            else:\\\\n                print(len(a))\"\n\n  But wait: the existing code in the TODO is at 12 spaces. We are writing:\n\n        Line1: 12 spaces: \"if ...\"\n        Line2: 16 spaces: \"print ...\"\n        Line3: 12 spaces: \"else:\"\n        Line4: 16 spaces: \"print ...\"\n\n  We can write the string as:\n\n        \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\n            else:\\n                print(len(a))\"\n\n  This has the same indentation.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But the problem says to output the missing code as it would appear.\n\n  We'll output the exact code that would be placed in the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"ans += i*(n-i)\",\n        \"program2\": \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\n            else:\\n                print(len(a))\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1 part is a single line. We don't need newlines.\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code. For program1, the missing code is one line. For program2, the missing code is 4 lines.\n\n  We output the JSON string.\n\n  Let me write the program2 code as a string with the newlines and spaces.\n\n  The string for program2: \n      \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n                print(len(a)+1)\\n            else:\\n                print(len(a))\"\n\n  But note: the spaces: the first line after the else is 12 spaces, then the if condition. Then the next line is 16 spaces for the print. Then 12 spaces for the else, then 16 for the last print.\n\n  This matches the existing indentation.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a raw string? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  We'll use the above.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
