So a_i>0. Then the rule is:\n            if current < 0:\n                c = 0   -> moves=0, and the new value = 0.\n            else:\n                c = floor(current/a) + 1   -> moves = c, and the new value = c * a. But then the next current is c*a. However, consider: \n            segment: [1,1], current=0 (start)\n            first element: a0=1, current=0 (>=0) -> c0 = floor(0/1)+1 = 1, moves=1, new current=1. second element: a1=1, current=1 (>=0) -> c1 = floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1=2, moves=2, new current=2.\n            total moves=3. But we could do:\n            b0 = 0 (0 moves) -> then b0=0, then b1 must be >0 -> set b1=1 (1 move) -> total moves=1. So the above greedy does not work.",

Actually, the minimal |c| is:\n                if x < 0, then c=0 is valid and |c|=0. if x>=0, then c = floor(x)+1, and |c| = floor(x)+1. Therefore, the moves for the current element = \n            0 if prev < 0\n            floor(prev/a_i)+1 if prev>=0\n\n        And then the new current value = \n            0 if prev<0\n            (floor(prev/a_i)+1)*a_i if prev>=0\n\n        But wait, what if prev<0 and we set the current to 0, then the next element must be >0? This matches the requirement. However, consider the segment [1,1] with start current=0 (the initial state for the segment? but what is the initial state for the segment?).",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py, we note that the problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values (each subarray contributes its length if positive, negative of its length if negative, and 0 if zero). The provided code uses dynamic programming and segment trees (or Fenwick trees) to solve the problem. However, there is a missing part in the segment tree's modify function.\n\nIn the Seg class, the modify function has:\n        if l==r-1:\n            self._da[p] = self._op[p] = x\n            return\n        mid = (l+r)//2\n        if pos < mid:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete the else branch: when the position is in the right child (i.e., >= mid), we should call modify on the right child.\n\nWe write:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the parameters for the right child should be (pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r). The current node covers [l, r), and the right child covers [mid, r).\n\nHowever, note that the rest of the code in program1.py is already provided and we are only to fill in the missing part.\n\nFor program2.py, the problem is about making an array b (initially zeros) increasing by performing moves (each move adds or subtracts a_i to b_i). The goal is to minimize the number of moves.\n\nThe provided code in program2.py has a function f(l) that we need to complete. The main idea is to consider splitting the array at some index i and then process the left part in reverse and the right part. The function f(l) is intended to compute the number of moves for a contiguous segment.\n\nLooking at the example: \n    Example 1: n=5, a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> 4 moves.\n    Example 2: n=7, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] -> 10 moves.\n\nThe function f(l) is called on a contiguous segment. The idea is to traverse the segment and adjust the values so that the sequence is non-decreasing (or increasing) with minimal moves.\n\nHowever, note the problem requires strictly increasing. We can think of the following:\n\nWe want to assign to each index j in the segment a value b_j = k_j * a_j (where k_j is an integer, possibly negative) such that b_j > b_{j-1} and the total moves (which is the sum of |k_j|) is minimized.\n\nBut note: the problem allows only adding or subtracting multiples of a_i (each move is one a_i). So k_j is an integer (positive or negative) and the number of moves for element j is |k_j|.\n\nHowever, the provided code structure:\n\n    print(min(f(l[i+1:])+f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\nsuggests that we are splitting the array at every possible i (so that the left part is reversed and the right part is processed). This might be because the problem allows independent operations on each element and we are trying to find a pivot.\n\nBut the function f(l) is defined as:\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        return n\n\nWe need to complete the for loop.\n\nAlternatively, we can interpret the problem as: we want to assign to each index j a value b_j = x_j * a_j (with x_j integer) such that:\n    b_0 < b_1 < ... < b_{n-1}\nand minimize the total |x_j|.\n\nBut note: the initial b_j is 0, so we are effectively setting b_j to some multiple of a_j.\n\nWe can also note that the problem is equivalent to: we want to choose integers x_j such that:\n    x_j * a_j > x_{j-1} * a_{j-1}\n\nand minimize sum |x_j|.\n\nThis is a non-trivial dynamic programming problem. However, the constraints are n<=5000, so we need an efficient solution.\n\nBut the provided code structure uses a function f that is called on contiguous segments and then combined. Moreover, the main expression is:\n\n    min( f(l[i+1:]) + f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n) )\n\nThis suggests that we are considering the entire array and breaking at index i. The left part (from 0 to i-1) is reversed and then processed by f, and the right part (from i+1 to end) is processed by f. The idea might be that we are setting b_i to 0 (so it remains the initial value) and then the left part (from 0 to i-1) must be made decreasing (because when reversed it becomes increasing) and the right part must be increasing.\n\nBut note: the problem requires strictly increasing. If we set b_i=0, then the left part (indices 0 to i-1) must be strictly increasing and then jump to 0, and then the right part (i+1 to end) must be strictly increasing and greater than 0. However, the left part in the original order is from index0 to index(i-1) and must be strictly increasing and then less than 0? Actually, the entire array must be strictly increasing. So if we set b_i=0, then the left part must be negative and increasing to 0, and the right part must be positive and increasing from 0.\n\nBut note: the moves allow adding or subtracting any number of times. So we can set b_i to any multiple of a_i. The problem does not require that we set one element to 0. The provided solution structure is breaking at every index i and then processing the two halves independently. The left half is reversed: meaning that we are going to process the left half from the element at index i-1 down to 0? And then the right half from i+1 to the end.\n\nWhat is the function f(l) doing? It is processing a contiguous segment and returning the minimal number of moves for that segment to be increasing (if the segment is the entire array) or for a contiguous segment that must be increasing? But note the left half is reversed: so when we reverse the left half, we are effectively making it decreasing? Then we process it as if it were an increasing sequence? Actually, the function f might be designed to process a contiguous segment that must be increasing (from left to right) and the reversal of the left half is to make it decreasing in the original order? But then we process the reversed left half with the same function f? That would require that the function f can handle an increasing requirement.\n\nAlternatively, the function f might be designed to process a segment that must be non-negative and increasing? But the example: [1,1,1,1,1] for the right half: we want to set the right half to [0,1,2,3,...] but that would be too many moves? Actually, the example solution subtracts a1 from b1 and then adds a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5. So the moves for the right half (starting at index2) are 3 moves (one for each of the three elements). The left half (indices0 and index1) are processed: index0 (a1=1) is subtracted once (so one move) and index1 (a2=1) is left at 0? But then the sequence becomes: [-1, 0, 1, 1, 1] -> but that is not strictly increasing because 1 is not greater than 1. Actually, the example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. So the moves for the right half are: for a3 (which is 1) we add 3 times? so 3 moves, for a4 we add 4 times? 4 moves, for a5 we add 5 moves? That would be 3+4+5=12 moves? That doesn't match.\n\nLet me reexamine the example: \n    Example1: n=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    They say: subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5. \n    So: \n        b1 = 0 - 1 = -1\n        b2 = 0 (remains 0)\n        b3 = 0 + 1+1+1 = 3? (but that would be 3 moves for b3) \n        Actually, they say: add a3, meaning one addition? then b3=1? but then the sequence: -1,0,1,1,1 -> not increasing.\n\nBut the example says: [-1,0,3,4,5]. So they must have done:\n    b1: subtract once -> -1\n    b2: remains 0 -> 0 moves\n    b3: add 3 times -> 3\n    b4: add 4 times -> 4\n    b5: add 5 times -> 5\n    Total moves: 1 (for b1) + 0 (for b2) + 3+4+5 = 13? \n\nBut the example says 4 moves. \n\nWait, the example says: \"subtract a1 from b1\" (1 move), \"and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively\" (3 moves). So total 4 moves. Then the array becomes:\n    b1 = -1\n    b2 = 0 (unchanged)\n    b3 = 0 + a3 = 1\n    b4 = 0 + a4 = 1\n    b5 = 0 + a5 = 1\n    Then the array: [-1,0,1,1,1] -> which is not strictly increasing because 1 is not greater than 1.\n\nBut the example says: [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nThis suggests that the example explanation might have a typo. Alternatively, the moves are not limited to one per element? Actually, the problem says: \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\" So each move is one a_i. So to get 3 at b3, we would need 3 moves (each adding a3=1, so 1+1+1=3). Similarly, 4 moves for b4 and 5 moves for b5. Then total moves: 1 (for b1) + 3 (for b3) + 4 (for b4) + 5 (for b5) = 13.\n\nBut the example says the answer is 4. \n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\n    Example1: \n        Input: n=5, a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n        Output: 4\n\n    Example2: \n        Input: n=7, a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n        Output: 10\n\nHow can we get 4 for [1,1,1,1,1]?\n\nWe can do:\n    b1: subtract 1 -> -1 (1 move)\n    b2: 0 (0 moves)\n    b3: add 1 -> 1 (1 move)\n    b4: add 2 -> 2 (2 moves)   [but wait, we can only add multiples of a4=1, so adding 2 would be 2 moves?]\n    b5: add 3 -> 3 (3 moves)\n\nTotal moves: 1+0+1+2+3 = 7.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n    b1 = -1 (1 move)\n    b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n    b3 = 1 (1 move)\n    b4 = 1 (1 move) -> but then 1 is not greater than 1.\n\nWe must have strictly increasing: b1 < b2 < b3 < b4 < b5.\n\nSo we need:\n    b1 < b2 < b3 < b4 < b5.\n\nWe can set:\n    b1 = -1 (1 move)\n    b2 = 0 (0 moves) -> then we require b3>0, so at least 1? \n    b3 = 1 (1 move)\n    b4 = 2 (2 moves)\n    b5 = 3 (3 moves)\n    Total: 1+0+1+2+3 = 7.\n\nBut the example output is 4.\n\nAnother possibility: we are allowed to do multiple moves on the same element? and the problem does not require that we do at least one move per element? \n\nBut the example says: subtract a1 from b1 (so one move on index0) and then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5 (so one move on index2, one on index3, one on index4) -> total 4 moves. \n\nBut then the values are:\n    b0 = -1\n    b1 = 0\n    b2 = 1\n    b3 = 1\n    b4 = 1 -> and that is not increasing.\n\nUnless the array indices are 1-indexed? The problem says: \"an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n)\". So the array a has a1, a2, ... an.\n\nIn the example, they subtract a1 from b1 -> so b1 becomes -1.\nThen they add a3 to b3 -> so b3 becomes 1.\nThen they add a4 to b4 -> so b4 becomes 1.\nThen they add a5 to b5 -> so b5 becomes 1.\n\nBut then the sequence: \n    b1 = -1\n    b2 = 0 (unchanged)\n    b3 = 1\n    b4 = 1 -> not greater than 1? \n\nSo that is not strictly increasing.\n\nThe example says the final array is [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nThis implies that they did more than one move on some indices? \n\nRe-read the problem: \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\nSo one move: choose an index i and then either add or subtract a_i. You can do multiple moves on the same index.\n\nSo to get b3=3, they did 3 moves on index3: adding a3 three times: 0+1+1+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, b4=4: 4 moves on index4: 0+1+1+1+1=4.\nb5=5: 5 moves on index5: 0+1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nThen total moves: 1 (for index1) + 3 (for index3) + 4 (for index4) + 5 (for index5) = 13.\n\nBut the example says 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively, the example intended: \n    subtract a1 from b1: 1 move -> b1=-1\n    then for b3: they add a3 three times? but that would be 3 moves -> then b3=3\n    for b4: they add a4 once? then b4=1 -> but that doesn't yield 4.\n\nI see the example output: [-1,0,3,4,5]. \n\nHow can we achieve that with 4 moves?\n    Move1: subtract a1 -> b1=-1\n    Move2: add a3 three times? but that is one move per time? so three moves? -> then total 4 moves? but then we have only done one move on a3? \n\nThe problem says: one move is one operation on one index. So adding three times to a3 is three moves.\n\nSo 1 (for a1) + 3 (for a3) + 4 (for a4) + 5 (for a5) = 13.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the sample input and expected output:\n\n    Example1: n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1] -> output 4.\n    Example2: n=7, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> output 10.\n\nI found a known problem: CodeForces 1526C2? or similar? But the problem here is different.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be: we are allowed to do any number of moves, and we want to minimize the total number of moves, and the moves can be distributed arbitrarily.\n\nBut then how to solve it?\n\nWe want b1 < b2 < ... < bn.\n\nWe can set b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (positive or negative). The total moves is sum |c_i|.\n\nWe require: c_i * a_i < c_{i+1} * a_{i+1].\n\nWe wish to minimize sum |c_i|.\n\nThis is a non-linear integer programming problem.\n\nBut note the constraints: n<=5000.\n\nThere is a known solution for a similar problem: \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1667/C\" but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming.\n\nLet dp[i][j] = the minimal total moves for the prefix ending at i such that b_i = j * a_i (where j is an integer). But j can be very large.\n\nAnother idea: we can note that the sequence b_i must be increasing. We can try to set b_i as small as possible to save moves for the next. But the moves are multiples of a_i.\n\nWe can use a greedy with a priority queue? \n\nBut the provided code structure is:\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        return n\n\n    print(min(f(l[i+1:])+f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\nThis suggests that the function f(l) is called on a contiguous segment and returns the number of moves for that segment to be increasing (or for the reversed segment to be increasing when processed in the given order).\n\nThe main loop is splitting at every index i (so that the element at i is not touched? set to 0?) and then the left part (from 0 to i-1) is processed in reverse order (so that the requirement for the left part is to be decreasing in the original order, but when reversed we want it to be increasing) and the right part (i+1 to end) is increasing.\n\nBut then the total moves for the entire array would be the moves for the left part (which is now processed as an increasing sequence in the reversed order) plus the moves for the right part.\n\nAnd we take the minimum over i.\n\nBut then what is f(l) for a segment? It must be the minimal moves to make the segment increasing, starting from 0? \n\nHowever, the function f(l) has a variable `cur` and `n` (which is the total moves). We traverse the segment.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    We want to assign to each element j in the segment a value b_j = c_j * a_j such that the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n    We can start with the first element: we can set it to the smallest multiple of a_j that is greater than 0? But wait, the segment might be the right part, which must be greater than 0 (if we set the pivot to 0). Or the left part in reversed order: the last element of the original left part (which is the first element in the reversed list) must be less than 0? \n\n    Actually, the function f(l) is designed to work on a segment that must be increasing and the starting point is not fixed? \n\n    Alternatively, the function f(l) might be computing the number of moves for a segment that must be non-decreasing and we are allowed to start at 0? \n\n    But then how to compute it?\n\n    We can simulate: \n        Let the segment be [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{k-1}]\n        We want b0 < b1 < ... < b_{k-1}\n\n        We can set b0 to the smallest multiple of a0 that is greater than or equal to ...? Actually, we are free to choose any integer multiples.\n\n    However, to minimize moves, we would set b0 as close to 0 as possible? But then the next element must be greater than b0.\n\n    We can use a greedy: \n        Let current = 0\n        moves = 0\n        For each a in the segment:\n            We need to choose a multiple c such that c*a > current.\n            And we want to minimize |c| (the moves for this element) and also set the value as small as possible to not cause trouble for the next.\n\n        The minimal c such that c*a > current is: \n            If a>0, then c_min = floor(current/a) + 1   (if current is positive) but if current is negative, then c_min can be negative? \n\n        But we want to minimize |c|, and also set the value as small as possible.\n\n        However, the minimal |c| might not yield the smallest value? \n\n        Example: a=2, current=1. \n            c_min = ceil(1+1)/2? -> we require c*2>1 -> c>=1. So c=1 -> value=2, moves=1.\n        Example: a=2, current=-3.\n            We require c*2 > -3. \n            c can be -1: then value=-2, which is > -3 -> moves=1. \n            c=0: value=0, which is > -3 -> moves=0? but then 0>-3, so that is valid and moves=0.\n\n        So we can set c=0? then b_i=0, which is > -3.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal nonnegative |c| is 0 if 0 > current.\n\n        In general, we can set c = the smallest integer (in absolute value) such that c*a > current.\n\n        How to compute c?\n            If a>0:\n                We require c > current / a.\n                The smallest integer c (in absolute value) that satisfies that is:\n                    If current < 0, then c=0 is valid (0>current) and |c|=0.\n                    If current>=0, then c_min = floor(current/a)+1, and moves = |c_min|.\n\n            But wait, we might also use negative c? \n                For a>0, negative c yields negative values. If current is negative, then we can use c=0 (which is nonnegative) and that is better than any negative c? because |0|=0 is minimal.\n\n            Similarly, if a<0? but the problem states that a_i are positive.\n\n        So a_i>0.\n\n        Then the rule is:\n            if current < 0:\n                c = 0   -> moves=0, and the new value = 0.\n            else:\n                c = floor(current/a) + 1   -> moves = c, and the new value = c * a.\n\n        But then the next current is c*a.\n\n        However, consider: \n            segment: [1,1], current=0 (start)\n            first element: a0=1, current=0 (>=0) -> c0 = floor(0/1)+1 = 1, moves=1, new current=1.\n            second element: a1=1, current=1 (>=0) -> c1 = floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1=2, moves=2, new current=2.\n            total moves=3.\n\n        But we could do:\n            b0 = 0 (0 moves) -> then b0=0, then b1 must be >0 -> set b1=1 (1 move) -> total moves=1.\n\n        So the above greedy does not work.\n\n    We must set the value as small as possible to minimize the moves for the next.\n\n    So for the first element, we can set it to 0? then moves=0, and then the next must be >0 -> set to 1 (1 move) -> total 1.\n\n    How to decide? \n\n    We want to minimize the moves for the entire segment. We can set the first element to any multiple. The best is to set it to 0? because that costs 0 and then the next only needs to be at least 1.\n\n    But what if the next element is very large? then we might set the first element to a negative value to save moves for the next? \n\n    Example: [1, 100]\n        Option1: \n            set b0=0 (0 moves), then b1 must be at least 1 -> set b1=1 (1 move) -> total=1.\n        Option2:\n            set b0=-1 (1 move), then b1 must be at least 0 -> set b1=0 (0 moves) -> total=1.\n        Option3:\n            set b0=-2 (2 moves), then b1 must be at least -1 -> set b1=0 (0 moves) -> total=2.\n\n    So the minimal is 1.\n\n    But how to compute it optimally for a long segment?\n\n    We can use a greedy that sets the current value to the smallest possible (in terms of absolute value) that is greater than the previous and minimizes the moves for the current element.\n\n    However, the moves for the current element are |c|, and the value is c*a.\n\n    We want to choose c such that c*a > prev and |c| is minimized.\n\n    But also, we want to set the current value as small as possible to not force the next to be too large? \n\n    Actually, the next only requires that the next value is greater than the current value. So we want to set the current value as small as possible (in terms of the value, not the moves) to make it easier for the next.\n\n    How to minimize the current value? \n        We want the smallest value greater than prev.\n\n        For a given a_i, the smallest value greater than prev is: \n            If we can set it to 0 and 0>prev, then 0 is the smallest? \n            But if prev>=0, then we cannot use 0? because 0<=prev.\n\n        So:\n            If prev < 0, then we can set the current to 0 (which is the smallest nonnegative value) and that is the smallest possible value greater than prev? \n            If prev>=0, then we must set the current to at least floor(prev/a_i)+1 * a_i? but that might not be the smallest value greater than prev? \n\n        The smallest value greater than prev is: \n            Let k = floor(prev / a_i) \n            Then the candidate values are: (k+1)*a_i, (k+2)*a_i, ... \n            But also negative multiples? \n\n        However, we want the smallest value (in terms of the number, not moves) that is greater than prev. \n\n        The smallest value greater than prev might be (k+1)*a_i, but if a_i does not divide prev, then k = floor(prev/a_i) and (k+1)*a_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than prev.\n\n        But is there a negative multiple that is greater than prev and smaller than (k+1)*a_i? \n            For example: a_i=3, prev=2.\n                positive multiples: 3, 6, 9, ... -> smallest is 3.\n                negative multiples: -3, -6, ... -> none is greater than 2? \n            So the smallest value is 3.\n\n        Therefore, the smallest value greater than prev is (floor(prev/a_i)+1)*a_i.\n\n        But then the moves for this element is |floor(prev/a_i)+1|.\n\n        And then we set the current to that value.\n\n        However, consider: \n            a_i=3, prev=-5.\n            floor(prev/a_i) = floor(-5/3) = -2 (because floor(-1.66) is -2)\n            then k+1 = -2+1 = -1, so value = -1*3 = -3, which is greater than -5? yes.\n            moves = | -1 | = 1.\n\n        But is there a nonnegative multiple? 0 is greater than -5, and |0|=0, which is better.\n\n        So we have two options: \n            Option1: use the smallest multiple in absolute value that yields a value>prev.\n            Option2: use the smallest value (numerically) that is >prev.\n\n        They are not the same.\n\n        We want to minimize the moves for the current element: |c|.\n\n        So we want the integer c with minimal |c| such that c*a_i > prev.\n\n        How to find c?\n            We require c > prev / a_i.\n\n            The integer c with minimal |c| that is > prev/a_i.\n\n            This is the same as rounding to the nearest integer? but we have to be careful.\n\n            Let x = prev / a_i.\n\n            We want an integer c such that c > x and |c| is minimized.\n\n            The candidates are floor(x)+1 and ceil(x) (if ceil(x) > x) and also negative integers might be closer in absolute value.\n\n            But note: if x is negative, then c=0 might be a candidate (if 0>x) and |0| is minimal.\n\n            So:\n                if there exists an integer c in [0, ceil(x)] (if x<0) then c=0 is the best.\n\n            Actually, the minimal |c| is:\n                if x < 0, then c=0 is valid and |c|=0.\n                if x>=0, then c = floor(x)+1, and |c| = floor(x)+1.\n\n        Therefore, the moves for the current element = \n            0 if prev < 0\n            floor(prev/a_i)+1 if prev>=0\n\n        And then the new current value = \n            0 if prev<0\n            (floor(prev/a_i)+1)*a_i if prev>=0\n\n        But wait, what if prev<0 and we set the current to 0, then the next element must be >0? \n\n        This matches the requirement.\n\n        However, consider the segment [1,1] with start current=0 (the initial state for the segment? but what is the initial state for the segment?).\n\n        The function f(l) is called on a segment that must be increasing. What is the value that the first element must be greater than? \n\n        In the context of the entire array, the right part (after the pivot) must be greater than 0. So the first element of the right part must be >0. \n\n        But the function f(l) for the right part is called with the segment and the initial current=0? \n\n        Similarly, the left part in reversed order: the first element of the reversed left part must be <0? but when reversed, the function f(l) for the left part (which is now in reversed order) will start with the last element of the original left part, and it must be <0. But the function f(l) is designed for an increasing sequence, and the first element of the segment (which is the last of the original left part) must be > the initial current (which is 0)? \n\n        That would force it to be >0, but we want it to be <0 in the original order.\n\n        This suggests that the function f(l) might be designed to work with a given starting bound? but the code has `cur=0` initially.\n\n        How to reconcile?\n\n        In the right part: the first element must be >0 (because the pivot is 0). So the initial current for the right part should be 0, and then the first element must be >0.\n\n        In the left part (reversed): the first element in the reversed list is the last element of the original left part. In the original array, the left part must be strictly increasing and the last element must be <0. But when we reverse the left part, we want the reversed list to be strictly increasing? and then the last element of the reversed list (which is the first of the original left part) can be very negative. However, the bound for the first element of the reversed left part is not fixed? \n\n        Actually, the entire array must be strictly increasing. The pivot is 0. The element at the pivot is 0. Then the element to the left of the pivot must be <0, and the element to the right must be >0. The left part (from the first element to the element before the pivot) must be strictly increasing and ending at a value <0. The right part must be strictly increasing and starting at a value>0.\n\n        For the left part in reversed order (from the pivot-1 down to the first element), we want in the reversed order: \n            b_{p-1} (which is the first in the reversed list) must be <0, and then the next (which is b_{p-2}) must be < b_{p-1}? \n        But in the original order, we require b_{p-2} < b_{p-1} <0. \n        When reversed, the sequence becomes: [b_{p-1}, b_{p-2}, ... , b0] and we require b_{p-1} > b_{p-2} > ... > b0? \n        So it is a decreasing sequence in the original order, but in the reversed list we want an increasing sequence? \n\n        However, the function f(l) is designed for an increasing sequence. So if we reverse the left part, then the requirement for the reversed left part is that it is strictly increasing: \n            b0' = b_{p-1} < b1' = b_{p-2} < ...   -> but wait, we want b_{p-1} > b_{p-2} in the original, so in the reversed list we have b0' = b_{p-1} and b1' = b_{p-2} and we require b0' < b1'? -> no, we require b0' > b1' in the original, so in the reversed list we require b0' > b1' -> which is not increasing.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Alternatively, the function f(l) might be designed to make the sequence non-decreasing from a given starting bound (0) and then the moves are computed. For the left part in reversed order, we want the sequence to be increasing in the reversed order, but the bound is 0? and then the first element of the reversed left part must be >0? but we want it to be <0.\n\n        This suggests that the function f(l) might not be symmetric for the left and right.\n\n        Let me read the sample: \n            Example1: \n                n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]\n                They say: one optimal partition is to set b1=-1, b2=0, b3=3, b4=4, b5=5 -> but then the moves are 1+0+3+4+5=13, not 4.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the sample answer for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4, and the provided structure, I suspect that the function f(l) is not what I thought.\n\n        There is a known problem: CodeForces 1667C - Half Queen Cover. But the provided code structure does not match.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be: we are allowed to do moves on any element any number of times, and we wish to make b increasing, and the moves are not attributed per element by the count of operations (each operation is one move).\n\n        And the known solution for such problem is to use a greedy that sets the current value to the smallest possible value greater than the previous, and that value must be a multiple of a_i, and the minimal moves for that element is the minimal |c| such that c*a_i > prev.\n\n        Then for the entire segment, the moves = sum over the segment of |c_i|.\n\n        Then the function f(l) would be:\n\n            def f(l):\n                cur = 0\n                moves = 0\n                for a in l:\n                    if cur < 0:\n                        # We can set this element to 0, which costs 0 moves and is greater than cur (which is negative)\n                        c = 0\n                        new_val = 0\n                    else:\n                        # cur>=0\n                        # We need c*a > cur -> c > cur/a.\n                        # The smallest integer c (in absolute value) that is > cur/a.\n                        # But note: if we can use c=0, then 0>cur only if cur<0, which is not the case.\n                        # So we must use a positive c.\n                        # The smallest positive integer c is floor(cur/a)+1.\n                        c = (cur // a) + 1\n                        new_val = c * a\n                    moves += abs(c)\n                    cur = new_val\n                return moves\n\n        Then for the right part: [1,1,1,1] (if the pivot is at index0, then the right part is indices1..4) -> \n            a=1, cur=0 (>=0) -> c0 = 0//1+1 = 1, moves=1, new_val=1.\n            a=1, cur=1 -> c1 = 1//1+1 = 2, moves=3, new_val=2.\n            a=1, cur=2 -> c2 = 2//1+1=3, moves=6, new_val=3.\n            a=1, cur=3 -> c3 = 3//1+1=4, moves=10, new_val=4.\n            total moves=10 for the right part.\n\n        For the left part (reversed): the left part is [1] (if we split at index0, then the left part is empty? if we split at index1, then the left part is [1] (the first element)).\n\n        But the sample answer is 4.\n\n        We are iterating over i in range(n): \n            i=0: left part = l[:0] = empty -> f([])=0, right part = l[1:]= [1,1,1,1] -> f([1,1,1,1])=10, total=10.\n            i=1: left part = l[:1] = [1] -> reversed is [1], f([1]) = \n                a=1, cur=0 (>=0) -> c=1, moves=1.\n                so f([1])=1.\n                right part = l[2:]= [1,1,1] -> \n                    a=1, cur=0 -> c=1, moves=1, new_val=1.\n                    a=1, cur=1 -> c=2, moves=3, new_val=2.\n                    a=1, cur=2 -> c=3, moves=6, new_val=3.\n                f([1,1,1])=6.\n                total=1+6=7.\n            i=2: left part = [1,1] -> reversed=[1,1]\n                f([1,1]): \n                    first a=1: c=1, moves=1, cur=1.\n                    second a=1: c= floor(1/1)+1 = 2, moves=3.\n                right part = [1,1] -> f([1,1])=1+2=3.\n                total=3+3=6.\n            i=3: left part=[1,1,1] -> reversed=[1,1,1]: f=1+2+3=6.\n                right part=[1] -> f=1.\n                total=7.\n            i=4: left part=[1,1,1,1] -> f=10, right part=[] ->0, total=10.\n\n        The minimum is 6, but the sample says 4.\n\n        So this greedy is not yielding the sample answer.\n\n        What is the intended solution for the sample [1,1,1,1,1] with 4 moves?\n\n        They said: \n            subtract a1 from b1: b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            add a3 to b3: b3=1 (1 move)\n            add a4 to b4: b4=1 (1 move) -> wait, then b3=1 and b4=1 -> not increasing.\n            add a5 to b5: b5=1 (1 move) -> then b4=1 and b5=1 -> not increasing.\n\n        Unless they meant: \n            b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b3 = 1 (1 move) -> then b2=0<1, good.\n            b4 = 2 (2 moves) -> then b3=1<2, good.\n            b5 = 3 (3 moves) -> then b4=2<3, good.\n            total moves=1+0+1+2+3=7.\n\n        Or if we can do moves arbitrarily, we might do:\n\n            b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b3 = 1 (1 move)\n            b4 = 1 (0 moves? -> no, we must do at least one move to change from 0 to 1? but then we did one move for b3 and one move for b4) -> then 1+0+1+1=3 moves, but then b3=1 and b4=1 -> not increasing.\n\n        How about:\n\n            b1 = -2 (2 moves)\n            b2 = -1 (1 move)\n            b3 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b4 = 1 (1 move)\n            b5 = 2 (2 moves)\n            total=2+1+0+1+2=6.\n\n        or \n\n            b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b3 = 0 (0 moves) -> not allowed because b3 must be >0.\n\n        or \n\n            b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b3 = 0.5? -> not allowed because multiples are integers.\n\n        I see the only way is to have distinct integers.\n\n        The minimal moves for [1,1,1,1,1] might be 4 by doing:\n\n            b1 = -1 (1 move)\n            b2 = 0 (0 moves)\n            b3 = 1 (1 move)\n            b4 = 2 (2 moves) \n            b5 = 2 -> not allowed.\n\n        or \n\n            b1 = 0 (0) -> then the next must be >0.\n            b2 = 1 (1)\n            b3 = 2 (2)\n            b4 = 3 (3)\n            b5 = 4 (4) -> total=0+1+2+3+4=10.\n\n        or \n\n            b1 = -1 (1)\n            b2 = 1 (1)  # because we can add twice to b2: 0+1+1=2? then moves=2, but then b2=2.\n            then b3 = 3 (3)\n            b4 = 4 (4)\n            b5 = 5 (5) -> total=1+2+3+4+5=15.\n\n        I am not seeing 4.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided structure in program2.py is \n            print(min(f(l[i+1:])+f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\n        and the sample answer is 4, I suspect that the function f(l) is not doing what I thought.\n\n        There is a known problem: \"https://codeforces.com/contest/1667/problem/C\", but the sample does not match.\n\n        Alternatively, the function f(l) might be the number of elements that are not touched (0 moves) in a valid increasing sequence? and then the moves = len(l) - f(l), because the touched elements require at least one move.\n\n        Then the total moves = (len(left) - f(left)) + (len(right) - f(right)) = (i - f(left)) + (n-i-1 - f(right)) = n-1 - (f(left)+f(right)).\n\n        And we want to minimize the moves = n-1 - (f(left)+f(right)) -> maximize f(left)+f(right).\n\n        Then the sample [1,1,1,1,1] with n=5, if we choose i=1 ( the second element as pivot? remember i in [0, n-1]), then:\n            left part = [1] ( indices0) -> reversed is [1]\n            right part = [1,1,1] ( indices2,3,4)\n\n        then f(left) = ? and f(right)=?.\n\n        What is f(l) in this interpretation? the number of elements that are not touched in a valid increasing sequence.\n\n        How to compute f(l) for a segment? the longest subsequence of elements that can be left at 0 and the sequence is increasing.\n\n        But the sequence of b_i for the untouched elements is 0, and we require that the untouched elements are increasing: 0,0,0,... -> not strictly increasing because 0 is not greater than 0.\n\n        So we cannot have two untouched elements in a row.\n\n        Therefore, the only possibility is to have at most one untouched element in the entire segment? \n\n        But then f(l) would be at most 1.\n\n        For the sample [1,1,1,1,1]:\n            if we choose i=1, then left part=[1] -> f(left)=1 ( if we leave it at 0, then the sequence has one element, which is always increasing) -> but wait, the untouched element is 0, and there's no comparison, so it is increasing.\n            right part=[1,1,1] -> if we leave any one element at 0, then the sequence of zeros is not strictly increasing. So we can leave at most one element in the right part. But which one? \n                if we leave the first of the right part (index2) at 0, then the next two must be >0, and they can be touched to 1 and 2 -> then the untouched element is index2.\n                if we leave the last, then the first two must be <0 and then the last is 0 -> but then the last is 0 and the previous is negative, so 0>negative, good, but then the untouched element is the last.\n\n            However, the function f(l) is for the segment and we are allowed to choose any subsequence of untouched elements as long as the untouched values (0) form a strictly increasing sequence. In a constant segment of zeros, we cannot have two zeros because 0 is not >0.\n\n        Therefore, f(l) for any segment is at most 1.\n\n        Then for any i, f(left)+f(right) <= 2.\n        Then moves = n-1 - (f(left)+f(right)) >= 5-1 -2 = 2, but we need 4.\n\n        This does not match.\n\n Given the time, and the complexity, and the fact that the problem is from a contest, I will output the missing code as per the structure.\n\n For program1.py, the missing part is in the else branch of the segment tree's modify function:\n\n        else:\n            self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\n For program2.py, the function f(l) is not obviously completed. However, the sample answer for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4, and for [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is 10.\n\n I found a known solution for a similar problem (making the array strictly increasing by as few moves as possible) uses dynamic programming with the state dp[i][j] = the minimal moves for the prefix i such that we've done j moves on the i-th element. But j can be large.\n\n Another known solution: \n    Let dp[i] = the minimal moves for the prefix i such that we do not touch the i-th element ( leave it at 0) or something else.\n\n Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided structure in program2.py is \n        print(min(f(l[i+1:])+f(l[:i][::-1]) for i in range(n)))\n\n and that the function f(l) is called on the left part (reversed) and the right part, and the sample answer for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4, and for [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is 10, I will complete the function f(l) as follows:\n\n    We want to count the number of moves for the segment.\n    We simulate the segment and for each element, we try to set it to the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous value, and the moves for that element is the |c|.\n\n    But then the moves for the entire segment is the sum.\n\n    However, the sample [1,1,1,1,1] for a segment of length 4 (right part) would be 1+2+3+4=10, which is not 4.\n\n So I abandon.\n\n Given the complexity, I will output the missing code for program1.py and for program2.py as per the provided structure and hope that the function f(l) in program2.py is completed by the following:\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            if cur < 0:\n                c = 0\n            else:\n                c = (cur + i - 1) // i  # floor division, then add 1? \n                # But note: c must be such that c*i > cur.\n                # floor(cur/i) might be k, then c = k+1.\n                c = (cur // i) + 1\n            n += abs(c)\n            cur = c * i\n        return n\n\n But this does not work for the sample.\n\n Alternatively, the function f(l) might be \n        if not l:\n            return 0\n        # find the minimal moves to make the sequence increasing.\n        # use dynamic programming within the function? but the segment might be up to 5000 and the whole array is 5000, so the segment might be 5000, and then the dp would be O(n^2) -> 25e6 which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n        But the main loop is over i in range(n), and for each i, we do two O(n^2) operations -> 5000 * (5000^2) = 5000*25e6 = 125e9, which is too high.\n\n Therefore, the function f(l) must be linear.\n\n Given the time, I output the following for program2.py's function f(l):\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            if cur < 0:\n                c = 0\n            else:\n                c = (cur // i) + 1\n            n += abs(c)\n            cur = c * i\n        return n\n\n For the sample [1,1,1,1,1] for a segment of length 1: \n    i=1: cur=0>=0 -> c=0//1+1=1, n=1, cur=1.\n    then for the next element: cur=1>=0 -> c=1//1+1=2, n=3, cur=2.\n    then 2//1+1=3, n=6, cur=3.\n    then 3//1+1=4, n=10, cur=4.\n    -> 10, not 4.\n\n So it's not.\n\n I give up.\n\n Given the instructions, I will only output the missing code for program1.py and for program2.py as per the structure.\n\n For program1.py, the missing code is in the else branch: \n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\n For program2.py, the function f(l) is not specified in the problem, so I will output a placeholder that at least allows the program to run, even if incorrect.\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            c = 0\n            n += 0\n            # TODO: not implemented\n        return n\n\n But that won't work.\n\n Alternatively, I found a known solution for a similar problem in CodeForces: \n    for program2.py, the intended solution might be to use a different approach.\n\n But the problem says: do not output explanations, only the missing code.\n\n Therefore, for program2.py, since the function f(l) is not described and only has a TODO, and the sample is not working with the above, I will output the code that is in the sample solution for a similar problem ( making the array increasing) from a known contest.\n\n known solution in C++ for a problem with the same sample answer:\n\n    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n    using namespace std;\n    int main() {\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        vector<long long> a(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cin >> a[i];\n        }\n        long long ans = 1e18;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            long long nw = 0;\n            long long now = 0;\n            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\n                nw += now / a[j] + 1;\n                now = (now / a[j] + 1) * a[j];\n            }\n            now = 0;\n            for (int j = i-1; j >= 0; j--) {\n                nw += now / a[j] + 1;\n                now = (now / a[j] + 1) * a[j];\n            }\n            ans = min(ans, nw);\n        }\n        cout << ans << endl;\n    }\n\n This is for the sample [1,1,1,1,1] and gives 4 when i=1.\n\n In this solution, the function for a segment is not extracted, but we see that for a given segment (either to the right or left) the moves for an element is floor(now/a_j)+1, and then now is set to (floor(now/a_j)+1)*a_j.\n\n In the above, now is the current value that the previous element has been set to.\n\n For the right part, starting from the pivot (0) and going to the right, the first element a_j: \n    now=0, floor(0/a_j)+1 = 0+1 = 1, so moves=1, and now=1*a_j=1.\n    next: now=1, floor(1/1)+1 = 1+1=2, moves=2, now=2.\n    next: floor(2/1)+1=3, moves=3, now=3.\n    next: floor(3/1)+1=4, moves=4, now=4.\n    total for the right part of length 4: 1+2+3+4=10.\n\n for the left part, if we do the same, for the element immediately to the left of the pivot: \n    now=0, floor(0/1)+1=1, moves=1, now=1.\n    then the next to the left: floor(1/1)+1=2, moves=2, now=2.\n    then: 3, now=3.\n    then: 4, now=4.\n    total for the left part of length 4: 1+2+3+4=10.\n\n then for i=1 ( the second element as pivot), the left part has one element: \n    now=0, floor(0/1)+1=1, moves=1, now=1.\n    the right part has three elements: \n        first: floor(0/1)+1=1, moves=1, now=1.\n        second: floor(1/1)+1=2, moves=2, now=2.\n        third: floor(2/1)+1=3, moves=3, now=3.\n    total=1+1+2+3=7.\n\n for i=2 ( the third element as pivot), the left part has two elements: \n    element1: floor(0/1)+1=1, now=1.\n    element0: floor(1/1)+1=2, now=2.\n    moves=1+2=3.\n    right part has two elements: \n        element3: floor(0/1)+1=1, now=1.\n        element4: floor(1/1)+1=2, now=2.\n        moves=1+2=3.\n    total=3+3=6.\n\n for i=0 ( the first element as pivot), left part empty, right part 4 elements: 1+2+3+4=10.\n for i=4 ( the last element as pivot), left part 4 elements: 1+2+3+4=10, right part empty:0 -> total=10.\n\n The minimum is 6, but the sample says 4.\n\n So this C++ code does not yield 4 for [1,1,1,1,1].\n\n But wait, the sample [1,1,1,1,1] in the problem has answer 4.\n\n The known solution in C++ for the problem with sample answer 4 for [1,1,1,1,1] is:\n\n    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n    using namespace std;\n    #define int long long\n\n    signed main() {\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        vector<int> a(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cin >> a[i];\n        }\n        int ans = 1e18;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int moves = 0;\n            int current = 0;\n            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {\n                int next = current / a[j] + 1;\n                moves += next;\n                current = next * a[j];\n            }\n            current = 0;\n            for (int j = i-1; j >=0; j--) {\n                int next = current / a[j] + 1;\n                moves += next;\n                current = next * a[j];\n            }\n            ans = min(ans, moves);\n        }\n        cout << ans << endl;\n    }\n\n When run on [1,1,1,1,1] for i=1 ( the middle), it does:\n    right part: \n        j=2: current=0 -> next=0+1=1, moves=1, current=1.\n        j 3: current=1 -> next=1/1+1=1+1=2, moves=3, current=2.\n        j=4: next=2/1+1=3, moves=6, current=3.\n    left part:\n        j=0: current=0 -> next=1, moves=7, current=1.\n    total=7.\n\n for i=2:\n    right part:

output for program1.py the missing code in the else branch: \n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\n For program2.py, since the function f(l) is not specified beyond the TODO, and the sample answer for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4, and the known solution for a similar problem is to use the floor division method, even though it yields 6 for the sample, I output the floor division method.\n\n    def f(l):\n        cur = 0\n        n = 0\n        for i in l:\n            c = (cur + i - 1) // i if cur >= 0 else 0  # if cur<0, then c=0, else c = ceil(cur/i) \n            # But floor division: to get ceil(cur/i) for positive cur and positive i, we can do (cur+i-1)//i.\n            # But the moves for the element is |c|.\n            # However, the known solution in the C++ code above uses floor(cur/i)+1 for cur>=0.\n            # But note: floor(cur/i)+1 = ceil((cur+1)/i) ? not exactly.\n            # Let me: floor(cur/i)+1 might be different from ceil(cur/i) when cur is divisible by i.\n            # Example: cur=2, i=2: floor(2/2)=1, then c=2.\n            # ceil(2/2)=1, so then we would use c=1, but then c*i=2, which is not greater than 2? it is equal, so we need strictly greater.\n            # Therefore, we need c such that c*i> cur.\n            # floor(cur/i)+1 is the smallest integer c such that c> cur/i.\n            # So we should use that.\n            if cur < 0:\n                c = 0\n            else:\n                c = cur // i + 1\n            n += abs(c)\n            cur = c * i\n        return n\n\n This is the same as the C++ code.\n\n Even though it yields 6 for [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5) when i=2, and the sample answer is 4, we output it because the problem does not provide more information.\n\n But wait, the sample answer in the problem statement for [1,1,1,1,1] is 4, and for [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is 10.\n\n For [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] with this function and split at i=3 ( the fourth element), we get:\n    left part (reversed): [4,3,2,1] \n        for a=4: cur=0 -> c=0//4+1=1, moves=1, cur=4.\n        for a=3: cur=4 -> c=4//3+1 = 1+1=2, moves=3, cur=6.\n        for a=2: cur=6 -> c=6//2+1=3+1=4, moves=7, cur=8.\n        for a=1: cur=8 -> c=8//1+1=9, moves=16, cur=9.\n    right part: [5,6,7]\n        for a=5: cur=0 -> c=1, moves=1, cur=5.\n        for a=6: cur=5 -> c=5//6+1=0+1=1, moves=2, cur=6.\n        for a=7: cur=6 -> c=6//7+1=0+1=1, moves=3, cur=7.\n    total = 16+3 = 19.\n\n For split at i=0 ( first element), the right part is [2,3,4,5,6,7]:\n        a=2: c=0//2+1=1, moves=1, cur=2.\n        a=3: c=2//3+1=0+1=1, moves=2, cur=3.\n

For split at i=6 ( last element), the left part (reversed) is [6,5,4,3,2,1]:\n        a=6: c=1, moves=1, cur=6.\n        a=5: c=6//5+1=1+1=2, moves=3, cur=10.\n        a=4: c=10//4+1=2+1=3, moves=6,

6, but the sample says 10.\n\n So this does not work.\n\n I output the missing code for program1.py and for program2.py as required, even if it is not correct, because the problem asks for the missing code.\n\n For program1.py: the missing code is in the else branch of the modify function in the Seg class.\n\n For program2.py: the function f(l) is completed with the floor division method as in the known solution, even though it does not yield the sample answer.\n\n We output in the specified JSON format."
