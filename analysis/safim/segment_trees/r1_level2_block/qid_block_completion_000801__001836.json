Therefore, for program1.py, we output:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that in the branch for s1 < s2, p1 is always < n. But from the examples we tried, it is safe. For instance, in the example [1,2,3,1,1] (n=5), the last value of p1 is 3, which is <5. In the example [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5), the last value of p1 is 3, which is <5. In the example [1] (n=1), p1 becomes 1, which is not <1? But in the branch for s1 < s2, we never use p1=1? In the first test case with n=1, after the s1==s2 branch, p1 becomes 1. Then we are in the loop? Then we check: s1 < s2? -> false. Then s2 < s1? -> true: then we do s2 += l[p2] with p2=0 -> valid. Then p2 becomes -1. Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=-1 -> condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break. So we never use the branch for s1 < s2 when p1=1. Therefore, it is safe. So we write for program1.py: s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: in the branch for s1 < s2, we might have p1 = n? How? Only if we enter the branch when p1 = n-1, then we do:\n\n            s1 += l[n-1] -> valid. p1 = n.\n\n        Then next iteration: we break. So it is safe. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        Now for program2.py.

For example, n=1: \n              i=1, swap the 'B' (position1) with the 'N' (position3) -> but the sample swap was (1,2). Alternatively, swap (1,3): \n                  becomes: N at1, A at2, B at3 -> \"NAB\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. But the sample swap was (1,2): \n                  becomes: A at1, B at2, N at3 -> \"ABN\", which also does not have \"BAN\". Both are valid.

But to avoid index error, we must check. However, the problem: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> which means p1<=p2+1. And p2 is at least -1? But when p1 is n, then we require n-1<=p2. And p2 is at most n-1? So if p2 is n-1, then n-1<=n-1 -> true. Then we enter the loop. Then we do the branch: if s1 < s2 -> then we try to update the left? But p1 is n -> we cannot.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses two pointers (p1 starting at 0 and p2 starting at n-1) and two sums (s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob). The idea is to move the pointers and update the sums until the pointers cross.\n\n However, the code has a TODO and also a condition that might be off.\n\n Let's analyze the provided code:\n\n   l2 = []   # This list is used to record the total candies eaten (p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever s1 == s2.\n   s1, s2 = 0, 0\n   p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n\n   while (p1-1 <= p2):   # This condition is a bit odd: p1-1<=p2. Initially, p1=0 -> -1<=p2 (which is true). But note that we are incrementing p1 and decrementing p2.\n\n   The loop body:\n        if s1 == s2: \n            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)   # total candies eaten: p1 (from left) and (n-1-p2) from right? Actually, the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - p2) because Bob starts at n-1 and moves left until p2 (so he has eaten from n-1 down to p2+1, which is (n-1 - p2) candies).\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        if s1 < s2:   # TODO: Your code here\n            # Currently, there is no code for this branch. We need to add code to handle when s1 < s2.\n\n        if s2 < s1: \n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n The problem: when s1 < s2, we need to add more to s1 (so we should take from the left). But note that we already did an if for s1==s2 and then we check s1<s2 and then s2<s1. However, after the first if we updated s1 and p1, so now s1 might be greater than s2? Also, the condition for the while loop might be incorrect.\n\n Actually, the condition in the while loop: (p1-1<=p2) is intended to allow p1 to go up to p2+1? But note that when p1==p2, we are at the middle. We can also consider that we have to break when p1>p2.\n\n However, the problem says that they cannot eat the same candy. So when p1==p2, that candy hasn't been eaten by either. We can only assign it to one or leave it.\n\n The intended logic is:\n\n   We want to record every time the two sums are equal. Then we try to extend the eating.\n\n   We start with both having 0. Then we add one candy to Alice (so s1 becomes the first candy) and then we check: if s1 < s2? But initially s2 is 0, so we then check s2 < s1? Then we add the last candy to Bob? Then we check again.\n\n   But the problem is that when s1 < s2, we are missing code. We should add a candy from the left to Alice? But note that we just did that in the s1==s2 branch? Actually, the code in the s1==s2 branch always adds one candy to Alice. Then we check the next conditions. So if after adding that candy, s1 becomes less than s2? That doesn't make sense because we just added to s1 and s2 was less than s1? \n\n   Actually, the flow is:\n\n      Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> we enter the first if: we record the total (which is 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0) and then we add l[0] to s1 and p1 becomes 1.\n\n      Then we check: if s1 (which is l[0]) is less than s2 (0)? -> it's false. Then we check if s2 (0) < s1 (l[0]) -> true, so we add l[n-1] to s2 and p2 becomes n-2.\n\n      Then we loop again: condition: p1-1 (0) <= p2 (n-2) -> true.\n\n      Then we check: if s1==s2? -> if l[0] == l[n-1]? then we record again? and then add the next left candy? \n\n   But note: the problem is that we are only adding to the left when we have equality? and then we check for s1<s2 and s2<s1? \n\n   Actually, we should be able to add from the left when s1 < s2? and from the right when s2 < s1? \n\n   The current code does not have a branch for s1 < s2. We need to add:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   But note: we have to be cautious because we might have already advanced p1 in the equality branch? Actually, the structure is:\n\n        if condition1: ... \n        if condition2: ... \n        if condition3: ... \n\n   So we can have multiple conditions in one iteration? That might lead to updating both in one iteration? \n\n   However, we want to update only one side per iteration? \n\n   The problem: after updating in the equality branch, we then check the next conditions and update again? That would be two updates in one iteration.\n\n   Example: \n        Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> we do the equality branch: record 0, then add l[0] to s1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: if s1 (l[0]) < s2 (0) -> false.\n        Then we check: if s2 (0) < s1 (l[0]) -> true: then we add l[n-1] to s2, p2 = n-2.\n\n        Now we have done two updates in one iteration.\n\n   But that is acceptable? Actually, we are trying to balance? However, the problem is that we are updating both sides in one iteration? But note that the problem allows Alice to eat from the left and Bob from the right independently? \n\n   However, the goal is to maximize the total number of candies. We are only recording the total when the sums are equal. \n\n   But the problem: we are updating both sides without checking if they are still in bounds? \n\n   The condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. After the first iteration, p1=1, p2=n-2 -> condition: 0<=n-2 -> true.\n\n   Then we check: s1 and s2? They are l[0] and l[n-1]. If they are equal, we record again? \n\n   But note: we are updating both sides in one iteration? Then we might overshoot? \n\n   Actually, the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we must do a two-pointer in O(n). \n\n   However, the current structure might update both sides in one iteration? That would be acceptable because each iteration we are moving at least one pointer? \n\n   But wait: what if we have:\n\n        if s1==s2: ... (which updates one pointer) \n        then if s1 < s2: ... (which updates the same pointer again?) \n\n   That would be two moves on the left? \n\n   We don't want that. We want to do one move per iteration? \n\n   Actually, the problem: the condition for the while loop is not standard. We should break when p1>p2? \n\n   And we should update only one of the sums per iteration? \n\n   How about we restructure? But the problem says we must fill in the TODO.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the code has:\n\n        if s1 == s2: \n            ... and then we update the left.\n\n        then we check if s1 < s2: then update the left? \n\n        then we check if s2 < s1: then update the right.\n\n   But if we update the left in the first branch, then s1 becomes greater than s2? Then we would update the right? \n\n   So we are updating both in one iteration? \n\n   However, that might be acceptable? Because we are only recording the total when we have equality? \n\n   But the problem: we are updating the left again in the same iteration? \n\n   Actually, the code after the first if might have changed the state so that the next condition is true? \n\n   We must avoid updating the same side twice? \n\n   Alternatively, we can change the ifs to elifs? \n\n   But the problem says: we have to fill the TODO. We cannot change the structure arbitrarily.\n\n   The TODO is in the branch for s1 < s2. We are to write code for that branch.\n\n   We should add:\n\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n   But then we have:\n\n        if s1 == s2: ... \n        if s1 < s2: ... \n        if s2 < s1: ... \n\n   This might lead to multiple updates? \n\n   However, note that after updating in the s1==s2 branch, we then check the next condition? So if we update the left and then s1 becomes less than s2? Then we would update the left again? That would be two left updates? \n\n   But that is what we want: if after adding one candy from the left we are still less than s2, then we need to add more? \n\n   However, that would break the two-pointer because we are updating twice without checking the pointer? \n\n   We must check that p1 is still in bounds? \n\n   Actually, the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. When we update p1, we do p1+=1. Then we check the condition at the next iteration? \n\n   But in the same iteration, we are updating again? \n\n   Example: \n        p1=0, p2=n-1, s1=0, s2=0 -> we do the first if: record, then s1 becomes l[0], p1=1.\n        Then we check: if s1 < s2? -> false (if l[0]>=0, which it is). \n        Then we check: if s2 < s1? -> true (if l[0]>0, which it is) -> then we update s2 to l[n-1], p2=n-2.\n\n        Then we go to the next iteration.\n\n   Now, if we have the TODO filled as:\n\n        if s1 < s2: \n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n   Then what if after the first if we have s1==s2 and we update the left, and then we have s1 < s2? Then we update the left again? \n\n   But note: after updating the left in the first if, we have s1 = some positive value. How can it be less than s2? Only if s2 was already large? \n\n   Actually, the two pointers are independent. \n\n   However, the problem is that we are updating both sides in one iteration? \n\n   But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000. If we do two updates per iteration, then the total iterations would be about n/2? So total operations about 200000? That is acceptable.\n\n   But let me test with a small example: [1,2,1]\n\n        n=3, l = [1,2,1]\n\n        Initially: s1=0, s2=0, p1=0, p2=2 -> condition: -1<=2 -> true.\n            s1==s2 -> record: 0 + (3-1-2)=0 -> then s1=1, p1=1.\n            Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> 1<0? false. Then 0<1 -> true: s2=1, p2=1.\n\n        Now: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n            s1=1, s2=1 -> record: 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then s1 += l[1]=2 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n            Then check: s1=3, s2=1 -> 3<1? false. Then 1<3 -> true: s2 += l[1]=2 -> s2=3, p2=0.\n\n        Now: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\n        Then we print l2[-1] = 2.\n\n        But the expected answer for [1,2,1]? \n            Alice can eat [1,2] -> 3, Bob can eat [1] -> 1 -> not equal? \n            Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> total 2 candies? That is the answer.\n\n        However, note that we recorded 2 at the last equality? But the total candies eaten at that point was 2 (Alice: 1 candy at index0 and Bob: 1 candy at index2). Then we updated and broke the condition? \n\n        But the problem: we recorded 2 at the moment when s1=1 and s2=1? Then we updated and then the condition broke? \n\n        The answer we output is 2, which is correct.\n\n        Now, what if we have [1,1]? \n\n            n=2, l=[1,1]\n\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1 -> then s2=0<1 -> s2=1, p2=0 -> then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n            Then: s1=1, s2=1 -> record: 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2 -> then s1 += l[1]=1 -> s1=2, p1=2 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\n            Then we output 2.\n\n        But what if we have [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]? \n\n        We want: Alice and Bob to have the same total. We can try:\n\n            Alice: [1,3] -> 4, Bob: [1,1] (from the right) -> 2 -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [1] (last one) -> 1 -> total 2 candies? \n            But also: Alice: [1,3,1] -> 5, Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> no.\n            Alice: [1,3] -> 4, Bob: [1] -> 1 -> no.\n            Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [1,1] -> 2 -> no.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,3,1] and Bob: [1,1]? -> 5 vs 2 -> no.\n\n            Actually, we can do: Alice: [1] and Bob: [1] -> total 2.\n\n            But note: the problem says they can eat any number from the left (in a row) and any number from the right (in a row). They don't have to eat until the middle? \n\n            However, the example: [1,3,1,1,1] -> Alice can eat the first two: [1,3] (4) and Bob can eat the last two: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,3,1] (5) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [1] (last one: 1) -> total 2.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,3] (4) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,3,1] (5) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,3,1,1] (6) and Bob: [1] (1) -> not equal.\n\n            So the maximum total is 2.\n\n        Now run the code:\n\n            n=5, l=[1,3,1,1,1]\n\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n            then s2=0<1 -> s2=1 (from the last candy: index4), p2=3.\n\n            Now: p1=1, p2=3 -> condition: 0<=3 -> true.\n                s1=1, s2=1 -> record: 1 + (5-1-3)=1+1=2 -> then s1 += l[1]=3 -> s1=4, p1=2.\n                then check: s1=4, s2=1 -> 4<1? false -> then 1<4 -> true: s2 += l[3]=1 -> s2=2, p2=2.\n\n            Now: p1=2, p2=2 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                s1=4, s2=2 -> not equal -> then check: s1< s2? false -> then s2< s1? true: s2 += l[2]=1 -> s2=3, p2=1.\n\n            Now: p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n                s1=4, s2=3 -> not equal -> then s1< s2? false -> then s2< s1? true: s2 += l[1]=3 -> s2=6, p2=0.\n\n            Now: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\n            Then we output the last recorded value: 2.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But what if we have [1,2,3,1,1]? \n\n        We want: \n            Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1,2,3] (6) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [1] (last) -> 1 -> total 2.\n\n            But also: Alice: [1,2,3,1] (7) and Bob: [1] (1) -> no.\n\n            How about Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1] (1) -> no.\n\n            How about Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> no.\n\n            So maximum 2.\n\n        Now run the code:\n\n            n=5, l=[1,2,3,1,1]\n\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1.\n            then s2=0<1 -> s2=1 (last candy: index4), p2=3.\n\n            Now: p1=1, p2=3 -> condition: 0<=3 -> true.\n                s1=1, s2=1 -> record 1 + (5-1-3)=1+1=2 -> then s1 += l[1]=2 -> s1=3, p1=2.\n                then check: s1=3, s2=1 -> 3<1? false -> then 1<3 -> true: s2 += l[3]=1 -> s2=2, p2=2.\n\n            Now: p1=2, p2=2 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                s1=3, s2=2 -> not equal -> then s1< s2? false -> then s2< s1? true: s2 += l[2]=3 -> s2=5, p2=1.\n\n            Now: p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n                s1=3, s2=5 -> then s1< s2: true -> we do: s1 += l[2]=3 -> s1=6, p1=3.\n\n            Now: p1=3, p2=1 -> condition: 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n            Then we output the last recorded value: 2.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        However, note that we are updating the left again in the same iteration? \n\n        In the last iteration (p1=2, p2=1) we did:\n\n            s1=3, s2=5 -> we do the s1<s2 branch: s1 += l[2] (which is the candy at index2, value 3) -> s1=6, p1=3.\n\n        Then we break.\n\n        But note: we did not check for equality after updating? \n\n        Actually, we only check for equality at the beginning of the iteration? \n\n        But we updated s1 to 6, and then we break? \n\n        However, we did not record any new equality? \n\n        That is acceptable because we are only interested in the maximum total candies when the sums are equal.\n\n        The last recorded equality was 2.\n\n        But what if we have an equality after updating in the same iteration? \n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1,1] \n\n            n=5, l=[1,1,1,1,1]\n\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s1=1, p1=1 -> then s2=0<1 -> s2=1 (last candy), p2=3.\n\n            Then: p1=1, p2=3 -> condition: 0<=3 -> true.\n                s1=1, s2=1 -> record: 1 + (5-1-3)=1+1=2 -> then s1 += l[1]=1 -> s1=2, p1=2.\n                then check: s1=2, s2=1 -> 2<1? false -> then 1<2 -> true: s2 += l[3]=1 -> s2=2, p2=2.\n\n            Then: p1=2, p2=2 -> condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                s1=2, s2=2 -> record: 2 + (5-1-2)=2+2=4 -> then s1 += l[2]=1 -> s1=3, p1=3.\n                then check: s1=3, s2=2 -> 3<2? false -> then 2<3 -> true: s2 += l[2]=1 -> s2=3, p2=1.\n\n            Then: p1=3, p2=1 -> condition: 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n            Then we output 4.\n\n        But is that correct? \n            Alice ate the first 3 candies: [1,1,1] -> 3\n            Bob ate the last 2 candies: [1,1] -> 2? -> not equal.\n\n        However, wait: the recording happened at the moment when p1=2 and p2=2: \n            Alice has eaten the first 2 candies: indices0 and 1 -> 2\n            Bob has eaten the last 2 candies: indices3 and 4 -> 2\n            Then we recorded 2 (from Alice) + 2 (from Bob) = 4.\n\n        But note: the candy at index2 (the middle) is not eaten by either? \n\n        How can they eat 4 candies? \n            Alice: [1,1] (from the left) -> 2\n            Bob: [1,1] (from the right) -> 2\n            Total 4.\n\n        And the sums are equal? 2==2 -> yes.\n\n        So the answer 4 is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO for program1.py is:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: we must be cautious that p1 is within bounds? The condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2. When p1 is at the last candy, then p1-1 = n-2, and p2 might be at 0? Then the condition is n-2<=0? which might be false? \n\n        Actually, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So if p1 is already beyond the condition, we break.\n\n        Also, when we update p1, we do p1+=1, and then we break the loop next time? \n\n        But we are updating p1 only if p1 is still valid? The list l has indices from 0 to n-1. We are using p1 as an index. We must not go beyond n? \n\n        The condition: while (p1-1<=p2) -> when p1 becomes n, then p1-1 = n-1, and if p2 is at least 0, then n-1<=p2? But p2 is at most n-1? \n\n        Actually, when p1 becomes n, then we break the loop? \n\n        How? \n            At the beginning of the loop: p1-1 = n-1, and we require n-1<=p2? \n            But p2 is at least -1? Actually, p2 starts at n-1 and decreases. \n\n        We break when p1-1>p2.\n\n        So if p1 becomes n, then p1-1 = n-1, and if p2 is at least n-1? But p2 started at n-1 and we have been decreasing it? \n\n        Actually, we break when p1-1>p2. \n\n        Example: n=1: \n            Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n            Then: s1==s2 (0) -> record 0 + (1-1-0)=0 -> then s1=l[0], p1=1.\n            Then we check: s1 (l[0]) < s2 (0)? false -> then s2 (0) < s1 (l[0])? true -> then s2 += l[0], p2=-1.\n\n            Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=-1 -> condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n        So we break.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: we must check that p1 is not beyond the array? However, the condition of the while loop ensures that we are safe? \n\n        Actually, when p1 is at n, then we break the loop? But in the update, we are using l[p1] when p1 is at most n-1? \n\n        How? The condition of the loop is p1-1<=p2. When p1 is n, then p1-1 = n-1. We break when n-1>p2? \n\n        But when p1 is n, we are not in the loop? \n\n        Actually, the update for p1: we do p1+=1 only after we have used l[p1]. So we must have p1 <= n-1 when we do l[p1]? \n\n        How do we ensure that? \n\n        The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> then p1 <= p2+1. \n\n        Since p2 is at least -1? \n\n        But when p2 is at least 0, then p1 <= p2+1. And p2+1 is at most n? \n\n        However, when p1 = p2+1, then we are about to break? \n\n        But we are updating: we do s1 += l[p1] and then p1 becomes p1+1. Then the next time we check the condition: (p1-1) = p2+1, and we require p2+1<=p2? -> false. So we break.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop: (p1-1<=p2) -> we are using p1-1. We are updating p1 to p1+1, so we are effectively increasing the left index.\n\n        We are also updating p2 to p2-1 in the other branch.\n\n        Therefore, we fill:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the code already has:\n\n            if s1 == s2: ... \n            if s1 < s2: ... \n            if s2 < s1: ... \n\n        We are not using elif? So we might do multiple branches? \n\n        However, the problem: after updating in the first branch (s1==s2) we then check the next condition? \n\n        But we want to do only one update per iteration? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we are updating the left in the first branch and then we check the next condition? \n\n        How about we change the structure to:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                ... \n            elif s1 < s2: \n                ... \n            else: \n                ... \n\n        But the problem says: we cannot change the structure arbitrarily? We are only to fill the TODO.\n\n        The TODO is only for the branch s1 < s2. The other branches are already written.\n\n        However, the current code has:\n\n            if s1 == s2: ... \n            if s1 < s2: ... \n            if s2 < s1: ... \n\n        This is not the same as if-elif. \n\n        But note: after updating in the first if, the state might change so that the next condition is true? \n\n        We have to avoid updating twice? \n\n        How about we break the update into one per iteration? \n\n        Actually, the problem: we are updating the left in the first if, and then we check the next condition? \n\n        Example: \n            s1==s2: we update the left -> now s1 becomes larger? Then we check s1 < s2? false. Then we check s2 < s1? true -> then we update the right? \n\n        So we update both in one iteration? \n\n        That is acceptable? \n\n        But note: the problem says they can eat independently? \n\n        However, the problem: we are only allowed to update one candy per person per time? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the order? \n\n        But the two-pointer method we are using is standard for such problems (like two-sum in a sorted array) but here the array is not sorted? \n\n        However, the problem: we are allowed to eat contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right? \n\n        But note: the two-pointer method we are using is not necessarily contiguous? \n\n        Actually, the problem: Alice eats from the left in a contiguous segment? But we are taking the leftmost candies one by one? That is contiguous. Similarly for Bob.\n\n        And we are only moving the pointers from the ends? \n\n        Therefore, the method is valid.\n\n        And updating both in one iteration is acceptable? \n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop: we break when p1-1>p2. \n\n        And we update the left and then the right? Then we break? \n\n        Actually, we do one iteration per update? \n\n        But we are doing two updates? \n\n        However, the total number of iterations is at most n? \n\n        Actually, each iteration we update at least one pointer? But sometimes two? \n\n        The worst-case: we update two per iteration? Then the total iterations is about n/2? \n\n        And the total n over test cases is 200000, so 200000 iterations? That is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py as:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: we must be cautious that p1 is not beyond the array? \n\n        The condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> which means p1 <= p2+1. \n\n        When we are at the last candy for the left, p1 = p2+1? Then we break? \n\n        Actually, we update p1 to p1+1 only after we have used l[p1]. So we require that p1 is at most p2? \n\n        But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        When p1==p2+1, then we are about to break? \n\n        But we are updating: we do s1 += l[p1] when p1 is at most p2? \n\n        Actually, the condition p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        We are going to use l[p1] only if p1 is in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But if p1==p2+1, then p1 might be n? \n\n        Example: p2 = n-1, then p1<=n -> so p1 can be n? \n\n        But the array l has indices from 0 to n-1. So l[p1] when p1=n would be out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n        How? \n\n        The condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. \n\n        When p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1, and we break if n-1>p2? \n\n        But we are updating p1 only in the branches. \n\n        In the branch for s1 < s2: we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]   # p1 must be <= n-1? \n\n        How do we know that p1 is at most n-1? \n\n        The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        Since p2 is at least -1? \n\n        But when p2 is at least 0, then p1<=p2+1. \n\n        And p2+1 is at most n? \n\n        However, if p2 is n-1, then p1 can be n? \n\n        Then we would try to access l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must break the loop when p1>n-1? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2. \n\n        When p1 = n, then p1-1 = n-1, and we break if n-1>p2? \n\n        But if p2 is n-1, then n-1<=n-1 -> true -> we enter the loop.\n\n        Then we do the update: we try to access l[p1] = l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        So we must avoid that.\n\n        How about we change the condition? \n\n        But the problem says: we cannot change the provided code arbitrarily? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem states: the total n over test cases is 200000, and each test case n is at most 200000? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change the condition? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        Therefore, we must not change the condition.\n\n        How about we add a condition inside the branch? \n\n        But the problem: we are only to write the code for the TODO branch? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            if p1 <= n-1: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop ensures that p1-1<=p2, and p2 is at least 0? \n\n        Actually, p2 can be negative? \n\n        Example: when p2 becomes -1, then we break? \n\n        But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> if p2 is -1, then we require p1-1<=-1 -> p1<=0. \n\n        So if p1 is 0, then we enter the loop? \n\n        Then we do the update: we might update the left? \n\n        But if p1=0, then we can do l[0]? \n\n        Then we update p1 to 1. \n\n        Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=-1 -> condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n        So it's safe? \n\n        But the problem is when p1 = n? \n\n        How can p1 become n? \n\n        We start at 0 and we do p1+=1 until n. \n\n        The last update: when p1 = n-1, we do:\n\n            s1 += l[n-1] \n            p1 = n\n\n        Then we break the loop? \n\n        But then we don't use l[n]? \n\n        Actually, we use l[p1] when p1 is n-1? \n\n        Then we update p1 to n. \n\n        Then next iteration: condition: n-1<=p2? \n\n        But p2 is at least -1? \n\n        We break if n-1>p2? \n\n        So we break.\n\n        Therefore, we never use l[n]? \n\n        But what if we are in the branch for s1 < s2 and p1 is n? \n\n        How can p1 be n? \n\n        We are in the loop: condition p1-1<=p2 -> which is n-1<=p2? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]   # p1 = n -> index out of bounds.\n\n        So we must avoid that.\n\n        How about we break the branch if p1 is already beyond n-1? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> and we are about to update the left? \n\n        We can check if p1 < n? \n\n        Actually, the problem: the array l has n elements, indices 0 to n-1.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 < n: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> and p1 might be n? \n\n        But if p1 is n, then we break the loop? \n\n        Actually, we are in the loop, so p1-1<=p2 -> which is true. \n\n        Then we do the branch: if s1 < s2 -> then we do the update? \n\n        But p1 is n -> we cannot access l[n]. \n\n        Therefore, we must check p1 < n.\n\n        But the problem: we are only to write the code for the TODO? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            if p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the condition of the while loop ensures that p1 is at most p2+1, but p2+1 might be n? \n\n        And p1 might be n? \n\n        So we must check.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are guaranteed that the array has n elements.\n\n        But to avoid index error, we must check.\n\n        However, the problem: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> which means p1<=p2+1. \n\n        And p2 is at least -1? \n\n        But when p1 is n, then we require n-1<=p2. \n\n        And p2 is at most n-1? \n\n        So if p2 is n-1, then n-1<=n-1 -> true. \n\n        Then we enter the loop. \n\n        Then we do the branch: if s1 < s2 -> then we try to update the left? \n\n        But p1 is n -> we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, we must break out of the loop? \n\n        But the problem: we are only to write the code for the branch? \n\n        How about we do nothing in that branch? \n\n        But then we would be stuck in an infinite loop? \n\n        Actually, we would do nothing and then the next condition: if s2 < s1? -> then we update the right? \n\n        But if p2 is already negative? \n\n        Actually, p2 is at least -1? \n\n        But in the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> when p1=n, then we require n-1<=p2. \n\n        And p2 is at least n-1? \n\n        So p2 must be at least n-1? \n\n        But p2 started at n-1 and we have been decreasing it? \n\n        So p2 cannot be more than n-1? \n\n        Therefore, p2 is exactly n-1? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                # we do nothing? because p1 is n? \n            then if s2 < s1: \n                s2 += l[p2]   # p2 = n-1 -> valid\n                p2 -= 1   # becomes n-2\n\n        Then we break the next iteration? \n\n        But we updated the right? \n\n        However, we are not updating the left? \n\n        But the problem: we are stuck? \n\n        Actually, we are updating the right? \n\n        Then we break the next iteration? \n\n        But the condition: p1-1 = n-1, and p2 = n-2 -> n-1<=n-2? false -> break.\n\n        So we break.\n\n        But we did not update the left? \n\n        And we did not record any new equality? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem: we are in the branch for s1 < s2, and we did nothing? \n\n        Then we move to the next condition? \n\n        But the problem: we are not updating? \n\n        How about we break the loop? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change the structure? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the condition of the while loop is not sufficient to prevent index out of bounds? \n\n        Therefore, to be safe, we should check p1 < n in the branch for s1 < s2.\n\n        We write:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                if p1 < n:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are guaranteed that the array has n elements.\n\n        And p1 is at most n? \n\n        But we are updating p1 only by one at a time? \n\n        And we start at 0 and go to n? \n\n        So when p1 is n, we break the loop? \n\n        Actually, we break the loop next time? \n\n        But we are in the loop now? \n\n        Therefore, we must avoid l[p1] when p1==n.\n\n        So we add the condition.\n\n        But the problem: the provided code for the other branches does not have such a condition? \n\n        In the s1==s2 branch, we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]; p1+=1\n\n        without checking? \n\n        Similarly, in the s2 < s1 branch, we do:\n\n            s2 += l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        without checking? \n\n        But in the s2 < s1 branch, we are using p2, which is at least 0? \n\n        Actually, p2 can be -1? \n\n        How? \n\n        The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> and we are about to update the right? \n\n        If p2 is -1, then we break the loop? \n\n        But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> if p2 is -1, then we require p1-1<=-1 -> p1<=0. \n\n        Then we enter the loop? \n\n        Then we do the branch: if s2 < s1 -> then we do:\n\n            s2 += l[p2]   # p2=-1 -> index out of bounds.\n\n        So we should also check p2>=0 in the s2 < s1 branch? \n\n        But the problem: we are not allowed to change that branch? \n\n        Therefore, to be consistent, we should not change the branch for s1 < s2 arbitrarily? \n\n        But the problem says: we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        And the TODO is only for the branch s1 < s2. \n\n        And the other branches are provided and might have the same issue? \n\n        However, the problem states that the total n over test cases is 200000, and the sum of n over test cases is 200000? \n\n        Actually, the input specification: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5.\"\n\n        So we will not have an array of size 200000 in one test case? \n\n        Actually, the constraint: n in one test case can be up to 200000, and the total n over test cases is 200000? \n\n        That means there is only one test case? \n\n        Because 200000 (for one test case) is the total? \n\n        Or multiple test cases, but the sum of n is 200000? \n\n        So the maximum n in one test case is 200000, but the total n (for all test cases) is 200000? \n\n        Therefore, there is at most one test case? \n\n        Actually, no: t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000. \n\n        So we can have up to 10000 test cases, but the average n is 20? \n\n        So the worst-case n is 200000? \n\n        But the total n is 200000, so there is only one test case with n=200000? \n\n        Or two test cases: one with 100000 and one with 100000? \n\n        But 100000+100000=200000.\n\n        So we might have a test case with n=200000? \n\n        And in that test case, we might have p1 going to n? \n\n        Then we would get an index error.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n        But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO? \n\n        How about we assume that the provided code for the other branches is safe? \n\n        But it is not: the branch for s1==s2 also updates the left without checking p1<n? \n\n        Similarly, the branch for s2<s1 updates the right without checking p2>=0? \n\n        Therefore, the entire code might have index errors? \n\n        But the problem: the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> which ensures that p1<=p2+1. \n\n        And for the left update: we use l[p1] only if p1 is in [0, n-1]? \n\n        How? \n\n        When we update the left, we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]   # p1 is the current pointer.\n\n        But the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        And p2 is at most n-1? \n\n        So p1<=n? \n\n        But we need p1<=n-1 to avoid index out of bounds.\n\n        So if p1==n, then we break? \n\n        But the condition allows p1=n? \n\n        Therefore, we must check in every branch that the index is valid? \n\n        But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        Given the constraints, and that the total n is 200000, and the worst-case n is 200000, we might have p1=n in the branch for s1==s2? \n\n        How? \n\n        Example: n=1, we did the left update and then the right update? \n\n        In the first test case with n=1:\n\n            p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n            s1==s2 (0) -> record 0, then s1 += l[0] -> s1=w0, p1=1.\n            then we check: s1 (w0) < s2 (0)? false.\n            then s2 (0) < s1 (w0)? true -> then s2 += l[0] -> s2=w0, p2=-1.\n\n            Then break.\n\n        So p1=1, which is n, but we did not use l[1]? \n\n        In the s1==s2 branch, we used l[0] (valid) and then p1 became 1.\n\n        Then in the next branch for s2<s1, we used l[0] again? \n\n        But wait: p2 is 0 at that moment? \n\n        Then we did l[p2] = l[0] -> valid.\n\n        Then p2 becomes -1.\n\n        So no index out of bounds.\n\n        Now, consider a test case with n=200000, and the entire array is 1's.\n\n        We might have p1 going to 200000? \n\n        When p1=200000, then in the branch for s1==s2, we would do:\n\n            s1 += l[200000] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        But how can p1 become 200000? \n\n        We start at 0, and we do p1+=1 until 200000.\n\n        The last update: when p1=199999, we do:\n\n            s1 += l[199999] -> valid, then p1=200000.\n\n        Then we break the next iteration? \n\n        Because the condition: p1-1=199999<=p2? \n\n        What is p2 at that moment? \n\n        In the same iteration, after updating the left in the s1==s2 branch, we then check the next conditions? \n\n        Then we might update the right? \n\n        But then we would use l[p2] with p2 being some index? \n\n        But p2 might be 0? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            s2 += l[0] -> valid.\n\n        Then p2 becomes -1.\n\n        Then next iteration: p1=200000, p2=-1 -> condition: 199<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n        So we never use l[200000]? \n\n        Therefore, the only time we use l[p1] is when p1 is in [0, n-1]? \n\n        Because we update p1 after using it.\n\n        Similarly for p2: we use it and then decrement.\n\n        So the code is safe.\n\n        Therefore, for the TODO in program1.py, we can simply write:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        without any condition.\n\n        Because p1 is at most p2+1, and p2+1 is at most n-1+1 = n, but we are using l[p1] when p1 is at most p2+1-1? \n\n        Actually, at the moment of using, p1 is at most p2+1? \n\n        But the array has size n, indices 0..n-1. \n\n        And p2+1 might be n? \n\n        But then p1 would be n? \n\n        But note: in the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        When p1 = p2+1, then we are about to break? \n\n        But we are in the loop, and we are about to update? \n\n        However, if p1 = p2+1, then p1 might be n? \n\n        But p2+1 = n -> p2 = n-1. \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1] = l[n] -> out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, we must ensure that p1 < n.\n\n        But how? \n\n        The condition p1-1<=p2 -> p1<=p2+1. \n\n        And p2 is at least 0 and at most n-1. \n\n        So p1 is at most n. \n\n        We only want to update if p1 < n.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            if s1 < s2 and p1 < n:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But the problem: the other branches do not have this check? \n\n        In the s1==s2 branch, we do:\n\n            if p1 < n: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        ? But we are not allowed to change that branch.\n\n        Given the constraints (total n over test cases 200000) and that the worst-case n is 200000, and the sum of n is 200000, there is only one test case with n=200000? \n\n        Or multiple test cases with small n? \n\n        But the maximum n in a test case can be 200000.\n\n        And in that test case, we might have p1 become 200000? \n\n        Then in the s1==s2 branch, we would try to access l[200000] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code for program1.py is not safe? \n\n        But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        We are not allowed to change the other branches.\n\n        Therefore, we must hope that the condition of the while loop and the updates ensure that p1 is always < n? \n\n        How? \n\n        In the s1==s2 branch, we do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]   # p1 is the current value\n            p1 += 1\n\n        Then after that, p1 might be n? \n\n        But then we break the loop next time? \n\n        And we don't use l[p1] again in that branch? \n\n        We used it before the increment.\n\n        So in the s1==s2 branch, we use l[p1] when p1 is in [0, n-1]? \n\n        Because if p1 were n, we wouldn't be in the loop? \n\n        The condition: p1-1<=p2 -> if p1 is n, then p1-1 = n-1, and we require n-1<=p2. \n\n        But p2 is at most n-1, so we enter the loop? \n\n        Then in the s1==s2 branch, we try to do:\n\n            s1 += l[p1] = l[n] -> index out of bounds.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code has an index out of bounds error? \n\n        To fix this, we would need to change the condition of the while loop or add checks in every branch.\n\n        But the problem: we are only to fill the TODO. \n\n        Given the complexity, and that the online judge might have large inputs, we must make it safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        So for program1.py, we output only the code for the TODO branch.\n\n        And we hope that the provided code for the other branches is safe? \n\n        But it is not.\n\n        Alternatively, we can assume that the provided code for the other branches is correct and safe? \n\n        But the condition of the while loop is provided, and the other branches are provided.\n\n        And the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        We are to output the missing code.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, we output:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        And hope that in the branch for s1 < s2, p1 is always < n.\n\n        But from the examples we tried, it is safe.\n\n        For instance, in the example [1,2,3,1,1] (n=5), the last value of p1 is 3, which is <5.\n\n        In the example [1,1,1,1,1] (n=5), the last value of p1 is 3, which is <5.\n\n        In the example [1] (n=1), p1 becomes 1, which is not <1? \n\n        But in the branch for s1 < s2, we never use p1=1? \n\n        In the first test case with n=1, after the s1==s2 branch, p1 becomes 1. Then we are in the loop? \n\n        Then we check: s1 < s2? -> false. Then s2 < s1? -> true: then we do s2 += l[p2] with p2=0 -> valid.\n\n        Then p2 becomes -1.\n\n        Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=-1 -> condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n        So we never use the branch for s1 < s2 when p1=1.\n\n        Therefore, it is safe.\n\n        So we write for program1.py:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: in the branch for s1 < s2, we might have p1 = n? \n\n        How? \n\n        Only if we enter the branch when p1 = n-1, then we do:\n\n            s1 += l[n-1] -> valid.\n            p1 = n.\n\n        Then next iteration: we break.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        Now for program2.py.\n\n        We are given a function ban(n) that for n>=2 does:\n\n            x = 0   # operation count\n            lt = [] # list of operations\n            i = 2\n            j = 3 * n\n            while i < j:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We have to fill the TODO.\n\n        The problem: \n            We have a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times.\n            We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (each swap is between two distinct indices) so that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n        The examples:\n            n=1: \n                swap (1,2) -> \"ABN\", which is provided in the code: for n=1, we return [1, [[1,2]]]\n\n            n=2:\n                swap (2,6) -> \"BNNBAA\", which is provided in the example.\n\n        How to generalize?\n\n        Note: the string s(n) = \"BAN\" * n = \"BANBAN...BAN\" (n times)\n\n        The length is 3n.\n\n        We want to remove all occurrences of the subsequence \"BAN\".\n\n        One observation: in the string, we have n occurrences of \"BAN\": \n            The first \"BAN\": positions 1,2,3\n            The second: positions 4,5,6\n            ...\n\n        How to break them? \n\n        Note: a swap might break multiple occurrences? \n\n        The minimum number of operations: the example for n=1 is 1, for n=2 is 1.\n\n        But the sample output for n=2 in the example is 1 operation.\n\n        However, the sample output for n=3? \n\n        The problem: we have to output the minimum number of operations.\n\n        Insight: \n          In each occurrence of \"BAN\", we have 'B' at the first position, 'A' at the second, 'N' at the third.\n\n          To break one occurrence, we can swap any two characters that break the order. For example, swap the 'A' and the 'N' in one occurrence: then we get \"BNA\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n          But wait: in \"BNA\", we can still find \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n            B at position1, A at position3, and N at position2? -> no, because we require B then A then N. In \"BNA\", we have B, then N, then A. So we cannot form \"BAN\".\n\n          But what if we have two occurrences? \n\n          How about we swap the 'A' in the first occurrence with the 'N' in the last occurrence? \n\n          Example for n=2: \n            Original: B A N B A N\n            Swap the A at position2 with the N at position6: \n                becomes: B (6) N (2) B A N -> but wait, we swap index2 and index6:\n                    index1: 'B'\n                    index2: originally 'A' -> becomes the character at index6: 'N'\n                    index3: 'N'\n                    index4: 'B'\n                    index5: 'A'\n                    index6: originally 'N' -> becomes 'A'\n                So the string: \"B\", \"N\", \"N\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\" -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n          How many operations? 1.\n\n          For n=3: \n            We can do:\n                Swap the A in the first occurrence (position2) with the N in the last occurrence (position9): \n                    becomes: B (swap with position9: so becomes the N at the end) at position1, then at position2 we put the character that was at position9: 'N'? \n                    and at position9 we put 'A'\n\n                Then the first occurrence: becomes \"B\" (at1), \"N\" (at2), and the third character of the first occurrence is still at3: 'N'? -> so \"BNN\" for the first three.\n\n                The last occurrence: the first character of the last occurrence is at7: 'B', then at8: 'A', then at9: 'A' (from the swap) -> \"BAA\"\n\n                The middle occurrence: unchanged: \"BAN\"\n\n                Now, does \"BAN\" appear as a subsequence?\n                    We can try: \n                        B: we can take the first B (at1) or the B at4 or at7.\n                        A: then we need an A after that B. In the first occurrence, after the B at1, we have 'N' at2 and 'N' at3 -> no A. \n                        Then we look at the middle occurrence: after the B at4, we have 'A' at5 and then 'N' at6 -> that forms \"BAN\".\n\n                So we need more swaps.\n\n          How about we swap the A in the first occurrence with the N in the last occurrence, and also swap the A in the second occurrence with the N in the second last occurrence? \n\n          For n=3, the second last occurrence is the second occurrence? \n\n          The occurrences are:\n            1: positions 1,2,3\n            2: positions 4,5,6\n            3: positions 7,8,9\n\n          The last occurrence is 3, the second last is 2.\n\n          Swap1: swap(2,9) -> first occurrence: [1: 'B', 2: 'N' (from9), 3: 'N'] -> \"BNN\"\n                   third occurrence: [7: 'B', 8: 'A', 9: 'A' (from2)] -> \"BAA\"\n          Swap2: swap(5,6) -> wait, we want to swap the A in the second occurrence (at5) with the N in the second last occurrence? But the second last occurrence is the second occurrence? \n\n          Alternatively, swap the A in the second occurrence (at5) with the N in the last part of the last occurrence? But we already swapped the last occurrence's N.\n\n          How about swap the A in the second occurrence (at5) with the N in the third occurrence? But the third occurrence's N is at9, which is now 'A'. \n\n          Alternatively, we can swap the A in the second occurrence (at5) with the N in the first occurrence? But the first occurrence's N is at3.\n\n          Swap2: swap(5,3): \n                position3: currently 'N' (from the first occurrence) -> becomes the A from5.\n                position5: becomes 'N'\n                Now the string: \n                    index1: 'B'\n                    index2: 'N' (from first swap)\n                    index3: 'A' (from second swap)\n                    index4: 'B'\n                    index5: 'N' (from second swap)\n                    index6: 'N' (originally at6, unchanged)\n                    index7: 'B'\n                    index8: 'A'\n                    index9: 'A'\n\n                Now: \n                    first occurrence: \"B\", \"N\", \"A\" -> we can form \"B\" at1, \"A\" at3 -> that's \"BA\", but then we need an \"N\" after 3? We have 'N' at5 and at6, so we can form \"BAN\": B at1, A at3, N at5.\n\n          This is complicated.\n\n        Insight from known solutions to similar problems: \n          The minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). \n          And one way is to swap the first character of the i-th \"BAN\" (which is the 'B') with the last character of the (n-i+1)-th \"BAN\" (which is the 'N') for i=1 to ceil(n/2).\n\n          For example, n=1: \n              i=1, swap the 'B' (position1) with the 'N' (position3) -> but the sample swap was (1,2). \n              Alternatively, swap (1,3): \n                  becomes: N at1, A at2, B at3 -> \"NAB\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n          But the sample swap was (1,2): \n                  becomes: A at1, B at2, N at3 -> \"ABN\", which also does not have \"BAN\".\n\n          Both are valid.\n\n          For n=2: \n              i=1: swap the 'B' of the first occurrence (position1) with the 'N' of the last occurrence (position6) -> \n                  becomes: \n                      position1: N (from the last occurrence)\n                      position6: B (from the first occurrence)\n                  The string: N, A, N, B, A, B -> \"NANBAB\"\n              But the sample swap was (2,6) -> which is swapping the 'A' at2 with the 'N' at6 -> \"B\", \"N\", \"N\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\" -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n          How about we swap the 'A's with the 'N's? \n\n          Another known solution: \n            m = (n+1)//2\n            Then for i in range(m):\n                swap the character at position (3*i+1) with the character at position (3*n - 3*i)\n\n          For n=1: \n              i=0: swap (1, 3) -> as above.\n\n          For n=2:\n              i=0: swap (1, 6) -> as above: \"NANBAB\"\n              i=1: not needed because m = (2+1)//2 = 1.\n\n          But the sample swap for n=2 was (2,6) -> which is different.\n\n          However, the problem says: output any shortest sequence.\n\n          How many operations? ceil(n/2).\n\n          For n=1: ceil(1/2)=1.\n          For n=2: ceil(2/2)=1.\n          For n=3: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            m = (n+1) // 2   # ceil(n/2)\n            Then for i in range(m):\n                # We swap the 'A' in the i-th occurrence with the 'N' in the (n-i-1)-th occurrence? \n                # The i-th occurrence: \n                #   'B' at 3*i+0 (if we use 0-indexed) -> but the problem uses 1-indexed.\n                #   'A' at 3*i+1\n                #   'N' at 3*i+2\n                # The (n-i-1)-th occurrence: \n                #   'B' at 3*(n-i-1)\n                #   'A' at 3*(n-i-1)+1\n                #   'N' at 3*(n-i-1)+2\n\n                # We want to swap the 'A' in the i-th occurrence with the 'N' in the (n-i-1)-th occurrence.\n\n                # In 1-indexed:\n                #   i-th occurrence: \n                #       'A' at 3*i+1 - 2? \n                #   Actually, the first occurrence (i=0) has:\n                #       positions: 1,2,3 -> so 'A' at 2.\n                #   The second occurrence (i=1) has: 4,5,6 -> 'A' at 5.\n                #   The (n-i-1)-th occurrence: for i=0, it is the last occurrence: index = n-1 -> which is the last one: \n                #       'N' at 3*(n-1)+3 = 3*n? \n                #   But the last character is at 3*n (1-indexed) -> but the string has length 3*n, so the last index is 3*n.\n\n                #   So for i=0: swap (2, 3*n)\n\n                #   For n=1: swap(2, 3) -> which is the sample for n=1?

\n                For the 'B' at3:\n                    then we need an 'A' after3: \n                        'A's at5,7,8.\n                    then for an 'N' after that 'A': \n                        after5: no 'N'\n                For the 'B' at6:\n                    then we need an 'A' after6: \n                        'A's at7,8.\n                    then for an 'N' after that 'A': \n                        after7: no 'N'\n\n                So no \"BAN\".\n\n            Therefore, it works.\n\n          But note: the sample for n=1 was [1, [[1,2]]] but our method uses [2,3] for n=1.\n\n          The problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any.\n\n          However, the sample for n=1 in the problem is: \n                swap (1,2) -> \"ABN\"\n\n          We can do that too.\n\n          How about we swap the 'B' with the 'A' in the same occurrence? \n\n          In general, we can swap any two within an occurrence to break it? \n\n          But for minimum operations, we want to break two occurrences with one swap? \n\n          However, one swap can only break one occurrence? \n\n          Actually, swapping two characters from two different occurrences might break two occurrences? \n\n          For example, in n=2: \n              swap the 'A' in the first occurrence with the 'N' in the last occurrence: \n                  breaks the first occurrence (because the first occurrence becomes \"B\" then \"N\" then ... -> no 'A' in between? \n                  and the last occurrence: becomes ... then 'A' at the end -> so we have 'B' at the beginning of the last occurrence and 'A' at the end, but we need an 'A' after the 'B' and before the 'N'. \n\n          But in the last occurrence, we now have: \n              positions: originally \"B\", then \"A\", then \"N\" -> after swap: \n                  first occurrence: we took the 'A' and put an 'N' in its place, so the first three: \"B\", \"N\" (from the last occurrence's 'N'), and then the first occurrence's original 'N' is still there? \n                  last occurrence: we put the 'A' (from the first occurrence) in the last position, and the last occurrence's 'N' is gone? \n\n          Actually, we swapped the 'A' in the first occurrence (at2) with the 'N' in the last occurrence (at6). \n          So the last occurrence: \n              'B' at4, 'A' at5, and at6 we have the 'A' from the first occurrence? -> \"B\", \"A\", \"A\" -> no 'N'? \n\n          So the last occurrence is broken.\n\n          And the first occurrence: \"B\", then at2 we have 'N' (from the last occurrence), and at3 we have the original 'N'? -> \"B\", \"N\", \"N\" -> no 'A'? \n\n          So both occurrences are broken.\n\n          Therefore, one swap can break two occurrences.\n\n          Hence, the minimum number of swaps is ceil(n/2).\n\n          And we can break by swapping the 'A' in the i-th occurrence with the 'N' in the (n-i-1)-th occurrence for i in range(ceil(n/2)).\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            In the TODO in the while loop:\n\n                We are given i and j, with i starting at 2 and j starting at 3*n.\n\n                We want to do for k in range(ceil(n/2)): \n                    operation: swap(i, j) \n                    then update: i += 3? and j -= 3? \n\n                But the while loop condition: i < j.\n\n                How about:\n\n                    x = 0\n                    lt = []\n                    i = 2   # this is the first 'A' in the first occurrence (1-indexed: 2)\n                    j = 3*n   # this is the last 'N' in the last occurrence (1-indexed: 3*n)\n\n                    while i < j:\n                        # we do a swap between i and j\n                        lt.append([i, j])\n                        x += 1\n                        # then we move i to the next occurrence: next 'A' is 3 more? \n                        i += 3\n                        # and j to the 'N' in the previous occurrence: 3 less?\n                        j -= 3\n                        # but we do this only for ceil(n/2) times? \n                        # but the while loop condition: i<j, and we do until i>=j.\n\n                How many times? \n                    i starts at 2, then 5, 8, ...\n                    j starts at 3*n, then 3*n-3, 3*n-6, ...\n\n                We stop when i>=j.\n\n                How many operations? \n                    The number of operations is the number of times we do the loop.\n\n                For n=1: \n                    i=2, j=3 -> 2<3 -> true: do swap(2,3), then i=5, j=0 -> 5<0 false -> break.\n                    So one operation: correct.\n\n                For n=2:\n                    i=2, j=6 -> 2<6: swap(2,6), then i=5, j=3 -> 5<3 false -> break.\n                    So one operation: correct.\n\n                For n=3:\n                    i=2, j=9 -> swap(2,9) -> then i=5, j=6 -> 5<6: swap(5,6) -> then i=8, j=3 -> 8<3 false -> break.\n                    So two operations: correct.\n\n                But note: for n=3, the second swap is (5,6): \n                    But 6 is not 3*(n-i) for i=1? \n                    For i=1: we would want to swap the 'A' in the second occurrence (which is at 3*1+2=5) with the 'N' in the (3-1-1)=1-th occurrence? \n                    The 1-th occurrence (0-indexed) is the second occurrence? \n                    And the 'N' in the second occurrence is at 3*1+3=6? \n                    So yes, (5,6) is swapping the 'A' and the 'N' in the second occurrence? \n\n                But wait, we intended to swap the 'A' in the i-th occurrence with the 'N' in the (n-i-1)-th occurrence. \n                For i=1 and n=3: \n                    the (n-i-1)-th occurrence = 3-1-1=1 -> the second occurrence (0-indexed index1) -> and the 'N' in that occurrence is at 3*(1)+3 = 6? \n                So it is the same.\n\n                Therefore, the while loop naturally does ceil(n/2) operations.\n\n          So the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n                lt.append([i, j])\n                x += 1\n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n          But note: the problem says the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2), and we are doing exactly that.\n\n          Therefore, we fill:\n\n                lt.append([i, j])\n                x += 1\n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n        However, the problem: the while loop condition is i<j, and we update i and j, and then the condition is checked.\n\n        This will do the swaps for the first ceil(n/2) pairs.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                lt.append([i, j])\n                x += 1\n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n        But note: the variables are i and j, and we are updating them.\n\n        And the while loop condition is i<j.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n        For program1.py: \"s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n        For program2.py: \"lt.append([i, j])\\n        x += 1\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n\n        But note: the indentation in program2.py: the TODO is inside the while loop, and we are to write the code for the while loop body.\n\n        And the code after that is the closing of the while loop and then return.\n\n        So we write the four lines.\n\n        However, the problem: in program2.py, the while loop is:\n\n            while i < j:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO with the four lines.\n\n        But the TODO is a comment, so we remove it and put the four lines.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"lt.append([i, j])\\n        x += 1\\n        i += 3\\n        j -= 3\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program2.py code has the variable 'x' for the count, and we are incrementing it.\n\n        And we are appending the pair [i,j] to lt.\n\n        And then updating i and j.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let's write the exact code.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is exactly:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the existing code has:\n\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But the next line is:\n\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        So we must not break the indentation.\n\n        We write:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But the existing code has the condition and then a comment. We replace the comment and the next line (which is empty) with the two lines, properly indented.\n\n        However, the problem: the provided code has:\n\n            if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace that with:\n\n            if s1 < s2: \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        But then the next condition is:\n\n            if s2 < s1: ...\n\n        So we have:\n\n            if ...: \n                ...\n            if ...: \n                ...\n            if ...: \n                ...\n\n        Which is what we had.\n\n        Therefore, we output the two lines with an extra indentation level (one level deeper than the if).\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, we output four lines, each indented one level deeper than the while.\n\n        The existing code in program2.py has:\n\n            while i < j:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            lt.append([i, j])\n            x += 1\n            i += 3\n            j -= 3\n\n        But note: the next line is the end of the while loop.\n\n        And the code is:\n\n            while i < j:\n                lt.append([i, j])\n                x += 1\n                i += 3\n                j -= 3\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
