    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code is almost complete. We are missing the condition for Division 2.\nAccording to the problem, Division 2 is for ratings between 1600 and 1899 (inclusive).\nIn the current code, we have:\n  if num>=1900: ... (Division 1)\n  elif num>=1600: ... (Division 2)\n  elif num>=1400: ... (Division 3)\n  else: ... (Division 4)\n\nNote that the condition for Division 2 is satisfied when the rating is at least 1600 and less than 1900.\nBut note that the condition for Division 1 (>=1900) has already been checked. So in the elif num>=1600, we know that the rating is between 1600 and 1899 (because if it were 1900 or above, it would have been caught by the first condition). Therefore, we can simply print \"Division 2\".\n\nSo the missing line for program1.py is:\n    print(\"Division 2\")\n\nBut note: the problem says that the rating can be as low as -5000 and as high as 5000. However, the conditions are set appropriately.\n\nFor program2.py:\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The process in each second:\n  1. Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, you can infect at most one additional child (if available and not infected) of your choice.\n  2. Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\nWe are given the code for program2.py, but there is a TODO in the binary search part.\n\nThe current approach in the function `solve`:\n  - We have a `counter` dictionary that counts the number of children for each node? Actually, note: the input gives the parent of each vertex (from vertex 2 to n). So we can build the children count for each node? But note: the root is 1, and we are counting the frequency of each parent. So `counter` will have the count of children for each node that is a parent.\n\n  Steps in the code:\n    1. We read the test cases.\n    2. For each test case, we have a list of n-1 integers (the parent for vertices 2 to n). We count the frequency of each parent (so the root 1 will be included, and every parent node). The root has no parent in the list? Actually, the list starts from p2 (parent of 2) to pn (parent of n). So the root (vertex 1) will appear as a parent for some children.\n\n    3. Then we make a list `count` of the frequencies (the number of children for each node). But note: the root is not counted as a child? Actually, the root is not in the list as a child? The frequencies are the counts of children for each node.\n\n    4. We sort the `count` list.\n\n    5. Then we adjust: for each index i (0-indexed), we do:\n          count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n    Why? The idea is that we start with the root. The root must be infected by an injection at time 0? Then in the next seconds, we can use spreading and injections.\n\n    Actually, the problem states that initially all are healthy. Then we start at second 0? But note the process: each second has two operations (spreading and then injection). However, the problem says \"each second\" and then the process repeats until the whole tree is infected.\n\n    The known solution for this problem is:\n        - We note that the root must be infected by an injection (since it has no parent to spread to it). So we start by infecting the root (at time 0? but then the process starts at second 1?).\n\n    Actually, the minimal seconds is computed as:\n\n        Let the root be infected at time 0? Then we have to account for the spreading and injections.\n\n    Alternative known solution:\n\n        We can model the problem as:\n          We start with the root infected (at time 0). Then we have a list of the children counts for each node.\n\n          The infection spreads in two ways: by injection (which we can do arbitrarily) and by spreading (which is limited: at most one per infected node that has at least one infected child? and then we can choose one more child to infect per such node).\n\n        The known approach:\n\n          Step 1: We build the tree and compute the children for each node. Then we do a BFS or DFS? Actually, the given code does:\n\n          Instead, we note that the problem can be solved by:\n\n            Let f(v) be the time when the entire subtree rooted at v is infected.\n\n            However, the constraints (sum of n over test cases <= 200000) and the fact that the input gives the parent of each vertex (so we can build the tree) but the code does not build the tree? It uses a frequency count.\n\n          Actually, the code uses:\n\n            counter: counts the number of children for each node? But note: the root is included? And what about non-leaf nodes? The frequency list `count` is built from the counts of each parent.\n\n          Then the code does:\n\n            count = list(counter.values())\n            num_level = len(count)   # This is the number of nodes that have at least one child? Actually, it's the number of distinct parents that appear? But note: the root (1) is included? Yes, because the root is the parent of some nodes.\n\n          Then we sort the count.\n\n          Then we adjust: for i in range(num_level):\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n          Why i+2? The idea is that we have i+1 (because i starts at 0) and then we subtract 1 more? Actually, the known solution from other Codeforces submissions:\n\n          There is a known solution:\n\n            We start with the root infected at time 0. Then we have a list of the children counts for each node. We sort the children counts (the number of children per node) in descending order? Actually, in the code we sort in ascending order? But then we subtract an index and then do a binary search.\n\n          The known solution steps:\n\n            Step 1: We note that we start with the root infected (time 0). Then we have to infect the children of the root. How?\n\n            Step 2: The infection can be spread from the root to one child per second? But also we can do injections arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, the solution:\n\n              Let the initial set of infected nodes be {root}. Then we have a list of the children counts for each node. We are going to simulate the spread.\n\n            However, the code does:\n\n              count.sort()   # sorts in increasing order? Actually, the list of children counts.\n\n              Then we subtract (i+2) from each count? Why?\n\n          Explanation from known similar problems (like Codeforces Round #783 (Div. 2) problem D):\n\n            We start at time 0 with the root infected.\n\n            Then, for each node, we can consider the time to infect all its children. But note: the spreading operation: at each second, for a node that has at least one child infected, we can infect one more child. So if a node has k children, then we need k seconds? But we can also use injections.\n\n          Actually, the solution in the code:\n\n            We have an array `count` of the number of children for each node (but note: the root is included? and the root has no parent, so we must account for the root separately?).\n\n            The root is infected at time 0. Then we have to infect its children. How?\n\n            The root has, say, c0 children. We can infect one child by injection at time 1? Then at time 2, we can use the root to spread to one more child? and also we can inject one more? But note: the spreading operation: for the root, if at least one child is infected (which is true at time 1) then we can spread to one more child at time 1? Actually, the process in one second:\n\n              Second 1:\n                Spreading: the root has one child infected? Actually, at the beginning (second 0) we have only the root. Then at second 1, we do:\n                  Spreading: for the root, we can spread to one child? But wait, initially no child is infected. So we cannot spread at the first second? Then we do injection: we inject one child of the root.\n\n              Then at second 2:\n                Spreading: the root now has one infected child, so we can spread to one more child? Then we spread to a second child of the root. Then we do injection: we can inject a child of the root? or a node elsewhere? Actually, we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n            However, the problem is that we can choose which child to spread and which to inject.\n\n          The known solution:\n\n            We start with the root at time 0.\n\n            Then we have a list of the children counts for each node. We sort the counts in descending order? Actually, the code sorts in ascending order? Then we subtract an index and then do a binary search.\n\n          The idea:\n\n            We have an array `a` of the children counts (for each node that has children). We also note that the root must be infected at time 0, and then we have to account for the children.\n\n            The time to infect the entire tree is:\n\n              base = 1 (for the root? but then we start at time 0) ... actually, the root is infected at time 0, so we start counting from 0.\n\n            Then we consider: we have to \"schedule\" the infection of the children of each node.\n\n            For a node with k children, the infection of its children will take time? The first child can be infected by injection at time t0, then the next by spreading at time t0+1? But note: we can interleave injections and spreading for different nodes.\n\n          Actually, the solution in the code:\n\n            We sort the children counts (the number of children for each node) in ascending order? Then we adjust:\n\n                count[i] = max(count[i] - i - 2, 0)\n\n            Why i+2? The index i (from 0 to num_level-1) and we subtract (i+2). Then we set negative values to 0.\n\n            Then we do a binary search on a variable R (which represents extra seconds needed) from 0 to max(count) (which is the maximum of the adjusted counts).\n\n            Then we check if we can cover the remaining infections (the adjusted counts) with k extra seconds? The function `check(k)` does:\n\n                b = count.copy()\n                for i in range(len(b)):\n                    b[i] = max(b[i] - k, 0)\n                if sum(b) <= k: then k is enough.\n\n            Then we do binary search for the minimal k (which is R) such that check(k) is true.\n\n            Then the answer is: num_level + 1 + R\n\n          What is num_level? It is the number of nodes that have children? Actually, the number of distinct parents that appear? But note: the root is included. And the root is the only node that has no parent? But we are counting the nodes that are parents (so they have at least one child).\n\n          Why num_level + 1 + R?\n\n          Explanation:\n\n            The base time is num_level + 1? Then we add R.\n\n          But note: the root is infected at time 0. Then we have to account for the time to infect the children of the root and the children of other nodes.\n\n          Known similar solution (from Codeforces submissions for problem \"D. Social Network\"):\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Let a = list of children counts (for each node that has children) and then we also include the root? Actually, the root is the starting point.\n\n              We sort a in increasing order? Actually, in the known solution, we sort in decreasing order? But here we sort in increasing order.\n\n          However, the code we have to complete:\n\n            We have:\n\n              if R == 0:\n                  return num_level + 1\n\n            Then we do binary search for R in [L, R] (with L=0, R = max(count)) and we want the minimal R such that check(R) is true.\n\n            Then we return num_level+1+R.\n\n          The TODO is in the binary search:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if check(mid):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          In the else branch, we want to set L to mid? Because if check(mid) is false, then we need more than mid, so we set L = mid.\n\n          So the missing line is: L = mid\n\n          But note: the binary search is set up to find the minimal R (which is the extra seconds) such that check(R) is true. The initial R is set to the maximum of the adjusted counts. Then we are doing:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (L+R)//2\n                if check(mid): \n                    R = mid   # because we can do with mid, so we try to lower R\n                else:\n                    L = mid   # we need more than mid, so we set L to mid and then next we check [mid, R]\n\n          This is a standard binary search for the minimal value that satisfies the condition.\n\n          However, note that the condition is: we want the minimal k such that check(k) is true. The binary search is set to narrow down the interval [L, R] until it is of length 1, then we break and return R.\n\n          But the condition in the while loop is R-L>1, so when we break, we have R = L+1? Then we return R.\n\n          So the missing line for program2.py is: L = mid\n\n          But note: the code after the while loop returns num_level+1+R.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the initial R is set to max(count) (which is the maximum of the adjusted counts). Then we are reducing R until we find the minimal k that satisfies the condition.\n\n          Example: if we have count = [0,0,0] then R=0 and we skip the binary search. Then we return num_level+1.\n\n          What if the binary search runs? For example, if we have count = [1,2,3] (after adjustment) then:\n\n            We set L=0, R=3 (max(count)=3).\n\n            Then mid = (0+3)//2 = 1 -> check(1): \n                b = [max(1-1,0)=0, max(2-1,0)=1, max(3-1,0)=2] -> sum=0+1+2=3. Then 3<=1? -> False -> so we set L=1.\n\n            Then mid = (1+3)//2 = 2 -> check(2): \n                b = [max(1-2,0)=0, max(2-2,0)=0, max(3-2,0)=1] -> sum=1. Then 1<=2 -> True -> set R=2.\n\n            Then R-L=1 -> break. Then return num_level+1+2.\n\n          So the code for the else branch is: L = mid\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: L = mid\n\n          But note: the code for program2.py is:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to set L to mid.\n\n          So the line is: L = mid\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the variable names are case-sensitive. The variables are L and R (uppercase) and mid.\n\n          So the code for the else branch is: L = mid\n\n          But note: the problem says the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200000, so the binary search will run in O(log(max(count))) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: L = mid\n\n          However, note that the code for program2.py has an indentation level. We must output the code with the same indentation.\n\n          The current code in the else branch is:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO line with: L = mid\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output in a JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n          For program1.py, the missing code is: print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          For program2.py, the missing code is: L = mid\n\n          However, note that the program2.py code has a while loop and the else branch. We must output the exact line that goes in the else branch.\n\n          But wait: the program2.py code has:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with: L = mid\n\n          But note: the code after the while loop is: return num_level + 1 + R\n\n          So the entire program2.py is as given, and we only fill the else branch.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing line is: print(\"Division 2\") (with the same indentation as the other print statements). The current code has:\n\n            elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We must replace the TODO with the print statement. But note: the current line has a comment. We are to replace the entire line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is on the same line as the condition. We are to complete the condition block.\n\n          The condition block for the elif should be:\n\n            elif num>=1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          But the current code has:\n\n            elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We can simply write: print(\"Division 2\") and then the next line is the next condition.\n\n          However, note that the next condition is on the same level. So we can write:\n\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          But the original code for the other conditions are on the same line. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            elif num>=1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing. The missing part is the body of the elif. Since the other conditions have the print on the same line, we can do the same.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are to output the missing code for the two programs.\n\n          We are to output in JSON:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n          For program1, the completion is the string that replaces the TODO. But note: the TODO is in the middle of a line. We are to output the entire line? Or just the code that goes after the colon?\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program1, the missing part is the body of the elif. Since the condition is already written, we only need to write the body. But the body is a single statement: print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          However, the current line is:\n\n            elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We can replace the comment with the print statement. So the line becomes:\n\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          But note: the next line is an elif. So we must not break the structure.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          This is one line.\n\n          For program2, the missing part is the body of the else branch. The body is: L = mid\n\n          So we write:\n\n            else:\n                L = mid\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing. In the else branch, we are missing the code. We are to output the code that goes in the else branch, which is \"L = mid\", with the same indentation.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          We are to output the exact code that is missing.\n\n          Therefore:\n\n            program1: the missing code is the string: 'print(\"Division 2\")'\n\n            But note: the current line has the condition and a comment. We are replacing the comment with the print. However, the problem says the code is:\n\n                elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are to replace the entire line? Or just the part after the colon? Actually, the problem says \"fill in\" the missing lines or blocks. We are to complete the line by replacing the TODO comment with the code.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". Since the condition is already there, we only need the body.\n\n            However, the problem does not specify whether we should output the entire line or just the body. But the example output format is a string for the completion. We are to output the code that completes the TODO.\n\n            Since the TODO is in the middle of the line, we can output the entire line? But that would duplicate the condition. Alternatively, we can output just the body.\n\n            The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So for program1, the missing code is the body of the elif, which is: print(\"Division 2\")\n\n            Similarly, for program2, the missing code is the body of the else, which is: L = mid\n\n          But note: the program1 code has the condition and then a comment. We are to replace the comment with the body. So we output the body as a string.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          Therefore, for program1, we output: 'print(\"Division 2\")'\n\n          For program2, we output: 'L = mid'\n\n          But note: the program2 code has an else branch that currently has a comment. We are to replace the entire block of the else branch? Actually, the else branch currently has:\n\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are to replace the TODO line with the code. So the body of the else is one line: L = mid.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the string: 'L = mid'\n\n          However, we must consider the indentation. The problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the code we output will be inserted at the TODO. The existing code has 8 spaces of indentation for the else branch? Actually, the code is:\n\n            while R - L > 1:\n                mid = (R + L) // 2\n                if(check(mid)):\n                    R = mid\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The else branch is indented by 4 (relative to the while). The body of the else should be indented by 8? Actually, in Python, we use 4 spaces per level. The while loop is at 4, then the body of the while is indented by 8. The if-else is at 8, and the bodies of the if and else are indented by 12.\n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code for the else branch is one line: L = mid, and it should be indented by 12? However, the problem does not require us to output the indentation? Actually, we are to output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is currently at the same indentation as the body of the else. We are to replace the comment with the code, so we output the line: \"L = mid\", with the same indentation as the comment.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact string of whitespace. But since we are outputting the code, we assume that the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent. The else branch is at 8 spaces, and the body should be at 12. So we output 12 spaces and then \"L = mid\"? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code that goes in the program.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But note: the existing code in the if branch is:\n\n                    R = mid\n\n          which is at 12 spaces. So we should output the same for the else branch.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are to output only the missing code. So for program2, we output the string: \"L = mid\", and we assume that the system will insert it with the same indentation as the TODO comment? Actually, the TODO comment is already at the correct indentation. We are replacing the comment with the code, so we output the code without the comment and without changing the indentation.\n\n          Therefore, we output the string \"L = mid\" for program2.\n\n          Similarly, for program1, we output the string 'print(\"Division 2\")' to replace the comment.\n\n          But note: in program1, the condition and the comment are on the same line. We are replacing the entire comment? Then the line becomes:\n\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the next line is an elif. So the structure is:\n\n            if ...: ...\n            elif ...: ...   [this is the line we are completing]\n            elif ...: ...\n            else: ...\n\n          So we output: 'print(\"Division 2\")'\n\n          Therefore, the JSON is:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\",\n              \"program2\": \"L = mid\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program2 code has a while loop and the else branch. The missing code is one line: L = mid.\n\n          However, what if the else branch requires multiple lines? In this case, it's one line.\n\n          Let's write the JSON.\n\n          Important: escape the quotes in the string for program1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the JSON string and then double quotes inside? The problem does not specify. But the example output format uses double quotes for the JSON keys and values.\n\n          We can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          Or:\n\n            \"program1\": \"print('Division 2')\"\n\n          But the original code uses double quotes. So we use double quotes and escape.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use: \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          But note: the original program1 code uses double quotes: print(\"Division 1\") and print(\"Division 3\") etc.\n\n          So we use: \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          For program2: \"L = mid\"\n\n          Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\", \"program2\": \"L = mid\"}\n\n          But wait: the program1 code has the condition and the TODO on the same line. We are replacing the entire comment? Then the line becomes:\n\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          Alternatively, we could break it into two lines:\n\n            elif num>=1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n\n          But the problem does not specify. However, the other conditions are written in one line. So we follow the same style.\n\n          Therefore, we output the one-line version.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are free to output a block? But the condition body is a single statement, so one line is sufficient.\n\n          So we output the one-line version.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is as above."
