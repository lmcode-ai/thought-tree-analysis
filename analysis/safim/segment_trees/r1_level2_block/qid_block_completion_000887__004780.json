    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current code is trying to count pairs (i, j) (i<j) such that the two strings of length 2 differ in exactly one position.\n The current approach uses a nested loop which is O(n^2) and n can be up to 10^5, so it will be too slow.\n\n We must change the approach to be efficient.\n\n Insight:\n We note that each string has two characters. We want pairs that differ in exactly one position. This means:\n   Either the first character is the same and the second differs, OR the second character is the same and the first differs.\n\n However, note that the current code also has a part for duplicate strings? Actually, the current code has a variable `mul` that seems to count duplicates? But the problem does not require counting duplicates in a particular way.\n\n Actually, the current code has a set `x` that marks indices that are duplicates? But the problem does not mention duplicates. However, note that the same string can appear multiple times.\n\n But the problem says: \"Given n strings\", so duplicates are allowed.\n\n However, the current approach is O(n^2) and will not work for n up to 10^5.\n\n We need an efficient solution.\n\n Alternate approach:\n We can group the strings by their first character and by their second character.\n\n Let:\n   f(c) = list of strings that have first character c\n   g(d) = list of strings that have second character d\n\n But note: we want to count pairs that have:\n   Case 1: same first character, different second character.\n   Case 2: same second character, different first character.\n\n However, note: if two strings are identical, they don't form a valid pair (because they don't differ in exactly one position, they differ in 0). Also, if they differ in both, we skip.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Total pairs that have same first character: for a fixed first character c, let the count of strings with first character c be `cnt1[c]`. Then the number of pairs with same first character is C(cnt1[c],2). But then we subtract the pairs that have the same second character? Actually, no: in the same first character group, we want to count pairs that have different second characters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can count:\n      Case1: same first character, different second: for each first character c, group the strings by their second character. Then for each group of second character d in the group for c, if there are `freq[c][d]` strings, then the number of pairs that have same first character and same second character is C(freq[c][d],2). Then the total pairs with same first character is C(total,2) minus the sum over d of C(freq[c][d],2). But wait: we want pairs that have same first and different second? Then that is exactly: \n          total_pairs_same_first = C(total,2) - sum_{d} C(freq[c][d],2)\n\n   Similarly, for same second character and different first: for each second character d, let the total number of strings with second character d be `cnt2[d]`. Then the number of pairs with same second character and different first is: \n          total_pairs_same_second = C(cnt2[d],2) - sum_{c} C(freq[c][d],2)\n\n   But note: we are double counting? Actually, no. Because the two cases are disjoint: \n        In case1: the first character is the same and the second is different -> the two strings are (c,d1) and (c,d2) with d1 != d2.\n        In case2: the second character is the same and the first is different -> (c1,d) and (c2,d) with c1 != c2.\n\n   However, wait: what if a pair has both characters different? Then we don't count it. And if a pair has both same? Then we don't count it either.\n\n   But note: the above two cases are disjoint because in case1 the first character is the same (so the second must be different) and in case2 the second character is the same (so the first must be different). There is no overlap.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the above counts for case1 and case2 are independent.\n\n   But note: the entire set of pairs that we are counting is the union of these two disjoint sets.\n\n   Therefore, the total count = \n        for each first character c: [ C(total_in_c, 2) - sum_{d} C(freq[c][d], 2) ] \n        plus\n        for each second character d: [ C(total_in_d, 2) - sum_{c} C(freq[c][d], 2) ]\n\n   However, wait: the above formula for the second case is actually the same as the first case? Actually, we are using the same frequency structure. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        Let M be a 2D array (or dictionary) where M[c][d] = count of string (c,d)\n\n        Then:\n          Case1: same first character c: for a fixed c, the total pairs that have same first character and different second = \n                total = sum_{d} M[c][d]\n                pairs = C(total,2) - sum_{d} C(M[c][d],2)\n\n          Case2: same second character d: for a fixed d, the total pairs that have same second character and different first = \n                total = sum_{c} M[c][d]\n                pairs = C(total,2) - sum_{c} C(M[c][d],2)\n\n        Then total pairs = sum_{c} [ C(total_c,2) - sum_{d} C(M[c][d],2) ] + sum_{d} [ C(total_d,2) - sum_{c} C(M[c][d],2) ]\n\n   But note: the entire structure is symmetric. However, observe that the term C(M[c][d],2) appears in both? Actually, no: in the first part we subtract for each c and each d: C(M[c][d],2). In the second part we subtract again for each c and each d: C(M[c][d],2). So we are subtracting twice the same term? \n\n   However, note: the two sums are over different groupings. Actually, the term C(M[c][d],2) is subtracted once for the first character c (in the first part) and then again for the second character d (in the second part). But that term is the same. \n\n   But wait: the term C(M[c][d],2) is the count of pairs of identical strings? Actually, no: it is the count of pairs of strings that are exactly (c,d) and (c,d). But note: we are not counting identical pairs in the same group twice? Actually, the identical pairs are only in one group? \n\n   However, the problem: we are counting pairs that are in the same first character group and then we break down by second character. Then we subtract the pairs that are identical. Similarly, for the same second character group, we break down by first character and subtract the identical pairs. \n\n   But note: the identical pairs are subtracted in both? Actually, no: for a fixed string (c,d), it appears in the group for first character c and in the group for second character d. However, the identical pairs of (c,d) are only subtracted in the first part when we consider the group c and then the second character d. Similarly, in the second part, when we consider the group d and then the first character c, we subtract the same identical pairs again? \n\n   This would be double subtraction? But actually, we are not counting the identical pairs in the valid pairs at all. The identical pairs are subtracted because they are not valid for either case (they are not in the set of pairs that differ in exactly one position). However, the problem is that the identical pairs are not the only pairs we subtract: we also subtract the pairs that have the same first and same second? Actually, we subtract all pairs that have the same first and same second? But that includes the identical pairs and also non-identical pairs? Actually, no: if two strings are (c,d1) and (c,d2) with d1 != d2, then they are in the same first group and different second group, so they are counted in the first part. The pairs that are (c,d) and (c,d) are the only ones that we subtract in the first part for the group c and second character d.\n\n   But note: the pairs that are (c,d) and (c,d) are the same string? Actually, no: we have multiple occurrences. So if we have two identical strings, then we have one pair: (i,j) for i<j. So we subtract C(M[c][d],2) which is the number of pairs of identical strings (c,d) in the group.\n\n   Now, in the second part, for the same set of identical strings (c,d), they also appear in the group for second character d. And we subtract again C(M[c][d],2). \n\n   But wait: the identical pairs are not being counted in the second part as valid? Actually, no: the second part counts pairs that have the same second character and different first. The identical pairs have the same first and same second, so they are not valid for the second part. But we are subtracting them again? \n\n   However, the problem: we are subtracting the identical pairs twice? But we never added them in the first place? \n\n   Actually, in the first part: \n        We start by counting all pairs in the first character group: which includes pairs that are (c,d) and (c,d') for d != d' and also (c,d) and (c,d) (the identical ones). Then we subtract the identical ones (so we are left with pairs that have same first and different second). \n\n   Similarly, in the second part: \n        We start by counting all pairs in the second character group: which includes pairs that are (c,d) and (c',d) for c != c' and also (c,d) and (c,d) (the identical ones). Then we subtract the identical ones.\n\n   So the identical pairs are subtracted once in the first part and once in the second part. But they were never part of the valid pairs. However, the problem: we are not counting the identical pairs as valid. So we are not including them. But the subtraction is done to remove the pairs that are not having the second character different (in the first part) and similarly for the second part.\n\n   However, the identical pairs are not the only ones we subtract: we also subtract the pairs that have the same first and same second? Actually, no: in the first part, we subtract the pairs that have the same first and same second? Actually, we break the group by second character and then subtract the pairs that are in the same second character? That is, we subtract the pairs that are (c,d) and (c,d) (the identical ones) and also if there are multiple distinct strings that share the same first and same second? Actually, no: the group for (c,d) is exactly the set of strings that are (c,d). So we subtract the pairs within that group.\n\n   Therefore, the formula is:\n\n        total = 0\n        For each first character c:\n            total_c = 0\n            for d in the second characters that appear with c: \n                total_c += M[c][d]\n            temp = 0\n            for d in the second characters that appear with c:\n                temp += M[c][d] * (M[c][d]-1) // 2   # which is C(M[c][d],2)\n            total += total_c*(total_c-1)//2 - temp\n\n        Similarly, for each second character d:\n            total_d = 0\n            for c in the first characters that appear with d:\n                total_d += M[c][d]\n            temp = 0\n            for c in the first characters that appear with d:\n                temp += M[c][d] * (M[c][d]-1) // 2\n            total += total_d*(total_d-1)//2 - temp\n\n   However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We can use:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        for each test case:\n            n = int(input())\n            strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            # We'll create:\n            #   freq: dictionary of dictionary or a 2D defaultdict for M[c][d]\n            #   group_by_first: defaultdict of list? but we only need counts.\n\n            freq = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in strings:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq[c1][c2] += 1\n\n            # Now, for the first part: same first character\n            ans = 0\n            for c, inner_dict in freq.items():\n                total_c = sum(inner_dict.values())\n                # Now subtract the pairs that have same second character (which are the pairs within each second character group)\n                for count in inner_dict.values():\n                    ans -= count*(count-1)//2   # we subtract the pairs that are same in both characters? but note: we are going to add total_c*(total_c-1)//2 and then subtract these?\n                ans += total_c*(total_c-1)//2\n\n            # Now for the second part: same second character. But note: we don't have a group_by_second? We can build one, or we can restructure.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can create a group_by_second dictionary similarly.\n\n            # But note: we can also iterate by second character by flipping the keys? We can create a new defaultdict for second character.\n\n            # However, we can do:\n            group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in strings:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1   # now for a fixed second character c2, we have counts by first character.\n\n            for d, inner_dict in group_by_second.items():\n                total_d = sum(inner_dict.values())\n                for count in inner_dict.values():\n                    ans -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_d*(total_d-1)//2\n\n            # But wait: the above two loops are symmetric? Actually, we are doing the same as the first part for the second character.\n\n            However, note: the above two loops are independent. But we are subtracting the same identical pairs twice? \n\n            Actually, in the first loop we subtract for each (c,d): the pairs within (c,d) for the same first character. Then in the second loop we subtract again the same pairs? \n\n            How many times do we subtract the identical pairs? \n                For a fixed (c,d) with count = k, we subtract C(k,2) in the first loop (when we are in group c) and then again in the second loop (when we are in group d) we subtract C(k,2) again? \n\n            But note: the identical pairs are not being added in the first place? \n\n            Actually, in the first loop for group c: \n                We add: C(total_c, 2) which includes the pairs that are (c,d) and (c,d) (the identical ones) and also (c,d) and (c,d') for d' != d.\n                Then we subtract: for each d, C(k,2) which removes the identical pairs (and any other pairs that are same in both? but actually, the group for c and d is only the identical ones?).\n\n            Similarly, in the second loop for group d:\n                We add: C(total_d, 2) which includes the pairs that are (c,d) and (c',d) for c' != c and also the identical pairs (c,d) and (c,d) (if there are multiple).\n                Then we subtract: for each c, C(k,2) which removes the identical pairs.\n\n            But note: the identical pairs (c,d) and (c,d) are not valid for either case? So we don't want to count them. However, we are subtracting them twice? \n\n            But we never added them in the valid count? Actually, we did: \n                In the first part: we added the entire group of first character c, which includes the identical pairs? Then we subtracted the identical pairs? So we are left with the pairs that have same first and different second.\n\n            Similarly, in the second part: we added the entire group of second character d, which includes the identical pairs? Then we subtracted the identical pairs? So we are left with the pairs that have same second and different first.\n\n            Therefore, the identical pairs are subtracted once in the first part and once in the second part? But they were added twice? \n\n            Actually, the identical pairs are included in the group for first character c and also in the group for second character d. But we are not counting the identical pairs as valid pairs. However, when we do:\n\n                first part: \n                    total_c = k1 + k2 + ... (including k for (c,d))\n                    then we add C(total_c,2) -> which includes the pairs of (c,d) with (c,d) and also (c,d) with (c,d') and (c,d') with (c,d) and (c,d') with (c,d') etc.\n                    then we subtract for each second character: C(k,2) -> which removes the pairs that are same in both characters? Actually, it removes the pairs that are in the same (c,d) group? which are the identical pairs? \n\n                So after the first part, we have the pairs that have same first and different second.\n\n            Similarly, the second part: we have the pairs that have same second and different first.\n\n            Therefore, the identical pairs are not included in the final count. But we subtracted them twice? \n\n            Actually, we subtracted them once in the first part and once in the second part? But we never added them? \n\n            How? \n                In the first part: \n                    We added the entire group of first character c: which includes the identical pairs? -> yes, we added C(total_c,2) which counts every pair in the group, including the identical ones.\n                    Then we subtracted the identical pairs (which are the pairs that are same in both characters) for each (c,d) group? -> so we removed the identical pairs from the first part.\n\n                In the second part: \n                    We added the entire group of second character d: which includes the identical pairs? -> yes.\n                    Then we subtracted the identical pairs for each (c,d) group? -> so we removed them.\n\n            But note: the identical pairs are only in one (c,d) group? So we subtracted them once in the first part and once in the second part? \n\n            However, the problem: the identical pairs are not valid for either case? So we don't want them. But we are subtracting them twice? \n\n            Actually, we are overcompensating? \n\n            Example: two identical strings: \"aa\" and \"aa\". \n                First part: \n                    group for 'a': total_c = 2 -> C(2,2)=1.\n                    then we subtract for the group (a,a): C(2,2)=1 -> so first part contributes 0.\n                Second part:\n                    group for 'a': total_d = 2 -> C(2,2)=1.\n                    then we subtract for the group (a,a): C(2,2)=1 -> so second part contributes 0.\n\n            So total=0, which is correct.\n\n            Now consider two distinct strings: \"aa\" and \"ab\". \n                First part: \n                    group for 'a': total_c=2 -> C(2,2)=1.\n                    then we break: \n                         for d='a': count=1 -> subtract 0\n                         for d='b': count=1 -> subtract 0\n                    so first part: 1.\n                Second part:\n                    group for 'a': total_d=1 -> 0\n                    group for 'b': total_d=1 -> 0\n                    so second part: 0.\n\n                Total=1 -> correct.\n\n            Now consider two distinct strings: \"aa\" and \"bb\". \n                First part: \n                    group 'a': total=1 -> 0\n                    group 'b': total=1 -> 0\n                Second part:\n                    group 'a': total=1 -> 0\n                    group 'b': total=1 -> 0\n                total=0 -> correct.\n\n            Now consider three strings: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\".\n                First part: \n                    group 'a': total=3 -> C(3,2)=3.\n                    subtract: \n                         'a': C(1,2)=0\n                         'b': C(1,2)=0\n                         'c': C(1,2)=0\n                    so first part: 3.\n                Second part:\n                    group 'a': total=1 -> 0\n                    group 'b': total=1 -> 0\n                    group 'c': total=1 -> 0\n                total=3 -> correct? \n                    pairs: \n                         (aa,ab): differ in second -> valid.\n                         (aa,ac): valid.\n                         (ab,ac): valid? -> they differ in the second character? but they have the same first character? so yes, they are in the first part.\n\n            Now consider: \"aa\", \"ba\", \"ca\": \n                First part: \n                    group 'a': 1 -> 0\n                    group 'b': 1 -> 0\n                    group 'c': 1 -> 0\n                Second part:\n                    group 'a': total=3 -> C(3,2)=3.\n                    subtract: \n                         for 'a': C(1,2)=0\n                         for 'b': C(1,2)=0\n                         for 'c': C(1,2)=0\n                    so second part: 3.\n                total=3 -> correct.\n\n            Now consider: \"ab\", \"ac\", \"bb\", \"bc\": \n                We want pairs that differ in exactly one position: \n                    (ab, ac): same first, different second -> valid.\n                    (ab, bb): same second? no: ab has second 'b', bb has second 'b'? and first: 'a' vs 'b' -> different. So they differ in first and same in second? -> valid? \n                    (ab, bc): differ in both -> not valid.\n                    (ac, bb): differ in both -> not valid.\n                    (ac, bc): same second? no: ac has second 'c', bc has second 'c'? and first: 'a' vs 'b' -> so same second, different first -> valid.\n                    (bb, bc): same first? no: bb has first 'b', bc has first 'b'? and second: 'b' vs 'c' -> same first, different second -> valid.\n\n                So valid pairs: (ab,ac), (ab,bb), (ac,bc), (bb,bc) -> 4.\n\n                Now compute by our method:\n\n                Build freq:\n                    'a': {'b':1, 'c':1} -> total_c=2 -> C(2,2)=1, then subtract 0 for each -> 1.\n                    'b': {'b':1, 'c':1} -> total_c=2 -> 1, then subtract 0 -> 1.\n                    first part total = 1+1 = 2.\n\n                Build group_by_second:\n                    'b': {'a':1, 'b':1} -> total_d=2 -> 1, subtract 0 -> 1.\n                    'c': {'a':1, 'b':1} -> total_d=2 -> 1, subtract 0 -> 1.\n                    second part total = 1+1 = 2.\n\n                total = 2+2 = 4 -> correct.\n\n            Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups. The number of distinct first characters and distinct second characters is at most 11 (from 'a' to 'k')? Actually, the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so 11 distinct letters. So the inner loops are over at most 11.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll use:\n            from collections import defaultdict\n\n        For each test case:\n            n = int(input())\n            arr = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            # Build frequency for first character: mapping from first char to a dict (second char -> count)\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in arr:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n            # Build frequency for second character: mapping from second char to a dict (first char -> count)\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in arr:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n\n            # For the first part: same first character\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                # total pairs in this first group: C(total,2)\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                # subtract the pairs that have the same second character: for each second char d, we have inner[d] and we subtract C(inner[d],2)\n                for d, cnt in inner.items():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            # For the second part: same second character\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for c, cnt in inner.items():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: the problem says the answer may be large and we should use 64-bit integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we are safe.\n\n   However, the original code had a set `x` and a variable `mul` and a nested loop. We are replacing that.\n\n   Therefore, we replace the entire inner part of the test case.\n\n   So the missing code for program1.py is the entire efficient solution.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The original code had:\n\n        for ii in range(int(input())):\n            n=int(input())\n            a=[]\n            co=0\n            x=set()\n            for jj in range(n):\n                a.append(input())\n            ... and then the nested loops.\n\n   We are going to replace the nested loops with the efficient solution.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n\n        for ii in range(int(input())):\n            n = int(input())\n            arr = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            # If we don't want to use strip, it's okay because the string is of length 2.\n\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in arr:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for cnt in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for cnt in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: the original variable names: the outer loop uses `ii` and the inner loops use `jj` and `kk`. We are changing the variable names. But that's acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   We are only replacing the inner part? Actually, the original code had:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            a.append(input())\n        for jj in range(n):\n            ... # the nested loop\n\n   We are replacing the entire nested loop and the set `x` and the variable `co` with the above.\n\n   So the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict   # we must add this at the top? but the problem says the entire program? but note: the original code does not have it.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n   For program1.py, we note that the original code does not have the import. So we must include the import in the missing block? But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\". The given program1.py does not have the import. So we must add the import? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can add the import at the top? However, the problem says to output the missing code for the block that we are to fill in.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". We are allowed to change the entire program? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". The original code has a loop that is inefficient. We are replacing that loop.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        We'll remove the entire inefficient loop and replace it with the efficient one. And we need to import defaultdict.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the code that goes in the missing part? The problem says the code has a TODO.\n\n   However, the TODO is in the inner loop. But we are replacing the entire inner loop? \n\n   Actually, the original code has:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            mul=1\n            if jj not in x:\n                for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                    ... # conditions\n\n   We are replacing that entire block.\n\n   So the missing block for program1.py is the entire efficient solution after reading the array `a`. We can do:\n\n        We'll keep the reading of the array, but then we do the efficient method.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py becomes:\n\n        for ii in range(int(input())):\n            n=int(input())\n            a=[]\n            # We are going to read the n strings\n            for jj in range(n):\n                a.append(input().strip())\n\n            # Now we do the efficient method\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for cnt in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for cnt in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: the original code had a variable `co` that was printed. We are printing `ans`.\n\n   However, the problem says: the original code printed `co`. We are replacing `co` with `ans`.\n\n   So we can remove the variable `co` and `x` and `mul`.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the import to the print, but note: the import must be inside the loop? or outside? \n\n   We can put the import at the top of the entire program? But the problem says we are given the program1.py as:\n\n        for ii in range(int(input())): \n            ... \n\n   We are going to output the missing code for program1.py as a string that replaces the inner inefficient loop.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n   We'll write the completion for program1.py as:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict   # we need to put this at the top? but the problem says the entire program is given. We are only replacing the inner block.\n\n   However, the given program1.py does not have the import. So we must include it. But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing a block that currently has:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            mul=1\n            if jj not in x:\n                for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                    ... \n\n   We are replacing that entire block and also the variable `co` and `x`? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        We remove the entire block after reading the array and replace it with the efficient solution. And we also remove the variables `co` and `x`? \n\n   But note: the variable `co` is printed at the end. We are printing `ans` now.\n\n   So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict   # at the top? but the problem says the entire program is given. Actually, the problem says we are to fill in the missing lines or blocks. We are allowed to add an import at the top? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the location. We can do:\n\n        Option 1: put the import at the very top (outside the loop) and then the efficient code in the loop.\n\n        But the problem says: we are given the program1.py as:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    ... \n\n        We are replacing the last for loop and the variables `co` and `x`? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Remove the variables `co` and `x` and the last for loop, and replace with the efficient code.\n\n        So the code for the test case becomes:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = []\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input().strip())   # we added strip? but the problem says the string is of length 2, so no extra spaces? but it's safe.\n\n                # Now efficient solution\n                from collections import defaultdict   # but we can move this import to the top of the entire program? \n\n        However, if we put the import inside the loop, it will be run multiple times. That is acceptable? \n\n        But it's better to put the import at the top. The problem says we are to output the missing code for the block. We are allowed to output multiple lines? \n\n        We'll output:\n\n            program1: \n                \"from collections import defaultdict\\n\" +\n                ... the rest of the code for the test case\n\n        But note: the original program1.py does not have the import. So we must add it. And we are replacing the inner loop.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            We output the entire code for the test case, including the import at the top? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to fill in the missing lines or blocks. The missing block is the entire inner loop and we also need to add an import at the top? \n\n        Alternatively, we can put the import inside the outer loop? It will work because the outer loop runs t times, and importing a module multiple times is safe.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                n = int(input())\n                a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n                # then the efficient solution\n\n        But that is inefficient? It will import defaultdict t times? Actually, after the first import, it's cached. But it's better to put at the top.\n\n        However, the problem says: we are to output the missing code for the block that we are to fill in. The given program1.py does not have the import. We are replacing the entire inner part. We can output:\n\n            \"from collections import defaultdict\\n\"   # at the very beginning of the entire program? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire program is given with missing lines or blocks. We are to fill in the missing lines. The given program1.py does not have the import. So we must add it. And then we replace the inner loop.\n\n        How about we output:\n\n            program1: \n                \"from collections import defaultdict\\n\"   # this line at the top? but the problem says the entire program is given. Actually, the problem does not specify the entire program structure. We are to complete the given program.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\". The given program1.py has:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n                n=int(input())\n                a=[]\n                co=0\n                x=set()\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    ... \n\n        We are to replace the last for loop and the variables that are no longer needed? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            We remove the variables `co` and `x` and the last for loop, and replace with the efficient code. And we add the import at the top of the entire program.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output two strings: one for program1 and one for program2.\n\n        We'll output for program1.py:\n\n            completion = \n                \"from collections import defaultdict\\n\"   # at the very top? but the given program1.py already has the first line? \n\n        Actually, the given program1.py starts with:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())): \n\n        So we cannot put the import at the top? \n\n        Therefore, we put the import inside the outer loop. It's safe.\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = []\n            for jj in range(n):\n                s = input().strip()\n                a.append(s)\n            # Now build the frequency tables\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the outer loop is already there. We are inside the outer loop. The original code had:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = []\n                co = 0\n                x = set()\n                ... reading and then the inner loop.\n\n        We are replacing from the line `co=0` to the end of the inner loop.\n\n        So we remove: \n            co=0\n            x=set()\n            for jj in range(n):   # the reading loop? but we already read? \n            Actually, the reading loop is:\n\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a.append(input())\n\n            Then we have the inner loop for jj in range(n): ... \n\n        We are replacing from after the reading loop. We keep the reading loop.\n\n        Therefore, the missing block for program1.py starts after the reading loop and ends at the print.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            # Remove the variables co and x and the inner loop, and replace with:\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the variable `a` is already defined. And we are using `a`. Also, we are using `n` which is defined.\n\n        However, we are inside the outer loop for the test case.\n\n        But wait: the original code had a variable `co` that was printed. We are printing `ans`. And we are removing `co` and `x`. So we must remove the initialization of `co` and `x`? \n\n        The original code had:\n\n            co=0\n            x=set()\n\n        We are not using them. So we should remove them. But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing block. The missing block is the inner loop. We are replacing the inner loop and also the variables? \n\n        We can do: we replace from the line `co=0` to the end of the inner loop. \n\n        So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            freq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\n                freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\n\n            ans = 0\n            for c, inner in freq_first.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            for d, inner in freq_second.items():\n                total = sum(inner.values())\n                total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\n                for count in inner.values():\n                    total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\n                ans += total_pairs\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the variable `a` is defined in the lines above. And we are not using `co` and `x` anymore. So we must remove the lines:\n\n            co=0\n            x=set()\n\n        How? The problem says: we are to fill in the missing block. The missing block is the inner loop. But we are also removing two lines? \n\n        We can do: we replace the entire block from the line `co=0` to the end of the inner loop with the above code.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the above string.\n\n        However, the original code had:\n\n            for jj in range(n):\n                a.append(input())\n\n        Then we have:\n\n            co=0\n            x=set()\n            for jj in range(n):\n                ... # the inner loop\n\n        We are replacing from `co=0` to the end of the inner loop.\n\n        So we remove those and put the efficient code.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            \"from collections import defaultdict\\nfreq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfreq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n    freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\nans = 0\\nfor c, inner in freq_first.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nfor d, inner in freq_second.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nprint(ans)\"\n\n        But note: the original code had a variable `co` that was printed. We are printing `ans`. And we are not using `co` and `x`. So we removed them.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    The problem: count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n. \n    We are to do it for t test cases, with n up to 40000, and the total n over test cases is not bounded by 40000? but t up to 10000.\n\n    However, the note says: the answer is computed modulo 10^9+7.\n\n    The given code:\n\n        g=10**9+7\n        v=[1]+[0]*40001\n        for i in range(1,40001):\n         if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n          for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:print(v[int(n)]%g)\n\n    This is a dynamic programming problem: we want to count the number of ways to sum to j using palindromic numbers. Since the order doesn't matter, we can use an unbounded knapSack? and we are counting distinct multisets.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Precompute all palindromic numbers up to 40000.\n\n        Then do:\n\n            dp[0] = 1\n            for each palindromic number p in pal_list:\n                for j from p to 40000:\n                    dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-p]) % mod\n\n        But note: the given code has:\n\n            v = [1] + [0]*40001   # v[0]=1, v[j] for j>=1 initially 0.\n\n            Then for i from 1 to 40000:\n                if i is palindrome:\n                    for j from i to 40001:   # j from i to 40000\n                        # then update v[j]?\n\n        The TODO is in the inner loop.\n\n        We want: v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        Why? because we are considering the palindromic number i, and we can use it any number of times. Then the recurrence is:\n\n            v[j] += v[j-i]\n\n        But note: we are iterating over palindromic numbers and then over j from i to 40000.\n\n        However, the problem: the palindromic numbers are not necessarily in order? but we are iterating i from 1 to 40000, so we are processing in increasing order.\n\n        This is the standard coin change for unlimited supply, and we want the number of combinations (order doesn't matter).\n\n        But note: the coin change for unlimited supply in which order doesn't matter: we must iterate coins first then amounts? \n\n        Example: \n            coins = [1,2,3] and we want to make 3: \n                combinations: 1+1+1, 1+2, 3 -> 3 ways.\n\n            If we do:\n\n                dp[0]=1\n                for coin in coins:\n                    for j from coin to n:\n                        dp[j] += dp[j-coin]\n\n            This gives:\n                coin=1: \n                    j=1: dp[1] += dp[0] -> dp[1]=1\n                    j=2: dp[2] += dp[1] -> dp[2]=1\n                    j=3: dp[3] += dp[2] -> dp[3]=1\n                coin=2:\n                    j=2: dp[2] += dp[0] -> dp[2]=1+1=2\n                    j=3: dp[3] += dp[1] -> dp[3]=1+1=2\n                coin=3:\n                    j=3: dp[3] += dp[0] -> dp[3]=2+1=3\n\n            So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the inner loop should be:\n\n            v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But note: the array v is being updated. We are iterating i from 1 to 40000, and for each i that is a palindrome, we update j from i to 40000.\n\n        So the missing line for program2.py is:\n\n            v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulus is g.\n\n        But the given code does:\n\n            for n in [*open(0)][1:]:print(v[int(n)]%g)\n\n        We are updating v[j] modulo g in the inner loop? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But note: the inner loop is:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        However, the problem says: the answer for n is v[n] % g. But we are already doing modulo in the update? \n\n        We can do modulo in the update to keep the numbers small.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But note: the variable names: i is the current coin (palindrome) and j is the current amount.\n\n        We write:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        However, the given code has:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to fill in the body of the inner for loop.\n\n        So the missing line is:\n\n            v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But note: the inner loop runs for j from i to 40000. We must update v[j] by adding v[j-i] and then mod.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            \"v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n        However, we must be careful: the variable j is the loop variable. We can write:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the inner loop? \n\n        The TODO is at the end of the for loop line. So we are to fill in the body.\n\n        We output: \"v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n        But note: the indentation. The given code has:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to write the body with proper indentation? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format as a string.\n\n        We'll output the string: \"    v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"   (with 4 spaces) but the original code uses 1 space? \n\n        The given code uses 1 space for indentation? \n\n        Actually, the given code:\n\n            g=10**9+7\n            v=[1]+[0]*40001\n            for i in range(1,40001):\n             if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n              for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        The indentation is 1 space for the if and 1 space for the for? \n\n        We'll use the same indentation: 1 space for the inner body.\n\n        So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            \" v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n        But to be safe, we can use the same level of indentation as the for loop? The for loop is at one level of indentation (1 space) and the body should be one more? \n\n        Actually, the body of the for loop should be indented one more level. In Python, we can use 1 space? but it's not standard. However, the problem does not specify.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g   # with 4 spaces? but the original code uses 1 space.\n\n        But the given code uses 1 space for the outer if and for. So we use 1 space for the inner body? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the code is given. We are to fill in the body. The body should be at the same indentation level as the for loop? \n\n        But the for loop is already indented? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for i in range(1,40001):\n             if ...:   [this is one space]\n              for ...:   [this is two spaces?]\n\n        Then the body of the inner for should be at three spaces? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. We can output:\n\n            \"  v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"   # with two extra spaces? \n\n        But the original code uses 1 space per level? \n\n        Alternatively, we can count the levels:\n\n            Level0: for i ...:\n            Level1:  if ...:   [one space]\n            Level2:   for j ...:   [two spaces?]\n\n        Then the body of the inner for should be at level3: three spaces.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". We are to output the body of the inner for loop. The body is one line.\n\n        We'll output: \" v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\" with one extra space? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the given code has:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the comment with the body. We can write:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001): v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        but that is not good style.\n\n        Or we can write:\n\n            for j in range(i,40001):\n                v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But the problem says: the given code already has the for loop line. We are only to fill in the body.\n\n        Therefore, we output the body as a string with the appropriate indentation. Since the for loop is at an indentation level of 2 (if we count the outer for as 0, then the if is 1, then the for is 2), then the body should be at level 3.\n\n        The original code uses 1 space per level? \n\n        So we output: \"  v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"   (with two spaces at the beginning) to make the total indentation 3? \n\n        Actually, the outer for (i) has no space at the beginning? \n\n        The given code:\n\n            for i in range(1,40001):\n             if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n              for j in range(i,40001):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        The first line: for i ... has no space? \n        The second line: one space then if\n        The third line: two spaces then for\n\n        So the body of the inner for should be at three spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"   # with three spaces at the beginning? \n\n        But that would be:\n\n            for i in range(1,40001):\n             if str(i)==str(i)[::-1]:\n              for j in range(i,40001):\n                 v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\n\n        But the body is now at three spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a tab? but the problem says spaces.\n\n        We'll use three spaces for the body.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify. But to be safe, we can output the line without worrying about the indentation? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire program is given. We are to fill in the body. The body must be properly indented.\n\n        We'll output: \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"   (with three spaces at the beginning)\n\n        But note: the original code uses 1 space per level. So:\n\n            Level0: for i ...: (0 spaces)\n            Level1:  if ...: (1 space)\n            Level2:   for j ...: (2 spaces)\n            Level3:    ... (3 spaces)\n\n        So three spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\n    But wait: the inner loop runs for j from i to 40000. We are updating v[j] by adding v[j-i]. This is the standard unbounded knapSack for combinations.\n\n    This is correct.\n\nSummary:\n\n    program1: \n        completion = \"from collections import defaultdict\\nfreq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfreq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n    freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\nans = 0\\nfor c, inner in freq_first.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nfor d, inner in freq_second.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nprint(ans)\"\n\n    program2:\n        completion = \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"\n\nBut note: in program1, we are using `a` which is defined as the list of strings. And we are printing `ans` at the end. We removed the variables `co` and `x` and the inner loop.\n\nIn program2, we are adding the body of the inner for loop.\n\nWe output in JSON format.\n\nNote: the string for program1 has newlines. We must escape them? The problem says: output as a string.\n\nWe'll use raw string? But the problem says: output the missing code as a string.\n\nWe can use:\n\n    {\"program1\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\nfreq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfreq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n    freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\nans = 0\\nfor c, inner in freq_first.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nfor d, inner in freq_second.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nprint(ans)\", \"program2\": \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"}\n\nBut note: the program1 string has double quotes? We are using double quotes for the JSON keys and values. We must escape the double quotes inside the string? \n\nActually, the program1 string does not have double quotes. It has single quotes? \n\nWe use single quotes in the string? \n\nAlternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says: output as a string in JSON.\n\nWe'll use the standard JSON escaping.\n\nBut the problem does not require the output to be in a file. We are writing a string.\n\nWe'll write the JSON as:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \"the string for program1\",\n        \"program2\": \"the string for program2\"\n    }\n\nAnd we escape any double quotes and backslashes.\n\nIn program1, we have:\n\n    \"from collections ... \n\nThis starts with a double quote? But we are inside a JSON string. We must escape the double quotes? \n\nActually, the program1 string does not contain any double quotes? It has single quotes in the code? \n\nSo we can write without escaping.\n\nSimilarly, the program2 string: \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\" has no double quotes.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    {\"program1\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\nfreq_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfreq_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    freq_first[c1][c2] += 1\\n    freq_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n\\nans = 0\\nfor c, inner in freq_first.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nfor d, inner in freq_second.items():\\n    total = sum(inner.values())\\n    total_pairs = total*(total-1)//2\\n    for count in inner.values():\\n        total_pairs -= count*(count-1)//2\\n    ans += total_pairs\\n\\nprint(ans)\", \"program2\": \"   v[j] = (v[j] + v[j-i]) % g\"}\n\nBut note: the program1 string has a newline at the end? and the program2 string has three spaces.\n\nThis should be correct."
