In the provided code for the first TODO:\n\n                while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n                    mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n                    yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1) if yy < mid_y:\n                        la = mid_a\n                    if yy > mid_y:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is at the same indentation as `la = mid_a`, which is 12 spaces. So we output for the first TODO: \"        ra = mid_a\" (with 8 spaces? or 12?) The line above has 12 spaces for `la = mid_a`. So we should use 12 spaces? But the code in the provided has:\n\n            if yy < mid_y: la = mid_a   # this is indented by 12 spaces\n\n          So for the TODO, we should have:\n\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                ra = mid_a   # 12 spaces\n\n          Similarly for the second TODO.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem: We want to split a permutation into consecutive subarrays such that the number of odd subarrays (subarrays with an odd number of inversions) is maximized.\n\nAfter reading the input, the provided code has a loop that processes each test case. The current code attempts to count the number of odd segments by traversing the array. However, the logic is incomplete.\n\nKey Insight:\nThe problem can be reduced by noting the following:\n1. The inversion parity of a segment of length 0 or 1 is even (0 inversions). \n2. For a segment of length 2: [a, b] has 1 inversion (odd) if a > b, and 0 (even) otherwise.\n3. For a segment of length 3: \n   - The inversion parity can be either even or odd. However, note that we can always split a segment of length 3 into two segments: one of length 1 and one of length 2 (if the length-2 is odd) or even split differently.\n\nBut note the problem: We want the maximum number of odd segments.\n\nImportant known solution:\nWe can use a greedy approach. We note that:\n- A segment of length 1 has 0 inversions -> even.\n- A segment of length 2: if it is decreasing then it is odd (1 inversion), otherwise even.\n- A segment of length 3: \n   The inversion parity of the entire segment of 3 elements can be computed. However, note that we can split a segment of 3 in two ways:\n   Option 1: [a, b, c] -> one segment: inversion parity = (a>b?1:0) + (a>c?1:0) + (b>c?1:0) mod 2.\n   Option 2: split into [a] and [b, c]: then we get 0 + (1 if b>c else 0) -> so one odd segment if b>c.\n   Option 3: split into [a, b] and [c]: then we get (1 if a>b else 0) + 0.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to split arbitrarily. The key is that we can have at most one odd segment per two elements? \n\nActually, known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problems) is:\nLet dp[i] be the maximum number of odd segments we can get for the prefix ending at i.\nBut note constraints: total n over test cases <= 200000, so we need linear.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy with state machine.\n\nHowever, note the provided code in the problem has a while loop and a variable `prev` and it increments `numoddseg` when a[i] < prev.\n\nBut the provided code is incomplete. The current logic is:\n\n    numoddseg = 0\n    prev = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        if a[i] < prev:\n            numoddseg += 1\n            prev = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        i += 1\n\nWe must complete the else part.\n\nWhat is the idea?\nIt seems that the algorithm is trying to form segments of at most 2? Because when we see a drop (a[i] < prev), we count a segment and reset prev. Otherwise, we update prev.\n\nBut note: the problem allows segments of any length. However, we can always break the array such that each odd segment is of length 1 or 2? Actually, a segment of length 1 is even, so we cannot use it as an odd segment. Therefore, we must use segments of length at least 2 to get an odd segment.\n\nBut note: a segment of length 3 can be odd? Yes, for example [3,2,1] has 3 inversions (odd). However, we can break [3,2,1] into [3,2] (odd) and [1] (even) -> 1 odd segment, or [3] and [2,1] -> 1 odd segment, or leave as one segment -> 1 odd segment. So we get 1 in any case.\n\nBut what if we have [1,3,2]? \n   Inversions: (3,2) -> 1 inversion -> odd. So we can have one odd segment.\n\nBut note: we can also break [1,3,2] as [1] and [3,2] -> then we get one odd segment.\n\nSo the idea: we can always break the array so that we get an odd segment for every two consecutive elements that form a descent? But then we cannot have two consecutive descents because we break at every descent? \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the maximum number of odd segments.\n\nKnown solution from Codeforces (problem D from a contest) is:\n   We can have at most floor((n+1)/2) odd segments? But not exactly.\n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round #800) is:\n\n   We note that:\n   - A segment of length 1: even -> 0\n   - A segment of length 2: odd if the two are decreasing, even otherwise.\n   - A segment of length 3: \n        We can break it as:\n          Option 1: [a, b] and [c] -> then we get 1 odd segment if a>b, and 0 otherwise.\n          Option 2: [a] and [b, c] -> then we get 1 if b>c, 0 otherwise.\n          Option 3: [a, b, c] -> then we get the parity of the entire segment.\n\n        However, note: we can also break it as three segments? Then we get at most 2 odd segments? \n        But wait: we can break [a, b, c] as [a], [b], [c] -> 0 odd segments.\n\n        How to get two odd segments? \n        We can break [a, b, c] into [a, b] and [c] -> then we get 1 if a>b, and then [c] is even -> total 1.\n        Similarly, we cannot get two odd segments from three elements? Because we can only have one segment of two and one segment of one.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum we can get from three elements is 1.\n\n   But what about four elements? \n        [4,3,2,1]: \n          Break into [4,3] (odd), [2,1] (odd) -> 2 odd segments.\n\n   So the maximum number of odd segments is the maximum independent set of disjoint adjacent pairs that we can form? \n\n   However, note: we are allowed to break arbitrarily. We can also have a segment of length 1 in between.\n\n   Actually, we can use a greedy: traverse the array and whenever we can form an odd segment (by taking two consecutive elements that form a descent) we take them and then skip the next element? But note: we can also form a segment of length 1 arbitrarily.\n\n   Known solution from Codeforces: \n        Let dp[i] be the maximum number of odd segments we can form for the prefix ending at i.\n        We have:\n          dp[0] = 0\n          dp[1] = 0   (because one element is even)\n          dp[2] = 1 if a[0] > a[1] else 0\n\n        Then for i>=2:\n          dp[i] = max( \n              dp[i-1],   // if we leave a[i] as a segment (even, so no increment)\n              dp[i-2] + 1   // if we take a[i-1] and a[i] as a segment and they form an odd segment (i.e., a[i-1] > a[i])\n              // but also we can take a segment of length 3? \n          )\n\n        However, what about a segment of length 3? \n          We can break [i-2, i-1, i] as one segment: then the inversion parity is (a[i-2]>a[i-1]) + (a[i-2]>a[i]) + (a[i-1]>a[i]) mod 2.\n          Then we get 1 if the total inversions mod 2 is 1, then we have dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-3] + (1 if the segment [i-2,i] is odd else 0))\n\n        But note: we are allowed to break arbitrarily. We can also break the segment [i-2, i] as [i-2] and [i-1, i] -> then we get dp[i-1] + (1 if a[i-1]>a[i]) \n        or as [i-2, i-1] and [i] -> then we get dp[i-2] + (1 if a[i-2]>a[i-1])\n\n        So the segment of length 3 as one segment might not be necessary because we can break it and get the same or more? \n\n        Actually, we can get at most one odd segment from three elements? So if we take the entire segment of three as one odd segment, we get 1, and if we break it we also get at most 1? \n\n        Therefore, we don't need to consider segments of length 3? \n\n        But wait: what if we have [3,1,2]? \n          Entire segment: inversions: (3>1, 3>2, 1<2) -> 2 inversions -> even -> 0.\n          Break as [3,1] (odd) and [2] (even) -> 1 odd segment.\n          Break as [3] and [1,2] (even) -> 0.\n          Break as [3], [1], [2] -> 0.\n\n          So maximum is 1.\n\n        How about [2,1,4,3]? \n          We can break as [2,1] (odd) and [4,3] (odd) -> 2.\n\n        So the recurrence:\n\n          dp[0] = 0\n          dp[1] = 0\n          for i from 2 to n-1:\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1]   # skip a[i] as a segment of one (even)\n            # if we take a[i] and a[i-1] as a segment of two: then we require a[i-1] > a[i]\n            if a[i-1] > a[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-2] + 1)   # because we use two elements\n\n            # Also, we can consider a segment of three? But note: we can break the segment [i-2, i-1, i] as:\n            #   [i-2] (even) and then [i-1, i] (if a[i-1] > a[i] then we get 1) -> then total = dp[i-3] + (1 if a[i-1]>a[i] else 0) \n            #   but that is already considered by the above? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can form a segment of three that ends at i? Then we would have to check the parity of the entire segment [i-2, i] and then add dp[i-3] + (1 if the segment is odd else 0). \n\n            # However, note: we are allowed to break arbitrarily. We can also break the segment [i-2, i] as one segment and then the rest. \n\n            # But we must consider: what if we have a segment of three that is odd? Then we can get an extra odd segment? \n\n            # Example: [1,3,2] -> the entire segment [1,3,2] is even? Actually, inversions: (1,3) -> no, (1,2) -> no, (3,2) -> yes -> 1 inversion -> odd. So we can get 1 by taking the entire segment.\n\n            # How do we capture that? \n\n            # We can do:\n            if i>=2:\n                # Check the segment of three: [i-2, i-1, i]\n                # Count inversions: \n                cnt = 0\n                if a[i-2] > a[i-1]: cnt += 1\n                if a[i-2] > a[i]: cnt += 1\n                if a[i-1] > a[i]: cnt += 1\n                if cnt % 2 == 1: # odd segment\n                    # then we can form a segment ending at i of length 3\n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], (dp[i-3] if i-3>=0 else 0) + 1)\n                else:\n                    # we can still break the segment of three arbitrarily? but we don't get an odd segment from the entire segment, so we break it as we did above (which is already considered by the two-element segments and skipping)\n                    # so we don't need to do anything? \n                    pass\n\n            # But note: we can also break the segment of three as two segments: \n            #   Option 1: [i-2] and [i-1, i] -> then we get dp[i-1] = max( dp[i-1], (dp[i-3] if i-3>=0 else 0) + (1 if a[i-1]>a[i] else 0) )\n            #   Option 2: [i-2, i-1] and [i] -> then we get dp[i] = max(dp[i], (dp[i-2] if i-2>=0 else 0) + (1 if a[i-2]>a[i-1] else 0) ) -> but note: this is already considered in the two-element segment at i-1? \n\n            # Actually, the recurrence for two-element segments at i-1 and i-2 are already considered. \n\n        However, note: the problem constraints: total n <= 200000, but the sum of n over test cases is 200000. So we can do O(n) per test case? But note: the total n is 200000, so we can do a DP that runs in O(n) per test case? \n\n        But wait: the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n        However, the provided code does not use DP and uses a greedy while loop. \n\n        Alternatively, there is a known greedy solution:\n\n          We can note that we can always get at least k odd segments if we can partition the array into k segments that are odd.

The above code does not consider it. \n\n          However, note: the segment of three that is odd must have an odd number of inversions. But the inversion count mod2 is the same as the parity of the permutation of three elements. \n          The permutations of three elements that are odd (i.e., have odd inversion count) are the ones that are even permutations? \n\n          Actually, the inversion count mod2 is the sign of the permutation. The even permutations have even inversion count and the odd permutations have odd inversion count? \n          But wait: \n            Identity: 0 -> even.\n            Swap (0,1): [1,0,2] -> 1 inversion -> odd.\n            Swap (1,2): [0,2,1] -> 1 inversion -> odd.\n            Two swaps: [2,1,0] -> 3 inversions -> odd? \n          Actually, the inversion count mod2 is the parity of the permutation. \n\n          The permutations of three elements that are odd (as defined by the problem) are the ones with odd inversion count. \n          There are three: \n            [1,0,2] -> inversion: (0,1): 1>0 -> 1 inversion -> odd.\n            [2,1,0] -> 3 inversions -> odd.\n            [2,0,1] -> inversions: (0,1): 2>0, (0,2): 2>1, (1,2): 0<1 -> 2 -> even? \n          Actually, [2,0,1]: \n            pairs: (0,1): 2>0 -> 1, (0,2): 2>1 -> 1, (1,2): 0<1 -> 0 -> total 2 -> even.\n\n          The odd permutations of three elements: \n            [1,0,2] -> 1 inversion -> odd.\n            [0,2,1] -> 1 inversion -> odd.\n            [2,1,0] -> 3 inversions -> odd.\n            [2,0,1] -> 2 -> even.\n            [1,2,0] -> 1 inversion? (1,0): 1>0, (2,0): 2>0 -> 2 inversions? -> even.\n            [0,1,2] -> 0 -> even.\n\n          So the odd permutations of three elements are the ones that are cyclic shifts? \n\n          But note: the provided greedy does not take a segment of three. \n\n          How does the greedy handle [3,1,2]? \n            We break at the first drop: [3,1] -> odd segment, then leave [2] -> total 1.\n          But the entire segment [3,1,2] is even -> so we cannot take it as one odd segment.\n\n          How about [0,2,1]? \n            a = [0,2,1]\n            i0: prev=-1 -> else: prev=0\n            i1: 2>0 -> else: prev=2\n            i2: 1<2 -> then we break: numoddseg=1, and then reset -> total=1.\n\n          But we can also take the entire segment [0,2,1] as one segment: which is odd -> then we get 1.\n\n          How to capture that? \n\n          The provided greedy does not take the entire segment of three. It breaks at the first opportunity (at the drop at the last two). \n\n          But note: if we do not break at the first drop, we might get a segment of three? \n\n          The current code breaks at the first drop. \n\n          We need to modify: sometimes we might want to skip a drop to get a segment of three? \n\n          How? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            We maintain a state: \n              state0: we are starting a new segment (so we have no element in the current segment) -> then we take the current element and set prev = a[i] and move to state1.\n              state1: we have one element in the current segment (stored in prev). Then we look at the next element:\n                  If the next element is less than prev, then we can break a segment of two -> then we get an odd segment and reset to state0 for the next element? \n                  But if we don't break, we can go to state2: meaning we have two elements in the current segment.\n\n            Then in state2: we have two elements: [x, y] (with x and y stored? or we store the last element? and we know the inversion count mod2? Actually, we don't need the entire segment, we only care about the possibility of forming an odd segment at the next step.\n\n          However, the problem: we want to maximize the number of odd segments. \n\n          We can do a state machine with DP:\n\n            dp[i][0]: maximum number of odd segments we can get for the prefix ending at i, and the current segment has 0 elements (so we are about to start a new segment at i+1) -> but we don't need this.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            dp[i][0]: the maximum number of odd segments for the prefix ending at i, and the current segment has ended (so we are free to start a new segment at i+1) \n            dp[i][1]: ... and we have one element in the current segment (the last element is a[i])\n            dp[i][2]: ... and we have two elements in the current segment (the last two are a[i-1] and a[i])\n\n          Then:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 0\n            dp[0][1] = 0   # we have one element in the current segment -> but we haven't closed it -> so we haven't counted any segment from this current segment\n            dp[0][2] = -infinity   # not possible\n\n            For i>=1:\n\n            Option: close the segment at i? But note: we are allowed to have multiple segments arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, we can close the segment at any point. \n\n            But note: we are counting the segment only when we close it and it is odd.\n\n          This becomes complex.\n\n          But note: the known solution from Codeforces for this problem (problem D in Codeforces Round #800) is:\n\n            We can note that the answer is the maximum number of disjoint pairs of adjacent indices (i, i+1) such that a[i] > a[i+1] and no two pairs are adjacent? \n\n            Why? Because if we take a pair (i, i+1) then we break after i+1, and then we cannot take the next pair (i+1, i+2) because the segment at i+1 is already taken.\n\n          This is a classic greedy: maximum independent set on a path for edges that are present when a[i] > a[i+1]. \n\n          Then the answer is the size of the maximum independent set of edges in the path graph where an edge exists between i and i+1 if a[i] > a[i+1].\n\n          How to compute the maximum independent set on a path? \n\n            We can do:\n\n              dp[0] = 0\n              for i in range(0, n-1):\n                 # we consider edge i (between i and i+1)\n                 dp[i+1] = max(dp[i], (dp[i-1] if i-1>=0 else 0) + 1)   # if we take the edge i, then we skip edge i-1\n\n          But note: the edges are not vertices, they are edges. We have n-1 edges.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let f0 = 0, f1 = 0   # f0: the maximum for the first i edges without taking the last edge, f1: with taking the last edge?\n            Actually, we traverse the edges:\n\n              dp[0] = 1 if a[0]>a[1] else 0   # for the first edge\n              dp[1] = max(dp[0], 1 if a[1]>a[2] else 0)   # but we cannot take both edge0 and edge1 if they are adjacent.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            dp[0] = 0\n            dp[1] = 1 if a[0]>a[1] else 0\n            for i from 2 to n-2:   # i is the index of the edge (edge i: between i and i+1)\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + (1 if a[i]>a[i+1] else 0))\n\n          Then the answer is dp[n-2]? \n\n          But note: the edges are from 0 to n-2.\n\n          However, the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do this.\n\n          But the provided code does not use DP and uses a greedy that is similar to the greedy for maximum independent set in a path: \n\n            We can simply do:\n\n              ans = 0\n              i = 0\n              while i < n-1:\n                 if a[i] > a[i+1]:\n                     ans += 1\n                     i += 2   # skip the next edge because we cannot take edge i+1 (adjacent to edge i)\n                 else:\n                     i += 1\n\n          This greedy is known to work for maximum independent set in a path? \n\n          Example: [4,3,2,1]: \n            i0: 4>3 -> ans=1, i=2 -> then 2>1 -> ans=2, i=4 -> done -> 2.\n          [5,4,3,2,1]: \n            i0: 5>4 -> ans=1, i=2: 3>2 -> ans=2, then i=4 -> done -> 2.\n          [1,3,2,5,4]: \n            i0: 1<3 -> skip -> i=1: 3>2 -> ans=1, then i=3: 5>4 -> ans=2, i=5 -> done -> 2.\n\n          But wait, in [1,3,2,5,4] the edges are:\n            edge0: 1<3 -> skip -> then edge1: 3>2 -> take -> then skip edge2 (because we jump to i=3) -> edge3: 5>4 -> take.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          How about [1,4,2,3]? \n            edges: \n              edge0: 1<4 -> skip -> i=1\n              edge1: 4>2 -> take -> ans=1, then skip edge2 (because we jump to i=3) -> done.\n          How about [1,4,3,2]? \n            edge0: 1<4 -> skip -> i=1\n            edge1: 4>3 -> take -> ans=1, then skip edge2 -> done.\n          But we can also take edge2: 3>2 -> then we would get 2? \n          However, we cannot take both edge1 and edge2 because they are adjacent. \n\n          So the greedy is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we can solve the problem by:\n\n            ans = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < n-1:\n                if a[i] > a[i+1]:\n                    ans += 1\n                    i += 2\n                else:\n                    i += 1\n\n          But wait: the provided code in program1.py has:\n\n            numoddseg = 0\n            prev = -1\n            i = 0\n            while i < n:\n                if a[i] < prev:\n                    numoddseg += 1\n                    prev = -1\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                i += 1\n\n          How to reconcile? \n\n          The provided code does not skip the next element? It does i += 1 always. \n\n          But in the if branch, after taking a drop, it sets prev = -1, which means that at the next iteration, we will be in the else branch (because a[i] (the next element) is >= -1) and then we set prev to that next element? \n\n          That means it does not skip the next element? \n\n          Example: [4,3,2,1]:\n            i0: prev=-1 -> else: set prev=4.\n            i1: a[1]=3 < 4 -> then numoddseg=1, prev=-1.\n            i2: a[2]=2 -> else: set prev=2.\n            i3: a[3]=1 < 2 -> then numoddseg=2, prev=-1.\n\n          So it does not skip i2? It uses i2 as the start of a new segment? \n\n          This is different from the greedy that skips the next edge. \n\n          In the above, we are forming segments of two: [4,3] and [2,1]. \n\n          But note: the segment [2,1] is formed by the elements at index2 and index3. \n\n          This greedy does not skip the next element, it only resets the state. \n\n          And it works for [4,3,2,1] -> 2.\n\n          How about [5,4,3,2,1]? \n            i0: else: prev=5\n            i1: 4<5 -> numoddseg=1, prev=-1\n            i2: else: prev=3\n            i3: 2<3 -> numoddseg=2, prev=-1\n            i4: else: prev=1 -> done -> total=2.\n\n          But wait, we have an extra element at the end? \n\n          How about [5,4,3,2,1] -> we form [5,4] and [3,2] and then leave [1] -> total 2.\n\n          This matches the independent set greedy.\n\n          How about [1,3,2,5,4]? \n            i0: else: prev=1\n            i1: 3>1 -> else: prev=3\n            i2: 2<3 -> numoddseg=1, prev=-1\n            i3: else: prev=5\n            i4: 4<5 -> numoddseg=2, prev=-1 -> done.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          How about [1,4,2,3]? \n            i0: else: prev=1\n            i1: 4>1 -> else: prev=4\n            i2: 2<4 -> numoddseg=1, prev=-1\n            i3: else: prev=3 -> done -> 1.\n\n          How about [1,4,3,2]? \n            i0: else: prev=1\n            i1: 4>1 -> else: prev=4\n            i2: 3<4 -> numoddseg=1, prev=-1\n            i3: 2 -> else: prev=2 -> done -> 1.\n\n          But wait, we have a drop at the last two: 3>2? \n            We don't see it because at i3: we have prev=-1? and then we set prev=2? and then we are done.\n\n          We missed the last drop? \n\n          How to fix? \n\n          We can note that after the loop, if we are in a state with a segment of two that has a drop, we haven't counted it? \n\n          But in the loop, we only count a drop when we see it and then reset. \n\n          In [1,4,3,2]:\n            At i3: we are at a[3]=2, and prev=-1 -> so we set prev=2 -> and then we are done. \n            We never see a drop after that.\n\n          But the drop is between 3 and 2? which was at i2 and i3? \n            At i2: we saw a drop (4>3) and then reset, so at i3 we start fresh.\n\n          The segment [3,2] is not formed? \n\n          Why? Because after reset at i2, we start a new segment at i3? \n\n          But the array is [1,4,3,2]. The segments we formed are [1,4]? -> wait, no: \n            The algorithm:\n              i0: a[0]=1 -> else: set prev=1.\n              i1: a[1]=4 -> 4>1 -> else: set prev=4.\n              i2: a[2]=3 -> 3<4 -> then we form a segment [4,3]? and reset -> so we have one segment.\n              Then at i3: we start a new segment with a[3]=2 -> so we set prev=2.\n\n          We have not formed a segment for [3,2]? \n\n          But note: the segment [3,2] is not consecutive in the new segment? The new segment at i3 is a segment of one element [2]? \n\n          We are not allowed to form non consecutive segments? \n\n          The splitting must be consecutive subarrays. We cannot skip an element in the middle.\n\n          The segment [4,3] is from index1 to index2, and then the next segment starts at index3. So the element 3 is in the segment [4,3] and the element 2 is in a segment by itself.\n\n          We cannot form [3,2] because they are not consecutive in the array? \n\n          But they are consecutive: index2 and index3 are consecutive. \n\n          However, after we break at index2 (after the element 3), the next segment starts at index3. So we can form [3,2] if we break after index3? \n\n          But the algorithm at i3: we have prev=-1 and a[3]=2 -> we set prev=2. Then we are done. We never see a drop after that.\n\n          So we missed the segment [3,2]? \n\n          How to capture it? \n\n          We can note that the algorithm only counts a segment when it sees a drop. But at the last element, we don't have a next element to compare.\n\n          Therefore, we must count the last two as a segment if we have two elements at the end and they form a drop? \n\n          But the algorithm currently does not do that.\n\n          We can change the loop to go up to the last element, and then after the loop, if we have a segment of two that hasn't been counted? \n\n          However, the state is reset after every segment of two. The only state we have is `prev`. \n\n          If at the end of the loop, we have a segment of two? Actually, we store the last element in `prev` only if we are in the else branch. \n\n          We could do: after the loop, if we have a segment of two that we haven't counted? But note: we break the array arbitrarily. We are not forced to break at the last element. \n\n          Actually, the algorithm forms segments on the fly. The segment [3,2] would have been formed if we had not reset at i2? \n\n          But we did reset at i2 because we saw a drop at i2.\n\n          The issue is: after reset, we start a new segment at i3. But then we only have one element in that segment. \n\n          We cannot form a segment of two with the last element and nothing after? \n\n          Therefore, the algorithm as implemented does not count the last drop.\n\n          How to fix? \n\n          We can change the condition: instead of resetting the state after a drop, we can consider that we are starting a new segment at the next element, but then we might be able to form a segment of two with the next two if they form a drop? \n\n          But the algorithm already does that: after reset, we set prev=-1, and then at the next element we do the else branch and set prev to that element. Then at the next next element, if it is a drop, we count.\n\n          In [1,4,3,2]:\n            We count the drop at i2 (3<4) and then at i3 we set prev=2. Then we are done. We don't have a next element to see a drop.\n\n          So we missed the last drop.\n\n          We can, after the loop, check if we have a segment of two that is pending? But we don't store two elements.\n\n          Alternatively, we can not reset the state to -1 but to the current element? \n\n          But then we would be including the current element in the next segment? \n\n          Actually, after we form a segment of two, we are done with those two, and then we start a new segment at the next element. \n\n          The algorithm does that by setting prev=-1 and then at the next element (i+1) we do the else branch and set prev = a[i+1]. \n\n          But then at i+2, we compare a[i+2] with prev (which is a[i+1]). \n\n          So the only issue is the very last two if they form a drop and we are at the last element.\n\n          We can do: after the while loop, if we have two elements in the current segment? But the state only stores one element.\n\n          Actually, the state `prev` is either -1 (meaning we have no pending element) or the last element of the current segment (which is a segment of one so far).\n\n          Therefore, at the end, we have a segment of one (if prev != -1) and we don't count it.\n\n          We cannot count it as an odd segment because it has no inversion.\n\n          So the last drop between the last two elements is not counted if it is the last two and we reset in the middle? \n\n          How about we do not reset to -1 but to the current element? \n\n          But then we would be including the current element in the next segment? \n\n          Example: [4,3,2,1]:\n            i0: else: prev=4.\n            i1: 3<4 -> then we count one segment, and then set prev=3?   # instead of -1\n            i2: then we compare a[2]=2 with prev=3: 2<3 -> count one segment, set prev=2.\n            i3: then compare a[3]=1 with prev=2: 1<2 -> count one segment, set prev=1.\n            Then we have 3 segments? \n\n          But we cannot have three segments: \n            The array [4,3,2,1] can be split into [4,3], [2,1] -> 2 segments, or [4,3,2] and [1] -> 1 segment, or [4] and [3,2] and [1] -> 1 segment, or [4,3,2,1] -> 1 segment. \n            We cannot have three segments of two because there are only four elements? \n\n          And note: a segment of one is even, so we cannot count it as an odd segment.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot have three odd segments.\n\n          So we must reset to -1 after counting a segment.\n\n          The only issue is the last two elements if they form a drop and we are at the last element. \n\n          We can do: after the while loop, if we have two elements in the current segment? But we don't. We only have one.\n\n          Alternatively, we can run the loop one extra step? \n\n          But the array is fixed.\n\n          Or we can change the condition to look ahead: \n\n          Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n            We are at index i, and we have a state `prev` which is the last element of the current segment (or -1 if none).\n\n            If i < n:\n                if prev != -1 and a[i] < prev:\n                    numoddseg += 1\n                    prev = -1   # reset after taking two\n                else:\n                    prev = a[i]\n\n          This is what we have.\n\n          To capture the last drop, we need to have a pending element and then the next element is the last and forms a drop? \n\n          But the last element is at i = n-1. We do:\n\n            i = n-1: \n                if prev != -1 and a[n-1] < prev: then we count and reset.\n                else: we set prev = a[n-1]\n\n          Then we are done.\n\n          In [1,4,3,2]: \n            i0: prev=-1 -> else: prev=1.\n            i1: 4>1 -> else: prev=4.\n            i2: 3<4 -> count=1, reset to -1.\n            i3: prev=-1 -> else: prev=2.   // we set prev=2, but then we are done. We missed the drop between 3 and 2.\n\n          Why is there a drop between 3 and 2? But in the array, the element 3 is at index2 and 2 is at index3. They are consecutive. \n\n          However, after reset at i2, we start a new segment at i3. The new segment has only one element: 2. \n\n          We cannot form a segment [3,2] because 3 is in the previous segment and 2 is in the next segment.\n\n          Therefore, the segment [3,2] is not allowed because the splitting must be consecutive and we already broke after 3.\n\n          So the answer for [1,4,3,2] is 1.\n\n          But wait, can we break as [1,4] and [3,2]? \n            [1,4]: even (0 inversions) -> not odd.\n            [3,2]: odd -> 1.\n\n          So only one odd segment.\n\n          How about breaking as [1,4,3] and [2]? \n            [1,4,3]: inversions: (4,3) -> 1 -> odd.\n            [2]: even.\n\n          So also one.\n\n          Or [1] and [4,3] and [2]: \n            [4,3]: odd -> 1.\n\n          So maximum is 1.\n\n          Therefore, the provided algorithm with the else branch setting `prev = a[i]` is correct.\n\n          So the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          But note: what if prev is -1? Then we set prev = a[i]. \n          What if prev is not -1? Then we are in the else branch only if a[i] >= prev. Then we set prev = a[i]? \n\n          This means we extend the current segment to include a[i]? \n\n          But then the current segment is not closed. We are only storing the last element.\n\n          This matches the greedy of forming segments: we keep extending the current segment until we see a drop, then we break at the drop and count one segment.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          But note: the variable `i` in the loop is the index, and we have an array `a`. \n\n          So in the else branch, we do:\n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          However, there is a bug: the first time, when prev is -1, we go to the else branch and set prev = a[i]. Then for the next element, we compare a[i+1] with prev (which is a[i]). \n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But note: after reset (prev=-1), we go to the else branch and set prev to the current element.\n\n          Therefore, the complete code for program1.py is:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]\n                a = lines[i+1]\n\n                numoddseg = 0\n                prev = -1\n                i = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    if prev != -1 and a[i] < prev:\n                        numoddseg += 1\n                        prev = -1\n                    else:\n                        prev = a[i]\n                    i += 1\n\n                print(numoddseg)\n\n          But wait: the variable `i` is used for two purposes: the outer loop and the inner while loop. \n\n          In the provided code, the outer loop uses `i` as the index in the list `lines`, and then the inner while loop uses `i` as the index in the array `a`. \n\n          This will break the outer loop.\n\n          We should change the inner while loop index to a different variable.\n\n          The provided code has:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]\n                a = lines[i+1]\n\n                numoddseg = 0\n                prev = -1\n                i = 0   # this overwrites the outer i\n                while i < n:\n                    ...\n\n          We should change the inner index to `j` or `idx`.\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n          The missing code is only the else branch. \n\n          However, the provided code has:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          in the else branch.\n\n          And the rest is given.\n\n          But note: the outer loop variable `i` is being overwritten. This will cause the next test case to be skipped. \n\n          We must fix that. But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n          However, the problem also says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          The provided code has a bug: the inner while loop uses `i` and overwrites the outer `i`. \n\n          We are allowed to fix that? \n\n          But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only to fill in the TODO. \n\n          But the TODO is in the else branch. \n\n          Alternatively, the problem might have intended to use a different variable. \n\n          Since the problem says the code is given as is, and we are to complete it, we must only complete the TODO.\n\n          But then the program will be incorrect because of the variable name conflict.\n\n          How did the problem expect? \n\n          The provided code has:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                ...\n                i = 0   # this is the inner index\n\n          This is a bug.\n\n          We must change the inner index to a different variable. \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n          We are not allowed to change other parts? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can consider the entire block that is not given? \n\n          But the TODO is only in the else branch.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output the fixed code for the entire block? \n\n          The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n          And the output format is: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n          We must output the completion for program1 and program2.\n\n          For program1, the completion is the else branch and also fixing the variable conflict.\n\n          But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n          Let me re-read: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          The given program1.py has:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]\n                a = lines[i+1]\n\n                numoddseg = 0\n                prev = -1\n                i = 0\n                while i < n:\n                    if a[i] < prev:\n                        numoddseg += 1\n                        prev = -1\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    i += 1\n\n                print(numoddseg)\n\n          We must fill in the TODO and also fix the variable conflict.\n\n          How about we change the inner index to `j`:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]\n                a = lines[i+1]\n\n                numoddseg = 0\n                prev = -1\n                j = 0\n                while j < n:\n                    if prev != -1 and a[j] < prev:\n                        numoddseg += 1\n                        prev = -1\n                    else:\n                        prev = a[j]\n                    j += 1\n\n                print(numoddseg)\n\n          But then we are changing more than the TODO.\n\n          Alternatively, the problem might allow us to output the entire block for the for-loop body? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n          And the missing code is only the else branch? \n\n          However, the else branch is only one line: `prev = a[i]` but then the variable `i` is the outer loop variable? \n\n          We are in a dilemma.\n\n          Let me assume that the outer loop variable is not used after the inner while loop. The next is `print(numoddseg)`, and then the outer loop moves to the next test case by `i` being incremented by 2 in the for loop. \n\n          But the inner while loop sets `i = n` at the end. Then the outer loop does `i += 2`? \n\n          The next test case: \n            The outer loop: i starts at 1, then we do i = 0 in the inner, then after the inner while, i becomes n (which is at least 1) and then the outer loop does i += 2 -> so the next test case will be at i = n+2.\n\n          But the test cases are stored in `lines` as:\n            lines[0]: t\n            lines[1]: n for test1\n            lines[2]: array for test1\n            lines[3]: n for test2\n            lines[4]: array for test2\n            ...\n\n          The outer loop: \n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                n = lines[i][0]   # this is the first integer of the line that has the n\n                a = lines[i+1]    # this is the next line, the array\n\n          After processing test case 1, we set i = 0 in the inner loop, then after the inner loop, i = n (say n0). Then the outer loop does: i = 1 + 2 = 3? No, the outer loop index is the one from the for loop. The for loop iterates i = 1, 3, 5, ... \n\n          But we overwrote i in the inner loop. The next value of i in the outer loop will be the value of i after the inner loop, then plus 2? \n\n          No, the for loop in python: \n            for i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\n                ... # body\n\n          The loop variable `i` is set at each iteration. The body can change the loop variable, but then at the next iteration, it is set to the next value in the range.\n\n          Example:\n\n            for i in range(0,3):\n                print(i)\n                i = 100\n\n          This prints 0, 1, 2.\n\n          So the inner assignment to i does not affect the outer loop.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code is safe.\n\n          So we only need to fill the else branch.\n\n          In the else branch, we do:\n\n            prev = a[i]\n\n          But note: the condition in the if branch is `if a[i] < prev`. This is only safe if `prev` is not -1. But if `prev` is -1, then `a[i] < prev` would be comparing an integer with -1, and if the array has only positive integers (as given, from 1 to n) then a[i] is at least 1, so 1 < -1 is false. So we go to the else branch.\n\n          In the else branch, we set `prev = a[i]` regardless of whether `prev` is -1 or not.\n\n          So we can simply do:\n\n            else:\n                prev = a[i]\n\n          Therefore, for program1, the missing code is: \"prev = a[i]\"\n\n          But note: the variable is `a` and `i` is the index.\n\n          However, the array is named `a` and the index is `i` in the while loop.\n\n          So we write: \n            \"program1\": \"prev = a[i]\"\n\n          But wait, the if condition is `if a[i] < prev` without checking if prev is -1. \n\n          In the first iteration, prev is -1, and a[i] (which is at least 1) is not < -1, so we go to the else branch. That is correct.\n\n          But if we have a negative number? The problem says: the permutation is from 1 to n, so no negative.\n\n          So it is safe.\n\n          But the provided if condition is only `if a[i] < prev`, not `if prev != -1 and a[i] < prev`. \n\n          This might cause an issue: in the first iteration, we compare a[0] (say 1) with -1: 1 < -1 is false, so we go to else. Then we set prev=1.\n\n          Then next iteration: i=1, we compare a[1] with prev=1. If a[1] is 2, then 2<1 is false -> else: set prev=2.\n\n          If a[1] is 0, then 0<1 -> then we count and reset.\n\n          But the array is a permutation of 1..n, so 0 will not appear.\n\n          However, what if we have a segment of two at the beginning: [2,1]? \n            i0: a[0]=2 -> else: set prev=2.\n            i1: a[1]=1<2 -> then we count: numoddseg=1, and reset to -1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Therefore, the condition does not need the `prev != -1` because when prev is -1, a[i] (>=1) is never < -1.\n\n          So the code is safe.\n\n          For program1, the missing code is: \"prev = a[i]\"\n\n          Now, for program2.py.\n\n          We are given a complex geometry problem.\n\n          The code has a function `binary_find` and a function `get_area`, and then a main.\n\n          The TODO is in the function `binary_find`:\n\n            while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n                mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n                yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n                if yy < mid_y:\n                    la = mid_a\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          And similarly in the next while loop for `rb` and `lb`:\n\n            while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n                mid_b = rb / 2.0 + lb / 2.0\n                yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2)\n                if yy < mid_y:\n                    lb = mid_b\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are to complete the TODO.\n\n          The code is doing a binary search.

This means we are moving the lower bound up, so we are assuming that as mid_a increases, yy increases? \n\n          But then if yy > mid_y, we should decrease mid_a, so we set the upper bound to mid_a: ra = mid_a.\n\n          Therefore, the TODO in the first while loop is:\n\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                ra = mid_a\n\n          Similarly, in the second while loop:\n\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                rb = mid_b\n\n          But wait, the second while loop is for `lb` and `rb` and the condition is the same.\n\n          So for program2, the missing code for the first TODO is: \"ra = mid_a\"\n\n          and for the second TODO is: \"rb = mid_b\"\n\n          However, the code has two TODOs. We must complete both.\n\n          But the output format is one string for program2.\n\n          We can write: \n\n            \"ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But note: the second TODO is in a separate while loop.\n\n          The structure:\n\n            while ...:\n                ...\n                if yy < mid_y:\n                    ...\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO1\n\n            while ...:\n                ...\n                if yy < mid_y:\n                    ...\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO2\n\n          We complete TODO1 with \"ra = mid_a\" and TODO2 with \"rb = mid_b\".\n\n          So the completion for program2 is:\n\n            ra = mid_a\n\n          and \n\n            rb = mid_b\n\n          We output them in the same string, in the order they appear.\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n          We output the two lines.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are missing two lines.\n\n          So for program2, we output:\n\n            \"ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But note: the indentation. The first TODO is indented by 8 spaces (from the while), and the second TODO is similarly indented.\n\n          We can output:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But wait, the two TODOs are in separate while loops. We cannot put them in one string arbitrarily.\n\n          The output format is a string for program2.\n\n          We must output the exact code that is missing, including the proper indentation.\n\n          The first TODO is at:\n\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with \"ra = mid_a\", keeping the same indentation.\n\n          The second TODO is at:\n\n                if yy > mid_y:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace with \"rb = mid_b\".\n\n          So the completion for program2 is two lines? \n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code as a string in the json.\n\n          We can output: \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\" \n\n          but then the second line \"        rb = mid_b\" would be placed in the second TODO? \n\n          That is not what we want.\n\n          We must output the code for both TODOs in the order they appear. \n\n          However, the problem has two separate TODOs. \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". It might be two separate lines.\n\n          But the output format is a single string for program2.\n\n          We can output: \"ra = mid_a\" for the first and \"rb = mid_b\" for the second, but then how to put in one string? \n\n          The problem does not specify. \n\n          Since the two TODOs are in the same function, and we are to complete both, we output the two lines with the same indentation.\n\n          So:\n\n            completion_for_program2 = \n                \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But this will fill the first TODO with \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\", which is not what we want.\n\n          We must fill each TODO separately.\n\n          How about we output the entire function `binary_find`? \n\n          But the problem says only the missing code.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n            for the first TODO: \"ra = mid_a\"\n            for the second TODO: \"rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and put them in the string as two separate lines.\n\n          But the problem has only one string for program2.\n\n          I think the problem expects the entire block of code that is missing, which in this case is two lines.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and hope that the two lines are placed in the two TODOs respectively.\n\n          But that would put both lines in the first TODO and leave the second TODO untouched.\n\n          This is not correct.\n\n          We must output the two lines in the exact positions. \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". It might be that we are to output the entire function, but that is not missing.\n\n          Given the ambiguity, and since the two TODOs are identical in structure, and the variable names are symmetric (the first uses a, the second uses b), we output the two lines.\n\n          But note: the first TODO is in the first while loop and the second in the second while loop.\n\n          We can output:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and then the first line will fill the first TODO and the second line will fill the second TODO? \n\n          But the first TODO is followed by the next while loop. \n\n          How about we output the entire block from the first TODO to the end of the function? \n\n          That is not acceptable.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n            for the first TODO: \"ra = mid_a\"\n            for the second TODO: \"rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and put them in the string as two separate lines with a newline.\n\n          And hope that the first line goes to the first TODO and the second line to the second TODO.\n\n          But the problem does not specify.\n\n          Let me assume that the TODOs are filled in the order of appearance.\n\n          We output the string:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and then the first occurrence of a TODO is replaced by \"        ra = mid_a\", and the second by \"        rb = mid_b\"? \n\n          But the string has two lines, so the first TODO will get the entire string.\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          We must output two separate completions for the two TODOs? \n\n          But the output format is a single string for program2.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem is from a contest and the solution is known, I will output the two lines.\n\n          But note: the sample output in the problem for program2 is not provided, so we rely on the logic.\n\n          Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But this is not precise.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output the entire function `binary_find` with the TODOs filled. But the problem says only the missing code.\n\n          I think the safest is to output the two lines exactly as they should appear in the two TODOs.\n\n          Since the two TODOs are in the same function, we output:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and hope that the first line is placed in the first TODO and the second line in the second TODO.\n\n          But note: the second TODO is after the first while loop, so the first line will be in the first TODO and then the second line will be after the first while loop, which is not in a TODO.\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          We must output only the code for the TODO, and separately for each TODO.\n\n          The problem has two TODOs. The output format has one string for program2. \n\n          How about we output:\n\n            \"ra = mid_a\"\n\n          for the first TODO and \n\n            \"rb = mid_b\"\n\n          for the second TODO, and then combine them as two lines in the string.\n\n          But then the first TODO will be replaced by the string \"ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\", which is two lines, and the second TODO will remain.\n\n          This is not correct.\n\n          Given the time, I will output for program2 the string:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\"\n\n          and hope that the first TODO is the only one we need to fill? \n\n          But there are two TODOs.\n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". It might be that the second TODO is not in the sample input, but it is.\n\n          Another idea: the two while loops are symmetric. The first is for `a` and the second for `b`. The code for the second is exactly the same as the first, so we can output the same code but with 'a' replaced by 'b'. \n\n          But the variable in the second is `mid_b`, and we set `rb = mid_b`.\n\n          So for the second TODO, we do `rb = mid_b`.\n\n          Therefore, we must fill the first TODO with \"ra = mid_a\" and the second TODO with \"rb = mid_b\".\n\n          Since the output is one string, we output:\n\n            \"ra = mid_a\\nrb = mid_b\"\n\n          but without the indentation? \n\n          But the indentation is 8 spaces.\n\n          We output:\n\n            \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          and hope that the first line goes to the first TODO and the second line goes to the second TODO.\n\n          But the first TODO is at a specific location, and the second TODO is later.\n\n          The only way is to output the two lines and assume they are placed in the two TODOs in order.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem is not clear, I will output the two lines with the proper indentation.\n\n          So for program2, the completion is: \"        ra = mid_a\\n        rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But to be safe, let's count the spaces: in the provided code, the TODO is indented by 8 spaces from the while, and the if is indented by 8, and the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n          In the provided code for the first TODO:\n\n                while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n                    mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n                    yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n                    if yy < mid_y:\n                        la = mid_a\n                    if yy > mid_y:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is at the same indentation as `la = mid_a`, which is 12 spaces.\n\n          So we output for the first TODO: \"        ra = mid_a\" (with 8 spaces? or 12?) \n\n          The line above has 12 spaces for `la = mid_a`.\n\n          So we should use 12 spaces? \n\n          But the code in the provided has:\n\n            if yy < mid_y:\n                la = mid_a   # this is indented by 12 spaces\n\n          So for the TODO, we should have:\n\n            if yy > mid_y:\n                ra = mid_a   # 12 spaces\n\n          Similarly for the second TODO.\n\n          Therefore, the completion for program2 is:\n\n            \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But wait, the second while loop is:\n\n                while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n                    mid_b = rb / 2.0 + lb / 2.0\n                    yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2)\n                    if yy < mid_y:\n                        lb = mid_b\n                    if yy > mid_y:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the second TODO is also at 12 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But this is 12 spaces for each line.\n\n          However, the problem might not care about the exact spaces, as long as the indentation is the same as the surrounding.\n\n          But to be precise, we use 12 spaces.\n\n          But in the string, we must put the exact code.\n\n          So for program2, the completion is a string: \n            \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"\n\n          But note: the first line is for the first TODO and the second for the second TODO.\n\n          Summary:\n\n          program1: \"prev = a[i]\"\n          program2: \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"\n\n          Now, output in json.\n\n          Example: \n            {\"program1\": \"prev = a[i]\", \"program2\": \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"}\n\n          But note: the program2 string has newline and spaces.\n\n          We must escape the newline as \\n.\n\n          And the entire string in json must be quoted.\n\n          We do:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"prev = a[i]\",\n              \"program2\": \"            ra = mid_a\\n            rb = mid_b\"\n            }\n\n          But wait, in the second while loop, the variable is `mid_b`, not `mid_a`. So we use `rb = mid_b`.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we output the json."
