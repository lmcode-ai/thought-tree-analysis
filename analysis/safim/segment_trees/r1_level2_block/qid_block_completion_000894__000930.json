I think the original author intended:\n\n                'YNEOS '[b::2] \n\n            with b being either 0 or 1, and then for b=0: \"YES\", for b=1: \"NO\" (if the string were 'YNOES' or something) -> but it's 'YNEOS '. Wait, if the string were 'YNOES', then:\n                b=0: [0::2] -> 'Y','O','S' -> \"YOS\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> 'N','E' -> \"NE\"\n\n            Not good. How about 'YNEOS' without space: \n                b=0: [0::2] -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> \"NO\"\n\n            That works. But the code has 'YNEOS ' (with space).",

For each segment i in the list from split:\n                    if i is empty: continue\n                    if len(i)==1:\n                         b = 1\n                         break   # break the inner loop\n                    else: if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                             b = 1\n                             break\n\n                Then the print will be: \n                    if no invalid: b=0 -> \"YES\"\n                    if invalid: b=1 -> \"NO \"\n\n            We'll output that. But note: what if there are multiple segments and the first segment is valid but the second is invalid? We break at the first invalid segment, so b=1. That is correct. What if there are multiple segments and the first is invalid, we break and b=1. What if there are multiple segments and the first is valid, the second is invalid: we break and b=1. What if there are multiple segments and we don't break until the last one: then b=1. What if we have one valid segment and then an invalid segment: we break and b=1. What if we have an invalid segment and then a valid segment: we break at the first invalid, so b=1. So it's correct.

But also, if the segment has length>=2 and is missing one color, the condition is true. So it's correct. But note: the condition is equivalent to: \n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n            We can write it as:\n\n                if len(i) == 1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: However, in Python, the condition is evaluated with precedence: \n                len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i) So it's the same. But we can also write:\n\n                if len(i) == 1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n            Which might be clearer. But to save space, we can do the three conditions. However, note: if the segment has length1, we don't need to check the colors, so we can do:\n\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: b = 1\n                    break\n\n            This is two checks, but it's the same. Given that the total length is 10^5, and the inner loop per test case is over segments, and the total length of all segments is <= n, it's efficient. So we can do:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i == '': \n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But note: the condition in the second if: if the segment has length1, we break and set b=1. In the third if: if the segment has length>=2 and is missing one color, we break and set b=1. This is correct. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the empty string can be checked by `if not i` or `if i==''` or `if len(i)==0`.

But note: the continue will skip the rest of the block for this (l, m) and go to the next m.\n\n            That is acceptable. Alternatively, we can do nothing in the TODO and then the line `ans1 += d1[a]` is executed even when a==s? Then we would be adding d1[s] for the same string? But at the time we are processing the current string s, we haven't updated d1[s] yet. So d1[s] is the count of the string s in the previous strings. And we are about to do d1[s] += 1 after the inner loops. So if we add d1[s] when a==s, we are counting the previous occurrences of s? \n\n            But the pair (i,j) for a previous string i that is the same as s: \n                The two strings are the same -> they do not differ in exactly one position -> we should not count. So we must skip. Therefore, the TODO for program1.py is:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n\n            But note: the code has:\n\n                for l in range(2):\n                    for m in range(97,109): a = list(s)\n                        a[l] = chr(m)\n                        a = ''.join(a)\n                        if a == s:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            We want to skip the addition when a==s. So we can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n\n            This will skip the `ans1 += d1[a]` for this (l, m). But what if we want to skip only the addition?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\n We are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so we can process each test case by splitting by 'W'\n The idea is to note that the stamp always changes two adjacent cells: one to R and one to B (in some order).\n Therefore, the entire string must be partitioned into segments of non-white cells that are separated by white cells.\n In each contiguous segment (without any white), we can only have an even number of operations? Actually, note:\n\n Observation:\n  - The stamp operation always changes two adjacent cells. Moreover, each operation flips the color pattern (if we think of R and B as two states) and also the relative positions matter.\n\n Important:\n  - We cannot have a segment of length 1 (because the stamp must cover two adjacent cells). So any segment of length 1 is invalid.\n\n  - Also, note that the entire segment must be colorable by a sequence of stamps. In fact, we can think of the segment as being built by overlapping stamps.\n\n  - Another observation: the entire segment must have an equal number of R and B? Not exactly: consider that a cell might be covered multiple times.\n\n Alternate Insight (known from similar problems):\n  - We can break the string by 'W'. For each contiguous segment of non-white (which must be only R and B), we can check:\n        * If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n        * Alternatively, we can note that the entire segment must be such that it is possible to form it by overlapping stamps.\n\n  - Actually, note that the stamp always produces one R and one B. However, because of overlapping, the counts of R and B might not be equal? \n    But consider: each stamp adds one R and one B. However, if a cell is stamped multiple times, it might flip: \n        R -> B -> R -> ... \n    So the parity of the color at a cell depends on the number of times it is stamped and the initial color (which is white, and white is not R or B).\n\n  - However, note that we start from white. Each stamp operation on a white cell: \n        If we use BR on two white cells: becomes B and R.\n        If we use RB on two white cells: becomes R and B.\n\n  - But if we stamp over a cell that is already colored, then:\n        If we have a cell that is R and we stamp it again (with a stamp that covers it and a neighbor) then:\n            The stamp operation will change the R to B (if the stamp has B for that position) and the neighbor accordingly.\n\n  - Actually, the problem is known to be solved by checking that in each contiguous segment (without white) we cannot have:\n        - The segment of length 1: then it's impossible.\n        - Also, if the entire segment is all the same color? That is also impossible? \n\n  Why? Because if we have a segment of two: \n        We can have \"RB\" or \"BR\", which are both one R and one B. \n        But if we have a segment of three: \n            We can have \"RBR\" or \"BRB\", etc.\n\n  However, note that we can also have all R's? Actually, no: because each stamp must put one R and one B. \n  But if we stamp multiple times, a cell might be covered an odd number of times. \n\n  Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem E) is:\n        Split the string by 'W'. For each segment:\n            - If the segment is empty, skip.\n            - Else, if the segment has length 1, then it's invalid.\n            - Or, if the segment has at least two characters, then we require that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n              Why? Because if the entire segment is only R's, then that is impossible. Similarly for only B's.\n\n  Why is that? \n      Consider: \n          - To form a segment, we must use the stamp at least once. The stamp always produces one R and one B. \n          - Then, if we cover a cell multiple times, it flips: R becomes B and B becomes R. \n          - Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n  But note: \n      Example: \"RR\" -> is that possible? \n          We can do: \n              Start: WW -> stamp as RB: becomes RB? \n              Then we want to change the B to R? \n                  We can stamp the two adjacent cells: \n                      If we stamp the first cell (which is R) and the second (which is B) with the stamp: \n                          If we use the stamp as BR: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R -> BR -> then we have BR, not RR.\n                      Alternatively, if we stamp the second cell and a third? but we don't have a third.\n\n          How about: \n              Start: WWW \n              We stamp the first two: RBW -> then we stamp the last two: but the last two are BW -> if we stamp as BR: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> R R B? \n          But we want RR? \n\n      Actually, we cannot get \"RR\" in a segment of two? \n          Because the only way to form two adjacent non-white cells is by one stamp that must put one R and one B. \n\n      Similarly, for a segment of three: \n          We can get \"RBR\" (by stamping the first two to RB, then the last two: the second and third: starting from RBW -> stamp the second and third: the second is B and the third is W -> becomes BR? Then we have R B R? \n          But wait: \n              Step1: WWW -> stamp first two: becomes RBW\n              Step2: stamp the second and third: \n                  The stamp must cover two adjacent: so we can only cover the second and third. \n                  The second is B and the third is W. \n                  The stamp will change the second to R and the third to B? \n                  But the stamp has two possibilities: \n                      If we use the stamp as RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> so we get R R B? \n                  Or if we use the stamp as BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R? -> but the second was B, so becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> wait, no: \n                  Actually, the stamp operation overwrites? The problem says \"recolors both cells\". So it doesn't matter what was there? \n\n      But note: the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". So it sets the two cells to the two colors of the stamp (in the order of the stamp). \n\n      Therefore, if we have a segment of two: \n          We can only get \"RB\" or \"BR\". We cannot get \"RR\" or \"BB\".\n\n      For a segment of three: \n          We can do:\n              Step1: stamp the first two as RB: -> RBW\n              Step2: stamp the last two as BR: -> then the second becomes B and the third becomes R? -> so we get R B R? \n          But wait: \n              Step2: we are stamping the second and third. The stamp can be applied as either:\n                  Option 1: the first character of the stamp on the second cell and the second on the third: then we set the second to R and the third to B? -> then we get R R B.\n                  Option 2: the first character of the stamp on the second cell as B and the second as R? -> then we set the second to B and the third to R -> then we get R B R.\n\n          So we can get \"RBR\" and \"RBB\" (if we use a different stamp in step2) but note: \n          Actually, we can also get \"RRB\" by:\n              Step1: stamp the last two as RB: -> WW becomes WRB? no, we start with three: \n              Alternatively: \n                  Step1: stamp the middle and last: WWW -> W then stamp the last two: W and then we stamp the last two as RB: -> W and then the last two become RB -> so W RB -> then we stamp the first two: the first is W and the second is R -> we can stamp as RB: then the first becomes R and the second becomes B -> R B B? \n\n          How do we get \"RRB\"? \n              We can do:\n                  Start: WWW\n                  Stamp the first two as RR? -> but the stamp must be either RB or BR. So we cannot get RR in the first two.\n\n          Therefore, the key is: \n              In a contiguous segment (without white), we can only form patterns that have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n      Why? \n          Because the stamp always produces one R and one B. And when we cover a cell multiple times, we are effectively flipping it: \n              If a cell is stamped an odd number of times, then it will be the opposite of the initial stamp? \n          But note: the initial state is white, and the first stamp sets it to either R or B. Then if stamped again, it will be set to the other color? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify that the stamp flips? It says \"recolors\", meaning it sets the cell to the color of the stamp at that position.\n\n          Therefore, if we stamp a cell multiple times, the last stamp that covers the cell determines its color? \n\n          Then we can have any pattern? \n\n      But wait: the constraint is that the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. \n\n      Alternate known solution (from Codeforces) for the same problem: \n          We split the string by 'W'. For each segment:\n              if the segment is non-empty:\n                  if the segment has only one character -> invalid.\n                  else if the segment has all the same color (like all 'R' or all 'B') -> invalid.\n                  else -> valid.\n\n      Why is that? \n          Because if we have a segment of two: we must have one R and one B. \n          For a segment of three: we can have \"RBR\", which has both R and B. But if we have \"RRR\", how would we form it? \n          To form \"RRR\", we would have to have a stamp that sets two adjacent to RR? But the stamp only comes in RB or BR. \n\n          Therefore, we cannot have a segment of non-white that is all one color (unless the segment is of length 1, which we already rule out).\n\n      So the algorithm for one test case:\n          n = int(input())\n          s = input().strip()\n\n          We split s by 'W' -> we get a list of segments.\n\n          For each segment in segments:\n              if segment == \"\": skip.\n              else:\n                 if len(segment) == 1:\n                     invalid -> break or mark as invalid.\n                 else:\n                     if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment: \n                         invalid -> break.\n\n          If we found any invalid segment, output \"NO\", else \"YES\".\n\n      However, note: what if the entire string is white? \n          Then we have one segment that is empty -> valid.\n\n      Example test cases from the problem:\n\n        Example 1: \"BWB\" -> \n            segments: ['B', '', 'B'] -> the first segment is \"B\" -> invalid -> output \"NO\". \n            But the example says the first test case is explained and it is possible? \n\n        Wait, the first test case in the problem is: \n            \"The first test case is explained in the statement.\" \n            The example in the statement: \"BRBBW\" -> but note the example input? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n        The sample test cases:\n\n        Example 5: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> \n            segments: ['RBR'] -> has both R and B -> valid -> \"YES\"\n\n        Example 6: n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> \n            segments: ['RBB'] -> has both R and B -> valid -> \"YES\"\n\n        Example 7: n=3, s=\"WWW\" -> \n            segments: ['','',''] -> valid -> \"YES\"\n\n        But what about the first test case? The problem says the first test case is explained: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\" -> wait, that note is for a different problem? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement we are solving now is about the stamp. The note in the problem description for the stamp example is:\n\n            \"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture $$$\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\texttt{W}$$$ ...\"\n\n        So the first test case might be: n=5, s = \"BRBBW\"\n\n        How do we split \"BRBBW\" by 'W'? -> ['BRBB',''] -> \n            segment1 = \"BRBB\": \n                length>=2 -> check: it has both 'R' and 'B'? -> yes, so valid.\n\n        But wait, the example also includes a white at the end. \n\n        However, the problem says: \n            \"The second test case of each test case contains a string s\"\n\n        And the sample test cases in the note:\n\n            \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n        The second test case: \n            Input: \n                7\n                5\n                BRBBW\n                1\n                B\n                2\n                WB\n                2\n                RW\n                3\n                RBR\n                3\n                RBB\n                3\n                WWW\n\n            Expected output: \n                YES\n                NO\n                NO\n                NO\n                YES\n                YES\n                YES\n\n        So for the first test case (n=5, s=\"BRBBW\"): we output YES -> which we do.\n\n        For the second test case: n=1, s=\"B\": \n            segments: ['B'] -> invalid -> output \"NO\"\n\n        Third test case: n=2, s=\"WB\": \n            segments: ['','B'] -> the segment 'B' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n\n        Fourth test case: n=2, s=\"RW\": \n            segments: ['R',''] -> the segment 'R' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n\n        So the code:\n\n          We read t test cases.\n\n          For each test case:\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            segments = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segments:\n                if seg == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                # Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are splitting by 'W', which is efficient.\n\n        But wait: what if the string is very long? The total n is <= 10^5, so it's acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the sample test case 2: \"WB\" -> segments: ['', 'B'] -> we get two segments: one empty and one ['B'] -> we break on the non-empty segment of length 1.\n\n        But what about a segment that is long? The condition 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg: \n            This is O(n) per segment. But the total length of all segments over test cases is <= 10^5? \n            Because the total n over test cases is <= 10^5.\n\n        So we can do.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we are safe.\n\n        But let's test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 5: \"RBR\" -> segment: ['RBR'] -> has 'R' and 'B' -> valid -> YES.\n          Example 6: \"RBB\" -> segment: ['RBB'] -> has 'R' and 'B' -> valid -> YES.\n\n        But wait: what about a segment that is \"RRB\"? \n            It has both R and B -> valid -> YES.\n\n        How about \"RRRRB\"? -> valid.\n\n        How about \"RRRRR\"? -> invalid because no 'B' -> NO.\n\n        How about \"BBBBB\"? -> invalid because no 'R' -> NO.\n\n        How about \"R\"? -> invalid -> NO.\n\n        How about \"RB\"? -> valid? \n            segment: \"RB\" -> length=2, and has both -> YES.\n\n        How about \"BR\": same.\n\n        How about \"BB\": \n            segment: \"BB\" -> no 'R' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n        How about \"RR\": \n            segment: \"RR\" -> no 'B' -> invalid -> NO.\n\n        This matches: because we cannot form \"RR\" or \"BB\" in a segment of two.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              segments = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for seg in segments:\n                  if len(seg) == 0:\n                      continue\n                  if len(seg) == 1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  # Check if the segment has both R and B\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n\n              print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but we are reading t test cases and then for each test case we split the string and then iterate over segments. The total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so this is efficient.\n\n        But note: the sample input format: \n            The first line: t\n            Then for each test case: \n                first line: n\n                second line: the string of length n\n\n        However, the provided code in the problem for program2.py is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n        We have to complete the code in the given structure.\n\n        The given code:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n                # This means: read all lines, then take every other line starting from index 2 (0-indexed: so the third line, fifth, ...) \n                # because the first line is t, then the first test case: first line is n, second line is the string -> so the strings we are processing are the even-indexed lines (if we count from 0: line0=t, line1=n1, line2=s1, line3=n2, line4=s2, ...) -> so [2::2] gives the strings: s1, s2, ... \n\n            Then for each string s (which is the input string for the test case, but note: the line has a newline, so we do s[:-1] to remove the newline? but the last character might be the newline, but if the last character is not newline? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: the second line of each test case contains a string. \n\n            Then we split the string by \"W\", and then iterate over the segments (which are in the list i? actually the loop variable is i for each segment).\n\n            Then we have a variable b that we are going to use to decide the answer.\n\n            Then we print: 'YNEOS '[b::2] -> \n                This is a trick: \n                    if b=0: then we take the substring starting at index 0 and stepping by 2: 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> 'YES'\n                    if b=1: then we take the substring starting at index 1 and stepping by 2: 'YNEOS '[1::2] -> 'NO'\n\n            So we want to set b=0 for YES and b=1 for NO? \n\n            But note: the problem says: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n            Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' -> which is 6 characters: \n                index0: 'Y'\n                index1: 'N'\n                index2: 'E'\n                index3: 'O'\n                index4: 'S'\n                index5: ' '\n\n            Then [b::2] for b=0: [0,2,4] -> \"YES\"\n            for b=1: [1,3,5] -> \"NO \" -> but wait, we don't want the space? \n\n            Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' (with a space at the end) -> so [1::2] gives \"N\", then \"O\", then \" \" -> \"NO \".\n\n            But the problem expects \"NO\" without space. \n\n            Alternatively, the string might be 'YNEOS' without space? But the code has a space: 'YNEOS ' -> 6 characters.\n\n            We can avoid by setting b to 0 for YES and then for NO we set b to 1, but then we get \"NO \".\n\n            Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for YES and 1 for NO, and then the output for NO is \"NO \" which might be acceptable? But the problem says \"You can output the answer in any case\" and the checker recognizes \"NO\", but if we output \"NO \" (with space) it might be wrong.\n\n            How about we do: \n                We set b = 0 if valid, and b = 1 if invalid.\n\n            Then we print: \n                if valid: 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> \"YES\"\n                if invalid: 'YNEOS '[1::2] -> \"NO \" (with a trailing space) -> but the problem expects exactly \"NO\".\n\n            We can change the string to 'YNEOS' (without space) and then [0::2] is \"YES\", [1::2] is \"NO\" (because then indices: [0,2,4] for 0::2: 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\", but wait: \n                'YNEOS' -> \n                    index0: 'Y'\n                    index1: 'N'\n                    index2: 'E'\n                    index3: 'O'\n                    index4: 'S'\n                Then [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> \"Y\" + \"E\" + \"S\" -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n                [1::2] -> indices 1,3 -> \"N\" + \"O\" -> \"NO\".\n\n            But the code has 'YNEOS ' (with a space). \n\n            How about we change the string to 'YNEOS'? But we cannot change the provided code? \n\n            Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for YES and 4 for NO? \n                Then for NO: [4::2] -> starting at index4: 'S' then step by 2: next is index6 -> out of range? \n\n            Or we can set b to 0 for YES and then for NO we set b to 1, but then we output the substring from index1 stepping by 2: which is \"N\", then \"O\", then \" \" -> \"NO \".\n\n            The problem expects the output to be exactly \"NO\" (without space). \n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid the trailing space by not having the space in the string? But the code is given as 'YNEOS '.\n\n            We can do: \n                Instead of setting b to 0 or 1, we set b to 0 for YES and 4 for NO? \n                Then for NO: [4::2] -> only the character at index4: 'S' -> not \"NO\".\n\n            How about we set b to 0 for YES and 1 for NO, but then we output the string without the last character? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                We note that the problem expects the answer for each test case on a separate line.\n\n                And the print function adds a newline. So if we output \"NO \" (with a space) and then a newline, that is \"NO \\n\", which is not the same as \"NO\\n\".\n\n            We can adjust: \n                Instead, we can set a flag and then use:\n\n                    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n                But the problem says: Output only the missing code. And the given code has:\n\n                    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n            So we must use that.\n\n            How about we set b to 0 for YES and then for NO we set b = 1, and then we remove the space from the string? \n\n            But we cannot change the print statement.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for YES and then for NO we set b = 1, and then the output for NO is \"NO \" (with a space) but the problem's checker might ignore trailing spaces? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"You can output the answer in any case\" and the example includes \"YES\" and \"NO\", but note the example: \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", \"YES\" are recognized. It doesn't say about spaces.\n\n            But to be safe, we can set b to 0 for YES and then for NO we set b = 1, and then we hope that the checker trims? \n\n            Or we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, and then the output is \"NO \" (with a trailing space) and then the print adds a newline -> so the line is \"NO \\n\". \n\n            The problem expects \"NO\\n\". \n\n            How about we do:\n\n                We set b = 0 for valid and b = 1 for invalid.\n\n                Then the output for invalid is 'YNEOS '[1::2] which is the characters at indices 1, 3, 5: \n                    index1: 'N'\n                    index3: 'O'\n                    index5: ' ' -> so we get \"NO \".\n\n            But we don't want the space. \n\n            We can avoid by not having the space in the string? But we cannot change the string.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, but then we output without the last character? \n\n            But we cannot change the print.\n\n            Another idea: we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, but then we do:\n\n                Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' -> 6 characters. \n                We can set b to 0 -> \"YES\" (by taking indices 0,2,4: 'Y','E','S')\n                For NO, we want \"NO\", so we take indices 1,3: but the stepping by 2 from 1: [1,3,5] -> we get three characters. \n\n            How about we set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, and then we do nothing? \n\n            But the problem expects \"NO\", not \"NO \".\n\n            Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 2? \n                Then for NO: [2::2] -> indices 2,4: 'E','S' -> \"ES\" -> not \"NO\".\n\n            How about we set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, and then we remove the last character of the string? \n\n            We cannot.\n\n            Another idea: we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, and then we hope that the problem checker is smart? \n\n            But the problem says: \"the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer\", but for negative, it must be \"NO\". \n\n            We must output \"NO\" without the space.\n\n            How about we change the string to a different one? \n\n            The code is: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n            We can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, but then we also change the string? \n\n            But we are only allowed to fill in the missing code in the loop.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Instead of using the provided print, we break out and then set b appropriately and then the print will be called.\n\n            But we cannot change the print.\n\n            Let me check: the string is 'YNEOS ' -> 6 characters.\n\n            We want for NO: to output \"NO\", which is two characters. \n\n            How about we set b = 1 and then we do nothing else? \n\n            Then the output is 'YNEOS '[1::2] -> which is the characters at indices 1, 3, 5: \n                index1: 'N'\n                index3: 'O'\n                index5: ' ' -> \"NO \"\n\n            But we can avoid including the space by not having the space? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: the input string s is given without any extra spaces? \n\n            How about we do: \n                We set b = 0 for valid, and for invalid we set b = 1, but then we also remove the trailing space from the entire output? \n\n            We cannot.\n\n            Another idea: we can set b to 0 for YES and for NO we set b = 1, and then we adjust the string: \n\n                The code is: \n                    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n                We can change the string to be 'YNEOS' (without space) by doing:\n\n                    s = s[:-1]   # but s is the input string? \n\n                But we are in the loop: \n                    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        b = 0\n                        for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n                Here, s is a line from the input.

It is a line from the input, including the newline. Then we do s[:-1] to remove the newline? \n\n            But what if the last line has no newline? \n\n            The problem says: the input is from stdin, and the total n<=10^5, so we can assume the last line has a newline? \n\n            Then s[:-1] is the string without the newline.\n\n            Then we split by \"W\", so we get segments.\n\n            Now, we want to set b=1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n            But then the print outputs 'YNEOS '[b::2] -> if b=0: \"YES\", if b=1: \"NO \".\n\n            How about we set b = 0 for valid and for invalid we set b = 1, and then we do nothing else? \n\n            And then we hope that the checker is not picky about the space? \n\n            But the problem says: \"the strings ... will be recognized as a positive answer\", meaning that for negative, it might be strict.\n\n            Alternatively, we can set b = 0 for valid and for invalid we set b = 1, and then we also set b = 2 if we want to output something else? \n\n            But then for b=2: we get 'YNEOS '[2::2] -> \"E\", \"S\" -> \"ES\", which is not \"NO\".\n\n            How about we set b = 1 for invalid and then break, and then we also break the inner loop, and then we do nothing? \n\n            But the space is there.\n\n            Another idea: we can avoid the space by not having the space in the string? \n\n            We can change the string in the print? \n\n            But we are not allowed to change the print.\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                We set b = 0 for valid.\n\n                For invalid, we set b = 1, and then we also set a global flag? \n\n            We cannot.\n\n            I think the intended solution in the provided code structure is to use the same logic and then output with the space, and the judge might accept \"NO \"? \n\n            But let me check known submissions for this problem (Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4), problem E: 2^Sort) -> wait, no, this problem is from a different contest? \n\n            Actually, the problem is from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem E: \"2^Sort\", but wait, the problem we are solving is about a stamp? \n\n            I recall that the problem about the stamp is from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem D: \n\n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/D\n\n            And in the editorial, they output \"YES\" or \"NO\", without space.\n\n            How did they do in the provided structure? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Instead of using the provided print, we can break and then use a different print? \n\n            But we cannot change the print.\n\n            How about we set b to 0 for valid and for invalid we set b = 1, and then after the inner loop, we do:\n\n                # if we set b to 1, then we want to output \"NO\", so we can set b = 1 and then the string to be printed is 'YNEOS '[1::2] which is \"NO \", but then we can remove the last character by reassigning b to a string? \n\n            But b is an integer.\n\n            We are not allowed to change the type of b.\n\n            I think we have to output \"NO \" and hope the judge trims.\n\n            But let me check the sample: \n                The sample test case 2: n=1, s=\"B\" -> we output \"NO \".\n\n            The problem sample output is \"NO\", so if the judge trims then it's okay.\n\n            Or the judge might be comparing with \"NO\\n\" and we output \"NO \\n\", which is different.\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                We set b = 0 for valid.\n\n                For invalid, we set b = 1, and then we also, after the inner loop, do:\n\n                    # We know we are going to print 'YNEOS '[1::2] -> \"NO \", but we want to remove the last character? \n                    # We cannot change the print.\n\n            Another idea: we can set b = 1 for invalid, and then we also change the global environment? \n\n            I think we have to live with the space.\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is only the part in the inner loop.\n\n            And the sample expected output for the second test case is \"NO\", but we are outputting \"NO \".\n\n            How about we do not use the provided print for NO? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                if we find an invalid segment, we set b = 1 and then break the inner loop, and then we do nothing.\n\n                Then after the inner loop, we have the print.\n\n                But then we output \"NO \".\n\n            We can try to set b to 1 and then also, in the inner loop, we can break and then continue to the next test case? \n\n            But the space is still there.\n\n            How about we set b = 0 for valid and for invalid we set b = 1, and then we also set b = 1 to a value that when we do [b::2] we get \"NO\" without space? \n\n            We can set b = 1 and then we also change the string 'YNEOS ' to 'YNOES'? \n\n            But we cannot.\n\n            I think the original author intended:\n\n                'YNEOS '[b::2] \n\n            with b being either 0 or 1, and then for b=0: \"YES\", for b=1: \"NO\" (if the string were 'YNOES' or something) -> but it's 'YNEOS '.\n\n            Wait, if the string were 'YNOES', then:\n                b=0: [0::2] -> 'Y','O','S' -> \"YOS\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> 'N','E' -> \"NE\"\n\n            Not good.\n\n            How about 'YNEOS' without space: \n                b=0: [0::2] -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> \"NO\"\n\n            That works.\n\n            But the code has 'YNEOS ' (with space). \n\n            How about we change the string in the print to 'YNEOS'? \n\n            We are allowed to change the print? \n\n            The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is only the block in the inner for loop.\n\n            So we cannot change the print.\n\n            Therefore, we must output the space.\n\n            But the problem expects \"NO\", not \"NO \".\n\n            I think there is a mistake in the provided code structure.\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                We set b = 0 for valid.\n\n                For invalid, we set b = 1, and then we also, after the inner loop, do:\n\n                    # We know we will print \"NO \", but then we can use a trick: \n                    #   sys.stdout.write('YNEOS '[b::2].rstrip() + '\\n')\n                    # But we cannot change the print.\n\n            We are not allowed.\n\n            Another idea: we can set b = 0 for valid and for invalid we set b = 1, and then we hope that the judge's checker trims the output? \n\n            Given the constraints, and that the problem says \"You can output the answer in any case\", maybe the space is allowed.\n\n            But the sample output in the problem does not have space.\n\n            How about we try to submit with the space and see if it passes? \n\n            But we are not submitting, we are providing the code.\n\n            Given the instructions, we must output the missing code.\n\n            So we will write the code for the inner loop as described, and hope that the space is not a problem.\n\n            Or, we can do:\n\n                We set b = 0 initially.\n\n                For each segment i in the list from split:\n                    if i is empty: continue\n                    if len(i)==1:\n                         b = 1\n                         break   # break the inner loop\n                    else:\n                         if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                             b = 1\n                             break\n\n                Then the print will be: \n                    if no invalid: b=0 -> \"YES\"\n                    if invalid: b=1 -> \"NO \"\n\n            We'll output that.\n\n            But note: what if there are multiple segments and the first segment is valid but the second is invalid? \n                We break at the first invalid segment, so b=1.\n\n            That is correct.\n\n            What if there are multiple segments and the first is invalid, we break and b=1.\n\n            What if there are multiple segments and the first is valid, the second is invalid: we break and b=1.\n\n            What if there are multiple segments and we don't break until the last one: then b=1.\n\n            What if we have one valid segment and then an invalid segment: we break and b=1.\n\n            What if we have an invalid segment and then a valid segment: we break at the first invalid, so b=1.\n\n            So it's correct.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if i == '':\n                    # we can skip, but the split already removes the empty string? \n                    # Actually, split('W') can produce empty strings at the beginning, middle, or end.\n                    # We are already skipping by doing nothing? \n                    # But the condition: if i is empty, we skip. But the loop variable i is the segment, and if it's empty, we don't do anything.\n                    # So we can do: \n                    #   continue\n                    # But the code already is: we are in the loop, and we want to skip empty segments.\n                    # We can do nothing for empty segments.\n                    # But the code after the if i=='': would be skipped.\n                    # How about we do:\n\n                    # Actually, we don't need to do anything for empty segments, so we can skip the checks.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    if i == '':\n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But note: the empty string might be handled by the split? and we might not need to check.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    if len(i) == 0: \n                        continue\n                    elif len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                            b = 1\n                            break\n\n            But the empty string has length 0, so we can do:\n\n                    if len(i) == 0: \n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            However, note: the condition 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: \n                This is equivalent to: not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)\n\n            So we can also do:\n\n                    if not i:  # empty\n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i): \n                        # But wait: if the segment has both, we don't break. \n                        # Actually, we want to break if it has only one color.\n                        # So: if the segment is not empty and (either length1 or missing one color) -> invalid.\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But note: if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors, we don't break.\n\n            However, if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors, we do nothing (b remains 0).\n\n            But what if we have multiple segments and the first segment is valid, then we don't break, and then the second segment is invalid: we will set b=1 and break.\n\n            But if we have a valid segment and then an empty segment, we skip the empty segment and then continue.\n\n            So the code for the inner loop in program2.py is:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if not i: \n                        continue\n                    if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i): \n                        # But wait: the condition for one color: we want to check if it is missing one color -> which is: if 'R' not in i OR 'B' not in i.\n                        # But note: if both are not present? that's not possible because the segment is non-empty and has only R and B? \n                        # Actually, the segment can be all R's -> then 'B' not in i -> condition true.\n                        # Or all B's -> then 'R' not in i -> condition true.\n                        # So we can break.\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But wait: the condition is: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n            This is equivalent to: \n                if len(i)==1 or (the segment does not have both colors)\n\n            But note: if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors, we skip.\n\n            However, if the segment has length>=2 and does not have both colors, we break.\n\n            And if the segment has length1, we break.\n\n            But the condition: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i)\n\n            is equivalent to:\n                if len(i)==1 or (not ('R' in i and 'B' in i))\n\n            which is what we want.\n\n            But note: if the segment has length1, then it automatically doesn't have both colors? because it has only one character. \n            So we could also do:\n\n                if len(i)>=1 and (len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i)):\n\n            But the empty ones are skipped, so i is non-empty.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            But wait: if the segment has length1, then we break. \n            Also, if the segment has length>=2 but is missing one color, we break.\n\n            However, the condition \"('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\" is true if at least one of the colors is missing. \n            For a segment of length1: it is missing at least one color (in fact, it is missing one of them, and has one of them) -> so the condition is true.\n\n            So we can simplify to:\n\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i): \n                    -> but wait, if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors, then this condition is false.\n\n            But note: if the segment has length>=2 and has both colors, then 'R' in i and 'B' in i, so the condition is false.\n\n            But if the segment has length>=2 and is missing one color, then the condition is true.\n\n            However, if the segment has length1, the condition is true.\n\n            But also, if the segment has length>=2 and is missing one color, the condition is true.\n\n            So it's correct.\n\n            But note: the condition is equivalent to: \n                if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n            We can write it as:\n\n                if len(i) == 1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n\n            However, in Python, the condition is evaluated with precedence: \n                len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\n\n            So it's the same.\n\n            But we can also write:\n\n                if len(i) == 1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n            Which might be clearer.\n\n            But to save space, we can do the three conditions.\n\n            However, note: if the segment has length1, we don't need to check the colors, so we can do:\n\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            This is two checks, but it's the same.\n\n            Given that the total length is 10^5, and the inner loop per test case is over segments, and the total length of all segments is <= n, it's efficient.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i == '': \n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break\n\n            But note: the condition in the second if: if the segment has length1, we break and set b=1.\n\n            In the third if: if the segment has length>=2 and is missing one color, we break and set b=1.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the empty string can be checked by `if not i` or `if i==''` or `if len(i)==0`. We can use any.\n\n        However, the split might produce empty strings, and we want to skip them.\n\n        We'll use `if i == ''` or `if not i`.\n\n        Let's use `if not i: continue`\n\n        So the code for program2.py's inner loop is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                if not i:\n                    continue\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition `'R' not in i or 'B' not in i` is true if at least one is missing. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if not i: continue\n            if len(i) == 1 or ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        But that is the same as:\n\n            if not i: continue\n            if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        But note: the condition `len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i` is always true for a segment of length1, so we can combine.\n\n        However, for clarity, we do two ifs.\n\n        But to save lines, we can combine.\n\n        Given the constraints, we can do either.\n\n        We'll do the two ifs for clarity.\n\n        Now, what about program1.py? \n\n        We haven't done program1.py.\n\n        The problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        We are only given the code for program2.py, and we are to complete both.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        And then: \n            \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        And the output format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        We have done program2.py.\n\n        Now, program1.py:\n\n        Description: Given n strings, each of length 2, count the number of pairs (i,j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n        Input: \n            t test cases.\n            For each test case: \n                n\n                n lines, each a string of length 2.\n\n        Output: for each test case, the number of pairs.\n\n        Constraints: \n            t from 1 to 100, n up to 10^5, but the total n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n        We cannot do O(n^2) per test case.\n\n        How to count pairs (i,j) such that the two strings (each of length 2) differ in exactly one position?\n\n        Let the string be represented as (a_i, b_i) for the two characters.\n\n        Two strings (a_i, b_i) and (a_j, b_j) differ in exactly one position if:\n            (a_i == a_j and b_i != b_j) OR (a_i != a_j and b_i == b_j)\n\n        We can count:\n\n            Total pairs that differ in exactly one position = \n                (number of pairs that have the same first character and different second character) \n                + (number of pairs that have the same second character and different first character)\n\n        But note: if we count separately, we might count a pair that has the same first and same second? no, because we require different in one position.\n\n        However, note: if two strings are identical, they are not counted (because they differ in 0 positions). \n        If they differ in both positions, they are not counted.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            Let's group by the first character: \n                For a fixed first character 'x', let the second characters be in a list. Then the number of pairs in this group that have different second characters? \n                    = total pairs in the group - pairs that have the same second character.\n\n            But we don't want to count pairs that have the same second character? \n\n            Actually, we want pairs that have the same first character and different second character.\n\n            For a fixed first character 'x', let the frequency of second characters be: \n                f1, f2, ... fk for the distinct second characters.\n\n            Then the number of pairs in this group that have different second characters = \n                total pairs in the group - sum_{each distinct char c} (number of pairs with second character c)\n\n            total pairs in the group = C(total_count, 2)\n            sum_{c} C(f_c, 2)\n\n            So for group 'x': \n                count_x = total_count\n                same_second = sum_{c} [f_c * (f_c-1)//2]   -> but we don't need to divide by 2? because we are counting pairs? \n                Actually, the number of pairs with the same second character in group x is: for each c, we have C(f_c,2) = f_c*(f_c-1)//2.\n\n            Then the number of pairs in group x that have the same first character and different second character = \n                C(total_count, 2) - sum_{c} C(f_c, 2)\n\n            Similarly, we can group by the second character and count the pairs that have the same second character and different first character.\n\n            But note: we cannot simply add these two because a pair that has the same first character and different second character is disjoint from a pair that has the same second character and different first character? \n\n            Actually, a pair (i,j) might be counted in both? \n\n            Let's see: \n                Condition 1: same first, different second -> (a_i==a_j and b_i != b_j)\n                Condition 2: same second, different first -> (a_i != a_j and b_i==b_j)\n\n            These two conditions are disjoint: because if the first characters are the same, then the second condition (which requires different first) is not satisfied, and vice versa.\n\n            So we can add.\n\n            Therefore, the total count = \n                [sum over all first characters x: C(count_x,2) - sum_{c in second characters in group x} C(f_c,2)] \n                +\n                [sum over all second characters y: C(count_y,2) - sum_{c in first characters in group y} C(f_c,2)]\n\n            But note: we are grouping by first character for the first part, and by second character for the second part.\n\n        However, we must be careful: the total_count for the first part is the frequency of first character x, and for the second part the total_count for second character y is the frequency of second character y.\n\n        How to compute:\n\n            We can do:\n\n                For the first part:\n                    group by the first character: \n                        We can create a dictionary: \n                            dict1: key = first character, value = list of second characters (or we can use a frequency dictionary for the second characters in the group)\n\n                Similarly, for the second part:\n                    group by the second character: \n                        dict2: key = second character, value = list of first characters.\n\n            But note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups.\n\n            Steps for one test case:\n\n                n = int(input())\n                strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n                # Part 1: group by first character\n                from collections import defaultdict, Counter\n                group_first = defaultdict(list)\n                for s in strings:\n                    group_first[s[0]].append(s[1])\n\n                total_pairs = 0\n\n                # For the first part: same first, different second\n                for key, seconds in group_first.items():\n                    total_in_group = len(seconds)\n                    # Count frequency of each second char in this group\n                    cnt_second = Counter(seconds)\n                    same_second_pairs = 0\n                    for char, count in cnt_second.items():\n                        same_second_pairs += count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_group_pairs = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += total_group_pairs - same_second_pairs\n\n                # Part 2: group by second character\n                group_second = defaultdict(list)\n                for s in strings:\n                    group_second[s[1]].append(s[0])\n\n                for key, firsts in group_second.items():\n                    total_in_group = len(firsts)\n                    cnt_first = Counter(firsts)\n                    same_first_pairs = 0\n                    for char, count in cnt_first.items():\n                        same_first_pairs += count*(count-1)//2\n                    total_group_pairs = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n                    total_pairs += total_group_pairs - same_first_pairs\n\n                print(total_pairs)\n\n            But note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and we are iterating over each group and then over the frequency in the group, the total work is O(n) per test case? \n                Because the sum of the sizes of all groups is n.\n\n            However, we are doing two passes: one for group_first and one for group_second, and each pass we iterate over the list and then over the distinct elements in the group.\n\n            The distinct elements in a group: the total distinct second characters in group_first might be large, but the total over groups is bounded by the total distinct pairs? \n\n            Actually, the total distinct second characters overall is at most 11 (from 'a' to 'k')? \n\n            The problem says: the strings consist of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters.\n\n            Similarly for the first character.\n\n            So the inner loops over the frequency dictionary in a group: the number of distinct characters in a group is at most 11.\n\n            So the entire algorithm is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n        However, we are given the code for program1.py:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for x in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                d1 = {}\n                for i in range(97,109):\n                    for j in range(97,109):\n                        d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n                ans1 = 0\n                for y in range(n):\n                    s = input()\n                    for l in range(2):\n                        for m in range(97,109):\n                            a = list(s)\n                            a[l] = chr(m)\n                            a = ''.join(a)\n                            if a == s:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                            ans1+=d1[a]\n                    d1[s]+=1\n                print(ans1)\n\n        How does this work?\n\n            It initializes a dictionary d1 for all pairs of characters from 'a' to 'k' (97 to 108, because 109 is exclusive) -> so 11*11=121 keys, all set to 0.\n\n            Then for each string s in the n strings:\n\n                For l in [0,1] (the two positions)\n                    For m in 97 to 108 (which is 'a' to 'l')? but the problem says from 'a' to 'k', so 97 to 107? \n\n                The code goes from 97 to 108 (exclusive of 109) -> so 97 to 108: that's 12 characters? \n\n                But the problem says from 'a' to 'k': which is 11 characters: 'a' to 'k' is 97 to 107.\n\n                So the range should be 97 to 108? 108 is 'l', which is not allowed.\n\n                But the problem says the string consists of letters from 'a' to 'k'. So when we change a character, we are only allowed to change to a letter from 'a' to 'k'. \n\n                The code uses 97 to 109: which is 12 characters: 'a' to 'l'. \n\n                But the problem says the input only has 'a' to 'k', so when we generate a string by changing one character to a letter from 'a' to 'l', we might generate a string that is not in the input? \n\n                But the dictionary d1 is initialized for all pairs from 'a' to 'l'? \n\n                However, the input strings are only from 'a' to 'k', so the keys in d1 that are not in the input will be 0.\n\n                But the problem says: the string s is in the input, and we are going to change one character to a letter from 'a' to 'l'. \n\n                We are iterating over l in [0,1] and m in [97,109) -> 12 possibilities per position.\n\n                For each string s, we are generating 2*12 = 24 strings.\n\n                Then we do: \n                    if a == s: \n                        # skip? \n                    ans1 += d1[a]\n\n                Then we do d1[s] += 1\n\n            What is this doing?\n\n            It seems to be counting, for each string s, and for each of the 24 possible one-character changes (to a letter in 'a' to 'l'), the number of times that changed string has been seen before (in d1) and adding that to ans1.\n\n            But note: we skip when a==s? \n\n            Why skip? because if we change a character to the same character, then a==s, and we don't want to count that? \n\n            But the problem: we want pairs that differ in exactly one position. \n\n            How does this relate?\n\n            Consider: \n                We are iterating over each string s (as j) and then we are considering all strings that can be obtained by changing one character of s to any letter in 'a' to 'l'. \n\n                Then we are adding d1[a] for each such a. \n\n                But d1[a] is the count of the string a that we have seen so far (in the previous strings, because we update d1 after processing the string).\n\n            However, note: we are updating d1[s] after we process the string.\n\n            So for the current string s, we are considering all strings that are one-change away from s (to any letter in 'a' to 'l') and then we add the count of how many times we have seen that string in the past.\n\n            But note: the problem counts pairs (i,j) with i<j. \n\n            We are iterating j from 0 to n-1, and for each j, we are counting the number of i<j such that the string at i is one of the 24 one-change strings of the current string s_j.\n\n            But wait: the one-change string might not be the same as the string at i. \n\n            Actually, we are counting: \n                For a fixed j, we consider a string a that is one change away from s_j. Then we add the count of a in the previous strings.\n\n            But note: the string a might be one change away from s_j, but the string a might be the same as the string at i? \n\n            However, the pair (i,j) is such that the two strings (s_i and s_j) differ in exactly one position. \n\n            But here, we are generating a string a that is one change away from s_j, and then we are counting the frequency of a in the previous strings. \n\n            But if there is a string a that is in the dictionary (from a previous string s_i), then the pair (i,j) is such that s_i = a and s_j = s, and s_j can be changed to a by changing one character? \n\n            But note: we are changing s_j to a, so a and s_j differ in exactly one position. \n\n            However, the string a might be different from s_j in one position, but that does not necessarily mean that the original string s_i (which is a) and s_j differ in exactly one position? \n\n            Actually, it does: because a and s_j differ in exactly one position.\n\n            But note: we are generating a from s_j by changing one character. So a and s_j differ in exactly one position.\n\n            And if we have seen a in a previous string s_i, then the pair (i,j) (with i<j) is a valid pair.\n\n            However, we are also generating a that might differ in one position, but note: we are iterating over both positions and all 12 letters. \n\n            But the problem: the strings are of length 2, and we are changing one character to any letter from 'a' to 'l'. \n\n            But the input strings only contain 'a' to 'k'. So if we generate a string that has a letter 'l', then it won't be in the dictionary? because the dictionary only has keys for 'a' to 'l'? but we initialized d1 for all pairs from 'a' to 'l', and we update d1 only for the input strings (which are from 'a' to 'k'). So the keys that contain 'l' will be 0.\n\n            But the input strings are from 'a' to 'k', so we will never have a string with 'l'. Therefore, when we generate a string a that has a letter 'l', then d1[a] will be 0.\n\n            So it's safe.\n\n            However, we are generating 24 neighbors per string, but the problem: the valid one-change strings should only change to the letters in the range 'a' to 'k'? \n\n            But the problem does not restrict the change to only the letters that are in the input? \n\n            The problem: the strings in the input are from 'a' to 'k', but when we change a character, we can change it to any letter from 'a' to 'k'? \n\n            But the problem does not say that the change is restricted to the letters that appear? \n\n            Actually, the problem: we are counting pairs (i,j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position. The letters in the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. \n\n            So the one-change string we generate should only use letters from 'a' to 'k'. \n\n            But the code uses 97 to 109, which is 12 letters: 'a' to 'l'. \n\n            We should change the range to 97 to 108? but 108 is 'l'. \n\n            The problem says 'a' to 'k': which is 97 to 107.\n\n            So we should use range(97, 108) for 11 letters? \n\n            But 97 to 108 (exclusive) is 97..107 -> 11 letters.\n\n            However, the code has 97 to 109: which is 12 letters.\n\n            We must fix: the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we should only consider 11 letters: 'a' to 'k'. \n\n            So the range should be from 97 to 108? \n\n            But 108 is exclusive, so 97 to 108 (exclusive) is 97,98,...,107 -> 11 letters.\n\n            But the code has 97 to 109 -> 12 letters.\n\n            We should change the range to 97 to 108? \n\n            But we are not allowed to change the code outside the TODO? \n\n            The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we can only fill the TODO.\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                In the TODO part, we skip the iteration if the generated letter is beyond 'k'? \n\n            But the range is fixed: 97 to 109. \n\n            Alternatively, we can skip when the generated letter is not in the range 'a' to 'k'? \n\n            But the range 97 to 109 includes 'l' (108). \n\n            We can do in the TODO:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue   # skip, but note: the code has a placeholder\n\n            But the code currently has:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n\n            But then we skip the addition for the same string.\n\n            Then we do: ans1 += d1[a]   for the other cases.\n\n            But we are generating a which might be the same as s? that happens when we change a character to itself.\n\n            We want to skip that because we don't want to count the same string.\n\n            But also, we want to skip when the generated letter is 'l'? \n\n            However, the dictionary d1 has keys for 'l', but the input never has 'l', so d1[a] for a containing 'l' is 0.\n\n            So we don't need to skip explicitly.\n\n            But the problem: the input strings are only from 'a' to 'k', so the dictionary d1 for a string containing 'l' is 0.\n\n            So we can leave the generation as is.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO part is:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue   # skip the current generated string if it is the same as s\n\n            But note: the code after the TODO is:\n\n                ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            So if a==s, we skip the addition? \n\n            But we don't want to count the same string? \n\n            Actually, we want to count pairs that differ in exactly one position. The same string does not differ, so we skip.\n\n            But the code already has:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: ...\n\n            and then we are supposed to do something? \n\n            The code after the if is: ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            We want to skip that addition when a==s.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue   # this will skip the rest of the inner loop for this (l, m) and go to the next.\n\n            But note: the continue is for the innermost loop? \n\n            Actually, we are inside:\n                for l in range(2):\n                    for m in range(97,109):\n                        ... \n                        if a==s:\n                            continue   # this will skip the next line (ans1 += d1[a]) and go to next m.\n\n            But we don't want to skip the entire inner loop, just skip the addition for this particular a.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            Or:\n\n                if a != s:\n                    ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            But the problem says: we can only fill in the TODO part.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    pass   # and then we do nothing, and then the ans1 += d1[a] is executed? \n\n            But we don't want to add when a==s.\n\n            So we must skip the line.\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue   # skip to next m\n\n            Then the line `ans1 += d1[a]` is skipped.\n\n            That is what we want.\n\n            But note: the continue will skip the rest of the block for this (l, m) and go to the next m.\n\n            That is acceptable.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do nothing in the TODO and then the line `ans1 += d1[a]` is executed even when a==s? \n\n            Then we would be adding d1[s] for the same string? \n\n            But at the time we are processing the current string s, we haven't updated d1[s] yet. \n\n            So d1[s] is the count of the string s in the previous strings. \n\n            And we are about to do d1[s] += 1 after the inner loops.\n\n            So if we add d1[s] when a==s, we are counting the previous occurrences of s? \n\n            But the pair (i,j) for a previous string i that is the same as s: \n                The two strings are the same -> they do not differ in exactly one position -> we should not count.\n\n            So we must skip.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO for program1.py is:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n\n            But note: the code has:\n\n                for l in range(2):\n                    for m in range(97,109):\n                        a = list(s)\n                        a[l] = chr(m)\n                        a = ''.join(a)\n                        if a == s:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            We want to skip the addition when a==s.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n\n            This will skip the `ans1 += d1[a]` for this (l, m).\n\n            But what if we want to skip only the addition? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    pass   # and then the addition happens? we don't want that.\n\n            Or we can do:\n\n                if a != s:\n                    ans1 += d1[a]\n\n            But we are not allowed to change the line after the TODO.\n\n            So we must use continue to skip the addition.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break out of the inner loop? no.\n\n            So we use continue.\n\n        But note: the continue will skip the addition and go to the next m.\n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n\n        And for program2.py, we have:\n\n            if not i:\n                continue\n            if len(i) == 1:\n                b = 1\n                break\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the condition `if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i` can be written as:\n\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n\n        However, we can also write:\n\n            if not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n        But the two are equivalent.\n\n        We'll use the disjunctive form.\n\n        Now, we output in the JSON format.\n\n        Example:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if a == s:\\n                continue\",\n                \"program2\": \"if not i:\\n                continue\\n            if len(i) == 1:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program1.py code has 8 spaces for indentation? \n\n        In the given program1.py, the TODO is in a block that is indented by 4 spaces (from the for loops). \n\n        The program2.py code is in a block that is indented by 4 spaces from the for loop.\n\n        We'll use the same indentation.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding.\n\n        For program1.py, the surrounding has:\n\n            for y in range(n):\n                s = input()\n                for l in range(2):\n                    for m in range(97,109):\n                        a = list(s)\n                        a[l] = chr(m)\n                        a = ''.join(a)\n                        if a == s:\n                            # TODO: Your code here   [this line is indented by 20 spaces? or 16?]\n\n        Actually, the code we are given for program1.py has:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for x in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                d1 = {}\n                for i in range(97,109):\n                    for j in range(97,109):\n                        d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n                ans1 = 0\n                for y in range(n):\n                    s = input()\n                    for l in range(2):\n                        for m in range(97,109):\n                            a = list(s)\n                            a[l] = chr(m)\n                            a = ''.join(a)\n                            if a == s:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n                            ans1+=d1[a]\n                    d1[s]+=1\n                print(ans1)\n\n        The TODO is at an indentation level of 24 spaces? \n\n        But we can use 8 spaces per level? \n\n        Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n        The structure:\n\n            for y ...:  [level 4]\n                for l ...: [level 8]\n                    for m ...: [level 12]\n                        ...

[level 20]\n\n        So we should indent the continue by 20 spaces? \n\n        But in the JSON string, we can represent it as:\n\n            \"                if a == s:\\n                    continue\"\n\n        But that might be 16 spaces for the if and 20 for the continue? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the exact same indentation as the surrounding.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify, so we use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            program1: \n                \"if a == s:\\n                continue\"\n\n            But the line after the if should be indented more. \n\n        How about:\n\n            \"if a == s:\\n                    continue\"\n\n        That is 20 spaces for the continue.\n\n        But the surrounding has the line `ans1+=d1[a]` at 16 spaces.\n\n        We want the continue to be at the same level as the TODO comment.\n\n        The TODO comment is at 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is in an if block, so the next line should be indented by 4 more.\n\n        But the code we are writing is to replace the TODO.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            program1: \n                \"continue\"\n\n            But that would be:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue   # but the continue is at the same level as the if body.\n\n            How many spaces? \n\n            The if is at 16 spaces, and the continue should be at 20.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"    continue\"\n\n        But then the entire block becomes:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n                ans1 += d1[a]\n\n        But the continue is 20 spaces, and the ans1 line is 16 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"continue\"\n\n        and then the code becomes:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n        But the if body is one statement: the continue.\n\n        How about we write:\n\n            \"continue\"\n\n        without any if? \n\n        But we are inside the if a==s.\n\n        So the code for program1.py in the TODO is simply:\n\n            continue\n\n        And the indentation is already provided by the surrounding.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            \"continue\"\n\n        But note: the continue will be at the same indentation level as the comment, which is 16 spaces? \n\n        The code:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue   # this is 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the if is at 16 spaces, and the continue should be at 20.\n\n        But the code we are given has:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            and then the next line (ans1 += ...) is at 16 spaces.\n\n        We want to skip the next line when a==s.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue   # at 20 spaces\n\n        So we need to output:\n\n            \"    continue\"\n\n        with 4 spaces at the beginning.\n\n        But the problem: the TODO is at 16 spaces, and we are replacing the comment with 4 more spaces and then \"continue\", so that the continue is at 20 spaces.\n\n        How about we output:\n\n            \"    continue\"\n\n        But then the code becomes:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here    continue   -> no, we are replacing the comment.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: the TODO is a placeholder for the code. We remove the comment and put the code.\n\n        So we put:\n\n            if a == s:\n                [our code]\n\n        We want:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n\n        So we output the string \"    continue\", which is 4 spaces and then \"continue\".\n\n        But the next line (ans1 += ...) is at 16 spaces, which is outside the if.\n\n        So the structure is:\n\n            if a == s:\n                continue\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the code we are to put is:\n\n            if not i:\n                continue\n            if len(i) == 1:\n                b = 1\n                break\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        The surrounding:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                # TODO: Your code here   [this is at 4 spaces?]\n\n            The for loop is at 4 spaces, and the TODO is at 8? \n\n            Actually, the code:\n\n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    b = 0\n                    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The for loop for i is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12.\n\n            We want to put multiple lines.\n\n            We'll output:\n\n                if not i:\\n                    continue\\n                if len(i) == 1:\\n                    b = 1\\n                    break\\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                    b = 1\\n                    break\n\n            But we need to match the indentation.\n\n            The current level is 8 spaces for the for loop, then the body should be 12.\n\n            So each line of the body should be indented by 12 spaces.\n\n            But the code we are writing is at the same level as the TODO, which is 12.\n\n            We can write:\n\n                \"if not i: continue\"\n\n            but that is not multiple lines.\n\n            We need to break into multiple lines.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                line1: \"if not i:\"\n                line2: \"    continue\"\n                but then the next if should be at the same level as the first if.\n\n            Actually, we want:\n\n                if not i:\n                    continue\n                if len(i) == 1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            The entire block is at 12 spaces, and the inner blocks are 16.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n                continue\\n            if len(i) == 1:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n\n            But the first line: \"if not i:\" at 12 spaces, then \"continue\" at 16 spaces, then \"if len(i)==1\" at 12 spaces? \n\n            We want:\n\n                12: if not i:\n                16:     continue\n                12: if len(i)==1:\n                16:     b = 1\n                16:     break\n                12: if ... \n\n            But the code after the first if is at 12 spaces? \n\n            We must indent the continue by 4 more spaces.\n\n            So the string for program2.py:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n                    continue\\n                if len(i) == 1:\\n                    b = 1\\n                    break\\n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                    b = 1\\n                    break\"\n\n            How many spaces? \n\n                The base level is 12 spaces.\n\n                Then the if not i: is at 12 spaces.\n                Then the continue should be at 16 spaces -> so we add 4 spaces: \"    continue\" -> total 16.\n                Then the next if is at 12 spaces.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n    continue\\nif len(i) == 1:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\\nif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n            But then the entire block is not indented.\n\n            We must indent each line by 12 spaces? \n\n            But the problem: we are replacing the TODO, and the TODO is at 12 spaces.\n\n            The code we output will be inserted at 12 spaces.\n\n            So we don't need to put the 12 spaces again.\n\n            We only need to indent the inner blocks.\n\n            Therefore, we write:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n                continue\\n            if len(i) == 1:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\\n            if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n\n            But wait, the base level is 12, so:\n\n                Line1: \"if not i:\" -> at 12\n                Line2: \"    continue\" -> but we want 16, so we output 4 spaces? \n\n            How about we output:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n    continue\\nif len(i) == 1:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\\nif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n            Then when inserted at 12 spaces, it becomes:\n\n                    12 spaces + \"if not i:\"\n                    12 spaces + \"    continue\"\n                    12 spaces + \"if len(i) == 1:\"\n                    ...\n\n            The \"    continue\" becomes 12+4 = 16 spaces, which is correct.\n\n            Similarly, the \"    b = 1\" becomes 16 spaces.\n\n            So we can output the code without extra indentation.\n\n            Therefore, the string for program2.py is:\n\n                \"if not i:\\n    continue\\nif len(i) == 1:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\\nif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n        But note: the condition in the last if: we wrote 'R' and 'B'. \n\n        However, the problem uses uppercase in the condition? \n\n        The string i is a string of 'R' and 'B' and possibly others? \n\n        But the segment i is a string of non-white characters, which are 'R' and 'B'. \n\n        And we are checking for the letters 'R' and 'B'. \n\n        So we use 'R' and 'B'.\n\n        But the problem: the input uses uppercase? \n\n        The input: the string s consists of 'W', 'R', 'B'. \n\n        So we use 'R' and 'B'.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"continue\"\n            program2: \"if not i:\\n    continue\\nif len(i) == 1:\\n    b = 1\\n    break\\nif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\\n    b = "
