Therefore, we can compute k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) and then check if there is an i such that ceil(S_i/t_j) is greater? But we just saw that the sequence is non-decreasing, so the maximum is the last element. Therefore, k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) is sufficient? However, in the example [3,1] with t_j=2: \n        S_total = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> that matches. But consider: \n        n=3, volumes = [3, 1, 1], t_j=2.\n        S_1=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n        S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n        S_3=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3 Then k_min = 3.\n\n        But if we set k = ceil(5/2)=3, then we need 3 pipes.

Then the water passing through the first two locks is 4 (from the first lock) and the overflow from the first lock to the second is 1, but the pipe in the third lock does not contribute to the first two. Therefore, the water that passes through the first two locks is 4, which is exactly 4 -> okay. For the entire system: 3 pipes * 2 seconds = 6, which is >=5. So k=3 works. But note: the condition for the first two locks: we require the number of pipes in the first two locks to be at least ceil(4/2)=2. We have 2 in the first lock -> that's in the first two, so we have 2 pipes in the first two -> okay. However, what if we try k=2? Condition for the entire system: 2*2=4 < 5 -> fails. So k_min=3.

The locks: \n              lock1: gets 6 liters -> but it only holds 1 -> so 1 liter stays and 5 overflow to lock2.\n              lock2: gets 5 (from lock1) -> but it holds 2 -> so 2 liters stay and 3 overflow to lock3. lock3: gets 3 (from lock2) and 6 from its own pipe -> total 9 liters? but it only holds 3 -> so 3 liters stay and 6 overflow to lock4.\n              lock4: gets 6 (from lock3) and 6 from its own pipe -> total 12 liters? but it holds 4 -> so 4 liters stay and 8 overflow to lock5.\n              lock5: gets 8 liters -> but it holds 5 -> so 5 liters stay and 3 overflow to the river.

But we argued that the minimal k is max_i ceil(S_i / t_j), and since the sequence ceil(S_i/t_j) is non-decreasing, the maximum is at i=n: ceil(S_total / t_j). However, we also saw that in the example [3,1] (n=2) with t_j=2: \n                S_1 = 3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n                S_2 = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n                so k_min=2. And in the example [3,1,1] (n=3) with t_j=2: \n                S_1=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n                S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n                S_3=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3\n                so k_min=3. Therefore, we must compute k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) only if there is no prefix i for which ceil(S_i/t_j) is greater than ceil(S_total/t_j)? But we proved that the sequence is non-decreasing, so the maximum is at i=n. Therefore, k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j). However, wait: in the example [3,1] with t_j=2: \n                ceil(S_2/2)=ceil(4/2)=2, which is the same as ceil(S_total/t_j).

But we argued that the maximum over i of ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) is ceil(prefix[n]/t_j) = ceil(S_total/t_j). Therefore, it is safe. But wait: what if there is an i such that ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > ceil(S_total/t_j)? Since prefix[i] <= S_total, then ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) <= ceil(S_total/t_j) only if the sequence is non-decreasing?

Query: t_j=3 -> ans = ceil(15/3)=5. Query: t_j=4 -> ans = ceil(15/4)= ceil(3.75)=4. Query: t_j=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3. Query: t_j=6 -> ceil(15/6)= ceil(2.5)=3. This matches our calculation. But the example output in the problem says for the first test case: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This implies that the first test case has queries: \n            1,2,3,4,5,6 -> and the answers for t_j=3 and t_j=4 are -1?

But note: the condition ceil(prefix[i]/t_j)<=i is equivalent to prefix[i] <= i * t_j. Why? ceil(a/b) <= c   <=>   a/b <= c   [because if a/b is not an integer, ceil(a/b) is the next integer, and if a/b is an integer then ceil(a/b)=a/b]\n            is not true: ceil(3/2)=2<=2 is true, and 3/2=1.5<=2 is true. ceil(3/1)=3<=3 -> 3/1<=3 -> true. ceil(3/2)=2<=1 -> false, and 3/2=1.5<=1 -> false. Actually, ceil(a/b) <= c   if and only if   a <= b * c.\n            Proof: \n                ceil(a/b) = floor((a-1)/b) + 1. ceil(a/b) <= c  => floor((a-1)/b) + 1 <= c  => floor((a-1)/b) < = c-1  => (a-1)/b < c  => a-1 < b*c  => a <= b*c   (since a,b,c integers) But wait: ceil(3/2)=2<=2: 3<=2*2=4 -> true. ceil(3/2)=2<=1: 3<=2*1=2 -> false. However, the converse: if a<=b*c, then ceil(a/b) <= c?\n                a<=b*c  => a/b <= c  => ceil(a/b) <= ceil(c) = c?  -> not necessarily: ceil(a/b) might be greater than c if a/b is not an integer and c is integer? Example: a=3, b=2, c=1.5: ceil(3/2)=2>1.5 -> fails. But c is an integer (because it's the number of pipes in the first i locks, and i is integer). So if a<=b*c and c is integer, then a/b<=c, so ceil(a/b) is the smallest integer >= a/b, and since a/b<=c, then ceil(a/b)<=c? \n                Not exactly: if a/b = 3.5 and c=4, then ceil(3.5)=4<=4 -> true. if a/b=3.5 and c=3, then a=7, b=2, c=3: 7<=2*3=6 -> false. Therefore, the condition a<=b*c is equivalent to ceil(a/b)<=c when c is integer. So the condition for each i: prefix[i] <= i * t_j. Therefore, for a given t_j, if there exists an i such that prefix[i] > i * t_j, then it's impossible -> output -1.",

Query: t_j=4:\n                i=1: 1<=4 -> holds. i=2: 3<=8 -> holds. i=3: 6<=12 -> holds. i=4: 10<=16 -> holds. i=5: 15<=20 -> holds. then k = ceil(15/4)=4. Query: t_j=5:\n                i=1: 1<=5 -> holds. i=2: 3<=10 -> holds. i=3: 6<=15 -> holds. i=4: 10<=20 -> holds. i=5: 15<=25 -> holds. then k = ceil(15/5)=3. Query: t_j=6:\n                similarly, holds, k=ceil(15/6)=3. Query: t_j=2:\n                i=1: 1<=2 -> holds. i=2: 3<=4 -> holds? 3<=4 -> holds. i=3: 6<=6 -> holds. i=4: 10<=8 -> fails. Therefore, for t_j=2: -1.\n\n            Query: t_j=1:\n                i=1: 1<=1 -> holds. i=2: 3<=2 -> fails. So the answers for the first test case with queries [1,2,3,4,5,6] are:\n                t_j=1: -1\n                t_j=2: -1\n                t_j=3: 5\n                t_j=4: 4\n                t_j=5: 3\n                t_j=6: 3\n\n        But the example output in the problem says for the first test case:\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This matches if the queries are not 1,2,3,4,5,6 but something else?",

And \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\" -> which is 4 pipes, but the minimal might be 3? But the example output for the fifth query is 3, not 4.",

For the example: \n            i=1: ceil(1/1)=1\n            i=2: ceil(3/2)=2\n            i=3: ceil(6/3)=2\n            i=4: ceil(10/4)=3\n            i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n            so t_min=3. Therefore, for t_j=3, we can achieve the filling? How? We need k_min = ceil(15/3)=5. But we have only 5 locks. So we open all 5 pipes? Then in 3 seconds, we get 15 liters. The first lock: 3 liters -> fills the first lock (1 liter) and overflows 2 to the second. Second lock: gets 2 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 5, but the second lock only needs 2? -> then it overflows 3 to the third. Third lock: gets 3 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 6, but the third lock only needs 3 -> overflows 3 to the fourth. Fourth lock: gets 3 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 6, but the fourth lock needs 4 -> then it overflows 2 to the fifth. Fifth lock: gets 2 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 5, which is exactly what it needs. So it works. Therefore, for t_j=3, we output k_min=5. But the example says that the third query (t_j=3) is -1?",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first problem involves efficiently answering multiple queries about the maximum total value of free items a customer can receive in a store promotion. The second problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to ensure all white cells in an infinite grid contain zero dolls, using combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach for Program1 (Store Promotion)\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The store has `n` items with given prices. For each query, the customer must purchase at least `x` items, and the `y` cheapest items among them are free. The goal is to maximize the total value of the free items for each query.\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal strategy is for the customer to select the `x` most expensive items. The sum of the `y` cheapest items in this selection (which are the last `y` items in the sorted list of the selected items) will be the maximum possible free value.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Sort the item prices in descending order. Compute a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Query Processing**: For each query `(x, y)`, the sum of the free items is the sum of the items from position `x-y` to `x-1` in the sorted list. This can be derived using the prefix sums as `prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]` (handling edge cases where `x-y-1` is negative).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Sorting**: O(n log n) time.\n   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n) time.\n   - **Query Processing**: O(1) per query, leading to O(q) time for all queries.\n   - **Overall Complexity**: O(n log n + q), which is efficient for the constraints (n, q \u2264 2\u00d710^5).\n\n### Approach for Program2 (Jina in Wonderland)\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves an infinite grid where cells are colored based on a non-increasing sequence. The goal is to determine the minimum operations required to remove all dolls from white cells, starting with one doll at (0, 0). Each operation splits a doll into two, moving one right and one down.\n2. **Intuition**: The number of times a doll appears at any white cell (x, y) (where y < a_x) is given by the binomial coefficient C(x+y, x). The total operations required is the sum of these coefficients over all white cells.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Combinatorial Mathematics**: The sum of binomial coefficients over all white cells (x, y) for y from 0 to a_x-1 simplifies to C(x + a_x, x+1) using combinatorial identities.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to a sufficiently large number to efficiently compute binomial coefficients modulo 10^9+7.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Precomputation**: O(M) for factorials and inverses, where M is the maximum value needed (up to 400,000).\n   - **Processing Sequence**: O(n) for summing the binomial coefficients for each term in the sequence until a zero is encountered.\n   - **Overall Complexity**: O(M + n), which is efficient for the constraints (n \u2264 2\u00d710^5, a_i \u2264 2\u00d710^5).\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0]-xy[1]-1])\",\n  \"program2\": \"    if z == 0: break\\n    d = (d + f[x+z] * pow(f[x+1], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[z-1], m-2, m) % m) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The solution processes each query by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums of the sorted prices. For a query `(x, y)`, it retrieves the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the top `x` items by subtracting the prefix sum at `x-y-1` from the prefix sum at `x-1`.\n- **Program2**: The solution calculates the sum of binomial coefficients C(x + a_x, x+1) for each term in the non-increasing sequence until a zero is encountered. It uses precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently compute these coefficients under modulo 10^9+7, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs. The result is accumulated in variable `d`, which is printed at the end.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\n We are given the total number of locks n, then a list of n volumes, then q queries (each query is a time t_j)\n The idea:\n 1. We first compute the minimum time required to fill all locks (t_min) as the maximum over i (from 1 to n) of ceil(S_i / i), \n    where S_i = v0 + v1 + ... + v_{i-1} (the prefix sum up to the i-th lock, 0-indexed).\n    Why? Because the water that flows through the first i locks must at least be the sum of the volumes of the first i locks. \n    And if we have k pipes that are all contributing to the first i locks (and note that water from a pipe at a lock beyond i doesn't help the first i locks until they are full), \n    then the time must be at least ceil(S_i / k). But note: we are distributing the water from k pipes to the first i locks? Actually, the water from a pipe at a lock j (<= i) will contribute to the first i locks until they are full. However, note that water from a pipe at a lock j>i might also contribute to the first i locks? But wait: the problem states that water exceeding a lock is transferred to the next. So if we have a pipe at a lock beyond i, then until the first i locks are full, the water from that pipe will eventually flow to the first i locks? Actually, no: the water from a pipe at lock j (j>i) will first fill lock j and then overflow to j+1, but it never goes backwards. So it does not help the first i locks. Therefore, the water for the first i locks must come from the pipes that are at locks 1 to i. Hence, if we have k pipes, then the total water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time t is k * t. We require k * t >= S_i. Therefore, for the first i locks to be filled by time t, we must have k >= ceil(S_i / t). But note: we are going to use the same k for all i? Actually, we are going to set k to be the total number of pipes. However, the constraint must hold for every i: k >= ceil(S_i / t). Therefore, the minimal k for a given t must be at least max_i(ceil(S_i / t)). \n\n 2. However, note the problem: we are to compute the minimum number of pipes k such that after t_j seconds all locks are filled. And we have the constraint that the water from a pipe at a lock j only contributes to the locks from j onward until it overflows. But the key is that the entire system must be filled. The total water that must be provided is the total sum S = v0+v1+...+v_{n-1}. However, the water from a pipe at lock j will only contribute to the locks from j to the end. But note: if we have k pipes, then the total water provided is k * t. And we require k * t >= S. However, that is not sufficient: we also have the constraint that the water must be distributed appropriately so that the first lock is filled by the water that goes through it. \n\n 3. Actually, the problem is more subtle. We have two constraints for a fixed k (number of pipes) and time t:\n    a) k * t >= S (the total water must be at least the total volume).\n    b) For every i (from 1 to n): the water that has passed through the first i locks must be at least the sum of the first i locks. But note: the water that passes through the first i locks is exactly the water from the pipes that are in the first i locks? Actually, no: a pipe at a lock j (with j>i) does not contribute to the first i locks. However, a pipe at a lock j (with j<=i) does. But also, water from a pipe at a lock j (with j>i) does not help the first i locks. Therefore, the water that has passed through the first i locks is the sum of the water from the pipes at locks 1 to i. Let k_i be the number of pipes in the first i locks. Then the water that has passed through the first i locks is k_i * t. We require k_i * t >= S_i (the prefix sum for the first i locks). Therefore, we must have k_i >= ceil(S_i / t). Since k_i <= k (the total number of pipes), we must have k >= ceil(S_i / t) for every i.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k for a given t must be at least M = max(ceil(S_1/t), ceil(S_2/t), ..., ceil(S_n/t), ceil(S_total/t)?). But note: the condition for the entire system (i=n) is k * t >= S_total, which is the same as k >= ceil(S_total/t). However, note that for i=n, we have S_n = S_total. So the condition for i=n is k>=ceil(S_total/t). Therefore, the condition for the entire system is included in the max over i.\n\n 4. However, note that we computed t_min as the maximum over i of ceil(S_i / i) [but wait, in the code we did: for i from 1 to n, we computed t_min = max(t_min, ceil(S_i / i))]. Why i? Actually, that was for the minimal time when we have i pipes? But note: the problem in the code is computing the minimal time required to fill the locks if we are allowed to use as many pipes as we want? Actually, no: the minimal time is constrained by the fact that we cannot have more than one pipe per lock? Actually, we can have multiple pipes? But note: the problem says \"open pipes\" and each lock has one pipe. But we can open any subset of the pipes. However, the minimal time is determined by the worst bottleneck: for the first i locks, we have at most i pipes (because there are only i locks from 1 to i) and we need to fill the prefix sum S_i. Therefore, the minimal time must be at least ceil(S_i / i). So t_min = max_i(ceil(S_i / i)) is the minimal time required to fill the system (if we open all pipes? but note: if we open all pipes, then we have n pipes, and the time would be max(ceil(S_i / i) for i from 1 to n). \n\n 5. Now, for a query with time t_j:\n    - If t_j < t_min, then it's impossible -> output -1.\n    - Otherwise, we want the minimal k (number of pipes) such that:\n          k >= ceil(S_i / t_j) for every i in [1, n]\n        and also note that k must be at least ceil(S_total / t_j) (but that is included in i=n).\n\n    But note: k must be an integer and we can choose which pipes to open arbitrarily. However, the condition for each i is: k_i (the number of pipes in the first i locks) must be at least ceil(S_i / t_j). But we are free to choose the positions of the pipes. The minimal total k that satisfies the condition is the maximum over i of ceil(S_i / t_j). Why? Because if we set k = max_i(ceil(S_i / t_j)), then for each i, we can assign at least ceil(S_i / t_j) pipes to the first i locks? Actually, we are not forced to put the pipes only in the first i locks? But note: the condition for the first i locks only requires that the number of pipes in the first i locks (k_i) is at least ceil(S_i / t_j). However, we are free to put pipes anywhere. But if we put a pipe beyond the first i locks, it doesn't help the first i locks. Therefore, we must have at least ceil(S_i / t_j) pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, the total number of pipes k must be at least ceil(S_i / t_j) for every i. Hence, the minimal k is M = max_i(ceil(S_i / t_j)).\n\n    However, note: we can also put pipes beyond the first i locks, but they don't help the first i locks. Therefore, the condition for the first i locks is independent and requires that the pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i / t_j). Therefore, the total number of pipes k must be at least the maximum over i of ceil(S_i / t_j). But note: we can always assign the pipes arbitrarily? Actually, we are not constrained by the positions? The problem is: we can choose any set of pipes to open. The minimal k is the maximum over i of ceil(S_i / t_j). Why? Because if we set k = M, then for each i we can assign at least ceil(S_i / t_j) pipes to the first i locks? But note: the same pipe is counted in multiple i? Actually, a pipe at lock j is counted in the first i locks for every i>=j. Therefore, we cannot assign the same pipe to multiple segments. However, we are not \"assigning\" per segment. The condition is: for the first i locks, the total number of pipes that are in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i / t_j). This is a family of constraints. The minimal k that satisfies all these constraints is the maximum over i of ceil(S_i / t_j). Why? Because if we have k total pipes, then the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most k (if we put all pipes in the first i locks). But we can also put pipes beyond the first i locks, which doesn't help the first i locks. Therefore, to satisfy the constraint for the first i locks, we must have at least ceil(S_i / t_j) pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, the total k must be at least ceil(S_i / t_j) for every i. Hence, k_min = max_i(ceil(S_i / t_j)).\n\n    However, note: we can also consider that the condition for i=n is k >= ceil(S_total / t_j). And for i=1, k >= ceil(v0 / t_j). But the condition for the entire system (i=n) is k >= ceil(S_total / t_j). And the condition for the first lock is k >= ceil(v0 / t_j). But note: the condition for the first i locks might be more restrictive? For example, if we have a very large lock at the beginning, then ceil(v0/t_j) might be large. \n\n 6. Therefore, for a given t_j, we can compute:\n        k_min = max( ceil(S_1/t_j), ceil(S_2/t_j), ..., ceil(S_n/t_j) )\n    where S_i = v0 + v1 + ... + v_{i-1} (0-indexed, so S_1 = v0, S_2 = v0+v1, ...).\n\n 7. But note: the problem states that the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200,000. However, we have q up to 200,000 and n up to 200,000. If we try to compute k_min for each query by iterating over all n prefixes, that would be O(n*q) which is 40e9, too slow.\n\n 8. We need a more efficient way. Notice that the function f(i) = ceil(S_i / t_j) is a non-decreasing function in S_i? Actually, S_i is increasing, but when we divide by t_j and take ceiling, it is non-decreasing? Yes, because S_i is increasing. However, note that the condition for a fixed t_j: \n        ceil(S_i / t_j) = (S_i + t_j - 1) // t_j   (if we use integer arithmetic)\n\n    And we want M = max_{i=1..n} ceil(S_i / t_j). But note: since S_i is increasing, ceil(S_i / t_j) is non-decreasing? Actually, no: consider t_j=3, S_i: [1,2,3,4] -> ceil(1/3)=1, ceil(2/3)=1, ceil(3/3)=1, ceil(4/3)=2 -> so it is non-decreasing? Actually, it is non-decreasing because S_i is increasing. Therefore, the maximum is at the last element: ceil(S_n / t_j). \n\n    But wait: is that true? Consider two consecutive prefixes: \n        ceil(S_i / t_j) and ceil(S_{i+1}/t_j) = ceil( (S_i + v_i) / t_j )\n        Since v_i is positive, (S_i + v_i) >= S_i, so ceil((S_i+v_i)/t_j) >= ceil(S_i/t_j). \n\n    Therefore, the sequence ceil(S_i/t_j) is non-decreasing. Hence, the maximum is at i=n: ceil(S_total / t_j). \n\n    However, that contradicts the example in the note: \n        Example: n=5, volumes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], t_j=3.\n        S_1=1 -> ceil(1/3)=1\n        S_2=3 -> ceil(3/3)=1\n        S_3=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2\n        S_4=10 -> ceil(10/3)= ceil(3.33) = 4\n        S_5=15 -> ceil(15/3)=5.\n\n        Then k_min = max(1,1,2,4,5)=5.\n\n    But wait: is that the minimal k? How can we fill the system with 5 pipes? \n        In 3 seconds, 5 pipes would produce 15 liters, which is exactly the total volume. \n        However, we must check the constraints for each prefix:\n          i=1: we need at least ceil(1/3)=1 pipe in the first lock -> we have 5 pipes, so we can assign at least one in the first lock? Actually, we can assign one pipe to the first lock and the rest elsewhere. Then the first lock gets 3 liters in 3 seconds, which is more than 1. \n          i=2: we need ceil(3/3)=1 pipe in the first two locks -> we have at least one pipe in the first two? Actually, we have one pipe in the first and then we have others beyond? But the condition requires the pipes in the first two locks to be at least 1. We have one in the first, and we can put one in the second? Actually, we have 5 pipes: we can put one in the first, one in the second, and the rest in the others. Then the first two locks: the first lock gets 3 liters (but it only needs 1, so 2 liters overflow to the second). The second lock gets 3 liters from its own pipe and 2 from the overflow -> total 5, but it only needs 2. So that's more than enough.\n\n        However, the condition for the first two locks: the water that passes through the first two locks must be at least 3. The water that passes through the first two locks is the water from the pipes in the first two locks. We have two pipes (one in the first, one in the second) -> 2*3 = 6, which is >=3. \n\n        Similarly, for i=3: we need ceil(6/3)=2 -> we have at least two pipes in the first three? We have one in the first, one in the second, and one in the third -> that's 3, which is >=2. \n        i=4: ceil(10/3)=4 -> we need at least 4 pipes in the first four. We have one in the first, one in the second, one in the third, and one in the fourth -> that's 4, so 4*3=12>=10 -> okay.\n        i=5: ceil(15/3)=5 -> we have 5 pipes, so 5*3=15.\n\n        So k=5 works.\n\n    But note: is k=4 enough? \n        Condition for i=5: 4*3=12 < 15 -> fails. So k=5 is minimal.\n\n    However, the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/t_j) is 5, which is the same as ceil(S_5/t_j). So in this example, the maximum is at the last.\n\n    Now consider a different example: \n        n=2, volumes = [3, 1], t_j=2.\n        S_1 = 3 -> ceil(3/2)= ceil(1.5)=2.\n        S_2 = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2.\n        Then k_min = max(2,2)=2.\n\n        But what if we use k=1? \n          Condition for i=1: we need at least ceil(3/2)=2 pipes in the first lock? -> fails because we only have 1 pipe. So k=1 fails.\n          Condition for i=2: k=1 -> 1*2=2 < 4 -> fails.\n\n        So k_min=2.\n\n        Now, if we use k=2: \n          We can put both pipes in the first lock? Then the first lock gets 4 liters in 2 seconds (which is more than 3, so 1 overflows to the second). The second lock gets 1 liter from overflow -> exactly 1. \n          But note: the condition for the first lock: we have two pipes in the first lock? Then the water passing through the first lock is 4, which is >=3 -> okay.\n          The condition for the entire system: 4 liters total, which is >=4 -> okay.\n\n        However, what if we put one pipe in the first and one in the second?\n          First lock: 2 liters from its own pipe -> not enough (needs 3). \n          But note: the pipe in the second lock: in the first second, it produces 1 liter in the second lock. But the second lock has volume 1, so it gets filled and then the next second the water from the second lock's pipe overflows? But the first lock is not full. The overflow from the second lock goes to the next lock (which doesn't exist) so it is lost. Therefore, the first lock only gets 2 liters. \n\n        Therefore, we must put both pipes in the first lock? \n\n        The condition for the first lock: we require that the number of pipes in the first lock is at least ceil(3/2)=2. So we must have at least 2 pipes in the first lock. Therefore, we must put both pipes in the first lock.\n\n        So the condition that the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/t_j) is the minimal k is correct.\n\n    However, note: in the above example, the maximum was 2 and it occurred at i=1. So the maximum is not necessarily at the last.\n\n    Therefore, we must compute:\n        k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t_j)\n\n    But note: the sequence S_i is increasing, so the sequence ceil(S_i/t_j) is non-decreasing? Actually, no: \n        Consider t_j=3, and volumes = [1, 1, 4]. \n        S_1=1 -> ceil(1/3)=1\n        S_2=2 -> ceil(2/3)=1\n        S_3=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2 -> so non-decreasing.\n\n    Actually, because S_i is increasing, ceil(S_i/t_j) is non-decreasing? \n        Let a = S_i, b = S_{i+1} = a + v_i (v_i>0). Then:\n          ceil(a/t_j) <= ceil((a+1)/t_j) <= ... <= ceil((a+v_i)/t_j)\n        because adding a positive number to a can only increase the value or keep it the same until it crosses a multiple of t_j.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is non-decreasing. So the maximum is at the last element: ceil(S_n/t_j). \n\n    But wait: in the example with [3,1] and t_j=2: \n        S_1=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n        S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> so the maximum is 2, and it occurs at the first and the last.\n\n    Therefore, we can compute k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) and then check if there is an i such that ceil(S_i/t_j) is greater? But we just saw that the sequence is non-decreasing, so the maximum is the last element. Therefore, k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) is sufficient? \n\n    However, in the example [3,1] with t_j=2: \n        S_total = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> that matches.\n\n    But consider: \n        n=3, volumes = [3, 1, 1], t_j=2.\n        S_1=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n        S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n        S_3=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3\n        Then k_min = 3.\n\n        But if we set k = ceil(5/2)=3, then we need 3 pipes. \n        Condition for the first lock: we need at least ceil(3/2)=2 pipes in the first lock -> we have 3 pipes, so we can assign 2 to the first lock? Actually, we can assign 2 to the first and one to the third? \n          First lock: 2 pipes * 2 seconds = 4 liters -> fills the first lock (3) and 1 overflows to the second.\n          Second lock: gets 1 from overflow and we have no pipe there? Then we need 1 liter for the second lock: the overflow gives 1, so it is filled. Then the third lock: we have a pipe at the third: 2 liters. But the third lock only needs 1, so it gets 1 and the rest overflows. \n          Total: 4 (from first lock) + 2 (from third lock) = 6 liters, but we only need 5. \n\n        However, the condition for the entire system: 3*2=6>=5 -> okay.\n\n        But what about the constraint for the first lock: we have 2 pipes in the first lock? -> 2*2=4>=3 -> okay.\n        For the first two locks: the water that passes through the first two locks must be at least 4. The pipes in the first two locks: we have 2 in the first and none in the second? Then the water passing through the first two locks is 4 (from the first lock) and the overflow from the first lock to the second is 1, but the pipe in the third lock does not contribute to the first two. Therefore, the water that passes through the first two locks is 4, which is exactly 4 -> okay.\n\n        For the entire system: 3 pipes * 2 seconds = 6, which is >=5.\n\n        So k=3 works.\n\n        But note: the condition for the first two locks: we require the number of pipes in the first two locks to be at least ceil(4/2)=2. We have 2 in the first lock -> that's in the first two, so we have 2 pipes in the first two -> okay.\n\n        However, what if we try k=2? \n          Condition for the entire system: 2*2=4 < 5 -> fails.\n\n        So k_min=3.\n\n        But note: the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/t_j) is max(ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ceil(5/2)=3) = 3, which is the same as ceil(S_3/t_j)=ceil(5/2)=3.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(S_total/t_j) only if the entire system is the bottleneck? But note: the sequence is non-decreasing, so the maximum is at the last. Therefore, k_min = ceil(S_total/t_j) is sufficient? \n\n    However, wait: in the example [3,1] we had k_min=ceil(4/2)=2, and that matched the maximum over i. In the example [3,1,1] we had k_min=ceil(5/2)=3, which is the maximum over i.\n\n    But consider: \n        n=2, volumes = [1, 3], t_j=2.\n        S_1=1 -> ceil(1/2)=1\n        S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n        Then k_min = 2.\n\n        Now, if we set k=ceil(S_total/t_j)=ceil(4/2)=2, then we need 2 pipes. \n        Condition for the first lock: we need at least ceil(1/2)=1 pipe in the first lock -> we can put one pipe in the first and one in the second? \n          First lock: 1 pipe * 2 seconds = 2 liters -> fills the first lock (1) and 1 overflows to the second.\n          Second lock: gets 1 from overflow and 2 from its own pipe -> total 3, which is enough.\n        So it works.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k is always ceil(S_total/t_j)? \n\n    But wait: what about the example [3,1] with t_j=2: \n        k_min = ceil(4/2)=2 -> works.\n\n    And the example [3,1,1] with t_j=2: \n        k_min = ceil(5/2)=3 -> works.\n\n    However, consider the example from the problem note? \n        The first example test: \n          Input: \n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            6\n            1\n            2\n            3\n            4\n            5\n            6\n\n          The answers: \n            For t=1,2,3,4: -1 (because t_min= ceil(1/1)=1, ceil((1+2)/2)=ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(6/3)=2, ceil(10/4)=3, ceil(15/5)=3 -> so t_min = max(1,2,2,3,3)=3? Actually, we computed t_min as the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/i). \n\n          How did we compute t_min?\n            i=1: ceil(1/1)=1\n            i=2: ceil((1+2)/2)=ceil(3/2)=2\n            i=3: ceil((1+2+3)/3)=ceil(6/3)=2\n            i=4: ceil(10/4)=3\n            i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n            so t_min = 3.\n\n          Therefore, for t_j=1,2: output -1.\n\n          For t_j=3: \n            k_min = ceil(15/3)=5 -> but the example says for the second query (which is t_j=2? actually the queries are: 1,2,3,4,5,6) the answer for t_j=2 is -1? and for t_j=3: the example says that in the sixth query (t_j=6) we can open 3 pipes? \n\n          Actually, the example says: \n            \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4.\"\n\n          So for t_j=6: \n            k_min = ceil(15/6)= ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n          And the example says that for the sixth query (t_j=6) the answer is 3.\n\n          But what about t_j=3: \n            k_min = ceil(15/3)=5 -> so we output 5.\n\n          The example says: \n            \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\". \n            Query1: t_j=1 -> -1 (because 1 < t_min=3)\n            Query2: t_j=2 -> -1? but the example says the second query is answered by opening pipes 1,3,4? Actually, the example says: \"in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" -> meaning that the second query is t_j= something that is at least 4? \n\n          The input queries: \n            The first test case has 6 queries: \n                1\n                2\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n\n          The example says: \n            \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\" -> so the sixth query is t_j=6 -> answer=3.\n\n          And the fifth query: t_j=5 -> k_min = ceil(15/5)=3 -> so we output 3? but the example says: \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\" -> meaning 4 pipes? \n\n          Why 4? Because the minimal k is 3? \n\n          Actually, the minimal k for t_j=5 is 3. But the example says \"one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\" meaning that 4 pipes also work. But we are to output the minimal number.\n\n          Therefore, for t_j=5 we output 3.\n\n          However, the example output for the first test case is: \n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n\n          But wait: the example says the first, third, and fourth are -1? \n            t_j=1: -1\n            t_j=2: -1\n            t_j=3: -1? but t_min=3, so for t_j=3 we don't output -1? \n\n          The condition: we output -1 if t_j < t_min. For t_j=3: 3>=3 -> not -1.\n\n          Therefore, we must reexamine the minimal time condition.\n\n 9. The minimal time condition: \n        We computed t_min = max_i( ceil(S_i / i) )\n        Why? \n          For the first i locks, we have at most i pipes (because there are only i locks). Therefore, the time must be at least ceil(S_i / i). \n          Therefore, the minimal time to fill the entire system is at least max_i(ceil(S_i / i)).\n\n        For the example: \n            i=1: ceil(1/1)=1\n            i=2: ceil(3/2)=2\n            i=3: ceil(6/3)=2\n            i=4: ceil(10/4)=3\n            i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n            so t_min=3.\n\n        Therefore, for t_j=3, we can achieve the filling? \n\n        How? We need k_min = ceil(15/3)=5. But we have only 5 locks. So we open all 5 pipes? \n          Then in 3 seconds, we get 15 liters. \n          The first lock: 3 liters -> fills the first lock (1 liter) and overflows 2 to the second.\n          Second lock: gets 2 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 5, but the second lock only needs 2? -> then it overflows 3 to the third.\n          Third lock: gets 3 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 6, but the third lock only needs 3 -> overflows 3 to the fourth.\n          Fourth lock: gets 3 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 6, but the fourth lock needs 4 -> then it overflows 2 to the fifth.\n          Fifth lock: gets 2 from overflow and 3 from its own pipe -> total 5, which is exactly what it needs.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, for t_j=3, we output k_min=5.\n\n        But the example says that the third query (t_j=3) is -1? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\". \n          Query1: t_j=1 -> -1 (because 1<3)\n          Query2: t_j=2 -> -1 (because 2<3)\n          Query3: t_j=3 -> we output 5? \n          Query4: t_j=4 -> we output ceil(15/4)= ceil(3.75)=4? \n          Query5: t_j=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3\n          Query6: t_j=6 -> ceil(15/6)= ceil(2.5)=3\n\n        But the example says the answer for the fourth query is -1? \n\n        Why? \n\n        Let me read the example again: \n          \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5. The lock 3 is filled by its own pipe.\"\n\n        This implies that for t_j=4, we can do it with 3 pipes? \n\n        How? \n          We open pipes at locks 1, 3, 4.\n          At time 0: all empty.\n          After 1 second: \n              lock1: 1 liter -> not full (needs 1) -> so it becomes full and overflows 0? \n              Actually, lock1: 1 liter -> exactly full -> no overflow? \n              lock3: 1 liter -> not full (needs 3)\n              lock4: 1 liter -> not full (needs 4)\n          After 2 seconds:\n              lock1: already full, so the next liter from pipe1 overflows to lock2 -> lock2 gets 1 liter.\n              lock3: 2 liters -> still not full.\n              lock4: 2 liters.\n          After 3 seconds:\n              lock1: full -> overflow 1 to lock2 -> lock2 now has 1+1=2 (which is full, because it needs 2) -> then lock2 overflows 1 to lock3.\n              lock3: 3 liters (2 from its own and 1 from overflow) -> full -> then the next second? \n              Actually, at the end of 3 seconds: \n                 lock1: full, lock2: full, lock3: 3 liters (full), lock4: 3 liters (needs 4) -> not full.\n          After 4 seconds:\n              lock1: full -> overflow 1 to lock2 -> lock2 is full so it overflows 1 to lock3 -> lock3 is full so it overflows 1 to lock4 -> lock4 gets 1 from overflow and 1 from its own pipe -> total 3+1+1=5? \n\n          But wait: the pipe at lock4 is still producing: so lock4 gets 1 from its own pipe and 1 from overflow -> total 4? \n\n          Actually, at the start of the 4th second, we have:\n              lock1: produces 1 -> but it's full, so the 1 liter overflows to lock2.\n              lock2: is full, so the overflow (1 liter) goes to lock3.\n              lock3: is full, so the overflow (1 liter) goes to lock4.\n              lock4: gets 1 from overflow and 1 from its own pipe -> total 2 liters in the 4th second? Then lock4 has 3 (from previous) + 2 = 5, which is more than 4. \n\n          So lock4 is filled and overflows 1 to lock5. Then lock5 gets 1 liter? but it needs 5. \n\n          So after 4 seconds, lock5 is not full.\n\n        Therefore, we need to account for lock5. \n\n        The example says: \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full\" -> but lock4 is full? and then \"in the following 1 second\" -> meaning the fifth second? but the query is for 4 seconds.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"the lock 3 is filled by its own pipe\" -> but we see that lock3 was filled at the end of the 3rd second? \n\n        And then: \"In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5\". \n\n        This seems to imply that after 4 seconds, the system is not full? \n\n        But the example says that the sixth query (t_j=6) is 3 pipes. \n\n        How does it work for t_j=6? \n          We open pipes at locks 1,3,4.\n          After 6 seconds:\n            Total water = 3*6 = 18 liters.\n            The locks: \n              lock1: gets 6 liters -> but it only holds 1 -> so 1 liter stays and 5 overflow to lock2.\n              lock2: gets 5 (from lock1) -> but it holds 2 -> so 2 liters stay and 3 overflow to lock3.\n              lock3: gets 3 (from lock2) and 6 from its own pipe -> total 9 liters? but it only holds 3 -> so 3 liters stay and 6 overflow to lock4.\n              lock4: gets 6 (from lock3) and 6 from its own pipe -> total 12 liters? but it holds 4 -> so 4 liters stay and 8 overflow to lock5.\n              lock5: gets 8 liters -> but it holds 5 -> so 5 liters stay and 3 overflow to the river.\n\n          Total in the locks: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 -> filled.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        But why does the example say \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full\" and then \"in the following 1 second\" (meaning the 5th second) water is transferred to locks 2 and 5? \n\n        Actually, the example might be describing the process for the sixth query (t_j=6) at time 4 seconds? \n\n        However, the example says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\" \n\n        But at 4 seconds, lock4 is not full: \n          lock1: 4 seconds * 1 = 4 -> fills lock1 and overflows 3 to lock2.\n          lock2: gets 3 -> fills lock2 (which holds 2) and overflows 1 to lock3.\n          lock3: 4 seconds * 1 = 4 -> plus 1 from overflow -> total 5, but lock3 holds 3 -> so it overflows 2 to lock4.\n          lock4: 4 seconds * 1 = 4 -> plus 2 from overflow -> total 6, which is more than 4 -> so lock4 is full and overflows 2 to lock5.\n\n          Then lock5: 2 liters.\n\n          So after 4 seconds, lock1, lock2, lock3, lock4 are full? \n\n        The example says \"locks 1 and 4\" -> but lock2 and lock3 are also full? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        But regardless, the minimal k for t_j=4 is ceil(15/4)= ceil(3.75)=4. \n\n        How can we do it with 4 pipes? \n          We open 4 pipes: say at locks 1,2,3,4.\n          After 4 seconds:\n            Total water = 16 liters.\n            lock1: 4 -> full, overflows 3 to lock2.\n            lock2: 4 (from its own) + 3 (overflow) = 7 -> full (holds 2) -> overflows 5 to lock3.\n            lock3: 4 (from its own) + 5 = 9 -> full (holds 3) -> overflows 6 to lock4.\n            lock4: 4 (from its own) + 6 = 10 -> full (holds 4) -> overflows 6 to lock5.\n            lock5: 6 -> which is more than 5 -> full.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        Therefore, for t_j=4, we output 4.\n\n        But the example says the fourth query (t_j=4) is -1? \n\n        This contradicts.\n\n        After re-reading the problem note: \n          \"In the queries 1, 3, 4 the answer is -1\"\n\n        But we have:\n          Query1: t_j=1 -> -1 (because 1<3) -> correct.\n          Query2: t_j=2 -> -1 (because 2<3) -> correct.\n          Query3: t_j=3 -> output 5 -> not -1.\n          Query4: t_j=4 -> output 4 -> not -1.\n\n        However, the example says the answer for the third and fourth queries are -1? \n\n        There might be a misunderstanding in the example. \n\n        Let me check the official example: \n          Input: \n            1\n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            6\n            1\n            2\n            3\n            4\n            5\n            6\n\n          Expected output: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        How can that be? \n\n        The minimal time t_min = 3, so for t_j=3 and t_j=4 we should not output -1.\n\n        But the example output says the first four are -1.\n\n        This implies that the minimal time t_min is 4? \n\n        How? \n\n        Let me recalc t_min: \n          We defined t_min = max_i(ceil(S_i / i))\n\n          i=1: ceil(1/1)=1\n          i=2: ceil((1+2)/2)=ceil(3/2)=2\n          i=3: ceil((1+2+3)/3)=ceil(6/3)=2\n          i=4: ceil((1+2+3+4)/4)=ceil(10/4)=3\n          i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n\n          So t_min=3.\n\n        But wait: the problem says: \n          \"the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after t_j seconds\"\n\n        And we are computing t_min as the minimal time required (if we open all pipes) is 3? \n\n        However, note: we cannot open more than one pipe per lock? Actually, we can open any subset of the pipes. But we are not forced to open all. \n\n        The minimal time required to fill the system is the minimal t such that there exists a set of pipes (any subset) that can fill the system in time t. \n\n        We argued that t must be at least max_i(ceil(S_i/i)). But is that sufficient? \n\n        How to achieve t_min = 3? \n          We open all 5 pipes -> as above, it works.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal time is 3.\n\n        But the example output says that for t_j=3 the answer is -1? \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n          \"The mayor of Divanovo is interested in q independent queries. For each query, suppose that initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. For the j-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after t_j seconds.\"\n\n        And the example says: \n          \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n        So for t_j=6, we open 3 pipes.\n\n        For t_j=3, we must open 5 pipes.\n\n        But the example output for t_j=3 is -1? \n\n        I see the problem: the example output provided in the problem says: \n          \"For the first test case the pairs ...\" and then \"In the sixth query ...\", but the expected output for the first test case is: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This implies that the first four queries (t_j=1,2,3,4) are -1? \n\n        Why t_j=4 is -1? \n\n        We showed that with 4 pipes we can fill the system in 4 seconds. \n\n        The only possibility is that the minimal time t_min is not 3 but 4? \n\n        How could that be? \n\n        Let me recast the constraint: \n          We require that for every lock i, the time must be at least the volume of that lock? -> no, because water can come from multiple pipes and overflow.\n\n        But note: the first lock: the water that fills it must come from the pipes at lock1 or before? but there is no before. And the pipe at lock1 is the only one that can fill it. However, we can also get water from pipes at lock1? and we can have only one pipe at lock1. But we can open the pipe at lock1 and also get overflow from nowhere? \n\n        Actually, the first lock can only be filled by the pipe at lock1. Why? Because there is no lock before it. Therefore, the time must be at least the volume of the first lock. \n\n        But wait: the first lock has volume 1 -> so time>=1.\n\n        Similarly, the second lock: it can be filled by the pipe at lock2 and/or by overflow from lock1. \n\n        However, the overflow from lock1 is limited by the production of the pipe at lock1. In time t, the pipe at lock1 produces t liters. The first lock takes 1 liter, so the overflow to lock2 is t-1. The pipe at lock2 produces t liters. So the total water for lock2 is (t-1) + t = 2t-1. We require 2t-1 >= 2 -> 2t>=3 -> t>= ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n        Similarly, the third lock: \n          Water from lock1: t-1 (overflow from lock1) -> but after lock2, the overflow from lock2: (2t-1) - 2 = 2t-3? \n          Plus the pipe at lock3: t.\n          So total for lock3: (2t-3) + t = 3t-3.\n          We require 3t-3>=3 -> 3t>=6 -> t>=2.\n\n        The fourth lock: \n          Water from lock3: (3t-3) - 3 = 3t-6? \n          Plus pipe at lock4: t.\n          Total: 4t-6 >=4 -> 4t>=10 -> t>= ceil(10/4)=3.\n\n        The fifth lock: \n          Water from lock4: (4t-6) - 4 = 4t-10? \n          Plus pipe at lock5: t.\n          Total: 5t-10>=5 -> 5t>=15 -> t>=3.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal time is max(1, ceil(3/2)=2, 2, 3, 3) = 3.\n\n        So why is the example output for t_j=3: -1? \n\n        I see: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", but in the example there is only one test case with n=5.\n\n        And the example output is: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This suggests that the minimal time is 4? \n\n        Let me double-check the example with t_j=3 and 5 pipes: \n          We open all 5 pipes.\n          After 3 seconds:\n            lock1: 3 liters -> full, overflows 2 to lock2.\n            lock2: 3 (from its own) + 2 = 5 -> full, overflows 3 to lock3.\n            lock3: 3 (from its own) + 3 = 6 -> full, overflows 3 to lock4.\n            lock4: 3 (from its own) + 3 = 6 -> full, overflows 2 to lock5? (because lock4 holds 4, so 6-4=2)\n            lock5: 3 (from its own) + 2 = 5 -> full.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the example output provided in the problem statement for the first test case is: \n            -1\n            -1\n            5\n            4\n            3\n            3\n\n        But the problem says: \"In the queries 1, 3, 4 the answer is -1\" -> which would be the first, third, and fourth queries. \n\n        This matches if the first test case has queries: \n            t_j=1 -> -1\n            t_j=2 -> -1\n            t_j=3 -> 5\n            t_j=4 -> 4\n            t_j=5 -> 3\n            t_j=6 -> 3\n\n        But the example output in the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and the sixth query ...\"\n\n        and then the example output is: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This is a discrepancy.\n\n        I suspect there is a mistake in the example output in the problem statement. \n\n        However, the problem also says: \n          \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n        and \n\n          \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\"\n\n        This suggests that the fifth query (t_j=5) is answered with 3 pipes? and the sixth query (t_j=6) is answered with 3 pipes? \n\n        But then what about t_j=3 and t_j=4? \n\n        Given the constraints, we must trust our reasoning.\n\n        Therefore, we will implement:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, then list of n volumes.\n          Step 2: Compute the prefix sums: \n                S[0] = 0\n                S[i] = v0 + v1 + ... + v_{i-1}   for i from 1 to n\n          Step 3: Compute t_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / i)   [where S_i = S[i] (the prefix sum ending at i-1? note: the first lock is index0)]\n\n          But note: our prefix sum for the first i locks (i locks) is S_i = v0 + ... + v_{i-1}. And we have i pipes available for the first i locks? -> then the minimal time is at least ceil(S_i / i).\n\n          Step 4: For each query t_j:\n                if t_j < t_min: \n                    ans = -1\n                else:\n                    ans = ceil(S_total / t_j)   ??? \n\n          But we argued that the minimal k is max_i ceil(S_i / t_j), and since the sequence ceil(S_i/t_j) is non-decreasing, the maximum is at i=n: ceil(S_total / t_j). \n\n          However, we also saw that in the example [3,1] (n=2) with t_j=2: \n                S_1 = 3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n                S_2 = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n                so k_min=2.\n\n          And in the example [3,1,1] (n=3) with t_j=2: \n                S_1=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n                S_2=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2\n                S_3=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3\n                so k_min=3.\n\n          Therefore, we must compute k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j) only if there is no prefix i for which ceil(S_i/t_j) is greater than ceil(S_total/t_j)? \n\n          But we proved that the sequence is non-decreasing, so the maximum is at i=n. Therefore, k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j).\n\n          However, wait: in the example [3,1] with t_j=2: \n                ceil(S_2/2)=ceil(4/2)=2, which is the same as ceil(S_total/t_j).\n\n          In the example [3,1,1] with t_j=2: \n                ceil(S_3/2)=ceil(5/2)=3, which is ceil(S_total/t_j).\n\n          Therefore, we can compute for each query:\n                if t_j < t_min: \n                    ans = -1\n                else:\n                    ans = (S_total + t_j - 1) // t_j   [this is ceil(S_total/t_j) for integers]\n\n          But note: S_total might be large, and t_j up to 1e9, so this is safe.\n\n        However, consider the example [1, 1000000000] with n=2, and t_j=1:\n                t_min = max( ceil(1/1)=1, ceil(1000000001/2)=500000001 ) -> t_min=500000001.\n                For t_j=1: 1 < 500000001 -> -1, which is correct.\n\n        For t_j=500000001: \n                ans = ceil(1000000001 / 500000001) = ceil(2.000000000...) = 2? \n                But 500000001 * 2 = 1000000002, which is >=1000000001 -> so ceil(1000000001/500000001)=2.\n\n          However, is 2 the minimal k? \n                Condition for the first lock: ceil(1/500000001)=1 -> we need at least 1 pipe in the first lock.\n                Condition for the entire system: ceil(1000000001/500000001)=2.\n                So we need 2 pipes.\n\n          How? \n                We put one pipe in the first lock and one in the second.\n                After 500000001 seconds:\n                    first lock: 500000001 liters -> fills the first lock (1 liter) and overflows 500000000 to the second.\n                    second lock: 500000001 (from its own) + 500000000 = 1000000001 -> which is exactly the volume.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is:\n          Precomputation:\n            n = int(input())\n            v = list of n integers\n            S_total = sum(v)\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + v[i-1]\n            t_min = 0\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                # t_min = max(t_min, ceil(prefix[i] / i))\n                # ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b\n                # But note: if prefix[i] is 0 then ceil(0/i)=0, but we have at least one lock so prefix[1]>=1.\n                t_min = max(t_min, (prefix[i] + i - 1) // i)\n\n          Then for each query t_j:\n                if t_j < t_min:\n                    ans = -1\n                else:\n                    ans = (S_total + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n        However, note: the condition for the first i locks: we require that the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(prefix[i] / t_j). But we are not checking that. We are only setting the total pipes to ceil(S_total/t_j). \n\n        But we argued that the maximum over i of ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) is ceil(prefix[n]/t_j) = ceil(S_total/t_j). \n\n        Therefore, it is safe.\n\n        But wait: what if there is an i such that ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > ceil(S_total/t_j)? \n          Since prefix[i] <= S_total, then ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) <= ceil(S_total/t_j) only if the sequence is non-decreasing? \n          But note: ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) is non-decreasing in prefix[i], and prefix[i] is increasing, so the maximum is at i=n.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for a query is:\n            if t_j < t_min: -1\n            else: ceil(S_total/t_j)\n\n        However, let me test with the example from the problem: \n            n=5, v=[1,2,3,4,5], S_total=15, t_min=3 (as computed).\n\n            Query: t_j=3 -> ans = ceil(15/3)=5.\n            Query: t_j=4 -> ans = ceil(15/4)= ceil(3.75)=4.\n            Query: t_j=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3.\n            Query: t_j=6 -> ceil(15/6)= ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n        This matches our calculation.\n\n        But the example output in the problem says for the first test case: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This implies that the first test case has queries: \n            1,2,3,4,5,6 -> and the answers for t_j=3 and t_j=4 are -1? \n\n        Why would they be -1? \n\n        The only possibility is that the minimal time t_min is not 3 but 4? \n\n        How could that be? \n\n        Let me recast the minimal time: \n          We defined t_min = max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i))\n\n          But note: the constraint for the first i locks is: we can have at most i pipes, so the time must be at least ceil(prefix[i]/i). \n\n          However, is that sufficient? \n\n          We showed that with i pipes for the first i locks, we can achieve it in time ceil(prefix[i]/i). \n\n          But for the entire system, we need to fill all locks. We can use more than i pipes? \n\n          Actually, for the entire system, we can use up to n pipes. \n\n          Therefore, the minimal time for the entire system is the minimal t such that there exists a set of pipes (with size k) that satisfies for every i: the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(prefix[i]/t). \n\n          And the minimal t is the minimal value that is at least as large as max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i))? \n\n          Actually, no: the minimal t might be larger than that. \n\n          Consider: \n            We have a constraint for each i: there must be an integer k_i (number of pipes in the first i locks) such that k_i * t >= prefix[i] and k_i <= k (the total pipes) and k_i is at most i (because there are only i locks in the first i).\n\n          And we are free to choose the k_i and k. \n\n          The minimal t is the smallest t such that there exists a k and a sequence k_1<=k_2<=...<=k_n=k (non-decreasing) with k_i<=i and k_i*t>=prefix[i] for every i.\n\n          This is a more complex minimization. \n\n        Given the complexity and the constraints (n,q up to 200000), we need an efficient solution.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we can do O(n) per test case? but q can be up to 200000 per test case? \n\n        Actually, the input says: \n            The first line of the input contains a single integer t (number of test cases). \n            Then for each test case: \n                n\n                list of n volumes\n                q\n                q lines of queries\n\n        And the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, but the sum of q over test cases is not bounded by 10^5? It says q for each test case is up to 200000, and the number of test cases is at most 100, so total q up to 20000000? \n\n        We need an O(1) per query.\n\n        Given the complexity, I suspect the intended solution is:\n\n          We know that the minimal time T_min (the minimal t for which there exists a valid configuration) is at least L = max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i)) and at most ...? \n\n          And then for a query t_j:\n            if t_j < T_min: -1\n            else: k_min = ceil(S_total / t_j)   [which might be not enough?] \n\n        But we have a counterexample for the [3,1] example with t_j=2: \n            T_min = max( ceil(3/1)=3, ceil(4/2)=2 ) = 3? \n            Then for t_j=2: 2<3 -> -1, but we showed that with t_j=2 and k=2 it is possible.\n\n        How did we achieve it? \n            We put both pipes in the first lock. \n            Then the first lock gets 2*2=4 liters: \n                lock1: uses 3, overflows 1 to lock2 -> lock2 gets 1, which is exactly what it needs.\n\n            So it works in time 2.\n\n        Therefore, T_min for [3,1] is 2, not 3.\n\n        How to compute T_min? \n\n        We need the minimal t such that there exists a non-decreasing sequence k_1<=k_2<=...<=k_n (with k_i<=i) and k_i>=ceil(prefix[i]/t) for every i.\n\n        And then the minimal number of pipes k is k_n.\n\n        But note: we are not asked for T_min, we are asked for the minimal k for a given t_j.\n\n        For a fixed t_j, we want the minimal k such that there exists a sequence k_1<=k_2<=...<=k_n = k with:\n            k_i >= ceil(prefix[i] / t_j) and k_i <= i.\n\n        And the minimal k is the minimal value such that there exists a non-decreasing sequence satisfying the above.\n\n        How to compute that quickly? \n          We can try: \n            k must be at least ceil(prefix[n]/t_j) (for i=n).\n            and for i from n-1 downto 1: \n                k_i = min(i, k_{i+1])   [because the sequence is non-decreasing and cannot exceed i] \n                but also k_i >= ceil(prefix[i]/t_j)\n\n          Then the minimal k is the last k_n.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to choose the pipes arbitrarily, so we can set:\n            k_n = k\n            k_{n-1} = min(k, n-1, ...) \n\n        Actually, we can do a greedy from left to right? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n            k_i = max( ceil(prefix[i]/t_j), k_{i-1])   and also k_i <= i.\n            but note: the sequence must be non-decreasing, and we can also set k_i as small as possible.\n\n        Actually, we want the minimal final k. \n\n        We can do a binary search on k? But then for each k we have to check the entire sequence, which is O(n) per k, and then per query, and q can be 200000 -> too slow.\n\n        Given the complexity, I suspect the intended solution is different.\n\n        Insight: \n          The condition for the entire system: k * t_j >= S_total -> k>=ceil(S_total/t_j).\n          Additionally, for each i, we require that the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(prefix[i]/t_j). \n          But note: the number of pipes in the first i locks cannot exceed i. \n          Therefore, if ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > i, then it is impossible. \n\n        But wait: if ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > i, then even if we put i pipes in the first i locks, we get i*t_j < prefix[i]? -> then it's impossible. \n\n        Therefore, for a given t_j, if there exists an i such that ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > i, then we output -1? \n\n        However, note: we already have a minimal time condition t_min = max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i)). \n          But ceil(prefix[i]/i) > i is not directly related. \n\n        Let me see: \n          ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) > i  <=> prefix[i] > i * t_j.\n\n        And if that happens, then even if we put i pipes in the first i locks, we get only i*t_j < prefix[i] -> cannot fill the first i locks.\n\n        Therefore, for a given t_j, if there exists an i such that prefix[i] > i * t_j, then it's impossible -> output -1.\n\n        Otherwise, the minimal k is ceil(S_total/t_j)? \n\n        But is that true? \n\n        Consider [3,1] with t_j=2:\n            i=1: prefix[1]=3, i*t_j=2 -> 3>2 -> then we output -1? \n            but we know it's possible.\n\n        What went wrong? \n            ceil(prefix[1]/t_j) = ceil(3/2)=2, and 2<=1? -> no, 2>1? -> then we require the number of pipes in the first 1 lock to be at least 2, but there is only 1 lock -> so we can have at most 1 pipe in the first 1 lock. \n            Therefore, it's impossible? \n\n        But we put two pipes in the first lock -> that is allowed. The first lock is the first lock, so the number of pipes in the first 1 lock is 2. \n\n        However, the condition \"k_i <= i\" -> for i=1, k_1<=1. But we have 2>1 -> violates.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot put two pipes in the first lock because there is only one lock in the first one? \n\n        This is the catch: the first i locks have exactly i locks, and we can put at most one pipe per lock. Therefore, the number of pipes in the first i locks cannot exceed i.\n\n        In the example [3,1] with i=1: we can have at most 1 pipe in the first lock. \n        Then the water for the first lock: 1 pipe * 2 seconds = 2 < 3 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, it is impossible for t_j=2? \n\n        But wait, we did an experiment and it worked by putting two pipes in the first lock. How? \n\n        The problem says: \"each lock has a pipe attached to it\". And we can open any subset of the pipes. \n\n        But note: there is only one pipe at the first lock. We cannot open two pipes at the first lock because there is only one. \n\n        Therefore, the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most i (one per lock). \n\n        So in the example [3,1]: \n            We have two locks. We can open the pipe at lock1 and the pipe at lock2. \n            For the first lock (i=1): the number of pipes in the first 1 lock is 1 (only the pipe at lock1). \n            Then the water for the first lock: 2 seconds * 1 = 2 < 3 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, it is impossible to fill the system in 2 seconds. \n\n        Mayor must wait at least 3 seconds for the first lock: \n            In 3 seconds, the first lock gets 3 from its pipe -> filled, and then the second lock gets 3 from its own pipe -> filled.\n\n        So the example [3,1] with t_j=2 is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the example output for the first test case in the problem might be correct after all.\n\n        Let me double-check the first test case: \n            locks = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n            For i=1: \n                prefix[1]=1, i=1 -> ceil(1/t_j) must be <= 1 -> so we require 1/t_j <= 1 -> t_j>=1.\n            For i=2:\n                prefix[2]=3, ceil(3/t_j) must be <=2 -> 3/t_j <=2 -> t_j>= ceil(3/2)=2? -> but wait: ceil(3/t_j) is the minimal number of pipes in the first 2 locks. We can have at most 2. So we require ceil(3/t_j) <=2 -> which means 3/t_j <=2 -> t_j>= ceil(3/2)=2? -> no: ceil(3/t_j)<=2 means that 3/t_j <=2, because if 3/t_j>2 then ceil(3/t_j)>=3>2. So we require 3/t_j<=2 -> t_j>=3/2, i.e., t_j>=2 since time is integer.\n            For i=3:\n                prefix[3]=6, ceil(6/t_j)<=3 -> 6/t_j<=3 -> t_j>=2.\n            For i=4:\n                prefix[4]=10, ceil(10/t_j)<=4 -> 10/t_j<=4 -> t_j>= ceil(10/4)=3? -> 10/t_j<=4 -> t_j>=10/4=2.5 -> so t_j>=3.\n            For i=5:\n                prefix[5]=15, ceil(15/t_j)<=5 -> 15/t_j<=5 -> t_j>=3.\n\n            Additionally, we require that ceil(prefix[i]/t_j) is at most i, but also the time must be at least ceil(prefix[i]/i) for the minimal time condition? \n\n            But the minimal time condition is not needed if we do the per i condition.\n\n        Therefore, for a given t_j, we can fill the system if and only if for every i from 1 to n: \n                ceil(prefix[i] / t_j) <= i\n            and then the minimal number of pipes is ceil(S_total/t_j).\n\n        But note: the condition ceil(prefix[i]/t_j)<=i is equivalent to prefix[i] <= i * t_j.\n\n        Why? \n            ceil(a/b) <= c   <=>   a/b <= c   [because if a/b is not an integer, ceil(a/b) is the next integer, and if a/b is an integer then ceil(a/b)=a/b]\n            is not true: ceil(3/2)=2<=2 is true, and 3/2=1.5<=2 is true.\n            ceil(3/1)=3<=3 -> 3/1<=3 -> true.\n            ceil(3/2)=2<=1 -> false, and 3/2=1.5<=1 -> false.\n\n        Actually, ceil(a/b) <= c   if and only if   a <= b * c.\n            Proof: \n                ceil(a/b) = floor((a-1)/b) + 1.\n                ceil(a/b) <= c  => floor((a-1)/b) + 1 <= c  => floor((a-1)/b) <= c-1  => (a-1)/b < c  => a-1 < b*c  => a <= b*c   (since a,b,c integers) \n                But wait: ceil(3/2)=2<=2: 3<=2*2=4 -> true.\n                ceil(3/2)=2<=1: 3<=2*1=2 -> false.\n\n            However, the converse: if a<=b*c, then ceil(a/b) <= c?\n                a<=b*c  => a/b <= c  => ceil(a/b) <= ceil(c) = c?  -> not necessarily: ceil(a/b) might be greater than c if a/b is not an integer and c is integer? \n                Example: a=3, b=2, c=1.5: ceil(3/2)=2>1.5 -> fails.\n\n            But c is an integer (because it's the number of pipes in the first i locks, and i is integer). \n\n            So if a<=b*c and c is integer, then a/b<=c, so ceil(a/b) is the smallest integer >= a/b, and since a/b<=c, then ceil(a/b)<=c? \n                Not exactly: if a/b = 3.5 and c=4, then ceil(3.5)=4<=4 -> true.\n                if a/b=3.5 and c=3, then a=7, b=2, c=3: 7<=2*3=6 -> false.\n\n            Therefore, the condition a<=b*c is equivalent to ceil(a/b)<=c when c is integer.\n\n        So the condition for each i: prefix[i] <= i * t_j.\n\n        Therefore, for a given t_j, if there exists an i such that prefix[i] > i * t_j, then it's impossible -> output -1.\n        Otherwise, the minimal number of pipes is ceil(S_total / t_j).\n\n        Let me test with the example [3,1] (n=2) and t_j=2:\n            i=1: prefix[1]=3, i*t_j=2 -> 3>2 -> impossible -> output -1.  -> matches the example output for the first test case.\n\n        Test with [3,1] and t_j=3:\n            i=1: 3<=1*3=3 -> holds.\n            i=2: 4<=2*3=6 -> holds.\n            then k = ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n        Test with the first test case of the problem: \n            volumes = [1,2,3,4,5], prefix=[1,3,6,10,15]\n            Query: t_j=3: \n                i=1: 1<=1*3=3 -> holds.\n                i=2: 3<=2*3=6 -> holds.\n                i=3: 6<=3*3=9 -> holds.\n                i=4: 10<=4*3=12 -> holds.\n                i=5: 15<=5*3=15 -> holds.\n                then k = ceil(15/3)=5.\n\n            Query: t_j=4:\n                i=1: 1<=4 -> holds.\n                i=2: 3<=8 -> holds.\n                i=3: 6<=12 -> holds.\n                i=4: 10<=16 -> holds.\n                i=5: 15<=20 -> holds.\n                then k = ceil(15/4)=4.\n\n            Query: t_j=5:\n                i=1: 1<=5 -> holds.\n                i=2: 3<=10 -> holds.\n                i=3: 6<=15 -> holds.\n                i=4: 10<=20 -> holds.\n                i=5: 15<=25 -> holds.\n                then k = ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n            Query: t_j=6:\n                similarly, holds, k=ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n            Query: t_j=2:\n                i=1: 1<=2 -> holds.\n                i=2: 3<=4 -> holds? 3<=4 -> holds.\n                i=3: 6<=6 -> holds.\n                i=4: 10<=8 -> fails.\n\n            Therefore, for t_j=2: -1.\n\n            Query: t_j=1:\n                i=1: 1<=1 -> holds.\n                i=2: 3<=2 -> fails.\n\n            So the answers for the first test case with queries [1,2,3,4,5,6] are:\n                t_j=1: -1\n                t_j=2: -1\n                t_j=3: 5\n                t_j=4: 4\n                t_j=5: 3\n                t_j=6: 3\n\n        But the example output in the problem says for the first test case:\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n\n        This matches if the queries are not 1,2,3,4,5,6 but something else?

We can precompute the maximum over i of (prefix[i] - i * t_j) and see if it is >0? \n                However, t_j is given per query.\n\n          Alternatively, note that the function f(i) = prefix[i] - i * t_j is linear in t_j? \n\n          We can rearrange: \n                prefix[i] > i * t_j   <=>   t_j < prefix[i] / i.\n\n          Therefore, for a fixed i, the condition fails for t_j < prefix[i]/i.\n\n          So for a given t_j, we require that for every i, t_j >= prefix[i]/i.\n\n          That is, t_j >= max_i (prefix[i] / i).\n\n          But note: prefix[i]/i might not be integer. We want the smallest integer t_j such that t_j>= prefix[i]/i for every i.\n\n          And that smallest integer is ceil( max_i(prefix[i]/i) ).\n\n          Let M = max_i (prefix[i] / i)   [as a float point, but we can use integer: we want ceil(M)].\n\n          Then for a query t_j:\n                if t_j < ceil(M): \n                    then there exists an i such that t_j < ceil(M) <= M <= prefix[i]/i  [if M is not integer, then ceil(M) is the next integer] -> then prefix[i] > i * t_j? \n                    Actually, if t_j < ceil(M), then t_j < M (because ceil(M) is the smallest integer>=M, and if t_j is integer and less than ceil(M), then t_j <= floor(M) and floor(M) might be < M) -> not necessarily.\n\n          Example: M = 2.5, ceil(M)=3. If t_j=2, then 2<3, but 2<2.5 -> then prefix[i] > 2*i.\n\n          Therefore, the condition fails if t_j < M_i for some i, where M_i = prefix[i]/i.\n\n          But note: the condition fails if there exists i such that t_j < prefix[i]/i.\n\n          And the maximum of prefix[i]/i is M = max_i (prefix[i]/i). \n          Then if t_j < M, then there exists i such that t_j < prefix[i]/i.\n\n          But if t_j >= M, then for every i, t_j >= prefix[i]/i.\n\n          Therefore, we can precompute for the test case:\n                M = 0\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    # M = max(M, prefix[i]/i)\n                    # but we want to avoid float? \n\n                However, we need to compare t_j with M.

\n                We want t0 = ceil( max_i (prefix[i]/i) )\n\n                But note: we already computed in the minimal time condition: \n                    t_min = max_i( ceil(prefix[i] / i) )   [which is the minimal time required if we are to use at most i pipes for the first i locks]\n\n                And we have: \n                    ceil(prefix[i]/i) = (prefix[i] + i - 1) // i\n\n                And we defined:\n                    t_min = max_i ( (prefix[i] + i - 1) // i )\n\n                Now, note: \n                    Let M = max_i (prefix[i]/i)\n                    Then ceil(M) = ceil( max_i (prefix[i]/i) ) = max_i ( ceil(prefix[i]/i) )? \n\n                Is that true? \n                    Because the ceiling of the maximum is the maximum of the ceilings? \n                    Not necessarily: \n                        Consider i1: prefix[i1]/i1 = 2.5, ceil=3.\n                        i2: prefix[i2]/i2 = 2.7, ceil=3.\n                        then max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i)) = 3, and ceil(max_i(prefix[i]/i)) = ceil(2.7)=3.\n\n                    But if i1: 2.5, i2: 2.1, then max_i(ceil(prefix[i]/i)) = ceil(2.5)=3, and ceil(max_i(prefix[i]/i))=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n                    In fact, \n                        ceil(max_i (a_i)) = max_i(ceil(a_i))   is not true: \n                            a1=1.5, a2=1.0: \n                                ceil(max(1.5,1.0))=ceil(1.5)=2\n                                max(ceil(1.5),ceil(1.0))=max(2,1)=2.\n                            a1=1.5, a2=2.5: \n                                ceil(max(1.5,2.5))=ceil(2.5)=3\n                                max(ceil(1.5),ceil(2.5))=max(2,3)=3.\n\n                    But is it always true that ceil(max_i a_i) = max_i ceil(a_i)? \n                        Let M = max_i a_i.\n                        ceil(M) is the smallest integer >= M.\n                        Let c = max_i ceil(a_i). \n                        Since ceil is non-decreasing, ceil(M) = ceil(max_i a_i) >= ceil(a_i) for every i, so ceil(M)>=c.\n                        Also, there is an i0 such that a_i0 = M, then ceil(a_i0)=ceil(M)>=c, and also c>=ceil(a_i0)=ceil(M). \n                        So c = ceil(M).\n\n                    Therefore, t0 = ceil( max_i (prefix[i]/i) ) = max_i ( ceil(prefix[i]/i) ) = t_min.\n\n          So we already have t_min = max_i( (prefix[i]+i-1)//i ) computed.\n\n          Therefore, for a query t_j:\n                if t_j < t_min: \n                    ans = -1\n                else:\n                    ans = (total + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n        Let me test with the example [3,1] (n=2):\n            prefix[1]=3, prefix[2]=4.\n            t_min = max( ceil(3/1)=3, ceil(4/2)=2 ) = 3.\n            Query t_j=3: \n                ans = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2.\n            Query t_j=4: \n                ans = (4+4-1)//4 = 7//4 = 1 (if using integer floor division) -> but we want ceil(4/4)=1? \n                But (4+4-1)//4 = 7//4 = 1 in floor division, but we want ceil(4/4)=1 -> works.\n\n            But wait: ceil(4/4)=1, and (4+4-1)//4 = 7//4 = 1 (since 7//4=1 in Python? no, 7//4=1 in floor division? 7//4=1 in integer floor division? 7//4=1.75 -> floor is 1, but we want ceil(4/4)=1.\n\n            How to compute ceil(a/b) for integers: (a+b-1)//b.\n\n            Here, a=4, b=4: (4+4-1)//4 = 7//4 = 1 (since 7//4=1 in integer division? no: 7//4=1 in Python? \n                In Python: 7//4 = 1 (because 7 divided by 4 is 1.75, floor is 1) -> but we want ceil(4/4)=1, so it works.\n\n            But ceil(4/5)= ceil(0.8)=1: (4+5-1)//5 = 8//5=1.\n\n            So the formula is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code for one test case:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total = sum(v)\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + v[i-1]\n\n            t_min = 0\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                # ceil(prefix[i] / i) = (prefix[i] + i - 1) // i\n                t_min = max(t_min, (prefix[i] + i - 1) // i)\n\n            q = int(input().strip())\n            res = []\n            for _ in range(q):\n                t_j = int(input().strip())\n                if t_j < t_min:\n                    res.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # ans = ceil(total / t_j) = (total + t_j - 1) // t_j\n                    ans = (total + t_j - 1) // t_j\n                    res.append(str(ans))\n\n            print(\"\\n\".join(res))\n\n        But note: the condition we derived was: \n            if t_j < t_min then -1, else ceil(total/t_j)\n\n        And we have the example [3,1] with t_j=3: \n            t_min=3, so not -1, and ceil(4/3)= (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2.\n\n        And we can achieve it with 2 pipes: \n"
