Since we are free to choose the pipes (and we want the minimum total pipes), we note that the entire system must satisfy for every i: x_i >= ceil(S_i / T). But note: the number of pipes in the first i locks cannot exceed the total number of pipes we use (say k). Therefore, we must have k >= ceil(S_i / T) for every i. Therefore, the minimum k must be at least max_i( ceil(S_i / T) ). But wait: the example: \n   n=5, volumes = [4,1,5,1,6]\n   Then S_1 = 4 -> ceil(4/1)=4 -> so k>=4? \n        S_2 = 5 -> ceil(5/2)=3 -> k>=3\n        S_3 = 10 -> ceil(10/3)=4\n        S_4 = 11 -> ceil(11/4)=3\n        S_5 = 17 -> ceil(17/5)=4\n\n   Then k_min = max(4,3,4,3,4) = 4. But the example says: in the sixth query (t_j=5) we can open 3 pipes (at locks 1,3,4). So what is the catch? The above reasoning is not exactly correct because the water from a pipe in the first i locks is not necessarily all going to the first i locks: if the pipe is at a lock j (<=i), then the water from that pipe will first fill the locks from j to i?",

So after 5 seconds: lock5=6 -> full. Therefore, it works. So what is the minimal number of pipes for T=5? We did it with 3. But our condition: \n   For i=1: ceil(4/5)=1 -> k>=1\n   i=2: ceil((4 +1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1\n   i=3: ceil(10/5)=2\n   i=4: ceil(11/5)=ceil(2.2)=3\n   i=5: ceil(17/5)=ceil(3.4)=4\n\nSo the condition says k>=4? But we did with 3. The flaw: the condition I described earlier is necessary: k must be at least ceil(S_i / T) for every i. But for i=5, ceil(17/5)=4, so we must have k>=4? But we did with 3. What's the resolution?",

However, the known solution for this problem is to use the condition: \n        k = ceil(total_volume / T)\n        and then check that for every i, ceil(prefix_i / T) < = the number of pipes in the first i locks. But the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most k, so we require ceil(prefix_i / T) < = k for every i.\n\n   For the example: \n        total_volume = 17, T=5 -> k>= ceil(17/5)=4.\n        ceil(4/5)=1<=4, ceil(5/5)=1<=4, ceil(10/5)=2<=4, ceil(11/5)=3<=4, ceil(17/5)=4<=4. so k=4. Therefore, the answer for t=5 is 4. Mayor's queries for the example: \n        q=6, queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6. t_min = max( ceil(4/1), ceil(5/2), ceil(10/3), ceil(11/4), ceil(17/5) ) = max(4, 3, 4, 3, 4) = 4. So for t_j=1,2,3,4: then t_j<4? 1<4 -> -1\n            2<4 -> -2? 3<4 -> -1\n            4>=4 -> then k = ceil(17/4)=5? -> but wait, the condition is that k must be at least the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/t_j). For t_j=4: \n            i=1: ceil(4/4)=1\n            i=2: ceil(5/4)=2\n            i=3: ceil(10/4)=3\n            i=4: ceil(11/4)=3\n            i=5: ceil(17/4)=5\n            so k=5. For t_j=5: \n            i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:3, i=5:4 -> so k=4. For t_j=6: \n            i=1: ceil(4/6)=1, i=2: ceil(5/6)=1, i=3: ceil(10/6)=2, i=4: ceil(11/6)=2, i=5: ceil(17/6)=3 -> so k=3. Therefore, the answers for the example should be:\n        t=1: -1\n        t=2: -1\n        t=3: -1\n        t=4: 5\n        t=5: 4\n        t=6: 3\n\n   But the example note says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\"\n        then the second query (t=2) is -1, the fifth (t=5) is 3 (according to the example note) -> but we got 4. However, the example note says: \"In the sixth query\" (which is t=6) we can open 3 pipes. So the example note might have mixed up the query indexing.",

We cannot for each query iterate over i from 1 to n (which would be 200,000 * 200,000 = 40e9). We must do better. Observe that the function f(i) = s[i] is the prefix sum, and we are computing ceil(s[i] / t_j) = (s[i] + t_j - 1) // t_j. And we want M = max_{i=1..n} ( (s[i] + t_j - 1) // t_j ).

If x1 <= x2, then ceil(x1/t_j) <= ceil(x2/t_j) ? Yes, because if x1/t_j = a.xxx, then ceil(x1/t_j)=a+1, and x2/t_j >= a.xxx, so ceil(x2/t_j) >= a+1. Therefore, the maximum is at i=n: ceil(s[n]/t_j). But wait, then why in the example for t_j=5: \n        i=5: ceil(17/5)=4, and indeed the maximum is 4. And for t_j=4: ceil(17/4)=5. And for t_j=6: ceil(17/6)=3. So then we can simply do: \n        ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But then for the example: \n        t_j=5: (17+5-1)//5 = 21//5 = 4.\n        t_j=4: (17+4-1)//4 = 20//4 = 5.\n        t_j=6: (17+6-1)//6 = 22//6 = 3 (since 22//6 = 3 in integer division? 22//6=3 in Python if using integer floor division, but we want ceil: ceil(17/6)=3). However, is it always true that the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/t_j) = ceil(s[n]/t_j)? Consider: \n        s = [10, 10] (n=2) -> s1=10, s2=10. For i=1: ceil(10/t_j), for i=2: ceil(10/t_j) -> same. Consider: \n        s = [1, 10] (n=2), t_j=10.\n        i=1: ceil(1/10)=1. i=2: ceil(10/10)=1.\n        -> max=1. Consider: \n        s = [10, 11] (n=2), t_j=10. i=1: ceil(10/10)=1. i=2: ceil(11/10)=2.\n        -> max=2. So the maximum is not necessarily at i=n if the prefix sums are not increasing faster than linearly? But note: the prefix sums are non-decreasing, and the function ceil(x/t_j) is non-decreasing in x. Therefore, the maximum is at the maximum x, which is s[n]. Therefore, we can simply use: \n        ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But wait: in the example [4,1,5,1,6] for t_j=5, we have total_volume=17, and ceil(17/5)=4, and that is the answer. However, let me try a counterexample:\n\n        n=2, volumes = [3, 1], total_volume=4. prefix: s1=3, s2=4. Query: t_j=2. Condition for i=1: ceil(3/2)=2. Condition for i=2: ceil(4/2)=2. So ans=2.

But if s is 0, then we would get (0+q-1)//q = (q-1)//q = 0, which is correct. But the problem says the volumes are at least 1, so s>=n>=1. Therefore, we can do this. Let me test with the example: \n        s=17, q=5 -> (17+5-1)//5 = 21//5 = 4 (since 21//5=4 in integer division). Example: q=4 -> (17+4-1)//4 = 20//4=5. Example: q=6 -> (17+6-1)//6 = 22//6 = 3 (because 22//6 is 3 in integer division). This matches. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) //",

The water that enters the system at a lock j (<= i) and that stays in the first i locks is: \n            min(T, the time when lock j is full and starts overflowing) \n        but note: the overflow from lock j might not reach lock i within time T? Actually, a simpler way: the water from a pipe at lock j will contribute to the first i locks only if j<=i, and the amount is min(T, the time when the entire chain from j to i is filled) ??? Alternatively, we note that the water from a pipe at lock j will eventually fill the locks from j to n, but the time to fill the first i locks (with i>=j) is at least the time to fill the entire segment [j, i]. However, the known solution for this problem is to compute:\n\n        k_min = max( ceil(s[i] / T) for i in [1, n] )\n\n   but we saw that doesn't work for the example. Another known solution: \n        We compute the minimum time required for a given k is: \n            T_min = max( ceil(s[i] / i) for i in [1, n] ) [This is what the provided code does for t_min]\n\n   But note the provided code:\n\n        s = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n            div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n            t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the missing part in the solve function. The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers (a and b) and two sums (suma and sumb). The idea is:\n- We start with a = -1 (so the next candy for Alice is at index 0) and b = n (so the next candy for Bob is at index n-1).\n- We have a variable `cur` for the current count of candies eaten and `ans` to record the maximum count when the two sums are equal.\n\nThe while loop runs until the pointers meet or cross. Inside:\n- If suma > sumb: then we take a candy from Bob's end (b-1) and add to sumb, and increment cur by 1.\n- If suma < sumb: we need to take a candy from Alice's end (a+1) and add to suma, and increment cur by 1. (This is the missing part.)\n- If they are equal: we record the current count (ans = cur) and then take one candy from both ends (so a moves right, b moves left, and we add both candies, and cur increases by 2).\n\nHowever, note that when we record `ans` in the equal case, we are at a state where the current sums are equal, and then we take one more from each side. But note that the next state might break the equality? Actually, the problem is that we are about to add two candies and then the next state might not be equal. But the key is that we record the current total count (cur) at the moment of equality, and then we proceed to add two more.\n\nBut note: the example test cases. In the first test case: [1,1] -> Alice takes the first, Bob takes the last. Then we have suma=1, sumb=1 -> then we set ans=0? Actually, initially cur=0, then we enter the else (since both are 0) and then we set ans=0, then we add two candies: a becomes 0, b becomes 1 (so a=0, b=1 -> then a>=b? Actually, a=0 and b=1 -> a<b, but then we break the loop? Actually, the condition is at the top: a>=b? Then we break. So we break and then print ans=0? That's not right.\n\nWait, let me reexamine the code:\n\nThe initial state: a=-1, b=n, suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0.\n\nThen we enter the loop: a=-1, b=n -> a<b -> so we enter.\n\nWe are in the else (since suma==sumb) -> then we set ans=cur (which is 0) -> then we do:\n   a += 1 -> a=0\n   b -= 1 -> b=n-1\n   suma += arr[0] -> suma = arr[0]\n   sumb += arr[n-1] -> sumb = arr[n-1]\n   cur += 2 -> cur=2\n\nThen we go to the top: check if a>=b? \n   If n=2, then a=0, b=1 -> 0<1 -> so we continue.\n\nThen we check: if suma>sumb? or ...? Then we do the next step.\n\nBut note: the problem says for the first test case the answer is 2. So we must record that at some point we had 2 candies and the sums were equal.\n\nHow do we record that? The code currently sets `ans = cur` in the else block, but then immediately we add two more candies. Then the next time we have equality we set `ans` again. But the problem is that after adding two candies, the next state might not be equal.\n\nActually, the idea is: when we have equality, we record the current total candies (which is `cur` at that moment) and then we take one more from each side. Then we continue until the pointers meet.\n\nBut note: the example [1,1]:\n   Step 1: a=-1, b=2 -> enter loop. \n        suma=0, sumb=0 -> else: \n            ans = 0 -> then a becomes 0, b becomes 1, suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2.\n   Step 2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> enter loop.\n        Now suma=1, sumb=1 -> else: \n            ans = 2 -> then a becomes 1, b becomes 0 -> now a>=b (1>=0) -> break.\n        Then we print ans=2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,1]? \n   n=3, arr=[1,2,1]\n   Step1: a=-1, b=3 -> else: set ans=0, then a=0, b=2, suma=1, sumb=1, cur=2.\n   Step2: a=0, b=2 -> a<b -> enter. \n        Now suma=1, sumb=1 -> else: set ans=2, then a=1, b=1 -> now a==b -> break? \n        But wait, we haven't considered the middle candy? \n\nBut note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. So when a and b meet, we break. However, the middle candy is not eaten by either? \n\nBut the example [1,2,1] should be: \n   Alice can eat [1] (sum=1) and Bob can eat [1] (sum=1) -> total 2 candies. \n   Or Alice can eat [1,2] (sum=3) and Bob can eat [1] (sum=1) -> not equal.\n   Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [2,1] -> not equal.\n   Or Alice eats [1,2,1] and Bob eats nothing -> not equal.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,3,1,1]? \n   We want: Alice eats [1,3] (sum=4) and Bob eats [1,1] (sum=2) -> not equal.\n   Or Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> total 2, but we can do better: \n        Alice eats [1,3] (4) and Bob eats [1] (1) -> not equal.\n        Alice eats [1] (1) and Bob eats [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n        Alice eats [1,3,1] (5) and Bob eats [1] (1) -> not equal.\n        Alice eats [1] (1) and Bob eats [1] (1) -> total 2.\n\nBut note: the example in the problem: \n   Fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer 7.\n\nHow does the algorithm work for [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]?\n   We start: a=-1, b=8, suma=0, sumb=0 -> else: set ans=0, then a=0, b=7 -> suma=7, sumb=1, cur=2.\n   Then: suma>sumb? 7>1 -> so we move Bob: b=6, sumb=1+11=12, cur=3.\n   Then: 7<12 -> so we move Alice: a=1, suma=7+3=10, cur=4.\n   Then: 10<12 -> move Alice: a=2, suma=10+20=30, cur=5.\n   Then: 30>12 -> move Bob: b=5, sumb=12+8=20, cur=6.\n   Then: 30>20 -> move Bob: b=4, sumb=20+10=30, cur=7.\n   Then: 30==30 -> set ans=7, then a=3, b=3 -> break? because a>=b? \n        But note: a=3 and b=3 -> a>=b -> break.\n\nSo we print 7.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,3,4,5]? \n   We want: \n        Initially: a=-1, b=5 -> else: ans=0, then a=0, b=4 -> suma=1, sumb=5, cur=2.\n        Then: 1<5 -> move Alice: a=1, suma=1+2=3, cur=3.\n        Then: 3<5 -> move Alice: a=2, suma=3+3=6, cur=4.\n        Then: 6>5 -> move Bob: b=3, sumb=5+4=9, cur=5.\n        Then: 6<9 -> move Alice: a=3, suma=6+4=10, cur=6 -> but now a=3, b=3 -> break. \n        We never set ans to anything? \n\nBut the answer should be 0? because we cannot have the same sum? \n\nBut the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\".\n\nSo we must output 0. However, in the code we initialize ans=0. Then we break without updating ans? So we output 0.\n\nBut what if we have a case where we have an equality in the middle? We update ans. Otherwise, we break and output the last recorded ans (which might be 0 from the initial state, but note: we set ans=0 in the first else block and then we set ans again when we have equality later?).\n\nBut in the [1,2,3,4,5] example, we set ans=0 at the beginning and then never set it again. Then we output 0 -> correct.\n\nHowever, what if we have a case that never hits the else block? Then we break and output 0? That is correct because if we never have equality then the maximum total candies is 0.\n\nBut wait: the problem says they can choose to eat zero candies? Then 0 is acceptable.\n\nSo the missing part in program1.py is the case when suma < sumb. We need to take a candy from the left (Alice). So:\n\n    elif suma < sumb:\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nBut note: we are at a state where a and b are the next available indices. Initially a=-1, so we do a+=1 -> 0, then add arr[0]. Similarly, when we are in the middle, a is the last index Alice has taken, so the next is a+1.\n\nBut we must be cautious: the condition a>=b at the top of the loop. After we do a+=1, we might have a==b? Then we break next time. But that is acceptable.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We have n locks with volumes v1, v2, ..., vn. Water flows at 1 liter per second per open pipe. The water overflows from a lock to the next one if it exceeds the volume. We need to fill all locks. We are given q queries, each with a time t_j, and we must find the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n   Reads n, then the volumes, then q, then the queries.\n\n   Then it does:\n        s = t_min = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n            div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n            t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n   Then for each query q:\n        if q < t_min:\n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\nWhat is t_min? It is the minimum time required to fill all locks even if we open all pipes? Actually, note that we cannot fill the locks faster than the time required for the cumulative volume divided by the number of locks? But note: the water flows in a chain. The constraint is that the lock i must be filled before the water can flow to the next. Actually, the key constraint is that the total water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time T is T (if we have one pipe in the first i locks) but actually we can have multiple pipes. However, the problem is to find the minimum number of pipes to open to achieve filling in time T.\n\nBut note: the example note: \n   \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\nSo the first lock has volume 4. Then even if we open all pipes, the first lock gets 1 liter per second per pipe? But wait: if we open a pipe at the first lock, then the first lock gets 1 liter per second. But if we open a pipe at a later lock, the water must first fill the previous locks? \n\nActually, the water flows sequentially: the first lock must be filled before any water goes to the second, and so on. Therefore, the time to fill the first lock is at least ceil(v1 / k1) where k1 is the number of pipes in the first lock? But note: we can have pipes in multiple locks, but the water from a pipe at a later lock does not help the first lock until the entire chain is filled up to that lock.\n\nTherefore, the total time must be at least the maximum over i of (S_i / i) where S_i = v1+v2+...+vi? Why? Because the entire first i locks must be filled, and the total water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time T is T * (number of pipes in the first i locks). But note: the pipes beyond the first i locks do not contribute to the first i locks until the later locks are filled? Actually, they don't contribute at all until the entire chain up to that lock is filled. Therefore, the water that ends up in the first i locks can only come from the pipes that are in the first i locks. \n\nSo the constraint: for the first i locks, we must have at least S_i liters of water coming from the pipes in the first i locks. If we use x_i pipes in the first i locks, then in time T we get T * x_i liters. Therefore, we must have T * x_i >= S_i. Since we are free to choose the pipes (and we want the minimum total pipes), we note that the entire system must satisfy for every i: x_i >= ceil(S_i / T). But note: the number of pipes in the first i locks cannot exceed the total number of pipes we use (say k). Therefore, we must have k >= ceil(S_i / T) for every i. Therefore, the minimum k must be at least max_i( ceil(S_i / T) ). \n\nBut wait: the example: \n   n=5, volumes = [4,1,5,1,6]\n   Then S_1 = 4 -> ceil(4/1)=4 -> so k>=4? \n        S_2 = 5 -> ceil(5/2)=3 -> k>=3\n        S_3 = 10 -> ceil(10/3)=4\n        S_4 = 11 -> ceil(11/4)=3\n        S_5 = 17 -> ceil(17/5)=4\n\n   Then k_min = max(4,3,4,3,4) = 4.\n\nBut the example says: in the sixth query (t_j=5) we can open 3 pipes (at locks 1,3,4). \n\nSo what is the catch? The above reasoning is not exactly correct because the water from a pipe in the first i locks is not necessarily all going to the first i locks: if the pipe is at a lock j (<=i), then the water from that pipe will first fill the locks from j to i? Actually, the water from a pipe at lock j (in the first i locks) will contribute to the entire chain from j to the end, but the first i locks will get the entire water from that pipe until the first i locks are filled? \n\nActually, the problem is more complex. The key is that the water from a pipe in the first i locks will eventually contribute to the first i locks until they are filled. However, if we have a pipe at a lock beyond i, then that pipe does not contribute to the first i locks until the entire chain up to that lock is filled? So indeed, the first i locks can only be filled by the pipes in the first i locks.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the first i locks is: the total water from the pipes in the first i locks must be at least S_i. And if we use k_i pipes in the first i locks, then in time T we have T * k_i >= S_i. Therefore, k_i >= ceil(S_i / T). Since k (the total pipes) must be at least k_i, we have k >= ceil(S_i / T) for every i. Therefore, the minimum k must be at least M = max_i( ceil(S_i / T) ). \n\nBut then why in the example for T=5, we have:\n   ceil(4/5)=1, ceil(5/5)=1, ceil(10/5)=2, ceil(11/5)=3, ceil(17/5)=4 -> so M=4? \nBut the example says we can do with 3 pipes.\n\nThe catch: the condition is not that the water from the pipes in the first i locks must be at least S_i, but note that the water from the pipes in the first i locks might also be used to fill locks beyond i? Actually, no: because the water that flows beyond i does not help the first i locks. Therefore, the water that leaves the first i locks is not available for the first i locks. So the condition is: the water that remains in the first i locks must be at least S_i. \n\nBut how do we account for the water that leaves? Actually, the water that leaves the first i locks is the overflow from the last lock in the segment? And that overflow is only after the entire segment is filled. Therefore, the pipes in the first i locks must produce at least S_i liters of water that stays in the first i locks. However, note that the pipes in the first i locks might produce more than S_i liters, and the excess goes to the next locks. But that doesn't harm. So the condition is indeed T * k_i >= S_i.\n\nBut then why the example works with 3 pipes? \n\nLet me simulate for T=5, with pipes at locks 1,3,4.\n\nAt time 0: all empty.\nEach second, 1 liter from lock1, 1 from lock3, 1 from lock4.\n\nSecond 1: \n   lock1: gets 1 (from pipe1) -> [1,0,0,0,0]\n   lock3: gets 1 -> but lock2 is not full? So the water at lock3 cannot be placed until lock2 is full? Actually, the problem says: \"When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second. The locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock i to the lock i+1.\"\n\nSo for lock3: the water enters lock3, but if lock3 is not full, it stays? Actually, no: the water enters the lock and if it exceeds the volume, the excess is transferred. But if it doesn't exceed, it stays.\n\nSo after second1:\n   lock1: 1 (volume4, so not full)\n   lock3: 1 (volume5, so not full)\n   lock4: 1 (volume1, so now it becomes 1 -> full? then the excess? but 1==volume1 -> no excess.\n\nAfter second2:\n   lock1: 1+1 = 2\n   lock3: 1+1 = 2 -> but then lock3 is not full? \n   lock4: already full, so the water from lock4's pipe: since lock4 is full, the 1 liter goes to lock5? \n        lock5: 1\n\nAfter second3:\n   lock1: 3\n   lock3: 3\n   lock5: 1+1=2\n\nAfter second4:\n   lock1: 4 -> full, so the next water from pipe1: goes to lock2? \n        lock2: 1 (from the overflow of lock1 at second4)\n   lock3: 3+1=4 (still not full)\n   lock5: 2+1=3\n\nAfter second5:\n   lock1: full -> so the water from pipe1 (1 liter) goes to lock2: lock2 becomes 1+1=2 -> but lock2 volume is 1? so it becomes 1 and the excess 1 goes to lock3? \n        lock2: 1 (full) and then 1 liter overflows to lock3.\n   lock3: 4 (from previous) + 1 (from pipe3) + 1 (overflow from lock2) = 6 -> but lock3 volume is 5, so it becomes 5 and the excess 1 goes to lock4? \n        lock4 is already full, so the excess goes to lock5: lock5 becomes 3+1=4.\n   lock4: pipe4 produces 1 liter -> but lock4 is full, so it goes to lock5: lock5 becomes 4+1=5.\n\nBut we need lock5 volume=6 -> not filled.\n\nWait, the example says: \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5.\" \n\nBut in the example, the volumes are [4,1,5,1,6]? \n   After 4 seconds: \n        lock1: 4 (full) -> so the water from pipe1 at second4: 1 liter goes to lock2 -> lock2 becomes 1 (full) and then the excess? lock2 volume is 1, so no excess? \n        lock3: we have 3 (from the pipe3 at seconds1,2,3) and then at second4: pipe3 adds 1 -> 4? \n        lock4: we have 1 (from second1) and then at second2,3,4: since lock4 is full, the water from pipe4 goes to lock5: so lock5 gets 3 liters (seconds2,3,4) -> so lock5=3.\n        Also, at second4: the overflow from lock2? we had lock2 getting 1 from lock1 at second4 -> that's it, lock2 is full (volume1) so no overflow.\n\n   Then after 4 seconds: \n        lock1:4, lock2:1, lock3:4, lock4:1, lock5:3.\n\n   Then at second5:\n        pipe1: 1 -> lock1 is full -> goes to lock2: lock2 is full -> goes to lock3: lock3 becomes 4+1=5 (full) -> then the excess? lock3 volume is 5, so no excess? \n        pipe3: 1 -> lock3 is full -> goes to lock4: lock4 is full -> goes to lock5: lock5 becomes 3+1=4.\n        pipe4: 1 -> lock4 full -> lock5: 4+1=5.\n\n   So after 5 seconds: lock5=5, but we need 6 -> not filled.\n\nBut the example says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\". And the query is t_j=5? Then the answer for t_j=5 is 3? \n\nBut our simulation shows that after 5 seconds, lock5 is only 5, not 6.\n\nWait, the example note says: \"Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\". The second query? The problem says: \"The third line contains one integer q (1<=q<=200000)\" and then q lines. The example input is:\n\n   n=5\n   volumes = [4,1,5,1,6]\n   q=6\n   queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nThe example says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\". Then the second query (t_j=2) and the fifth (t_j=5) and sixth (t_j=6) are positive.\n\nBut the example note also says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5.\"\n\nWait, they say \"after 4 seconds\" and then \"in the following 1 second\", meaning total 5 seconds? But then lock5 gets 1 liter? and lock2 gets 1 liter? Then lock5 would be 1 (from the 5th second) but we need 6? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The example note says: \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\" and then in the next second (the 5th second) the water from the pipes that are open (which are at 1,3,4) are distributed: \n   pipe1: 1 liter -> goes to lock2 (because lock1 is full) -> lock2 becomes 1 (full) and then the excess 0? \n   pipe3: 1 liter -> goes to lock3? but lock3 is not full? Actually, we thought lock3 was not full at 4 seconds? \n\nThe example note says: \"Because locks 1,3, and 4 are already filled\" -> wait, at 4 seconds? \n\nLet me recast: \n   They say: \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\" -> but lock3 is not full? \n\nBut then they say: \"effectively the water goes to locks 2 and 5\". \n\nSo at second5:\n   pipe1: 1 liter -> lock1 is full -> goes to lock2 -> lock2 becomes 1 (full) -> then the excess? lock2 volume is 1, so no excess? \n   pipe3: 1 liter -> lock3: at 4 seconds we had lock3 at 3? then at second5: becomes 4? not full (volume5) -> so it stays? \n   pipe4: 1 liter -> lock4 is full -> goes to lock5.\n\nSo lock5 gets 1 liter (from pipe4) and lock2 gets 1 liter (from pipe1). \n\nBut then lock3 only gets 1 liter from pipe3? so lock3=4, not 5.\n\nSo it seems the example note might have a typo? \n\nAlternatively, the example note says: \"Because locks 1,3, and 4 are already filled\" at 4 seconds? How? \n\nWith pipes at 1,3,4:\n\nAt time1:\n   lock1:1, lock3:1, lock4:1 -> lock4 is full? so the water from pipe4 at time1: 1 liter -> lock4 becomes full, and then the next water from pipe4 will go to lock5? \nAt time2:\n   lock1:2, lock3:2, lock4: full -> so pipe4: 1 liter to lock5 -> lock5=1.\nAt time3:\n   lock1:3, lock3:3, lock4: full -> pipe4: 1 liter to lock5 -> lock5=2.\nAt time4:\n   lock1:4 (full), lock3:4, lock4: full -> \n        pipe1: 1 liter -> lock1 full -> lock2:1 (so lock2 becomes full) -> then the excess? lock2 volume is 1, so no excess? \n        pipe3: 1 liter -> lock3:4+1=5 (full) -> then the excess? 0.\n        pipe4: 1 liter -> lock5:2+1=3.\n\nSo after 4 seconds: \n   lock1:4 (full), lock2:1 (full), lock3:5 (full), lock4:1 (full), lock5:3.\n\nThen at time5:\n   pipe1: 1 liter -> lock1 full -> lock2 full -> lock3 full -> lock4 full -> lock5:3+1=4.\n   pipe3: 1 liter -> lock3 full -> lock4 full -> lock5:4+1=5.\n   pipe4: 1 liter -> lock4 full -> lock5:5+1=6.\n\nSo after 5 seconds: lock5=6 -> full.\n\nTherefore, it works.\n\nSo what is the minimal number of pipes for T=5? We did it with 3.\n\nBut our condition: \n   For i=1: ceil(4/5)=1 -> k>=1\n   i=2: ceil((4+1)/5)=ceil(5/5)=1\n   i=3: ceil(10/5)=2\n   i=4: ceil(11/5)=ceil(2.2)=3\n   i=5: ceil(17/5)=ceil(3.4)=4\n\nSo the condition says k>=4? But we did with 3.\n\nThe flaw: the condition I described earlier is necessary: k must be at least ceil(S_i / T) for every i. But for i=5, ceil(17/5)=4, so we must have k>=4? But we did with 3. \n\nWhat's the resolution? \n\nThe condition is not that the water from the pipes in the first i locks must be at least S_i, but note: the water from the pipes in the first i locks might be used to fill locks beyond i? Actually, no: because the water that leaves the first i locks is not available for the first i locks. Therefore, the water that remains in the first i locks must be at least S_i. And that water comes only from the pipes in the first i locks. \n\nBut in our simulation, the pipes in the first i locks (for i=5, the entire system) are 3, and they produced 5*3=15 liters? but we need 17? \n\nWait, no: in 5 seconds, the three pipes produce 15 liters. But the total volume is 17. How did we get 17? \n\nWe didn't. We only filled 4+1+5+1+6 = 17? \n\nBut 15<17 -> so how? \n\nI see the error: the water from a pipe at lock j is not limited to the lock j and beyond? Actually, the entire system: the water from the three pipes (at locks 1,3,4) produced 5 seconds * 3 = 15 liters. But the total volume is 17. How did we get 17? \n\nWe didn't. The simulation showed that after 5 seconds, we filled 17? \n\nWait: \n   lock1:4\n   lock2:1\n   lock3:5\n   lock4:1\n   lock5:6\n   total = 4+1+5+1+6 = 17.\n\nBut 15<17 -> contradiction.\n\nLet me recount the water:\n\n   Time1: 3 liters (one from each pipe) -> lock1:1, lock3:1, lock4:1 (and lock4 becomes full, so the next water for lock4 goes to lock5? but at time1, lock4 is full so the water from pipe4 at time1: 1 liter -> lock4 is full -> so it goes to lock5? but lock5 is not full? so lock5 gets 1? \n        Actually, the problem says: \"water exceeding the volume of the lock i is transferred to lock i+1\". So at time1, lock4 gets 1 and that equals its volume -> no excess. So lock5 gets nothing at time1.\n\n   So at time1: total water in the system: 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n   Time2: \n        pipe1: lock1 gets 1 -> now 2.\n        pipe3: lock3 gets 1 -> now 2.\n        pipe4: lock4 is full -> so the 1 liter goes to lock5 -> lock5=1.\n        total: 2+2+1+1 = 6? but wait, lock4 is still 1? and lock5=1 -> total 2+2+1+1 = 6? but that's 2+2+1 (lock4)+1 (lock5)=6? \n\n   Time3:\n        pipe1: lock1=3\n        pipe3: lock3=3\n        pipe4: lock4 full -> lock5=1+1=2\n        total: 3+3+1+2 = 9\n\n   Time4:\n        pipe1: lock1=4 (full) -> so the water goes to lock2: lock2=1 (full) -> then the water doesn't go further? because lock2 volume is 1, so the water is exactly 1 -> no excess? \n        pipe3: lock3=4 -> then we add 1 -> becomes 5 (full) -> no excess.\n        pipe4: lock4 full -> lock5=2+1=3\n        total: 4+1+5+1+3 = 14\n\n   Time5:\n        pipe1: lock1 full -> lock2 full -> so the water goes to lock3: lock3 is full -> lock4 full -> lock5: 3+1=4.\n        pipe3: lock3 full -> lock4 full -> lock5: 4+1=5.\n        pipe4: lock4 full -> lock5: 5+1=6.\n        total: 4+1+5+1+6 = 17.\n\n   So total water = 17, and 3 pipes * 5 seconds = 15 -> we have 15 liters of water? but we have 17 in the system? \n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe resolution: the water from a pipe that is sent to the next lock is not lost. It is counted in the next lock. But note: the water that overflows from lock1 to lock2 is still in the system. And the water that overflows from lock2 to lock3 is still in the system. So the total water in the system is the sum of the water in each lock, and that equals the total water produced by the pipes.\n\nBut 3 pipes * 5 seconds = 15, and we have 17 in the system? \n\nWait, we have:\n   Time1: 3\n   Time2: 3 -> total 6\n   Time3: 3 -> total 9\n   Time4: 3 -> total 12\n   Time5: 3 -> total 15\n\nBut the system has 17? \n\nThis indicates an error in the simulation.\n\nLet me do it step by step for lock5:\n\n   At time1: lock5 gets 0.\n   At time2: lock5 gets 1 (from pipe4).\n   At time3: lock5 gets 1 (from pipe4) -> total 2.\n   At time4: lock5 gets 1 (from pipe4) -> total 3.\n   At time5: \n        pipe1: 1 -> goes through lock1, lock2, lock3, lock4 (all full) -> lock5: 3+1=4.\n        pipe3: 1 -> goes through lock3, lock4 -> lock5: 4+1=5.\n        pipe4: 1 -> lock5: 5+1=6.\n\n   So lock5: 6.\n\n   lock4: always 1 (full) -> so 1.\n   lock3: at time1:1, time2:2, time3:3, time4:4, then at time4: pipe3 adds 1 -> becomes 5? so lock3=5.\n   lock2: at time4: gets 1 from the overflow of lock1 -> so lock2=1.\n   lock1: at time1:1, time2:2, time3:3, time4:4.\n\n   Total: 4+1+5+1+6 = 17.\n\n   But the total water produced is 15.\n\nThe catch: the water from pipe1 at time5: \n   It goes to lock1 -> full -> then to lock2 -> full -> then to lock3 -> full -> then to lock4 -> full -> then to lock5: so it ends in lock5.\n\n   Similarly, pipe3 at time5: goes to lock3 -> full -> lock4 full -> lock5.\n\n   pipe4 at time5: lock5.\n\n   So the water from the three pipes at time5: 3 liters, all go to lock5.\n\n   But lock5 only had 3 at the end of time4? and then we add 3 -> becomes 6.\n\n   So the total water is 12 (after time4) + 3 = 15.\n\n   And the breakdown: \n        lock1:4\n        lock2:1\n        lock3:5\n        lock4:1\n        lock5:6\n        total = 4+1+5+1+6 = 17? \n\n   But 4+1+5+1+6 = 17, and 15 != 17.\n\nThis is a mystery.\n\nI see the error: lock2 has volume 1, so it can only hold 1 liter. But at time4, lock2 gets 1 liter from the overflow of lock1 (pipe1 at time4). Then at time5, pipe1 produces 1 liter: \n   lock1 is full -> so the water goes to lock2 -> lock2 is full -> so the water overflows to lock3 -> lock3 is full -> to lock4 -> full -> to lock5.\n\n   So the water from pipe1 at time5: ends in lock5.\n\n   Similarly, the water from pipe3 at time5: lock3 is full -> to lock4 -> full -> to lock5.\n\n   And pipe4 at time5: to lock5.\n\n   So lock5 gets 3 liters at time5, so lock5 becomes 3 (from time4) + 3 = 6.\n\n   But how much water is in lock2? only 1 liter (from time4). It doesn't get more at time5 because the water overflows.\n\n   Now, what is the water in lock3? \n        At time1:1, time2:2, time3:3, time4:4, then at time4: pipe3 adds 1 -> becomes 5? \n        But at time4, pipe3 adds 1: lock3 was 3 at time3, then at time4: \n             pipe3: 1 -> lock3 becomes 4.\n        Then at time4, we also have the overflow from lock2? no, because at time4 the overflow from lock1 went to lock2 and filled it exactly -> no overflow from lock2.\n\n        Then at time5: pipe3: 1 -> lock3 is full? no, lock3 volume is 5, and it was 4 at the end of time4. Then at time5, we add 1 -> becomes 5. \n\n   So lock3:5.\n\n   lock4: always 1.\n\n   lock1:4.\n\n   lock2:1.\n\n   lock5:3 (after time4) + 3 (at time5) = 6.\n\n   Total: 4+1+5+1+6 = 17.\n\n   But the total water added is 15.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nUnless there is an error in the simulation of the overflow at time4 for pipe1? \n   At time4: \n        pipe1: lock1 was 3 -> becomes 4 (full) -> then the water from pipe1 at time4: we haven't accounted for it? \n        We said: pipe1 at time4: lock1 is full -> so the water goes to lock2: lock2 becomes 1 (full) -> no excess.\n\n   So the water from pipe1 at time4: 1 liter -> lock2.\n\n   Then at time5: pipe1: 1 liter -> lock1 full -> lock2 full -> so it overflows to lock3.\n\n   So lock3 at time5: \n        from pipe3: 1 liter -> lock3 becomes 4+1=5.\n        from the overflow of lock2 (due to pipe1): 1 liter -> lock3 becomes 5+1=6? -> then lock3 overflows by 1 to lock4.\n\n   lock4: \n        from the overflow of lock3: 1 liter -> lock4 is full (volume1) -> so it overflows to lock5: 1 liter.\n        from pipe4: 1 liter -> lock4 full -> to lock5: 1 liter.\n   lock5: \n        from lock4 overflow: 1+1 = 2 liters.\n        from pipe4: 1 liter -> but wait, pipe4 is at lock4, so it goes to lock4 and then to lock5: so 1 liter.\n        and from the overflow from lock4 from lock3: 1 liter.\n        total for lock5: 3 (from before) + 2 (from lock4 overflows) + 1 (from pipe4) = 6? \n\n   But then lock3:6? but volume is 5 -> so it should be 5 and overflow 1.\n\n   This is getting very messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, let me read the intended solution for the locks problem.\n\nThe intended solution:\n\n   We precompute the prefix sums: s[i] = v1+...+vi.\n\n   The condition for a given T and a given number of pipes k is: \n        For every i from 1 to n: the amount of water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time T is at least s[i].\n\n   How much water can be delivered to the first i locks? \n        The water that enters the system at a lock j (<= i) and that stays in the first i locks is: \n            min(T, the time when lock j is full and starts overflowing) \n        but note: the overflow from lock j might not reach lock i within time T? \n\n   Actually, a simpler way: the water from a pipe at lock j will contribute to the first i locks only if j<=i, and the amount is min(T, the time when the entire chain from j to i is filled) ??? \n\n   Alternatively, we note that the water from a pipe at lock j will eventually fill the locks from j to n, but the time to fill the first i locks (with i>=j) is at least the time to fill the entire segment [j, i]. \n\n   However, the known solution for this problem is to compute:\n\n        k_min = max( ceil(s[i] / T) for i in [1, n] )\n\n   but we saw that doesn't work for the example.\n\n   Another known solution: \n        We compute the minimum time required for a given k is: \n            T_min = max( ceil(s[i] / i) for i in [1, n] )   [This is what the provided code does for t_min]\n\n   But note the provided code:\n\n        s = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n            div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n            t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n   This computes the minimum time required if we are allowed to open an arbitrary number of pipes? But note: if we open an arbitrary number of pipes, then the time is determined by the slowest lock to fill? Actually, no: because the first lock must be filled, and the time for the first lock is at least ceil(v1/ infinity) -> 0? \n\n   Actually, the code computes for the first i locks: the minimum time to fill the first i locks if we could put arbitrarily many pipes in the first i locks? But then the time would be ceil(s[i] / i) because we can put i pipes (one in each lock) and then the rate is i liters per second. \n\n   But note: the water from a pipe in the first i locks might overflow to the next locks beyond i, so we cannot use more than the volume of the lock. \n\n   Actually, the condition for the first i locks: if we put one pipe in each of the first i locks, then in time T, we deliver T * i liters. But we only need s[i] liters. Therefore, if T * i >= s[i], then we can fill the first i locks in time T. The minimal T for which this holds for all i is T_min = max_i( ceil(s[i] / i) ).\n\n   Therefore, if the query T is below T_min, then it's impossible -> print -1.\n\n   For T>=T_min, we need the minimum number of pipes k such that the entire system can be filled in time T.\n\n   How to compute k for given T?\n        We require: for every i, the number of pipes in the first i locks, say k_i, must satisfy: k_i * T >= s[i].\n        Therefore, k_i >= ceil(s[i] / T).\n        And then k must be at least max_i(ceil(s[i] / T)).\n\n   But then for the example: T=5, \n        i=1: ceil(4/5)=1\n        i=2: ceil(5/5)=1\n        i=3: ceil(10/5)=2\n        i=4: ceil(11/5)=3\n        i=5: ceil(17/5)=4\n\n   so k>=4.\n\n   But we did it with 3. \n\n   What is the catch? The condition is not sufficient? or not necessary?\n\n   The condition is necessary: if we use only 3 pipes, then for i=5: we require 3 * 5 = 15 >= 17? -> false.\n\n   Therefore, it is impossible with 3 pipes? \n\n   This contradicts the example simulation.\n\n   Unless the example simulation is in error.\n\n   Let me recompute the total water in the system after 5 seconds with 3 pipes: 3*5=15.\n   The total volume is 17.\n   Therefore, it is impossible to fill the system with 3 pipes in 5 seconds.\n\n   But the example simulation showed that after 5 seconds, the system is full. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   I must have made an error in the simulation.\n\n   Let me simulate with a spreadsheet.\n\n   Locks: [4,1,5,1,6]\n   Pipes at 1,3,4.\n\n   We simulate by seconds, and within each second, we add 1 liter to each pipe and then propagate overflows.\n\n   Second 1:\n        lock1: 1 (<=4) -> no overflow.\n        lock3: 1 (<=5) -> no overflow.\n        lock4: 1 (>=1) -> lock4 becomes 1 (full) -> the next water for lock4 will overflow to lock5.\n        lock5: 0.\n        After second1: [1,0,1,1,0] -> but wait, lock4 is full, so the water for lock4 in the future will go to lock5.\n\n   Second 2:\n        lock1: 1+1=2\n        lock3: 1+1=2\n        lock4: receives 1 -> but it is full -> so it overflows to lock5: lock5=1.\n        After second2: [2,0,2,1,1]\n\n   Second 3:\n        lock1: 3\n        lock3: 3\n        lock4: 1 -> full -> overflows to lock5: lock5=1+1=2.\n        After: [3,0,3,1,2]\n\n   Second 4:\n        lock1: 4 (full) -> next water for lock1 will overflow to lock2.\n        lock3: 4\n        lock4: 1 -> full -> to lock5: lock5=2+1=3.\n        Also, for lock1: we add 1 -> it overflows to lock2: lock2=1 (full) -> then any further overflow from lock1 will go to lock2 and then overflow to lock3 if lock2 is full.\n        After: [4,1,4,1,3]\n\n   Second 5:\n        lock1: we add 1 -> full -> overflows to lock2: lock2 is full -> overflows to lock3: lock3=4+1=5 (full) -> then overflows to lock4: lock4 is full -> to lock5: lock5=3+1=4.\n        lock3: we add 1 -> lock3 is now 5 (full) -> overflows to lock4: lock4 full -> to lock5: lock5=4+1=5.\n        lock4: we add 1 -> to lock5: lock5=5+1=6.\n        After: [4,1,5,1,6] -> filled.\n\n   Total water added: 3 pipes * 5 seconds = 15.\n   Total water in the system: 4+1+5+1+6 = 17.\n\n   This is impossible.\n\n   The only explanation is that the water from the overflow of lock1 to lock2 to lock3 counts as one liter in lock3, but it came from the pipe at lock1. Similarly, the water from the pipe at lock3 that overflows to lock4 and then to lock5 counts as one liter in lock5. \n\n   But then the total water is 15, and the system has 15 liters of water distributed as 4 in lock1, 1 in lock2, 5 in lock3, 1 in lock4, and 4 in lock5? -> 4+1+5+1+4=15.\n\n   How do we get 4 in lock5? \n\n   Let me recompute the water in each lock after 5 seconds without assuming the overflows are additional:\n\n   We have to simulate the propagation in order.\n\n   One way: within a second, we add the water from the pipes and then propagate in increasing index.\n\n   Second 1:\n        Add at lock1: 1 -> lock1: min(4,1)=1 -> no overflow.\n        Add at lock3: 1 -> lock3: min(5,1)=1 -> no overflow.\n        Add at lock4: 1 -> lock4: min(1,1)=1 -> exactly full, overflow=0.\n        lock5:0.\n        State: [1,0,1,1,0]\n\n   Second 2:\n        lock1: 1+1=2 -> no overflow.\n        lock3: 1+1=2 -> no overflow.\n        lock4: 1+1=2 -> but capacity=1, so we set lock4=1 and overflow=1.\n        Then the overflow from lock4 (1) goes to lock5: lock5=0+1=1.\n        State: [2,0,2,1,1]\n\n   Second 3:\n        lock1: 2+1=3\n        lock3: 2+1=3\n        lock4: 1+1=2 -> overflow=1 -> lock5=1+1=2.\n        State: [3,0,3,1,2]\n\n   Second 4:\n        lock1: 3+1=4 -> full, overflow=0.\n        lock3: 3+1=4\n        lock4: 1+1=2 -> overflow=1 -> lock5=2+1=3.\n        Also, lock1 is full, but we've already added the water. \n        State: [4,0,4,1,3]\n\n        wait, but the overflow from lock1: we haven't done that. \n        The water at lock1 is 4, which is exactly full -> overflow=0.\n\n        So state: [4,0,4,1,3]\n\n   Second 5:\n        lock1: 4+1=5 -> overflow=1.\n             -> we pass 1 to lock2: lock2=0+1=1 (capacity=1) -> exactly full, overflow=0.\n        lock3: 4+1=5 -> overflow=0.\n        lock4: 1+1=2 -> overflow=1 -> lock5=3+1=4.\n        State: [4,1,5,1,4] -> 4+1+5+1+4 = 15.\n\n   So lock5=4, not 6.\n\n   Therefore, the system is not filled.\n\n   So the example note must be incorrect.\n\n   But the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" for t=5.\n\n   Given the above, it is not possible.\n\n   However, the known solution for this problem is to use the condition: \n        k = ceil(total_volume / T)\n        and then check that for every i, ceil(prefix_i / T) <= the number of pipes in the first i locks.\n\n   But the number of pipes in the first i locks is at most k, so we require ceil(prefix_i / T) <= k for every i.\n\n   For the example: \n        total_volume = 17, T=5 -> k>= ceil(17/5)=4.\n        ceil(4/5)=1<=4, ceil(5/5)=1<=4, ceil(10/5)=2<=4, ceil(11/5)=3<=4, ceil(17/5)=4<=4.\n        so k=4.\n\n   Therefore, the answer for t=5 is 4.\n\n   Mayor's queries for the example: \n        q=6, queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n        t_min = max( ceil(4/1), ceil(5/2), ceil(10/3), ceil(11/4), ceil(17/5) ) \n                = max(4, 3, 4, 3, 4) = 4.\n        So for t_j=1,2,3,4: then t_j<4? \n            1<4 -> -1\n            2<4 -> -2? \n            3<4 -> -1\n            4>=4 -> then k = ceil(17/4)=5? -> but wait, the condition is that k must be at least the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/t_j).\n\n        For t_j=4: \n            i=1: ceil(4/4)=1\n            i=2: ceil(5/4)=2\n            i=3: ceil(10/4)=3\n            i=4: ceil(11/4)=3\n            i=5: ceil(17/4)=5\n            so k=5.\n\n        For t_j=5: \n            i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:3, i=5:4 -> so k=4.\n\n        For t_j=6: \n            i=1: ceil(4/6)=1, i=2: ceil(5/6)=1, i=3: ceil(10/6)=2, i=4: ceil(11/6)=2, i=5: ceil(17/6)=3 -> so k=3.\n\n   Therefore, the answers for the example should be:\n        t=1: -1\n        t=2: -1\n        t=3: -1\n        t=4: 5\n        t=5: 4\n        t=6: 3\n\n   But the example note says: \n        \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\"\n        then the second query (t=2) is -1, the fifth (t=5) is 3 (according to the example note) -> but we got 4.\n\n   However, the example note says: \"In the sixth query\" (which is t=6) we can open 3 pipes.\n\n   So the example note might have mixed up the query indexing.\n\n   Given the above, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n        For a query t_j:\n            if t_j < t_min: \n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                ans = max(ceil(s[i] / t_j) for i in range(1, n+1))\n\n   But note: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b\n\n   However, the catch: the total volume might be very large, and we have n up to 200,000 and q up to 200,000.\n\n   We cannot for each query iterate over i from 1 to n (which would be 200,000 * 200,000 = 40e9).\n\n   We must do better.\n\n   Observe that the function f(i) = s[i] is the prefix sum, and we are computing ceil(s[i] / t_j) = (s[i] + t_j - 1) // t_j.\n\n   And we want M = max_{i=1..n} ( (s[i] + t_j - 1) // t_j ).\n\n   But note: s[i] is non-decreasing in i.\n\n   And the function floor(s[i] / t_j) is non-decreasing in s[i], but ceil(s[i] / t_j) = floor((s[i]-1)/t_j) + 1.\n\n   However, we want the maximum over i.\n\n   Since s[i] is increasing, the maximum will be at i=n: ceil(s[n]/t_j) = ceil(total_volume / t_j).\n\n   But wait: is ceil(s[i]/t_j) increasing in i? \n        s[i] <= s[i+1] -> ceil(s[i]/t_j) <= ceil(s[i+1]/t_j) ? \n        Not necessarily: \n            s[i]=5, s[i+1]=6, t_j=5: \n                ceil(5/5)=1, ceil(6/5)=2 -> increasing.\n            s[i]=5, s[i+1]=6, t_j=3:\n                ceil(5/3)=2, ceil(6/3)=2 -> not increasing.\n\n   But note: s[i] is increasing, so s[i] <= s[i+1]. Then ceil(s[i]/t_j) <= ceil(s[i+1]/t_j) might not hold, but in fact, it does not necessarily hold. However, the function ceil(x/t_j) is non-decreasing in x. \n        If x1 <= x2, then ceil(x1/t_j) <= ceil(x2/t_j) ? \n        Yes, because if x1/t_j = a.xxx, then ceil(x1/t_j)=a+1, and x2/t_j >= a.xxx, so ceil(x2/t_j) >= a+1.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum is at i=n: ceil(s[n]/t_j).\n\n   But wait, then why in the example for t_j=5: \n        i=5: ceil(17/5)=4, and indeed the maximum is 4.\n\n   And for t_j=4: ceil(17/4)=5.\n\n   And for t_j=6: ceil(17/6)=3.\n\n   So then we can simply do: \n        ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But then for the example: \n        t_j=5: (17+5-1)//5 = 21//5 = 4.\n        t_j=4: (17+4-1)//4 = 20//4 = 5.\n        t_j=6: (17+6-1)//6 = 22//6 = 3 (since 22//6 = 3 in integer division? 22//6=3 in Python if using integer floor division, but we want ceil: ceil(17/6)=3).\n\n   However, is it always true that the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/t_j) = ceil(s[n]/t_j)?\n\n   Consider: \n        s = [10, 10] (n=2) -> s1=10, s2=10.\n        For i=1: ceil(10/t_j), for i=2: ceil(10/t_j) -> same.\n\n   Consider: \n        s = [1, 10] (n=2), t_j=10.\n        i=1: ceil(1/10)=1.\n        i=2: ceil(10/10)=1.\n        -> max=1.\n\n   Consider: \n        s = [10, 11] (n=2), t_j=10.\n        i=1: ceil(10/10)=1.\n        i=2: ceil(11/10)=2.\n        -> max=2.\n\n   So the maximum is not necessarily at i=n if the prefix sums are not increasing faster than linearly? \n\n   But note: the prefix sums are non-decreasing, and the function ceil(x/t_j) is non-decreasing in x. Therefore, the maximum is at the maximum x, which is s[n].\n\n   Therefore, we can simply use: \n        ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But wait: in the example [4,1,5,1,6] for t_j=5, we have total_volume=17, and ceil(17/5)=4, and that is the answer.\n\n   However, let me try a counterexample:\n\n        n=2, volumes = [3, 1], total_volume=4.\n        prefix: s1=3, s2=4.\n        Query: t_j=2.\n        Condition for i=1: ceil(3/2)=2.\n        Condition for i=2: ceil(4/2)=2.\n        So ans=2.\n\n        But is it possible with 2 pipes? \n            We can open two pipes, say at lock1 and lock2.\n            In time 2:\n                lock1: 2 (from its pipe) -> not full.\n                lock2: 2 (from its pipe) -> full (volume1) -> so overflow 1 to the river? \n                Then lock1: still 2, not 3.\n            Alternatively, open two pipes at lock1: \n                lock1: 2 -> not full.\n                lock2:0.\n            open one at lock1 and one at lock2:\n                lock1:1 (from its pipe) and lock2:1 (full) -> then the next second:\n                     lock1:1+1=2, lock2: receives 1 from its pipe -> overflow because lock2 is full -> the overflow goes to the river.\n                lock1 never gets the third liter.\n\n            So it takes 3 seconds to fill lock1: then with two pipes at lock1: in 2 seconds, only 2 liters -> not enough.\n\n        Therefore, it is not possible with 2 pipes in 2 seconds.\n\n        What is the minimal number of pipes for t_j=2?\n            For i=1: ceil(3/2)=2.\n            For i=2: ceil(4/2)=2.\n            -> so we require 2 pipes.\n\n        But our simulation shows it's not possible.\n\n        The error in the condition: the condition is necessary but not sufficient.\n\n        We require that the water from the pipes in the first i locks must be at least s[i], and the water from the pipes in the first i locks is at most t_j * (number of pipes in the first i locks). \n\n        In the example: for i=1, we require 2 pipes in the first lock. For i=2, we require 2 pipes in the first two locks. \n\n        But if we put two pipes in the first lock and none in the second, then the first lock gets 2*2=4>3 -> filled, and the overflow 1 goes to the second lock -> second lock gets 1 (exactly its volume). \n\n        So it is possible.\n\n        How? \n            Pipe1: at lock1, two pipes.\n            Then in time1: lock1 gets 2.\n            time2: lock1 gets 2 more -> becomes 4 -> then overflow to lock2: 4-3=1 -> lock2 gets 1 (full).\n\n        So it is possible.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is sufficient.\n\n        In the earlier simulation with one pipe in lock1 and one in lock2, it didn't work, but that's not the only way. We can put both pipes in lock1.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for the counterexample is 2.\n\n   So the solution for program2.py is:\n\n        total_volume = s[n] = sum(volumes)\n        For a query t_j:\n            if t_j < t_min: \n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But wait, the condition for the first i locks might require more than ceil(total_volume/t_j) if for some i, ceil(s[i]/t_j) > ceil(total_volume/t_j)? \n\n   However, since s[i] <= total_volume, then ceil(s[i]/t_j) <= ceil(total_volume/t_j) because the function ceil(x/t_j) is non-decreasing in x.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/t_j) is ceil(total_volume/t_j).\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        ans = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But note: the provided code has already read the volumes and computed `t_min` (which is the minimum time required if we can use arbitrarily many pipes, which is the maximum over i of ceil(s[i]/i)).\n\n   And then for each query, if the given time t_j is less than t_min, then it's impossible -> -1.\n\n   Otherwise, the answer is ceil(total_volume / t_j) = (total_volume + t_j - 1) // t_j.\n\n   However, note that the total_volume might be very large (up to 200,000 * 10^9 = 2e14), and t_j up to 10^9, so the division is safe.\n\n   Therefore, in program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        ans = (s + t_j - 1) // t_j\n\n   But wait, in the code, the variable `s` is the total_volume? \n\n   In the provided code, we have:\n\n        s = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n            ... \n\n        Then after the loop, s is the total_volume.\n\n   But then we have a list of queries.\n\n   However, note: the variable `s` is reused. After the loop, `s` is the total_volume.\n\n   But in the loop, we also have `t_min` computed.\n\n   Then in the for-loop for queries, we have:\n\n        for q in map(int, queries):\n            if q < t_min:\n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                ans = (s + q - 1) // q   # because q is the time for this query\n\n   But note: the variable `s` is the total_volume.\n\n   However, the variable `s` is defined in the outer scope. We must be cautious: the code reads:\n\n        _, volumes, _, *queries = stdin.readlines()\n        volumes = map(int, volumes.split())\n        queries = map(int, queries)\n\n        s = t_min = 0\n        for i, v in enumerate(volumes, 1):\n            s += v\n            div, mod = divmod(s, i)\n            t_min = max(t_min, div + (mod != 0))\n\n        res = []\n        for q in map(int, queries):\n            if q < t_min:\n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So after the for-loop, `s` is the total_volume.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n   But note: q is the time for the query.\n\n   However, we must use integer arithmetic. Since s and q are integers, (s+q-1)//q is the ceiling of s/q.\n\n   But if s is 0, then we would get (0+q-1)//q = (q-1)//q = 0, which is correct.\n\n   But the problem says the volumes are at least 1, so s>=n>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we can do this.\n\n   Let me test with the example: \n        s=17, q=5 -> (17+5-1)//5 = 21//5 = 4 (since 21//5=4 in integer division).\n\n   Example: q=4 -> (17+4-1)//4 = 20//4=5.\n   Example: q=6 -> (17+6-1)//6 = 22//6 = 3 (because 22//6 is 3 in integer division).\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n   But note: the variable in the loop is `q` (which is the time for the query).\n\n   However, the code uses `q` as the variable for the query time.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        program1: the code for the elif block in the while loop in solve() in program1.py.\n        program2: the code for the else block in the query loop in program2.py.\n\n   In JSON format.\n\n   For program1.py: \n        \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n   For program2.py: \n        \"ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n   But note: in program2.py, the variable `s` is the total volume, and `q` is the query time.\n\n   However, the code in program2.py has a variable `queries` that we are iterating over, and the loop variable is `q`.\n\n   But in the provided code, the line is:\n\n        for q in map(int, queries):\n\n   So `q` is the time.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n          \"program2\": \"ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 code has to be exactly the code to put in the else block.\n\n   However, the program2 code has an indentation level. The else block is at the same level as the `ans = -1` above.\n\n   So we output the string exactly as the code.\n\n   But note: the program1 code has to be exactly the code to put in the `elif suma<sumb` block.\n\n   We output the string without the comment and without extra spaces? The existing code has 8 spaces for the block.\n\n   In program1, the existing code in the if and else blocks are indented by 8 spaces. So we output the three lines with 8 spaces each? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the block for the elif.\n\n   In the provided program1.py, the missing part is:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace that with:\n\n        a += 1\n        suma += arr[a]\n        cur += 1\n\n   But we must maintain the same indentation. The current TODO is indented by 8 spaces. So we output three lines, each with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   And the example output format is a JSON string with two strings: the completion for program1 and program2.\n\n   We output the string exactly as it should appear in the program, including newlines and indentation.\n\n   For program1, the existing code has:\n\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n            a += 1\n            suma += arr[a]\n            cur += 1\n\n   But note: the existing code has 12 spaces of indentation for the `elif` block? Actually, the code:\n\n    while True:\n        if a>=b: break\n        elif suma>sumb:\n            b-=1\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=1\n        elif suma<sumb:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else :\n            ans=cur\n            a+=1\n            b-=1\n            suma+=arr[a]\n            sumb+=arr[b]\n            cur+=2\n\n   The block under `elif suma>sumb` is indented by 8 spaces. Similarly, the block under `else` is 8 spaces.\n\n   So the missing block should be 8 spaces.\n\n   But the TODO is at the same level as the other commands, so 8 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n   The `        ` is 8 spaces.\n\n   For program2, the else block:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace with:\n\n        else:\n            ans = (s + q - 1) // q\n\n   But the existing code has the else at the same level as the if, and the TODO is indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n   The code:\n\n        if q < t_min:\n            ans = -1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n   But the code above in the if block is at 8 spaces: `ans = -1`.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n   without any extra spaces, because the else block should be at the same indentation level as the if block.\n\n   However, the code in the if block is at 8 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the entire block is:\n\n        for q in map(int, queries):\n            if q < t_min:\n                ans = -1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The for-loop is at 0 indentation, the if-else is at 4 spaces, and the bodies are at 8 spaces.\n\n   So the missing code should be at 8 spaces.\n\n   But the problem says: output only the missing code, so we output the line at 8 spaces? \n\n   However, the output format is a string. We output the string exactly as it should be inserted.\n\n   But the existing TODO is at 8 spaces. We replace it with a line at 8 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we output the string \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\" (with 8 spaces) for program2? \n\n   But note: the TODO is at 8 spaces, and we are replacing it with a line of code at 8 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify whether to include the indentation. But since the TODO is already there and we are replacing it, we only need the code without the comment.\n\n   But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block of code that is missing, which in this case is one line, and it should be at the same indentation level as the other statements in the block.\n\n   To be safe, we output the code with the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n   Since the if block has `ans = -1` at 8 spaces, we output the else block with one line at 8 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the string for program2 is: \"        ans = (s + q - 1) // q\"\n\n   But note: the code has a variable `s` and `q` defined.\n\n   Final answer."
