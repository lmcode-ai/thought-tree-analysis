Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2 while m:\n              m -= 1\n              data = input().split()\n              i = int(data[0])\n              x = int(data[1])\n              positions = []\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  positions.append(i-1)\n              if i <= n:\n                  positions.append(i)\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans -= (a[pos] ! = a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n              a[i] = x\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1])",

Since the if branch has \"e = m\" at 16 spaces, we do the same for the else branch. So the string for program2.py is: \"                s = m+1\" But how many spaces?

So when i is n, then we update a[n] and then the pair at index n: (a[n],a[n+1]) -> which is (x,0) -> which is different -> but the term is n*(n-n)=0. So it's safe. Also, when i=1: \n            positions: \n                i-1 = 0 -> skip\n                i=1 -> include -> so we update the pair at index1: (a[1],a[2])\n\n        Example: first query in the example: \n            n=5, base = 15. Initially, after the for loop, we computed ans = 14? But wait, the initial array was [1,2,3,4,5] -> then we set a[0]=0, a[6]=0. Then the initial adjacent contributions: \n                i=1: (1,2) -> different -> 1*4=4\n                i=2: (2,3) -> different -> 2*3=6\n                i=3: (3,4) -> different -> 3*2=6\n                i=4: (4,5) -> different -> 4*1=4\n                i=5: (5,0) -> different -> 5*0=0\n                total = 4+6+6+4 = 20? Then base+ans = 15+20 = 35? But the example says after the first query the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29. So the initial state (before any query) is not printed.",

But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once. \"\n\n        So with 2 lines, we have 2 triangles -> so for n=1: we need 2 lines? and for n=2: 2 lines. For n=3: we need 3 lines -> which gives 6 triangles? But the problem says: the third test case n=3 -> output 3. In our cnt: \n            cnt[3]=6 -> 3 lines give 6 triangles -> which is >=3. So the number of lines is the index of cnt? The array cnt is built for k=0,1,2,... (number of lines) and cnt[k] is the total number of triangles after k lines. Then for a test case n, we want the smallest k such that cnt[k] >= n.\n\n        The function solve(sn) does:\n\n            t = int(sn)\n            s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n            while s < e: m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: \n\n            return str(s) This is a binary search for the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t.\n\n        But note: the binary search as written:\n\n            if cnt[m] >= t: then we set e = m (so we are looking in [s, m]).\n            else: ... We need to set s to m+1? Standard lower_bound:\n\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    s = m+1\n\n        Then at the end, s is the first index such that cnt[s] >= t. So the TODO should be: s = m+1\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = m+1\n\n        But note: the initial s=0, e=len(cnt)-1. Example: \n            n=1: \n                cnt = [0,0,2,...] We are looking for the smallest k with cnt[k]>=1.\n\n                k=0: 0<1 -> skip. k=1: 0<1 -> skip. k=2: 2>=1 -> so we want k=2. Binary search:\n\n                  s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (which is at least 2 at the beginning? because we built until 10^9)\n\n                  m = (0+2)//2 = 1 -> cnt[1]=0 <1 -> so we set s = 1+1 = 2.\n                  then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\n            n=3:\n                s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (>=3)\n                m = (0+3)//2 = 1 -> cnt[1]=0<3 -> s=2. then m=(2+3)//2=2 -> cnt[2]=2<3 -> s=3. then s=3, e=3 -> break -> return 3.\n\n            n=2: m0 = (0+last)//2 -> then eventually we get to m=1: 0<2 -> s=2. then check m=2: cnt[2]=2>=2 -> e=2. then s=2, e=2 -> return 2. So it matches. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = m+1\n\n        So we replace the TODO with: s = m+1\n\n        But note: the code in the function solve:\n\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1 if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    s = m+1 This is the standard binary search for the first index >= t. So that's it. Summary:\n\n   For program1.py: We add base = n*(n+1)//2 above the while loop, and then the while loop block. For program2.py:\n        We add: s = m+1 in the else branch. But note: the output format is a json:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nWe must output the missing code as a string for each. But note: the missing code for program1.py includes the base line and the entire while block? But the existing code for program1.py already has:\n\n   while(m):\n        # TODO:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe initial array is given, and there are m queries that update an element.\n\nThe key observation is that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\nTherefore, the awesomeness for a subarray [l, r] is: 1 + (number of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i] != a[i+1]).\n\nThen the total sum over all contiguous subarrays is:\n  Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1])]\n\nWe can split this into two sums:\n  = (number of contiguous subarrays) + Sum_{l=1}^{n} Sum_{r=l}^{n} [ (# of indices i in [l, r-1] with a[i]!=a[i+1]) ]\n\nThe first part is the total number of contiguous subarrays = n*(n+1)//2.\n\nThe second part: note that each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different (i.e., a[i]!=a[i+1]) will be counted in every contiguous subarray that includes both i and i+1. \nHow many contiguous subarrays include both i and i+1? \n  The left end l can be any index from 1 to i, and the right end r can be any index from i+1 to n.\n  So the count is i * (n - i)   [if we index the array from 1 to n].\n\nBut note: the problem indexes the array from 1 to n. In our code, we have inserted a[0] and a[n+1] as 0 (to avoid index issues?).\n\nTherefore, the total contribution of a difference at position i (between a[i] and a[i+1]) is: \n  1 * (i) * (n - i)   [if they are different] and 0 if they are the same.\n\nSo the initial total answer is:\n   ans = n*(n+1)//2   [for the ones] \n        + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i) ]\n\nBut note: the problem states that the array is 1-indexed. However, in the code we have inserted a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. The array a has indices 0..n+1.\n\nIn the initial code, we have:\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n\nBut note: (n - (i+1) + 1) = n - i. And the term is multiplied by i. So that term is i*(n-i). However, the loop runs for i from 1 to n. \nBut the adjacent pairs we care about are from (1,2) to (n, n+1). However, note that a[n+1] is 0. So the last pair (a[n] and a[n+1]) is always different? \nBut wait, the problem says the array has n elements. The subarrays are only from 1 to n. The adjacent pairs we need are from i=1 to i=n-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: the array a has length n. Then we inserted 0 at the beginning and at the end. So now we have:\n   a[0] = 0, a[1..n] = the original, a[n+1]=0.\n\nIn the initial loop, for i from 1 to n:\n   We are checking a[i] and a[i+1]. \n   For i = n: we check a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0). Since a[n] is at least 1, this will be different -> contributes n*(n-n) = n*0 = 0? \n   Actually: (n - (n+1) + 1) = n - n = 0? So it's 0. \n\nBut wait: the formula for the adjacent pair at i (which is between a[i] and a[i+1]) should be counted for the entire segment that includes both. \nThe segment that includes both i and i+1: for the pair (i, i+1) we require l<=i and r>=i+1. \n   The left end can be from 1 to i -> i choices.\n   The right end can be from i+1 to n -> (n - i) choices.\n\nSo the contribution is i*(n-i). \n\nBut in the initial code, for i=1 to n, we are doing:\n   (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (n - (i+1) + 1) * i \n   = (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i\n\nThis matches for i from 1 to n. However, note that the adjacent pairs we care about are only from 1 to n-1? \nBut the pair (n, n+1) is not part of the original array? However, the subarray [n] does not include a[n+1]. The subarray [n, n] is just [a_n] and does not involve a[n+1]. \nBut the adjacent pair (n, n+1) is never part of any contiguous subarray? Because the contiguous subarray ending at n does not include n+1. \n\nTherefore, the initial code is including an extra pair: the one between a[n] and a[n+1]. But note that the term for i=n: \n   (a[n]!=a[n+1]) * (n - n) * n = (some non-zero) * 0 * n = 0.\n\nSo it's safe. \n\nBut what about the pair (0, a1)? \n   i=0: we are not looping over 0. \n\nSo the initial code only considers pairs (a1,a2), (a2,a3), ... (a_n, a_{n+1]). The last one is (a_n,0) and it contributes 0. So it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the initial total answer is computed as:\n   ans = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - i) * i \n\nBut note: the total answer should also include the base part: the number of contiguous subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nWait, the problem: the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 + (# of adjacent differences in [l, r-1]). \nBut note: the base part is 1 for every contiguous subarray. So we have to add the total number of contiguous subarrays.\n\nSo we must add: n*(n+1)//2.\n\nBut the initial code does not do that? \n\nLooking at the example: \n   n=5, after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5] -> the answer is 29.\n\nTotal number of contiguous subarrays = 15.\n\nThen we need to add the contributions from adjacent differences.\n\nAdjacent pairs (from index1 to index2, index2 to index3, ... index4 to index5):\n   (1,2): different -> contribution: 1*(5-1) = 1*4 = 4\n   (2,2): same -> 0\n   (2,4): different -> 3*(5-3)=3*2=6\n   (4,5): different -> 4*(5-4)=4*1=4\n\nTotal from differences = 4+6+4 = 14.\n\nThen total = 15 (from the ones) + 14 = 29.\n\nSo we must add the base part.\n\nTherefore, we should initialize:\n   ans = n*(n+1)//2   [for the base 1 in every subarray] \n        + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i) ]\n\nBut note: in the initial code, the loop runs for i=1 to n, and the last term (i=n) is 0. So we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   for i in range(1, n):\n        base += (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nBut wait, the initial code does the loop for i=1 to n. However, the last term (i=n) is 0. So we can do the base and then the loop for i=1 to n? \n\nActually, the initial code does not have the base. So we must add it.\n\nBut the problem says: the initial array is given. Then we process m queries.\n\nSo we should start by:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.insert(0, 0)\n   a.append(0)\n\n   total_subarrays = n*(n+1)//2\n   ans = total_subarrays   # because each subarray has at least 1\n\n   # Then we add the contributions from adjacent pairs: for each adjacent pair i (from 1 to n-1) and also the last one (n) which will be 0.\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # This term: (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n        ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * i * (n - i)\n\nBut note: the example in the code does not have the base? \n\nIn the provided code snippet, they initialize ans=0 and then in the loop they add only the adjacent contributions. \n\nSo we must adjust: we need to add the base.\n\nBut the example output after the first query is 29. Without the base, the adjacent contributions are 14. So we must have 15 (base) + 14 = 29.\n\nTherefore, we should add the base.\n\nHowever, the provided code does not have the base. So we must fix the initial ans to be total_subarrays.\n\nBut the problem says: the initial array is given and then we process m queries. \n\nSo let me recalc the initial ans:\n\n   base = total_subarrays = 15\n   then add adjacent contributions: \n        i=1: (a1 != a2) -> 1 and 2: 1 != 2 -> True -> 1*4 = 4\n        i=2: (a2 != a3) -> 2 and 2 -> False -> 0\n        i=3: (a3 != a4) -> 2 and 4 -> True -> 3*2 = 6\n        i=4: (a4 != a5) -> 4 and 5 -> True -> 4*1 = 4\n        i=5: (a5 != a6) -> 5 and 0 -> True -> 5*(5-5)=5*0=0\n   total = 15 + 4+0+6+4+0 = 29.\n\nSo we must set:\n   ans = n*(n+1)//2   [which is 15] \n   then add for i in range(1, n+1): ... \n\nBut the provided code initializes ans=0 and then does the loop. So we are missing the base.\n\nTherefore, we must change the initial code to include the base.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are to complete the code. We cannot change the existing code arbitrarily? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.insert(0, 0)\n   a.append(0)\n   ans = 0 \n   for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i + 1) + 1) * i \n\n   while(m):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe see that the initial ans is computed without the base. \n\nSo we must fix the initial ans by adding the base. But we are allowed to complete the code? \n\nWe are only allowed to output the missing code? \n\nThe missing code is in the while(m) loop and possibly we can adjust the initial ans? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are not supposed to change the existing code. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". \n\nBut the example output for the first query is 29. Without the base, the initial ans is 14. Then we must add the base at some point? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the base is constant: it is always n*(n+1)//2. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   ans = base + ... \n\nBut the existing code sets ans=0 and then adds the adjacent contributions. \n\nSo we can change the initial ans to:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   for i in ...: \n        base += ... \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nAlternatively, we can add the base at the beginning and then update the adjacent contributions as we process the queries. \n\nBut the existing code does not have the base. \n\nWe are allowed to complete the code? We are only to fill in the TODO. \n\nBut the TODO is inside the while(m) loop. \n\nHow to handle the queries?\n\nWe note that the total answer = base (which is n*(n+1)//2) + contributions from adjacent pairs.\n\nThe contributions from adjacent pairs: for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) we have a term: \n   term_i = (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\nWhen we update an element at position i (1-indexed), it can affect at most three adjacent pairs:\n   (i-1, i), (i, i+1), (i+1, i+2) [if they exist]\n\nSo we need to:\n   - Remove the old contributions of the adjacent pairs that are affected (if they were different, then subtract the term)\n   - Update the array a at position i to x.\n   - Add the new contributions of the adjacent pairs that are affected (if they become different, then add the term)\n\nThen we output the new total ans.\n\nBut note: the base is constant and does not change.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   Let base = n*(n+1)//2   [this is constant]\n\n   We maintain a variable 'ans' that is the sum of the adjacent contributions.\n\n   Then total_answer = base + ans.\n\nBut the existing code uses the variable 'ans' for the adjacent contributions. And we have already computed the initial adjacent contributions.\n\nHowever, we are missing the base in the initial total. \n\nSo we must adjust: we can either:\n\n   Option 1: Change the initial computation to include base? But we are not allowed to change existing code? \n\n   Option 2: In the output for each query, we add the base to the variable we are printing? \n\nBut the problem says: after each query print the answer.\n\nWe are going to update the adjacent contributions and then print base + ans.\n\nBut the initial code does not have the base. So we must remember to add base when printing.\n\nHowever, the initial state: we have computed the adjacent contributions and stored in 'ans'. Then we have not printed the initial state? \n\nThe problem says: after each query print the answer. There are m queries, so we print m lines.\n\nBut what about the initial state? The problem says: \"after each query\", meaning after the first update, then after the second, etc. \n\nThe initial array is given, and then the first query is an update. So we must output the answer after the first update, then after the second, etc.\n\nBut note: the initial array is given and then we process the first query. The first query updates the array and then we output the answer for the updated array.\n\nSo we do not need to output the initial state? \n\nThe problem: \"After each query print the answer\"\n\nSo we have m queries, and we output m lines.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2   [constant]\n\n   # Compute initial adjacent contributions in 'ans'\n   ans = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        ans += (a[i]!=a[i+1]) * i * (n-i)\n\n   # Then for each query, we update the adjacent pairs and then output base+ans.\n\nBut the existing code does not have base. So we can define base at the beginning? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we are only to fill in the TODO block.\n\nSo we cannot change the existing code. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute base at the beginning and then in the while loop, when we update, we adjust the adjacent contributions and then print base+ans.\n\nBut we are allowed to add code above the while loop? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and the TODO is in the while loop.\n\nBut note: the existing code does not have the base. So we must add the base to the output.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n   ... existing code to compute initial adjacent contributions in ans ...\n\n   Then in the while loop, we update the adjacent contributions and then print base+ans.\n\nBut we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\nAlternatively, we can compute base in the while loop? \n\nBut base is constant. \n\nWe can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2   # we can add this line above the while loop? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nWe are to complete the code. We are allowed to add code in the TODO block and also above the while loop? \n\nBut the TODO is inside the while loop. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can add a block above the while loop? \n\nBut the existing code does not have base. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute base once and then use it in the while loop. \n\nWe can add:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n\nright after the for loop? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nWe are to output the entire missing code for program1.py? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo we are to write the missing code for program1.py as a string for the value of \"program1\".\n\nWe can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2   # add this after the for loop and before the while loop? \n\n   Then in the while loop, we update the adjacent pairs and then print base+ans.\n\nBut the existing code has:\n\n   ans = 0 \n   for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        ans += (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (n - (i + 1) + 1) * i \n\n   while(m):\n\nSo we can add:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n   while(m):\n        # read the query\n        # update the array and the adjacent contributions for the three pairs\n        # then print(base+ans)\n\nBut note: the existing variable 'ans' is the sum of adjacent contributions. \n\nSo the plan for the while loop:\n\n   For each query (m times):\n\n        i, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n        We are updating the element at position i (1-indexed). In our array a, the element at index i (0-indexed we have a[0]=0, then a[1] is the first element, so the element at position i is at a[i]).\n\n        The update: set a[i] = x.\n\n        The adjacent pairs that change are:\n            (i-1, i) -> index i-1 and i (if i>=2)\n            (i, i+1) -> index i and i+1 (if i<=n-1)\n            (i+1, i+2) -> actually, the pair (i, i+1) and (i+1, i+2) are independent? \n                   But note: the pair (i, i+1) is at index i (in our loop index i for the pair (a[i],a[i+1])).\n                   The pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1.\n\n        However, the update at position i affects:\n            the pair (i-1, i): which is the adjacent pair at index i-1 (if i-1>=1) \n            the pair (i, i+1): which is the adjacent pair at index i (if i<=n)\n\n        It does not affect the pair (i+1, i+2) because that pair is (a[i+1] and a[i+2]) and we are not changing a[i+1] or a[i+2]? \n\n        But wait: if we update a[i], then the pair (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) change. The pair (i+1, i+2) is (a[i+1] and a[i+2]) and is unchanged.\n\n        However, note: if we update a[i], then the pair (i, i+1) is between a[i] (which is updated) and a[i+1] (which is unchanged). \n        Similarly, the pair (i-1, i) is between a[i-1] (unchanged) and a[i] (updated).\n\n        So we need to update the adjacent pairs at indices: i-1 and i.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let positions = [i-1, i]   (but note: i-1 must be at least 1, and i must be at most n? because our pairs are from index1 to index n)\n\n          For each pos in [i-1, i]:\n               First, we remove the old contribution of the pair at pos: \n                   old_contrib = (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n                   ans -= old_contrib\n\n          Then update a[i] = x.\n\n          Then for each pos in [i-1, i]:\n               new_contrib = (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n               ans += new_contrib\n\n          Then print(base+ans)\n\n        But note: if i==1, then i-1=0 -> we skip because our pairs are from index1 to n (and our array a has indices 0..n+1, but the pair at index0: (a0, a1) is not considered? because our loop was from 1 to n). \n\n        Actually, the adjacent pairs we consider are for indices 1 to n. \n          The pair at index1: (a1, a2)\n          The pair at index2: (a2, a3)\n          ... \n          The pair at index n: (a[n], a[n+1]) -> but we know that the term for n is 0.\n\n        So for an update at position i (1-indexed), we need to update the pairs at:\n          pos = i-1: if i-1>=1 (so i>=2) -> because the pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1.\n          pos = i: if i<=n -> because the pair (i, i+1) is at index i.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n          positions = []\n          if i >= 2: positions.append(i-1)\n          if i <= n-1: positions.append(i)   # because the pair (i, i+1) is at index i, and i must be at most n-1? \n          But note: the pair at index i: (a[i], a[i+1]) -> if i is n, then we have a[n] and a[n+1] (which is 0) and the term is 0. So we can include i even if i==n? \n\n          However, the term for i=n: (a[n]!=a[n+1]) * n * (n-n) = ... *0 =0. So it doesn't matter.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            positions = []\n            if i >= 1:   # we are updating at i, then the pair at index i-1 (if exists) and at index i (if exists) \n                # but note: the pair at index i-1: requires i-1>=1 and i-1<=n -> so i>=2 and i-1<=n -> which is always true for i>=2 and i<=n+1? but i is at least 1 and at most n.\n                # Similarly, the pair at index i: requires i>=1 and i<=n.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                positions = []\n                if i-1 >= 1:   # then the pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1\n                    positions.append(i-1)\n                if i <= n:      # then the pair (i, i+1) is at index i\n                    positions.append(i)\n\n          But note: i is between 1 and n (inclusive). So:\n            if i==1: then i-1=0 -> skip, and i<=n -> true -> so positions = [1] (but wait: the pair at index1 is (a1, a2) and we updated a1, so we need to update the pair (1,2) which is at index1? \n            Actually, the pair (1,2) is at index1? \n\n          How do we index the pairs? \n            The pair between a1 and a2 is at index1? \n            In our loop, the pair at index1: i=1 -> (a[1], a[2])\n\n          So for an update at position i=1: \n            We need to update the pair at index1? -> which is the pair (a1, a2). \n            Also, the pair at index0? -> but we don't have that.\n\n          Therefore, we update:\n            positions = [i]   for the pair (i, i+1) and also if i>=2 then we update the pair at i-1.\n\n          But note: the update at position i=1 does not affect a pair at index0? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n            positions = []\n            if i >= 2: \n                positions.append(i-1)\n            if i <= n:\n                positions.append(i)\n\n          Then for each pos in positions:\n               ans -= (old value of the pair at pos) \n               then update the array at the updated position? \n               then ans += (new value of the pair at pos)\n\n          However, note: we are updating a[i] to x. So we must update the array first? \n\n          Actually, we need the old values to remove the contributions, then update the array, then add the new contributions.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            # Store the current a[i] if needed? We are going to update it to x.\n\n            # The adjacent pairs that we are updating: we need the old state of the pairs.\n\n            # For each position in the list of indices (positions) that we are going to update:\n\n            for pos in [i-1, i] (if they are in [1, n]):\n\n                # Remove the current contribution of the pair at pos: \n                ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n            # Then update a[i] = x\n            a[i] = x\n\n            for pos in [i-1, i] (if they are in [1, n]):\n\n                ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n            # Then print(base+ans)\n\n        But note: the pair at index i-1: we are using a[i] which we just updated? \n          In the second loop, we use the new a[i]. \n\n        Similarly, the pair at index i: we use a[i] (updated) and a[i+1] (which is unchanged).\n\n        And for the pair at index i-1: we use a[i-1] (unchanged) and a[i] (updated).\n\n        So that is correct.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the array a is 0-indexed? \n\n        The problem: the array a was read and then we inserted 0 at the beginning and appended 0 at the end. \n        So the element at position i (1-indexed) is at a[i] (0-indexed index i).\n\n        The update: we are given i (1-indexed) and x. So we set a[i] = x.\n\n        Example: \n            n=5, m=?\n            Initially: a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 0]\n\n            Query: i=3, x=2 -> but wait, a[3] is already 2? \n\n            But the problem: the first query: \n                Input: \n                  5 3\n                  1 2 3 4 5\n                Then the first query: \"1 1\" -> so i=1, x=1 -> but a[1] is already 1? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n            The initial array is [1,2,3,4,5]. Then the first query: i=3, x=2 -> so we set the third element to 2.\n\n            So the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n        Therefore, we must update a[i] to x.\n\n        Steps for the while loop:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2   # we must define base somewhere.\n\n          But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n          We can define base at the beginning of the while loop? But that would be inefficient? \n\n          Alternatively, we can define base above the while loop.\n\n        How about we add:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n        right after the for loop and before the while loop? \n\n        Then the while loop:\n\n          while m:\n              m -= 1\n              data = input().split()\n              if not data: \n                  continue\n              i = int(data[0])\n              x = int(data[1])\n\n              # The positions to update: \n              positions = set()\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  positions.add(i-1)\n              if i <= n:\n                  positions.add(i)\n\n              # Remove the contributions for these positions\n              for pos in positions:\n                  # The current contribution of the pair at pos: (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n                  ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n              # Update the array at position i\n              a[i] = x\n\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n              # Then output the total answer = base + ans\n              print(base+ans)\n\n        But note: the problem says the array a has been extended to have a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. So when i is n, then we update a[n] and then the pair at index n: (a[n],a[n+1]) -> which is (x,0) -> which is different -> but the term is n*(n-n)=0. So it's safe.\n\n        Also, when i=1: \n            positions: \n                i-1 = 0 -> skip\n                i=1 -> include -> so we update the pair at index1: (a[1],a[2])\n\n        Example: first query in the example: \n            n=5, base = 15.\n            Initially, after the for loop, we computed ans = 14? \n            But wait, the initial array was [1,2,3,4,5] -> then we set a[0]=0, a[6]=0.\n\n            Then the initial adjacent contributions: \n                i=1: (1,2) -> different -> 1*4=4\n                i=2: (2,3) -> different -> 2*3=6\n                i=3: (3,4) -> different -> 3*2=6\n                i=4: (4,5) -> different -> 4*1=4\n                i=5: (5,0) -> different -> 5*0=0\n                total = 4+6+6+4 = 20? \n\n            Then base+ans = 15+20 = 35? \n\n            But the example says after the first query the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29.\n\n            So the initial state (before any query) is not printed. \n\n            The first query: update a[3] to 2.\n\n            So we update i=3, x=2.\n\n            The positions: \n                i=3: \n                  positions: \n                    i-1 = 2 -> valid (since 2>=1) -> so update pair at index2: (a2, a3) -> which is (2,3) -> becomes (2,2) -> same.\n                    i=3 -> valid -> update pair at index3: (a3, a4) -> which was (3,4) -> becomes (2,4) -> different.\n\n            Before update: \n                For index2: (a2, a3) = (2,3) -> different -> contribution = 2*3=6 -> remove 6.\n                For index3: (a3, a4) = (3,4) -> different -> contribution = 3*2=6 -> remove 6.\n\n            Then set a[3]=2.\n\n            Then:\n                index2: (2,2) -> same -> contribution=0 -> add 0.\n                index3: (2,4) -> different -> contribution=3*2=6 -> add 6.\n\n            So the change: ans = 20 -6-6 +0+6 = 14.\n\n            Then total = base+ans = 15+14=29.\n\n            Then we output 29.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        But note: the initial state of the array is [1,2,3,4,5] and we computed the adjacent contributions as 20. \n        Then the first query updates and we get 14.\n\n        However, the problem does not require the initial state? Only after each query.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But what about the next queries? \n\n        The problem says: there are m queries.\n\n        We must do m times.\n\n        We are using while(m): and then m-=1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n               ...\n\n        But the existing code has while(m): \n\n        We can do:\n\n          while m:\n              m -= 1\n              ... \n\n        So we decrement m.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2   # we add this line\n\n          while m:\n              m -= 1\n              data = input().split()\n              i = int(data[0]); x = int(data[1])\n\n              # List of adjacent pairs to update: indices i-1 and i (if they are in the range [1, n])\n              positions = []\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  positions.append(i-1)\n              if i <= n:\n                  positions.append(i)\n\n              # Remove the old contributions\n              for pos in positions:\n                  # The current state of the pair at pos\n                  ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n              # Update the array\n              a[i] = x\n\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n\n              # Print the total answer for this query\n              print(base + ans)\n\n        But note: the problem says the array a was defined with a[0]=0 and a[n+1]=0. And we are updating a[i] for i in [1, n]. \n\n        However, we must be cautious: the array a is 0-indexed. The element at position i (1-indexed) is at index i in the list a.\n\n        Example: a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0] for n=5. \n            a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=2, a[3]=3, a[4]=4, a[5]=5, a[6]=0.\n\n        So updating a[i] where i is the given index (1-indexed) is at a[i] (0-indexed).\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: n, m up to 10^5. We are updating at most 2 pairs per query, so it's O(1) per query.\n\n        We must be cautious: the input might be large, so we use sys.stdin.readline.\n\n        We already have: input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, the example: the first query: i=3, x=2 -> we update a[3] to 2.\n\n        But note: the array a: \n            Initially: a[3] = 3 (for the array [0,1,2,3,4,5,0])\n            Then we set a[3]=2.\n\n        Then the array becomes: [0,1,2,2,4,5,0]\n\n        Then the adjacent pairs:\n            index1: (1,2) -> different -> 1*4=4\n            index2: (2,2) -> same -> 0\n            index3: (2,4) -> different -> 3*2=6\n            index4: (4,5) -> different -> 4*1=4\n            index5: (5,0) -> different -> 0\n            total adjacent contributions = 4+0+6+4+0 = 14 -> base+ans=15+14=29.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          while m:\n              m -= 1\n              data = input().split()\n              i = int(data[0])\n              x = int(data[1])\n              positions = []\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  positions.append(i-1)\n              if i <= n:\n                  positions.append(i)\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n              a[i] = x\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n-pos)\n              print(base+ans)\n\n        But note: the existing code has a while(m): and we are going to replace the TODO with the above? \n\n        We must be careful: the existing code has:\n\n          while(m):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the above block, but without the base=...? \n\n        But we added base above the while loop. \n\n        So the entire block for program1.py missing code is:\n\n          base = n*(n+1)//2\n          while m:\n              m -= 1\n              i, x = map(int, input().split())\n              # We'll create a list of adjacent indices to update: i-1 and i (if in [1, n])\n              positions = []\n              if i-1 >= 1:\n                  positions.append(i-1)\n              if i <= n:\n                  positions.append(i)\n              # Remove the old contributions for these positions\n              for pos in positions:\n                  # The current state of the pair at pos\n                  ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n              # Update the array\n              a[i] = x\n              for pos in positions:\n                  ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n              print(base + ans)\n\n        But note: the existing variable m is the number of queries. We decrement m until 0.\n\n        We can also use:\n\n          for _ in range(m):\n              ... \n\n        But the existing code uses while(m): so we do m-=1.\n\n        We'll use the above.\n\n        However, note: the example input has the first query: \"3 2\", so i=3, x=2.\n\n        But the problem says: the first query: \"i x\" meaning update the i-th element to x.\n\n        We read i and x.\n\n        We use: i, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n        But the existing code: we have input = sys.stdin.readline.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the array a is global? We are updating it.\n\n        Yes.\n\n        So that's program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe problem: \n   We are to add straight lines (parallel to the edges of the hexagons) to create equilateral triangles. \n   We are given t test cases, each with an integer n (up to 10^9) and we must output the minimum number of lines needed to have at least n triangles.\n\nThe code provided:\n\n   import sys\n   ctr = [0, 0, 0]\n   cnt = [0]\n\n   while cnt[-1] < 10**9:\n        i = ctr.index(min(ctr))\n        cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n        ctr[i] += 1\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        return str(s)\n\n   inp = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   inp.pop(0)\n\n   print('\\n'.join(map(solve, inp)))\n\nWe see that the code precomputes an array 'cnt' such that for a given number of lines (which is the index of cnt) we have the total number of triangles created.\n\nThe while loop: \n   ctr = [0,0,0]   # three directions? \n   cnt = [0]   # with 0 lines, 0 triangles.\n\n   Then while the last element of cnt is less than 10^9, we do:\n        i = index of the minimum value in ctr (if multiple, the first index)\n        new_triangles = 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i])\n        then append cnt[-1] + new_triangles to cnt\n        then increment ctr[i] by 1.\n\nWhat does this do? \n\nNote: the note says: after adding the first line, no triangles. After the second line, two triangles. \n\nSo for 0 lines: 0 triangles -> cnt[0]=0.\n   Then we start:\n\n   Step1: \n        ctr = [0,0,0] -> min is 0, i=0.\n        new_triangles = 2*(0+0+0 - 0) = 0.\n        cnt.append(0+0)=0 -> cnt=[0,0]\n        ctr[0] becomes 1 -> ctr=[1,0,0]\n\n   Step2:\n        ctr=[1,0,0] -> min=0 at i=1.\n        new_triangles = 2*(1+0+0 - 0) = 2*1=2.\n        cnt.append(0+2)=2 -> cnt=[0,0,2]\n        ctr[1] becomes 1 -> ctr=[1,1,0]\n\n   Step3:\n        ctr=[1,1,0] -> min=0 at i=2.\n        new_triangles = 2*(1+1+0 - 0)=2*2=4.\n        cnt.append(2+4)=6 -> cnt=[0,0,2,6]\n        ctr[2] becomes 1 -> ctr=[1,1,1]\n\n   Step4:\n        ctr=[1,1,1] -> min=1, i=0.\n        new_triangles = 2*(1+1+1 - 1)=2*(2)=4.\n        cnt.append(6+4)=10 -> cnt=[0,0,2,6,10]\n        ctr[0] becomes 2 -> ctr=[2,1,1]\n\n   Step5:\n        ctr=[2,1,1] -> min=1 at i=1 (or i=2, but we take the first) -> i=1.\n        new_triangles = 2*(2+1+1 - 1)=2*(3)=6.\n        cnt.append(10+6)=16 -> [0,0,2,6,10,16]\n\n   Step6:\n        ctr=[2,2,1] -> min=1 at i=2.\n        new_triangles = 2*(2+2+1 - 1)=2*(4)=8.\n        cnt.append(16+8)=24.\n\n   Step7:\n        ctr=[2,2,2] -> min=2 -> i=0.\n        new_triangles = 2*(2+2+2 - 2)=2*4=8.\n        cnt.append(24+8)=32.\n\n   Step8:\n        ctr=[3,2,2] -> min=2 -> i=1 (or i=2) -> i=1.\n        new_triangles = 2*(3+2+2 - 2)=2*5=10.\n        cnt.append(32+10)=42.\n\n   ...\n\n   The problem: for n=1,2: output 2; for n=3: output 3.\n\n   In our cnt:\n        cnt[0]=0 -> 0 lines -> 0 triangles -> not enough for n=1,2,3.\n        cnt[1]=0 -> 1 line -> 0 triangles -> not enough.\n        cnt[2]=2 -> 2 lines -> 2 triangles -> enough for n=1 and n=2? \n        But the problem says: for n=1 and n=2, we need 2 lines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\"\n\n        So with 2 lines, we have 2 triangles -> so for n=1: we need 2 lines? and for n=2: 2 lines.\n\n        For n=3: we need 3 lines -> which gives 6 triangles? \n\n        But the problem says: the third test case n=3 -> output 3.\n\n        In our cnt: \n            cnt[3]=6 -> 3 lines give 6 triangles -> which is >=3.\n\n        So the number of lines is the index of cnt? \n\n        The array cnt is built for k=0,1,2,... (number of lines) and cnt[k] is the total number of triangles after k lines.\n\n        Then for a test case n, we want the smallest k such that cnt[k] >= n.\n\n        The function solve(sn) does:\n\n            t = int(sn)\n            s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    # TODO: \n\n            return str(s)\n\n        This is a binary search for the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t.\n\n        But note: the binary search as written:\n\n            if cnt[m] >= t: then we set e = m (so we are looking in [s, m]).\n            else: ... \n\n        We need to set s to m+1? \n\n        Standard lower_bound:\n\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s+e)//2\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    s = m+1\n\n        Then at the end, s is the first index such that cnt[s] >= t.\n\n        So the TODO should be: s = m+1\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = m+1\n\n        But note: the initial s=0, e=len(cnt)-1.\n\n        Example: \n            n=1: \n                cnt = [0,0,2,...] \n                We are looking for the smallest k with cnt[k]>=1.\n\n                k=0: 0<1 -> skip.\n                k=1: 0<1 -> skip.\n                k=2: 2>=1 -> so we want k=2.\n\n                Binary search:\n\n                  s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (which is at least 2 at the beginning? because we built until 10^9)\n\n                  m = (0+2)//2 = 1 -> cnt[1]=0 <1 -> so we set s = 1+1 = 2.\n                  then s=2, e=2 -> break -> return 2.\n\n            n=3:\n                s=0, e=len(cnt)-1 (>=3)\n                m = (0+3)//2 = 1 -> cnt[1]=0<3 -> s=2.\n                then m=(2+3)//2=2 -> cnt[2]=2<3 -> s=3.\n                then s=3, e=3 -> break -> return 3.\n\n            n=2: \n                m0 = (0+last)//2 -> then eventually we get to m=1: 0<2 -> s=2.\n                then check m=2: cnt[2]=2>=2 -> e=2.\n                then s=2, e=2 -> return 2.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            s = m+1\n\n        So we replace the TODO with: s = m+1\n\n        But note: the code in the function solve:\n\n            while s < e:\n                m = (s + e) >> 1\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    s = m+1\n\n        This is the standard binary search for the first index >= t.\n\n        So that's it.\n\nSummary:\n\n   For program1.py: \n        We add base = n*(n+1)//2 above the while loop, and then the while loop block.\n\n   For program2.py:\n        We add: s = m+1 in the else branch.\n\nBut note: the output format is a json:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nWe must output the missing code as a string for each.\n\nBut note: the missing code for program1.py includes the base line and the entire while block? \n\nBut the existing code for program1.py already has:\n\n   while(m):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the block. But note: the base line is above the while loop.\n\nSo the entire missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        i, x = map(int, input().split())\n        positions = []\n        if i-1 >= 1:\n            positions.append(i-1)\n        if i <= n:\n            positions.append(i)\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        a[i] = x\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        print(base + ans)\n\nBut note: the existing code has the while(m): and we are to replace the TODO with the above block? \n\nActually, the existing code has:\n\n   while(m):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the above block (without the base line? because the base line is above the while). \n\nBut the base line must be added. So we add it above the while loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the base line to the end of the while loop? \n\nBut note: the existing code has the while(m): so we are only to fill the body? \n\nBut we are adding a line above the while loop. \n\nWe are allowed to complete the code. The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nWe can consider the missing block for program1.py as:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nBut the existing code has the while(m): so we are replacing the entire while loop? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   for _ in range(m):\n        ... \n\nBut the existing code has while(m): so we must use while(m): and decrement m.\n\nWe'll output the entire block as above.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is a single line: \"s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: the TODO is inside the else branch.\n\nSo the entire missing code for program2.py is: \"s = m+1\"\n\nBut we must output as a string. We must be cautious about newlines and indentation.\n\nFor program1.py, we output:\n\n   \"base = n*(n+1)//2\\nwhile m:\\n    m -= 1\\n    i, x = map(int, input().split())\\n    positions = []\\n    if i-1 >= 1:\\n        positions.append(i-1)\\n    if i <= n:\\n        positions.append(i)\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    a[i] = x\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    print(base + ans)\"\n\nBut note: the existing code has a while(m): and we are replacing the TODO with the above block? \n\nActually, the existing code has:\n\n   while(m): \n        # TODO: ...\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the body of the while loop. But we are also adding a line above the while loop.\n\nSo the missing block for program1.py is the base line and the entire while loop body? \n\nBut the while loop condition is already there. \n\nWe are to complete the code so that the entire program runs correctly.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nBut the existing code has the while(m): so we are replacing the while(m) block.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   for _ in range(m):\n        ... \n\nBut that would change the loop.\n\nWe'll stick to the while(m) and decrement m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        i, x = map(int, input().split())\n        positions = []\n        if i-1 >= 1:\n            positions.append(i-1)\n        if i <= n:\n            positions.append(i)\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        a[i] = x\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        print(base + ans)\n\nBut note: the existing code has the while(m): and we are replacing the TODO with the above block? \n\nActually, the existing code has:\n\n   while(m): \n        # TODO: ...\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with the above block (without the base line) and then we add the base line above? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nWe are to output the entire missing block for program1.py? \n\nWe can output:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nBut the existing code already has the while(m): condition. \n\nWe are only to fill the body? \n\nBut the base line is above the while loop. \n\nWe must include the base line because the existing code does not have it.\n\nTherefore, we output the base line and the entire while loop body (which is the block that we have).\n\nBut note: the existing code has the while(m): so we are not to repeat the condition? \n\nWe are to output the code that goes in the place of the TODO? \n\nBut the TODO is inside the while(m): and we are adding a line above the while(m):.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\".\n\nWe are to make the program run correctly. \n\nWe'll output the base line and then the entire while loop block (with the condition replaced by a body that does the work and decrements m).\n\nBut the existing code has:\n\n   while(m): \n        # TODO: ...\n\nWe are replacing the entire while loop? \n\nWe can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   for _ in range(m):\n        ... \n\nBut that would be more efficient? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nBut the existing condition is while(m): which is equivalent to while m>0:.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nBut note: the existing code has the while(m): so we are replacing the while loop with a new one? \n\nWe are allowed to do so? \n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\nWe'll output the entire block for program1.py as:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        i, x = map(int, input().split())\n        positions = []\n        if i-1 >= 1:\n            positions.append(i-1)\n        if i <= n:\n            positions.append(i)\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        a[i] = x\n        for pos in positions:\n            ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\n        print(base + ans)\n\nFor program2.py, we output:\n\n   s = m+1\n\nBut note: the indentation. \n\nIn the function solve, the else branch:\n\n   else:\n        s = m+1\n\nSo we output: \"    s = m+1\" (with 4 spaces of indentation) or one tab? \n\nBut the existing code uses spaces? \n\nWe'll use 4 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"    s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n   else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with \"s = m+1\", and we must indent it.\n\nSo the string for program2.py is: \"    s = m+1\"\n\nBut to be safe, we can output the exact line.\n\nNow, we output the json.\n\nExample:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"base = n*(n+1)//2\\nwhile m:\\n    m -= 1\\n    i, x = map(int, input().split())\\n    positions = []\\n    if i-1 >= 1:\\n        positions.append(i-1)\\n    if i <= n:\\n        positions.append(i)\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    a[i] = x\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    print(base + ans)\", \"program2\": \"    s = m+1\"}\n\nBut note: in the for loops in program1.py, we have:\n\n   for pos in positions:\n        ans -= ... \n\nWe must indent the body. We'll use 4 spaces per indent.\n\nBut the existing code uses 4 spaces? \n\nWe'll assume 4 spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without newlines? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code as a string. We can use \\n for newlines.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n   program1_str = \"base = n*(n+1)//2\\nwhile m:\\n    m -= 1\\n    i, x = map(int, input().split())\\n    positions = []\\n    if i-1 >= 1:\\n        positions.append(i-1)\\n    if i <= n:\\n        positions.append(i)\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    a[i] = x\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    print(base + ans)\"\n\n   program2_str = \"    s = m+1\"\n\nBut note: in the for loops, the body is indented by 4 more spaces. \n\nWe'll write:\n\n   for ...:\\n        ... \n\nwith 8 spaces for the inner body.\n\nBut the existing code in program1.py: the for loop in the initial computation is indented by 4 spaces, and the body by 8? \n\nWe'll match.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire block with the same indentation as the existing code.\n\nBut the existing code has:\n\n   for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        ans += ...   [4 spaces]\n\nSo we use 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, the while loop body: 4 spaces for the outer, then 8 for the inner.\n\nBut the base line is at the same level as the while.\n\nSo:\n\n   base = ...   [0 indent? but it should be at the same level as the existing code after the for loop]\n\nThe existing code:\n\n   n, m = ... \n   a = ...\n   ans = 0\n   for ...: \n        ... \n   while(m): \n        # TODO\n\nWe are adding base after the for loop and before the while, so at the same level as the while.\n\nThen the while loop body: each line indented by 4.\n\nSo:\n\n   base = n*(n+1)//2\n   while m:\n        m -= 1\n        ... \n\nThen the inner if and for: 8 spaces.\n\nSo the string for program1.py:\n\n   \"base = n*(n+1)//2\\nwhile m:\\n    m -= 1\\n    i, x = map(int, input().split())\\n    positions = []\\n    if i-1 >= 1:\\n        positions.append(i-1)\\n    if i <= n:\\n        positions.append(i)\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    a[i] = x\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    print(base + ans)\"\n\nBut note: the condition in the if: we have \"i-1>=1\" and \"i<=n\". \n\nWe'll write as above.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing line is in the else branch, which is already indented by 4. Then we add 4 more? \n\nThe existing code:\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        t = int(sn)\n        s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with \"s = m+1\", and we must indent it by 4 more spaces? \n\nSo the line should be 8 spaces from the function start? \n\nBut the function body is indented by 4, the while by 8, the if by 12, and the else branch by 12. Then the TODO is at 12. We replace with:\n\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\nBut that would be 12 spaces for the else and 16 for the assignment? \n\nBut the existing code uses 4 spaces per level. \n\nSo:\n\n   def solve(sn):\n        ... \n        while s < e:\n            ... \n            if ...:\n                ... \n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\nSo the assignment in the else branch is at the same level as the if branch. \n\nTherefore, we use 4 more spaces (so 12 in total from the function start) for the assignment? \n\nBut the existing code has the if and else at the same level, and the body of the if and else should be indented one more.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\nBut the existing code has the else: and then a comment. We replace the comment with \"s = m+1\", and we must have the same indentation as the comment? \n\nThe comment is at the same level as the if and else? \n\nActually, the existing code:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe assignment should be at the same level as the comment? \n\nBut the comment is at 12? \n\nWe'll do 4 spaces for the else: and then 8 for the body? \n\nBut the if branch has:\n\n                e = m\n\nwhich is at 8? \n\nWait, the code:\n\n        while s < e:\n            m = (s + e) >> 1\n            if cnt[m] >= t:\n                e = m\n            else:\n                # TODO\n\nThe if branch body: \"e = m\" is indented by 4 more (so 8 from the while, 12 from the function) and the else branch body: the comment is at the same level? \n\nSo we do:\n\n            else:\n                s = m+1\n\nwith \"s = m+1\" at the same level as \"e = m\".\n\nTherefore, the missing line for program2.py is: \"                s = m+1\"\n\nBut that is 16 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can count the current indentation:\n\n   The else: is at 12 spaces (if we count: function:4, while:8, if:12, else:12). Then the body of the else should be 16.\n\nBut the existing if branch body is at 16? \n\nSo we output 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. \n\nWe can output the exact line that would replace the TODO, which is \"s = m+1\", but we must include the indentation that matches the context.\n\nSince the if branch has \"e = m\" at 16 spaces, we do the same for the else branch.\n\nSo the string for program2.py is: \"                s = m+1\"\n\nBut how many spaces? \n\nThe function: 4\n   while: 4+4=8\n      m = ...: 8+4=12\n      if ...: 12\n      then the body of the if: 12+4=16 -> \"e = m\" at 16 spaces.\n      else: 12\n      then the body of the else: 16 -> \"s = m+1\"\n\nSo 16 spaces.\n\nBut 16 spaces is: \"                \" (16 spaces).\n\nAlternatively, we can output without counting: use the same as the if branch.\n\nBut to be safe, we output 16 spaces.\n\nBut note: the existing code might use tabs? but the problem says python and we use spaces.\n\nWe'll output 16 spaces.\n\nBut 16 spaces is long. \n\nAlternatively, we can output the code as:\n\n   \"                s = m+1\"\n\nBut we must count: 16 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation, as long as it runs. \n\nWe'll do 4 levels of 4 spaces: 4*4=16.\n\nTherefore, the final json:\n\n   {\n        \"program1\": \"base = n*(n+1)//2\\nwhile m:\\n    m -= 1\\n    i, x = map(int, input().split())\\n    positions = []\\n    if i-1 >= 1:\\n        positions.append(i-1)\\n    if i <= n:\\n        positions.append(i)\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans -= (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    a[i] = x\\n    for pos in positions:\\n        ans += (a[pos] != a[pos+1]) * pos * (n - pos)\\n    print(base + ans)\",\n        \"program2\": \"                s = m+1\"\n   }\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the condition \"i<=n\" might be written as \"i<=n\" (without extra spaces) but we have written as above.\n\nWe'll output the string as is.\n\nBut note: the expression (n - (i+1)+1) in the initial code was simplified to (n-i). But we use (n-pos) in the update. \n\nThis is consistent.\n\nWe are done."
