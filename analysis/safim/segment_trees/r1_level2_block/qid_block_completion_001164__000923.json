But we are storing the divisors in a set for each test case, and then we output the sorted list of valid a for that test case. How to reduce the work? We can iterate over the divisors of total = 2*(w+l-2) and for each divisor a, check the four conditions. But the number of divisors per test case is about O(sqrt(total)), which is about 10^5 per test case, and 100 test cases -> 10^7, which is acceptable in Pyton? However, worst-case 12.6e6 * 100 = 1.26e9? That is too high.",

The top: 3 tiles -> one tile of 1x3. The bottom: 3 tiles -> one tile of 1x3. The left: 5 tiles? But 5 is not divisible by 3? The right: 5 tiles? But wait: we broke the boundary as in possibility 1: \n            Condition1: a=3 divides w=3 and a=3 divides l-2=3 -> so we use:\n                top: w=3 -> divisible by 3\n                bottom: w=3 -> divisible by 3\n                left: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3\n                right: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3\n\n          So we break the sides as:\n            top: 3 tiles (including the two corners) -> one tile:",

The loop starts at 2, so we skip i=1. But we already have 1 and 2 in the set. Therefore, we are good. But what if there is a divisor that is 1? we already have it. Example: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6.

However, note that the corners are shared by two sides.\n\n The boundary has a total of 2*(w + l) - 4 tiles (because each corner is counted in two sides, so we subtract the 4 corners that are double counted? \n Actually, the entire perimeter is 2*(w+l) and then subtract the 4 corners? But note: the boundary is the outer ring. However, the problem says:\n   - The interior is (w-2)*(l-2) which is the inner rectangle. Then the boundary tiles are w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\n So the boundary has 2*(w+l) - 4 = 2*(w+l-2) tiles.\n\n The idea: The boundary must be tiled with tiles of size 1xa (or ax1). Since the tiles can be rotated, we can use them as 1xa or a x 1. \n However, note that the boundary is a cycle? Actually, the boundary is a ring of 2*(w+l-2) cells. But the problem does not require the entire boundary to be contiguous? \n Actually, the boundary is broken into four sides. But note: the tiles can be placed arbitrarily as long as they cover the boundary and are aligned (without overlapping the interior).\n\n However, the problem states: \"On the floor boundary\" meaning the entire boundary. The key is that the boundary is a connected region? Actually, it is a cycle.\n\n But note: the tiles are 1xa (or ax1) and must be placed without gaps. The entire boundary must be covered by these tiles. Therefore, the total number of boundary tiles must be divisible by a? \n However, note that the boundary is not a straight line: it has corners. But the tiles can be rotated and placed arbitrarily? \n\n Actually, the problem is more subtle. The boundary is made of four sides. We can break the boundary into four segments:\n   - Top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> length w\n   - Right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> length l\n   - Bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> length w\n   - Left: from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> length l\n\n But note: the corners are shared? Actually, the entire boundary has:\n   - Top: w, but the two corners are shared with the left and right? Actually, the top side has w tiles, but the two corners are included in the top and also in the left/right? \n   So the entire boundary has: top (w) + right (l) + bottom (w) + left (l) - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice) = 2*(w+l) - 4.\n\n However, the tiling must cover the entire boundary. The tiles can be placed arbitrarily? But note: the tiles are 1xa (or ax1) and must be placed along the boundary. \n The problem is: for which a can we tile the boundary? \n\n Important: The boundary is a cycle. The tiling of the boundary must cover the entire cycle without gaps. Therefore, the entire boundary length must be divisible by a? \n But note: the tiles can be placed in any orientation and can be broken arbitrarily? Actually, the tiles are linear. However, the boundary has corners. \n\n Alternate approach: The problem is known and has been solved in Codeforces problems (e.g., \"Bathroom Tiling\"). \n\n Known solution: \n   The entire boundary has 2*(w+l-2) tiles. Therefore, a must divide 2*(w+l-2). However, that is necessary but not sufficient.\n\n Why? Because the boundary is not a straight line. The tiles must cover the four sides and must be placed without overlapping the interior. \n Moreover, at the corners, the tile must fit the corner. \n\n Actually, we can break the boundary into four segments. But note that the problem allows the tiles to be rotated and placed arbitrarily. However, the tiles are 1xa, so they are linear. \n The key is that the entire boundary is a cycle and the tiles are linear. Therefore, the tile must be able to cover a linear segment of the boundary without breaking the cycle? \n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire boundary to be contiguous? Actually, the boundary is contiguous. \n\n But there is a catch: the corners. The tile of length a must be placed such that it does not wrap around a corner? Actually, the tile is 1xa (or ax1) and must be placed in a straight line. \n Therefore, the tile cannot bend. So we must cover each side independently? \n\n Actually, the problem allows the tile to be placed arbitrarily on the boundary. But the boundary is made of four straight sides. Therefore, we can cover each side independently? \n However, note that the problem does not require that a tile is entirely on one side. It can be placed across a corner? \n\n But the problem states: \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\" (in program2, but here the tile must fit on the boundary). However, the boundary has corners. \n The tile of length a must be placed entirely on the boundary. But if we try to place a tile that is longer than one side? Then it would have to wrap around a corner? \n However, the tile is linear and the boundary has a 90-degree turn at the corner. Therefore, the tile cannot be placed across a corner? \n\n So we assume that each tile must lie entirely on one side. Then the problem reduces to: we have four sides: top (w), right (l), bottom (w), left (l). \n But note: the corners are already covered? Actually, the corners are part of two sides? \n\n Actually, the corners are shared. Therefore, we have:\n   - The top side: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles, but the first tile of the top is the top-left corner and the last tile is the top-right corner.\n   - Similarly for the others.\n\n How can we cover a side of length L with tiles of length a? We can break the side into segments of length a? But note: the tile can be placed as 1xa or ax1? \n However, since the side is straight, we can use the tile as 1xa (if we are going horizontally) or as ax1 (if we are going vertically). But for a horizontal side, we must use the tile as 1xa? \n Actually, the tile can be rotated arbitrarily? But the side is horizontal, so we must use the tile as 1xa (so that it fits the horizontal direction). Similarly, for a vertical side, we use the tile as a x 1? \n But note: the tile is 1xa, so when rotated 90 degrees it becomes a x 1. Therefore, for a vertical side, we can use the tile as a x 1. \n\n Therefore, for a side of length L, we require that a divides L? But wait: we can use multiple tiles. However, the entire side must be covered. So a must divide L? \n\n However, note that the corners are shared. Therefore, the four sides are independent? Actually, no: the corners are shared. But if we cover each side independently, then we require that a divides w, a divides l, a divides w, and a divides l? \n That is, a must divide both w and l? \n\n But wait: the problem does not require that each side is covered independently? We can have a tile that covers part of the top and then the right? But we just argued that the tile cannot bend. \n\n Therefore, we must cover each side independently. However, note that the corners are already covered? Actually, the corners are part of two sides. \n\n How do we assign the corners? The problem does not specify. But note: the entire boundary must be covered. The corners are the meeting points. \n\n Actually, we can assign the corners arbitrarily to one of the two sides? For example, the top-left corner can be assigned to the top side or to the left side? \n\n But then the side lengths become:\n   Option 1: \n        top: w (including the two corners at the ends)\n        right: l-1 (because the top-right corner is already covered by the top, so we start from the next one)\n        bottom: w-1 (because the bottom-right corner is covered by the right? and bottom-left by the left? but then the bottom-left corner is not covered)\n        left: l-1\n\n This does not work.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the boundary at the corners and assign the corners to both sides? But then each corner is covered twice? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require that the tiles are placed without overlapping? But the problem says \"tile\", so no overlapping.\n\n Therefore, we must assign each corner to exactly one side. Then the sides become:\n   - Top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? but then the corner (0,0) is the start and (w-1,0) is the end. \n   - Right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> but (w-1,0) is already covered? so we start at (w-1,1) to (w-1, l-1) -> l-1 tiles.\n   - Bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> but (w-1, l-1) is covered? so we start at (w-2, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> w-1 tiles.\n   - Left: from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> but (0, l-1) is covered? and (0,0) is covered? so we start at (0, l-2) to (0,1) -> l-2 tiles.\n\n This is messy and inconsistent.\n\n Known solution from Codeforces problems: \n   The valid a must be divisors of the total boundary length? But that is not sufficient.\n\n Actually, we can consider the entire boundary as a cycle. The cycle has length 2*(w+l-2). Therefore, a must divide 2*(w+l-2). \n\n However, that is necessary but not sufficient. Why? Because the boundary has corners. The tile of length a must be placed such that it does not wrap around a corner? \n But if a divides the entire boundary, then we can break the cycle into segments of length a. However, the problem does not require the tile to be placed in a straight line? \n But the tile is linear and the boundary has corners. Therefore, we must ensure that the tile does not wrap around a corner? \n\n Actually, the problem allows the tile to be placed arbitrarily on the boundary? But the boundary is a grid. The tile must be placed in a straight line (either horizontally or vertically). \n Therefore, the tile cannot wrap around a corner. \n\n So we must cover the boundary without wrapping. This means that the tile must be placed entirely on one side? \n\n Then we are back to the four sides. How can we cover the entire boundary? \n\n We can cover the boundary by covering each side independently. But then we require that a divides the length of each side? But the sides have different lengths? \n\n Actually, we can cover the boundary by having the tiles on each side. But note: the corners are shared. Therefore, we can assign the corners arbitrarily to the adjacent sides? \n\n For example:\n   - The top side: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? but then the corner (0,0) is the start and (w-1,0) is the end. \n   - The right side: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> l tiles? but then the corner (w-1,0) is already covered by the top? \n\n This would double cover the corners.\n\n Therefore, we must not double cover. The problem says: the entire boundary. So we have to cover each boundary cell exactly once.\n\n How to assign the corners? We can assign each corner to one of the two adjacent sides. But then the side lengths become:\n\n   Option 1: \n        top: w (including the left corner and the right corner)\n        right: l-1 (from the top-right corner to the bottom-right corner, excluding the top-right corner because it's already covered by the top, but including the bottom-right corner)\n        bottom: w-1 (from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner, excluding the bottom-right corner? but then the bottom-right corner is covered by the right, so we start at the next one? and then we have w-1 tiles to cover the bottom, but then the bottom-left corner is not covered? \n        left: l-1 (from the bottom-left corner to the top-left corner, excluding the bottom-left corner? and then we miss the top-left corner? \n\n This is messy.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the boundary at the corners and not assign the corners to any side? But then the corners are not covered.\n\n Actually, the corners must be covered. \n\n Known solution from Codeforces: \n   The valid a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that satisfy one of the following conditions:\n\n   Condition 1: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l)   -> but wait, how?\n   Condition 2: a divides (w) and a divides (l-2)\n   Condition 3: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n   Condition 4: a divides (w) and a divides (l)   -> but note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2), so if a divides w and l, then a divides the boundary? \n\n But actually, the known solution (from Codeforces problems) is to consider the divisors of the boundary length and then check if they can tile the boundary without breaking the corners. \n\n However, note the constraints: w, l up to 1e9. We cannot iterate over all divisors of 2*(w+l-2) because that number can be huge (up to 4e9) and the number of divisors can be large (but the problem says the total output integers is at most 200000).\n\n But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\"\n\n Therefore, we can factor the number 2*(w+l-2) and iterate over the divisors? \n\n However, note that t can be up to 100, and the total divisors over all test cases must be at most 200000. \n\n How to check if a divisor a is valid? \n\n We have to cover the boundary. The boundary has four sides. The corners are critical. \n\n We can model the boundary as four segments, but the corners are the meeting points. The tile must be placed entirely on one segment? \n\n Then we require that each segment is divisible by a? But the segments are:\n\n   Segment 1: top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? \n   Segment 2: right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> l tiles? \n   Segment 3: bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> w tiles? \n   Segment 4: left: from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> l tiles? \n\n But then the total is 2*(w+l) and we have double counted the corners? Actually, we have counted the corners twice? \n\n Actually, if we assign the corners to both adjacent sides, then we have double counted. \n\n Therefore, we must assign each corner to exactly one side. \n\n How about we break the boundary at the top-left corner? Then we have a path that goes: \n   top: from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? \n   then right: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> l tiles? but note (w-1,0) is the end of top and the start of right? \n   then bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> w tiles? \n   then left: from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> l tiles? \n\n But then the total is w + l + w + l = 2*(w+l). But we know the boundary has only 2*(w+l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4. \n The discrepancy: we have included the four corners twice? Actually, we have included the four corners in two segments? \n\n Specifically:\n   (0,0) is in the top and in the left? \n   (w-1,0) is in the top and in the right?\n   (w-1, l-1) is in the right and in the bottom?\n   (0, l-1) is in the bottom and in the left?\n\n So we have 4 extra tiles? \n\n Therefore, we must subtract the corners. \n\n How to avoid double counting? We can define the sides without the corners? \n\n   Segment 1: top: from (1,0) to (w-2,0) -> w-2 tiles? \n   Segment 2: right: from (w-1,1) to (w-1, l-2) -> l-2 tiles?\n   Segment 3: bottom: from (w-2, l-1) to (1, l-1) -> w-2 tiles?\n   Segment 4: left: from (0, l-2) to (0,1) -> l-2 tiles?\n\n And then the corners: (0,0), (w-1,0), (w-1, l-1), (0, l-1) are left. \n\n But then we have 4 corners. How to cover the corners? They are isolated? \n\n Actually, the corners are adjacent to two sides. We can cover the corners with tiles that are placed on the sides? \n\n But note: the tile is 1xa. If a=1, then we can cover the corner by a 1x1 tile? But the problem says the boundary uses 1xa tiles. \n\n However, the problem does not require that the entire boundary is covered by the same a? Actually, a is fixed for the entire boundary.\n\n How can we cover the corners? We can use a tile that covers the corner and extends along one of the sides? \n\n For example, to cover the top-left corner (0,0): we can place a tile that covers (0,0) and then extends to the right (along the top) for a-1 more tiles? \n But then we require that a-1 <= w-1? \n\n Similarly, we can cover the top-left corner by a tile that extends downward (along the left) for a-1 more tiles? \n\n Therefore, the corners can be covered by the adjacent sides. \n\n Now, the entire boundary is covered by the four sides and the corners are covered by the tiles that start at the corner and extend along one side. \n\n But note: the tile that covers the corner must be placed entirely on one side? \n\n Actually, the tile is linear and must be placed in a straight line. Therefore, the tile that covers the corner must be placed entirely on one side? \n\n Then the corner is covered by one tile that is placed on one of the two adjacent sides. \n\n Therefore, we have two possibilities for each corner? \n\n However, the problem does not specify which side covers the corner. We are free to choose. \n\n Therefore, we have multiple ways to assign the corners to the sides. \n\n The known solution in Codeforces problems (e.g., problem \"Bathroom Tiling\" from a contest) is to consider the following:\n\n   The entire boundary can be tiled with 1xa tiles if and only if:\n\n      (a) a divides the entire boundary length: 2*(w+l-2)   [necessary]\n\n      (b) and one of the following holds:\n\n          Option 1: a divides (w) and a divides (l)   -> but wait, how? \n          Option 2: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l) \n          Option 3: a divides (w) and a divides (l-2)\n          Option 4: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n\n   But note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So condition (a) is already that a divides 2*(w+l-2). \n\n   Why these conditions? \n\n   Explanation:\n\n   We can assign the corners to the sides in different ways. \n\n   Possibility 1: assign each corner to the two sides that meet at that corner? Actually, we have four corners. \n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the boundary as two pairs of opposite sides. \n\n   Possibility: \n        Cover the top and bottom with tiles that run horizontally, and the left and right with tiles that run vertically. \n        Then the top and bottom must be divisible by a? -> so a must divide w (because the top has w tiles, including the two corners? but then the top has w tiles? but we have two corners that are shared with the left and right? \n\n        Actually, if we cover the top with horizontal tiles, then the top has w tiles. But the two corners of the top are also the start of the left and right? \n        How do we cover the corners? \n\n        We can cover the top from (0,0) to (w-1,0) with horizontal tiles. Then the corner (0,0) is covered by the top? and the corner (w-1,0) is covered by the top. \n        Then the left side: from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> but (0,0) is already covered, so we start at (0,1) to (0, l-1) -> l-1 tiles. \n        Similarly, the right side: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> but (w-1,0) is covered, so we start at (w-1,1) to (w-1, l-1) -> l-1 tiles.\n        The bottom: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> but (0, l-1) and (w-1, l-1) are not covered yet? \n\n        Then the bottom has w tiles? \n\n        But then the total boundary tiles: w (top) + (l-1) (right) + w (bottom) + (l-1) (left) = 2*w + 2*l - 2 = 2*(w+l) - 2, which is not 2*(w+l-2). \n\n        We are missing two tiles? \n\n        Actually, the bottom-left corner (0, l-1) and bottom-right corner (w-1, l-1) are not covered? \n\n        So we must cover them. How? We can use two vertical tiles? But the left side already started at (0,1) and went to (0, l-1) -> but that does not include (0, l-1)? \n\n        Actually, the left side should go from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> but (0,0) is already covered. So we cover (0,1) to (0, l-1) -> that's l-1 tiles, so (0, l-1) is covered? \n\n        But then the bottom-left corner (0, l-1) is covered by the left side. Similarly, the bottom-right corner is covered by the right side. \n\n        Then the bottom side: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> but (0, l-1) and (w-1, l-1) are already covered. So we cover (1, l-1) to (w-2, l-1) -> w-2 tiles. \n\n        Then the total: \n            top: w\n            right: l-1\n            bottom: w-2\n            left: l-1\n            total = w + (l-1) + (w-2) + (l-1) = 2*w + 2*l - 4 = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n            top: w -> must be divisible by a? \n            bottom: w-2 -> must be divisible by a? \n            left: l-1 -> must be divisible by a?\n            right: l-1 -> must be divisible by a?\n\n        But wait: the top is w, and the bottom is w-2. They are not the same. \n\n        Actually, we can cover the top with horizontal tiles: then we require that a divides w? \n        Similarly, the bottom: we require that a divides w-2? \n        The left and right: we require that a divides l-1? \n\n        But then we have three conditions: a divides w, a divides w-2, and a divides l-1? \n\n        However, note: the top and bottom are both horizontal, but they are of different lengths? \n\n        Alternatively, we can assign the corners differently. \n\n        Possibility 2: \n            Cover the top from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? \n            Cover the bottom from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> w tiles? \n            Cover the left from (0,1) to (0, l-2) -> l-2 tiles? \n            Cover the right from (w-1,1) to (w-1, l-2) -> l-2 tiles? \n\n        Then the total: 2*w + 2*(l-2) = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n        Conditions: \n            a divides w (for top and bottom) and a divides l-2 (for left and right).\n\n        Possibility 3: \n            Cover the top from (0,0) to (w-2,0) -> w-1 tiles? (leaving the top-right corner for the right side)\n            Cover the right from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-1) -> l tiles? \n            Cover the bottom from (w-1, l-1) to (1, l-1) -> w-1 tiles? \n            Cover the left from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> l tiles? \n\n        But then the total: (w-1) + l + (w-1) + l = 2*w + 2*l - 2 -> not matching.\n\n        Possibility 4: \n            Cover the top from (0,0) to (w-1,0) -> w tiles? \n            Cover the right from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-2) -> l-1 tiles? \n            Cover the bottom from (w-1, l-1) to (0, l-1) -> w tiles? \n            Cover the left from (0, l-1) to (0,0) -> l tiles? \n\n        Then the total: w + (l-1) + w + l = 2*w + 2*l - 1 -> not matching.\n\n        Possibility 5: \n            We can cover the corners with separate tiles? But the tile size a might be 1, then we can cover each corner individually. \n\n        Actually, the known solution in Codeforces for this problem is to consider the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) and then check if the divisor a satisfies one of the following:\n\n            (1) a divides w and a divides l\n            (2) a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n            (3) a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n            (4) a divides (w-2) and a divides (l-2)\n\n        But wait, what about the possibility that a divides (w-1) and (l-1)? \n\n        Actually, there is another possibility: \n            We cover the top from (0,0) to (w-2,0) -> w-1 tiles? \n            Then the top-right corner (w-1,0) is covered by the right side? \n            The right side: from (w-1,0) to (w-1, l-2) -> l-1 tiles? \n            Then the bottom-right corner (w-1, l-1) is covered by the bottom? \n            The bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (1, l-1) -> w-1 tiles? \n            Then the bottom-left corner (0, l-1) is covered by the left? \n            The left: from (0, l-1) to (0,1) -> l-1 tiles? \n            Then the top-left corner (0,0) is covered by the top? \n\n            But then the top-left corner is covered by the top? and the top started at (0,0) to (w-2,0) -> that includes (0,0). \n            The left side: from (0, l-1) to (0,1) -> that does not include (0,0). \n\n            Total: (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) + (l-1) = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n            Conditions: \n                a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1) and a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1) -> so a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1).\n\n        But note: we have two segments of length w-1 (top and bottom) and two segments of length l-1 (right and left). \n        So we require that a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1). \n\n        However, wait: the top and bottom are both w-1? and the left and right are both l-1? \n        So we require: \n            a divides (w-1)   [for top and bottom]\n            a divides (l-1)   [for left and right]\n\n        But note: the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2) = 2*( (w-1) + (l-1) ). So if a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1), then a divides the entire boundary? \n\n        Therefore, we have four possibilities:\n\n            Possibility A: \n                top: w, bottom: w, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> conditions: a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n            Possibility B:\n                top: w-2, bottom: w-2, left: l, right: l -> conditions: a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n            Possibility C:\n                top: w-2, bottom: w-2, left: l-2, right: l-2 -> conditions: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l-2)\n            Possibility D:\n                top: w-1, bottom: w-1, left: l-1, right: l-1 -> conditions: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n\n        But note: possibility C is a special case of A and B? \n\n        However, we must also consider that a must divide the entire boundary? Actually, if a divides w and a divides (l-2), then a divides 2*(w+l-2) because:\n            w = k1 * a, l-2 = k2 * a -> then w+l-2 = a*(k1+k2) -> 2*(w+l-2) = 2*a*(k1+k2) -> divisible by a.\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        Therefore, we can check for each divisor a of 2*(w+l-2) if it satisfies one of the four conditions:\n\n            (1) (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) \n            (2) ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0)\n            (3) ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0)\n            (4) ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0)\n\n        But note: what if a=1? Then all conditions are satisfied? \n\n        Also, what if a=2? \n\n        However, there is a catch: the conditions (1) to (4) are not independent. \n\n        Also, note that the entire boundary is 2*(w+l-2). So a must divide 2*(w+l-2). We are iterating over the divisors, so that is already satisfied.\n\n        But wait: what if a does not divide the entire boundary? Then we skip. But we are iterating over the divisors, so it does.\n\n        However, note: the divisor a might be 1, and we have to include it. \n\n        But there is a problem: the conditions (1) to (4) might not cover all possibilities? \n\n        Actually, we have four ways to assign the corners. \n\n        But note: the possibility (3) is redundant? Because if a divides (w-2) and a divides (l-2), then it also satisfies (1) and (2)? \n        Actually, no: condition (1) requires a divides w and (l-2). Condition (3) requires a divides (w-2) and (l-2). They are different.\n\n        However, we must include all four.\n\n        But note: the possibility (3) is not covered by (1) or (2). \n\n        Therefore, we check all four.\n\n        However, what if a satisfies more than one condition? Then we would count it once.\n\n        We are storing the solutions in a set.\n\n        But note: the problem says the valid a are positive integers. And we are iterating over divisors (which are positive).\n\n        Steps for program1.py:\n\n          Let total = 2*(w+l-2)   [the boundary length]\n\n          We want to collect all divisors a of total (with a>=1) such that at least one of the four conditions holds.\n\n          However, note: the problem says a can be 1, and we must include it.\n\n          But note: the divisor a must be at least 1, and we are iterating over divisors.\n\n          How to iterate over divisors? \n            We can iterate i from 1 to sqrt(total) to get the divisors.\n\n          However, note: the total can be as large as 2*(10^9+10^9) = 4e9, so sqrt(4e9) is about 63245, which is acceptable for one test case? \n          But t can be up to 100 -> 100 * 63245 = 6.3e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n          But the problem says the total output integers is at most 200000, so the total number of divisors over all test cases is bounded by 200000? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the output contains at most 200000 integers\", meaning the total over all test cases. \n\n          Therefore, we must be careful: we cannot iterate to sqrt(total) for each test case if the total is large? \n\n          However, note that the total = 2*(w+l-2) and w,l up to 1e9, so total up to 4e9. The number of divisors of a number up to 4e9 is about O(sqrt(4e9)) = about 63245 per test case. \n          And 100 test cases would be 100 * 63245 = 6.3e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n          But worst-case 6.3e6 divisors per test case? Actually, worst-case the number of divisors is about 2 * sqrt(n) (if we iterate i from 1 to sqrt(n), we get two divisors per i: i and n//i). \n          So the total number of divisors per test case is about 2 * sqrt(4e9) ~ 126490. Then 100 test cases: 100 * 126490 = 12.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n          However, the problem says the total output integers (the k and the a_i) is at most 200000. \n\n          But note: the divisors we find per test case are stored in a set. The set for one test case might have up to 126490 divisors. Then the total over 100 test cases would be 100 * 126490 = 12.6e6 integers, which is 12.6 million, but the problem says at most 200000 integers in the output? \n\n          This is a contradiction. \n\n          Therefore, we must not iterate over all divisors for each test case? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200000 integers.\"\n\n          This means that the total number of valid a over all test cases is at most 200000. But the divisors we consider per test case might be large, but the valid ones (that satisfy one of the conditions) are not necessarily all divisors. \n\n          However, we are storing the divisors in a set. The set for one test case might be large, but the total output (the valid a) over all test cases is bounded by 200000. \n\n          But we are storing the divisors in a set for each test case, and then we output the sorted list of valid a for that test case. \n\n          How to reduce the work? \n\n          We can iterate over the divisors of total = 2*(w+l-2) and for each divisor a, check the four conditions. \n\n          But the number of divisors per test case is about O(sqrt(total)), which is about 10^5 per test case, and 100 test cases -> 10^7, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n          However, worst-case 12.6e6 * 100 = 1.26e9? That is too high.\n\n          Actually, the total over all test cases of the number of divisors we iterate over is bounded by the sum over test cases of the number of divisors of 2*(w_i+l_i-2). \n\n          The problem does not guarantee that the total of the divisors is bounded, but the output integers (the valid a) is bounded by 200000. \n\n          However, we must iterate over the divisors to check the conditions. \n\n          But note: we can factor the number total = 2*(w+l-2) and then iterate over the divisors? \n\n          The number of divisors of a number n is about O(sqrt(n)) in the worst-case, but the average is low? \n\n          But worst-case (highly composite number) the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(n))? Actually, the maximum number of divisors for a number around 4e9 is about 1344 (for example, 963761198400 has 1344 divisors). \n\n          So worst-case per test case: 1344 divisors. Then 100 test cases: 134400 divisors. \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            total_boundary = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n            divisors = set()\n            # iterate i from 1 to sqrt(total_boundary)\n            i = 1\n            while i * i <= total_boundary:\n                if total_boundary % i == 0:\n                    divisors.add(i)\n                    divisors.add(total_boundary // i)\n                i += 1\n\n            solutions = set()\n            for a in divisors:\n                # Check the four conditions\n                if a > total_boundary: # skip? but divisors are <= total_boundary\n                    continue\n                # Condition 1: a divides w and a divides (l-2)\n                if w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                # Condition 2: a divides (w-2) and a divides l\n                elif (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                # Condition 3: a divides (w-2) and a divides (l-2)\n                elif (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                # Condition 4: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)\n                elif (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n            # Also note: a must be at least 1, and we have included 1.\n\n          But wait: what if a=2? \n          Example: w=3, l=5 -> total_boundary = 2*(3+5-2)=12. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\n          Conditions for a=2:\n            Condition1: w%2=3%2=1 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition2: (w-2)%2=1%2=1 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition3: (w-2)%2=1%2=1 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition4: (w-1)%2=2%2=0, (l-1)%2=4%2=0 -> valid.\n\n          So a=2 is included.\n\n          Conditions for a=3:\n            Condition1: 3%3=0, (5-2)=3%3=0 -> valid.\n\n          Conditions for a=1: \n            Condition1: 3%1=0, 3%1=0 -> valid.\n\n          Conditions for a=4: \n            Condition1: 3%4=3 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition2: 1%4=1 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition3: 1%4=1, 3%4=3 -> skip.\n            Condition4: 2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> skip.\n\n          Conditions for a=6: \n            Condition1: 3%6=3 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition2: 1%6=1 !=0 -> skip.\n            Condition3: 1%6=1, 3%6=3 -> skip.\n            Condition4: 2%6=2, 4%6=4 -> skip.\n\n          Conditions for a=12: similarly skip.\n\n          So solutions = {1,2,3} -> which matches the example.\n\n          However, note: the example says a=1,2,3.\n\n          But wait: the example picture for a=3: \n            The interior: (3-2)*(5-2)=1*3=3 tiles (1x1). \n            The boundary: 2*(3+5-2)=12 tiles. \n            We use 12/3=4 tiles of size 1x3.\n\n          How do we cover the boundary? \n            The top: 3 tiles -> one tile of 1x3.\n            The bottom: 3 tiles -> one tile of 1x3.\n            The left: 5 tiles? But 5 is not divisible by 3? \n            The right: 5 tiles? \n\n          But wait: we broke the boundary as in possibility 1: \n            Condition1: a=3 divides w=3 and a=3 divides l-2=3 -> so we use:\n                top: w=3 -> divisible by 3\n                bottom: w=3 -> divisible by 3\n                left: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3\n                right: l-2=3 -> divisible by 3\n\n          So we break the sides as:\n            top: 3 tiles (including the two corners) -> one tile: [0,0] to [2,0] (if we start at the top-left corner and go right)\n            bottom: 3 tiles? but we have to leave the corners? Actually, we break the sides as:\n                top: from (0,0) to (2,0) -> 3 tiles? \n                bottom: from (0,4) to (2,4) -> 3 tiles? \n                left: from (0,1) to (0,3) -> 3 tiles? \n                right: from (2,1) to (2,3) -> 3 tiles? \n\n          Then the corners: (0,0) and (2,0) are covered by the top, (0,4) and (2,4) by the bottom, and the sides are covered. \n\n          But what about the corners (0,0) and (0,4) and (2,0) and (2,4)?

\n          But we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter, and then we add a and 2*a. \n          And the set solutions will avoid duplicates.\n\n          But note: the initial set has 1 and 2. Then we iterate i from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter). \n          For i=2, we get a=2 and a = half_perimeter//2 (if half_perimeter is even). \n          Then for a=2, we consider factor=2 and 4. \n          Then for a = half_perimeter//2, we consider factor = half_perimeter//2 and half_perimeter.\n\n          But half_perimeter might be large, but that's okay.\n\n          But what if half_perimeter is odd? then for i=2, half_perimeter % 2 !=0, so we skip.\n\n          Therefore, we are not missing the even divisors? because we are also considering 2*a for every divisor a.\n\n          But note: the divisors of the boundary length that are not of the form a or 2*a for a a divisor of half_perimeter? \n          Actually, every divisor of the boundary length is either a divisor of half_perimeter or twice a divisor of half_perimeter? \n          So we cover all.\n\n          Therefore, we can complete the TODO with the above for loop.\n\n          But note: the provided code has a variable 'half_perimeter' = w+l-2.\n\n          We don't have boundary_length explicitly, but we know factor is at most 2*a, and a is at most half_perimeter, so factor is at most 2*half_perimeter, which is the boundary length.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          However, note: the condition might be satisfied for factor=2*a even if a is not valid? \n\n          But we are not checking a, we are checking factor.\n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                if half_perimeter % i != 0:\n                    continue\n                div = half_perimeter // i\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    # The provided code already did: \n                    #   mod_a = w % a\n                    #   if mod_a <= 2: \n                    #       then we do the following?\n                    # But note: the condition \"mod_a<=2\" is already checked. \n                    #   So we are inside the if.\n                    for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                        if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n                           ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \\\n                           ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n                           ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                            solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But wait: the condition \"if mod_a<=2\" is already satisfied for a, but not necessarily for 2*a. \n          However, we argued that if factor is valid, then w % factor is 0,1, or 2. \n          But the code has only checked for a, not for 2*a. \n\n          Therefore, we might add a factor=2*a for which w % (2*a) is 3, but then it wouldn't be valid? \n          But we are checking the four conditions, and if they are satisfied, then w % factor must be 0,1, or 2. \n\n          So it is safe.\n\n          However, to be consistent, we could also check for factor: if w % factor > 2, then skip? \n          But the four conditions already imply that w % factor is 0,1, or 2. \n\n          Therefore, we don't need to check again.\n\n          But note: the four conditions are OR, so if one is satisfied, then the factor is valid and we add it.\n\n          Therefore, we can do as above.\n\n          But note: the initial set solutions = {1,2} might not be covered by the loop? \n          The loop starts at i=2, so it does not consider i=1. \n          Why? because the range is from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)).\n\n          How to capture the divisor 1? \n          We already have solutions = {1,2}. \n\n          But what about 2? \n          The divisor 1: then a=1 and 2*a=2, which are already in the set.\n\n          But what if half_perimeter has a divisor i=1? \n          The loop starts at 2, so we skip i=1. \n\n          But we already have 1 and 2 in the set.\n\n          Therefore, we are good.\n\n          But what if there is a divisor that is 1? we already have it.\n\n          Example: w=3, l=5: half_perimeter=6, divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n          The loop: \n            i=2: 6%2==0 -> then a in [2, 6//2=3]\n                for a=2: \n                    factors = [2,4]\n                    for factor=2: \n                         condition1: w=3%2=1, (l-2)=3%2=1 -> not both 0 -> skip.\n                         condition2: (3-2)=1%2=1, 5%2=1 -> skip.\n                         condition3: 1%2=1, 3%2=1 -> skip.\n                         condition4: (3-1)=2%2=0, (5-1)=4%2=0 -> valid -> add 2.\n                    for factor=4: \n                         condition1: 3%4=3, 3%4=3 -> skip.\n                         condition2: 1%4=1, 5%4=1 -> skip.\n                         condition3: 1%4=1, 3%4=3 -> skip.\n                         condition4: 2%4=2, 4%4=0 -> skip.\n                for a=3:\n                    factors = [3,6]\n                    for factor=3: \n                         condition1: 3%3=0, 3%3=0 -> valid -> add 3.\n                    for factor=6: \n                         condition1: 3%6=3, 3%6=3 -> skip.\n                         condition2: 1%6=1, 5%6=5 -> skip.\n                         condition3: 1%6=1, 3%6=3 -> skip.\n                         condition4: 2%6=2, 4%6=4 -> skip.\n\n          Then solutions becomes {1,2,3} (since we started with {1,2} and then added 2 and 3).\n\n          But 2 was already in the set, so it remains.\n\n          Therefore, we output: \"3 1 2 3\"\n\n          But the example expects: \"3 1 2 3\" -> sorted: 1,2,3.\n\n          However, the problem says: the valid a are 1,2,3.\n\n          But note: the example also has a=1,2,3.\n\n          Therefore, it matches.\n\n          But what about a=4? \n          We did not get it, and we know it is not valid.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n                for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                    if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n                       ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \\\n                       ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n                       ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                        solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But note: the condition is long. We can break it into multiple lines.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code, and the missing code is the TODO block.\n\n          We write:\n\n            for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                    solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But to make it more readable, we can break the condition into multiple lines? \n          But the problem says: output only the missing code, and we are in the middle of a loop.\n\n          We can write:\n\n            for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                cond1 = (w % factor == 0) and ((l-2) % factor == 0)\n                cond2 = ((w-2) % factor == 0) and (l % factor == 0)\n                cond3 = ((w-2) % factor == 0) and ((l-2) % factor == 0)\n                cond4 = ((w-1) % factor == 0) and ((l-1) % factor == 0)\n                if cond1 or cond2 or cond3 or cond4:\n                    solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But that is 5 lines. \n\n          The problem does not specify the length, but we are to output the missing block.\n\n          We choose the one-liner for brevity.\n\n          But note: the condition might be too long? \n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But the backslashes are not necessary if we use parentheses. \n\n          Actually, we are inside an if that is already in a for loop. \n\n          We can do without backslashes by using parentheses around the whole condition.\n\n          But the condition is already in parentheses? \n\n          We'll write:\n\n            if ( (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or\n                 ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or\n                 ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or\n                 ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0) ):\n                solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But in Python, we can break a long condition across lines inside parentheses.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n          We'll output:\n\n            for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                    solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But to be safe and avoid a very long line, we can break it as:\n\n            for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                if ( (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0) ):\n                    solutions.add(factor)\n\n          This is 5 lines. But the TODO is a block.\n\n          We'll output the block as:\n\n            for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                if ( (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                     ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0) ):\n                    solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But note: the indentation. The provided code has 8 spaces of indentation for the TODO.\n\n          We are inside:\n\n                for a in [i, div]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we are at 12 spaces of indentation. Then the block we add should be at 16 spaces.\n\n          We write:\n\n                    for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                        if ( (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                             ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or \n                             ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or \n                             ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0) ):\n                            solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But note: the condition spans multiple lines. \n\n          Alternatively, we can write it in one line to avoid the line breaks.\n\n          Given the constraints, we choose the one-liner.\n\n          We write:\n\n                    for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                        if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                            solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But the line is long. \n\n          We'll do the one-liner.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n                    for factor in [a, 2*a]:\n                        if (w % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and l % factor == 0) or ((w-2) % factor == 0 and (l-2) % factor == 0) or ((w-1) % factor == 0 and (l-1) % factor == 0):\n                            solutions.add(factor)\n\n          But note: the variable 'solutions' is the set we are building.\n\n          And we are done for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  Description: \n      We are given t test cases. For each test case, an integer n and a string s of length n (with characters 'W','R','B').\n      We have a stamp that can stamp two adjacent cells with BR or RB. The stamp must fit entirely on the n cells. \n      We can stamp multiple times on the same cell. \n      We start with a white row (all 'W') and we want to know if we can obtain the string s.\n\n  Approach:\n\n      Note: the stamping operation: \n          It sets two adjacent cells to one of {BR, RB}. \n\n      We can think in reverse: \n          We start from the final picture and we can \"clean\" a segment of two adjacent cells if they are one of the stamped patterns? \n          But note: the stamping is not reversible in a unique way? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use an invariant.\n\n      Known solution from Codeforces problems (e.g., \"Stamp Painting\" or similar) for this problem:\n\n          Observation:\n            - The stamp always stamps one 'R' and one 'B'. Therefore, the entire picture must have an even number of non-white cells? \n              But note: we can have an odd number of non-white cells? \n              Example: n=3, s = \"B B W\" -> two non-white cells -> even.\n\n            - Actually, the entire picture must have the same parity of non-white cells? \n\n          However, the key is to break the string into contiguous segments of non-white cells. \n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Split the string by 'W' to get contiguous non-white segments.\n\n            Step 2: For each contiguous non-white segment:\n                      - The segment must have at least two different colors? \n                      - Or if the segment has only one color, then it must be of length at least 2? \n\n            But wait: \n                Example: \"RR\" -> is it possible? \n                    We can do: \n                      Start: WW -> we cannot stamp a single cell? \n                      But we have two adjacent: we can stamp as RB? but then we get RB, not RR.\n\n                How to get \"RR\"? \n                    We can do:\n                      Step1: stamp the first two: RB -> \"RBW\"\n                      Step2: stamp the last two: BR -> then we get R (from the first stamp) and then the second stamp: the last two are 'B' and 'W'? -> we stamp the last two as BR? -> then we get R, then B becomes R? \n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n                      Start: WWW\n                      Step1: stamp the middle and last: W then stamp the last two: W then use the stamp on positions 1 and 2: \n                              positions"
