How? We take the set S = the top x items. Then the free items are the last y in that set. Then the sum is: \n          p[x] - p[x-y]   (because p is the prefix sum of the descending array, and we want the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1): which is p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      Example: Store: [5,3,5] -> sort descending: [5,5,3]\n          p[0]=0, p[1]=5, p[2]=10, p[3]=13.\n\n          Query (3,2): \n              x=3, y=2 -> we want the segment from index 3-2=1 to 2: that is a[1] and a[2]? But note: our array a is [5,5,3] (index0:5, index1:5, index2:3). The segment from index1 to index2: 5+3 = 8 -> matches.\n\n          Query (2,1): \n              x=2, y=1 -> segment from index2-1=1 to 1: a[1]=5 -> matches.\n\n          Query (3,3): \n              x=3, y=3 -> segment from index0 to index2: p[3]-p[0]=13 -> but the example note says 6? But wait, the example note for the third query is for a different store? The problem note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". So for the store [1,2,3]: \n          Sort descending: [3,2,1]\n          p[0]=0, p[1]=3, p[2]=5, p[3]=6.\n          Query (3,3): x=3, y=3 -> p[3]-p[0]=6 -> matches. Therefore, the algorithm is: \n          For a query (x,y): \n              free_sum = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n      But note: our prefix array p is defined for the entire descending sorted array, and we have p[0]=0, p[1]=a[0], p[2]=a[0]+a[1], ... p[i] = sum of a[0:i]. So the code for program1.py: We have: \n            n, q = map(int, input().split()) a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            p = [0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                p.append(p[-1] + a[i])\n            # Then for each query (x,y):\n            #   we output p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n      However, note: the array a has n elements. The indices: from 0 to n-1. For a query (x,y): we require x-y to be nonnegative and x<=n? The problem says: 1<=y<=x<=n. So x-y is at least 0 and at most x-1. But note: our prefix array p has indices from 0 to n (inclusive).",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given the number of items n and the number of queries q.\nThen a list of n integers (prices) and then q queries, each with x and y.\n\nThe idea:\n- We sort the prices in descending order. Why? Because we want to maximize the free value: the free items are the y cheapest among the x items we choose. To maximize the free value, we want the cheapest items in the chosen set to be as expensive as possible. But note: we can choose any set of x items. So we want to choose x items that have the largest possible y smallest items.\n\nHow?\n- Actually, note: the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So if we choose x items, the free items are the y smallest in that set. To maximize the free value, we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible.\n\nBut observe: we can choose any set. So we can choose the x items that have the largest possible y smallest items? How?\n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n- We want to maximize the sum of the y smallest items in a set of x items.\n\nBut note: the entire set of items is fixed. We can sort the items in ascending order? But the note in the problem does descending.\n\nActually, the provided code sorts the list in descending order and then uses accumulate to get the prefix sums.\n\nWhy descending?\nBecause if we sort in descending order, then the array `a` has the most expensive first.\n\nBut then the free items are the cheapest in the set. In a set of x items, the cheapest items are the ones at the end of the sorted descending array? Actually, if we sort in descending order, then the last element in the chosen set (if we take the first x from the sorted descending) would be the smallest? \n\nWait: if we take the top x items (the x largest) then the free items are the y smallest in that set. The y smallest in the set of the top x would be the last y of the top x. Since we sorted in descending order, the set we take is a[0:x] (which are the x largest). Then the smallest in that set is a[x-1] and the next smallest is a[x-2] and so on? Actually, the set a[0:x] is sorted descending, so the smallest is the last element of that segment, i.e., a[x-1]. The next smallest is a[x-2]? But that is larger? \n\nActually, we want the y smallest in the set to be the last y of the segment? But in descending order, the segment a[0:x] is from high to low. So the last y in that segment are the smallest. But note: the last y in the segment a[0:x] are the smallest, but they are in descending order? Actually, the segment a[0:x] is sorted descending, so the smallest y are a[x-y: x] but in descending order? Actually, no: the entire segment is descending, so the smallest element is at index x-1, then the next smallest at x-2, ... up to x-y. So the y smallest are a[x-y] to a[x-1]? But note: in the array `a` (which is sorted descending) the segment from x-y to x-1 is the smallest y in the set. However, we want the sum of these.\n\nBut note: the prefix sum array `p` is built from the descending sorted array. So:\np[0] = 0\np[1] = a[0]\np[2] = a[0]+a[1]\n...\np[i] = a[0]+...+a[i-1]\n\nSo the sum of the segment from index i to j (inclusive) in the original array `a` (which is descending) is p[j+1] - p[i].\n\nBut the y smallest in the set of x (which are the last y in the segment of the first x) are the indices from x-y to x-1 (0-indexed). So the sum would be p[x] - p[x-y]? \n\nLet me check with the example: \nFirst example: items = [5, 3, 5] -> but note the example input: \nThe input: n=3, q=3, and the prices: [5, 3, 5]? Actually the example note says: \n  In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8.\n\nBut wait: the two cheapest in {5,3,5} are 3 and 5? Then the free value is 8.\n\nHow do we get that?\nSort the array: ascending: [3,5,5] -> then if we take the entire set (x=3) and y=2, the free items are the two smallest: 3 and 5 -> 8.\n\nBut the problem says: we can choose any set? Actually, we can choose any set of x items. So we want to maximize the free value. In this case, we have three items: [3,5,5]. The best set to choose is the entire set? Because if we choose the entire set, the two smallest are 3 and 5 (which is 8). If we choose two items, we can get two 5's? Then the free item (if we had to take two and get one free) would be 5? But the query is for x=3 and y=2.\n\nSo the example: \nInput: \n3 3\n5 3 5\n3 2\n2 1\n3 3\n\nWe are to output:\n8\n5\n6\n\nBut note: the second query: x=2, y=1 -> we can choose any two items. The best is to choose the two 5's. Then the free item is the smallest of the two, which is 5. So output 5.\n\nThird query: x=3, y=3 -> we have to take all three and get the three cheapest (which is all) for free: 3+5+5=13? But the example says 6? \n\nWait, the example note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\nBut wait, the example input is [5,3,5]? How do we get 1+2+3? \n\nActually, the example note is for a different set of items? The note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\nSo the example note is for a different test case? \n\nLooking at the problem statement: the input for the third query is the same store? The store has items [5,3,5]? Then the third query: x=3, y=3: we take all three, and the free value is the entire set: 5+3+5=13? But the example output is 6.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut the note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\nSo the example note is for a different store? The store in the note has items 1,2,3? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The following q lines contain two integers x_i and y_i each\" and then the example note says: \n  first query: x=3, y=2 -> 8\n  second: x=2, y=1 -> 5\n  third: x=3, y=3 -> 6\n\nBut the input for the store is the same for all queries? The store has n items. The example store has 3 items: [5,3,5]? Then the third query: we take all three, and the free value is the entire set: 5+3+5=13? \n\nBut the example output for the third query is 6. \n\nThis indicates that the example note is for a different store? Actually, the problem says: \"The store sells n items\" and then the input. The example note says: \"In the first query ...\" meaning the first query for the store that has [5,3,5]. Then the second query for the same store. Then the third query for the same store? \n\nBut the example note says for the third query: \"a customer has to buy all the items\" meaning the entire store? Then the free value is the three cheapest in the entire store? The entire store is [5,3,5] -> the three cheapest are 3,5,5? Then the sum is 13? \n\nBut the example output is 6. \n\nAlternatively, the problem note might be for a different example? The problem note says: \"Note\" and then gives three examples. The first example: the store has items that include 5,3,5? The second: the same store? The third: a different store? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The management has not yet decided on the exact values of x and y. Therefore, they ask you to process q queries\". So the store is fixed. The example note must be for the same store? \n\nBut then the third query: x=3, y=3: we take the entire store (which has 3 items) and get the 3 cheapest (which is the entire set) for free. The sum of the entire set is 5+3+5=13? \n\nBut the note says 6. \n\nAlternatively, the example note might be for a different set of items? The problem says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items\" meaning the entire store? But the store has 3 items? Then the free value is the entire set? \n\nBut the note says: \"their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\nSo the store in the note for the third example must have items 1,2,3? \n\nThis indicates that the example note is for a different test case? \n\nLooking at the problem statement: the input for the store is given. The example input: \n  First line: \"3 3\"\n  Second line: \"5 3 5\"\n\nThen the queries: \n  \"3 2\"\n  \"2 1\"\n  \"3 3\"\n\nSo the outputs should be 8, 5, and 13? \n\nBut the example note says: \n  first query: 8\n  second: 5\n  third: 6\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nWait, the problem note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\nThis implies that the store in the note for the third example has items 1,2,3? \n\nBut the input we are given is [5,3,5]. \n\nSo the example note is for a different store? \n\nTherefore, the example note is a separate example. The problem has two examples: \nExample 1: store = [5,3,5] and queries: (3,2) -> 8, (2,1) -> 5, and then \nExample 2: store = [1,2,3] and query (3,3) -> 6.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The following q lines contain two integers x_i and y_i each\" meaning for the same store.\n\nSo the example note is for two different stores? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"Note\" and then gives three examples. The first two examples are for the store [5,3,5] and the third example is for a store [1,2,3]? \n\nBut the input specification says: the first line is n and q, then the next line the n items, then q queries.\n\nSo the example note is just illustrating the concept. \n\nTherefore, for the store [5,3,5] and query (3,3): we must output 13.\n\nBut the example note says for the third query (which is the third example) 6. \n\nSo the example note is not the same as the sample input? \n\nThe problem says: \"In the first query\" meaning the first query of the sample input? Then the second query? Then the third query? \n\nBut the sample input has:\n  n=3, q=3\n  prices = [5,3,5]\n  queries: \n      3 2\n      2 1\n      3 3\n\nSo the outputs should be 8, 5, and 13? \n\nBut the example note says the third query output is 6. \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nI see: the problem note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items\" meaning the entire store? But the store has 3 items? Then the free value is the entire set? \n\nBut the store in the note for the third example is different: the store has items 1,2,3? \n\nSo the problem note is not using the same store for all examples? \n\nTherefore, we must follow the algorithm: for a fixed store, for a query (x,y):\n  We can choose any set of x items. We want to maximize the sum of the y cheapest items in that set.\n\nHow to compute that?\n  Sort the entire array in descending order. Then the best set of x items is the x largest? Why? \n  Because if we take the x largest, then the y smallest in that set are the last y of the x largest. And these are the largest possible y smallest? \n\n  Why is that? \n  Consider: we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible. If we take the x largest items, then the smallest item in the set is the x-th largest item. The next smallest is the (x-1)-th largest? But note: the set of the x largest items has the property that any other set of x items cannot have a larger smallest item? Why? Because if we replace one of the large items with a smaller one, then the smallest item might become even smaller. \n\n  Similarly, the second smallest in the set? \n\n  Actually, we can prove by exchange argument: \n      Let S be the set of the x largest items. \n      Let T be any other set of x items. \n      We want to show that the sum of the y smallest in S is at least the sum of the y smallest in T.\n\n  How? \n      The y smallest in S are the last y in the sorted descending set S. \n      Let the y smallest in S be: a_{x-y+1}, a_{x-y+2}, ..., a_x (in the sorted descending array, these are the smallest in S).\n\n      Now, consider T. The y smallest in T are the smallest y items in T. \n      Since S is the set of the x largest, then the k-th largest in T is at most the k-th largest in S? \n\n      Actually, the smallest item in T cannot be larger than the smallest item in S (which is the x-th largest overall) because if it were, then T would have an item that is larger than the x-th largest, but then that item would be in the top x, and then the entire set S is the top x, so T cannot have an item that is not in the top x? \n\n      Actually, no: T can have an item that is not in the top x? Then that item is at most the x-th largest? \n\n      But note: the x-th largest is the smallest in S. So the smallest in T is at most the smallest in S? \n\n      However, we are summing the y smallest. \n\n      We can use the fact: the k-th smallest in T is at most the k-th smallest in S? \n\n      Actually, the y smallest in T: \n          Let T_small be the y smallest in T. \n          Let S_small be the y smallest in S.\n\n      We want to show: sum(T_small) <= sum(S_small)\n\n      How? \n          We can pair the smallest in T with the smallest in S_small? \n          But note: the smallest in T is <= the smallest in S (which is the x-th largest) and the smallest in S_small is the (x-y+1)-th largest? Actually, the y smallest in S are the last y in the sorted descending set, which are the smallest. But in the entire array, the y smallest in S are the (x-y+1)-th largest, (x-y+2)-th largest, ... up to the x-th largest.\n\n      Actually, the y smallest in S are the x-th largest, (x-1)-th largest, ... (x-y+1)-th largest? \n\n      But note: the entire array is sorted descending: \n          a[0] = largest\n          a[1] = second largest\n          ...\n          a[x-1] = x-th largest\n\n      Then the y smallest in S (which is the set of the first x) are the last y: indices from x-y to x-1? \n          a[x-y] is the (x-y+1)-th largest? \n          a[x-1] is the x-th largest.\n\n      Now, the set T: the y smallest in T: \n          The largest of the y smallest in T is at most the (x-y+1)-th largest? Why? \n          Because if it were larger, then T would have at least y items that are at least the (x-y+1)-th largest. But then T would have at least y items that are in the top (x-y+1) + (y-1) = x? Actually, the top x items are exactly the set S. \n\n      Actually, we can use the following: \n          The y smallest in T are at most the y largest among the y smallest in S? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the known solution: \n          The maximum free value for (x,y) is the sum of the segment from x-y to x-1 in the descending sorted array? \n\n      How? \n          We take the set S = the top x items. Then the free items are the last y in that set. \n\n      Then the sum is: \n          p[x] - p[x-y]   (because p is the prefix sum of the descending array, and we want the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1): which is p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      Example: \n          Store: [5,3,5] -> sort descending: [5,5,3]\n          p[0]=0, p[1]=5, p[2]=10, p[3]=13.\n\n          Query (3,2): \n              x=3, y=2 -> we want the segment from index 3-2=1 to 2: that is a[1] and a[2]? \n              But note: our array a is [5,5,3] (index0:5, index1:5, index2:3). \n              The segment from index1 to index2: 5+3 = 8 -> matches.\n\n          Query (2,1): \n              x=2, y=1 -> segment from index2-1=1 to 1: a[1]=5 -> matches.\n\n          Query (3,3): \n              x=3, y=3 -> segment from index0 to index2: p[3]-p[0]=13 -> but the example note says 6? \n\n      But wait, the example note for the third query is for a different store? \n\n      The problem note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". \n\n      So for the store [1,2,3]: \n          Sort descending: [3,2,1]\n          p[0]=0, p[1]=3, p[2]=5, p[3]=6.\n          Query (3,3): x=3, y=3 -> p[3]-p[0]=6 -> matches.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm is: \n          For a query (x,y): \n              free_sum = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n      But note: our prefix array p is defined for the entire descending sorted array, and we have p[0]=0, p[1]=a[0], p[2]=a[0]+a[1], ... p[i] = sum of a[0:i].\n\n      So the code for program1.py: \n          We have: \n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\n            p = [0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                p.append(p[-1] + a[i])\n            # Then for each query (x,y):\n            #   we output p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n      However, note: the array a has n elements. The indices: from 0 to n-1. \n          For a query (x,y): we require x-y to be nonnegative and x<=n? \n\n      The problem says: 1<=y<=x<=n.\n\n      So x-y is at least 0 and at most x-1. \n\n      But note: our prefix array p has indices from 0 to n (inclusive). \n\n      Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n          for _ in range(q):\n              x, y = map(int, input().split())\n              # Then we want to output p[x] - p[x-y]\n              print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      However, note: the example store [5,3,5] for (3,2): \n          p[3] = 5+5+3 = 13, p[3-2]=p[1]=5 -> 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n      But what if x is greater than the length of the prefix? \n          We built p for n+1 elements: indices 0..n.\n\n      Since x<=n, we are safe.\n\n      However, the problem says: n,q up to 200,000. We are building a prefix sum of n, and then each query is O(1). \n\n      So the missing code for program1.py is:\n          for _ in range(q):\n              x, y = R()   # because R is defined as: map(int, input().split())\n              print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      But note: the original code uses R = lambda: map(int, I().split())\n\n      And the code already has: \n          n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n\n      Then the for loop: for _ in range(q): ... \n\n      So we can write:\n\n          for _ in range(q):\n              x, y = R()\n              print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The missing block is inside the for loop.\n\n      But note: the original code has:\n          for _ in range(q):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      So we must replace the TODO with two lines? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do one line? \n\n      We can do: \n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n      But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program\"\n\n      So for program1.py, the missing code is two lines.\n\n      However, the problem output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\n      We must output the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\n      But note: the original code uses R and I, so we can use R() to read the next two integers.\n\n      Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      But note: the problem says \"for each query, print a single integer\". \n\n      However, the program1.py is going to be piped to program2.py? Actually, the command is \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\". \n\n      But program2.py is a separate program? \n\n      Actually, the problem has two programs. We are to complete both.\n\n      Now, for program2.py:\n\n      Description: \n          We are to count the number of distinct multisets of palindromic integers that sum to n. \n          Two ways are different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different.\n\n          This is equivalent to: count the number of partitions of n using only palindromic integers.\n\n          We are to do this for t test cases, with n up to 40000.\n\n      Approach:\n          We first generate all palindromic numbers up to 40000? \n          Then we use dynamic programming for the partition function (unrestricted) but restricted to the palindromic numbers.\n\n          The classic coin change problem: ways to form j using coins from the set? But here order doesn't matter -> it's the coin change problem for the number of ways (without order) -> that is the same as the partition function.\n\n          We can use:\n            dp[0] = 1\n            for each coin (palindromic number) in the set of palindromic numbers:\n                for j from coin to m:\n                    dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-coin]) % mod\n\n          The array dp is of size m+1 (m=40000).\n\n      The given code:\n\n          R=range\n          m=40001\n          d=10**9+7\n          p=[]   # this will be the list of palindromic numbers\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]: # then i is palindromic\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n          Then: \n            a=[1]+[0]*m   # a[0]=1, a[1..m]=0\n            for i in p:\n                for j in R(i, m):\n                    a[j] += a[j-i]\n                    a[j] %= d\n\n          Then for the test cases:\n            for n in [*open(0)][1:]: \n                print(a[int(n)])\n\n      What is missing? \n          We need to collect the palindromic numbers. In the loop, if i is palindromic, we should append i to the list p.\n\n      So the missing code in the for loop is:\n          p.append(i)\n\n      But note: the code already has the condition: if n==n[::-1]: then we do something. \n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:\n              p.append(i)\n\n      However, note: the variable `n` is the string of i. We can also write:\n\n          p.append(i)\n\n      But note: the variable `n` is reused? After the loop, we have a variable `n` that is the last i? \n\n      Actually, the next part of the code uses `n` for the input. \n\n      But the loop is only for generating the palindromic numbers. After that, we have:\n\n          a=[1]+[0]*m\n          ... \n\n      Then we read the input: for n in [*open(0)][1:]: ...\n\n      So the variable `n` in the loop is local to the loop. \n\n      Therefore, the missing code in the for loop is: p.append(i)\n\n      But note: the code already has the condition: if n==n[::-1]: then we do ... \n\n      So we can write:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n      However, the problem says: the palindromic numbers are positive integers without leading zeros. The condition n==n[::-1] ensures that. \n\n      Therefore, the completion for program2.py is just: p.append(i) inside the if.\n\n      But note: the code has:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We must complete the TODO. \n\n      We can write: \n          p.append(i)\n\n      But note: the variable `i` is the integer. \n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n          p.append(i)\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the code after the loop uses `p` as the list of palindromic numbers.\n\n      So the entire program2.py after completion:\n\n          R=range\n          m=40001\n          d=10**9+7\n          p=[]\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:\n                  p.append(i)\n          a=[1]+[0]*m\n          for i in p:\n              for j in R(i,m):\n                  a[j] += a[j-i]\n                  a[j] %= d\n          for n in [*open(0)][1:]: \n              print(a[int(n)])\n\n      But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The missing block is only the line \"p.append(i)\" inside the if.\n\n      However, the TODO is at the end of the if condition. We can write the line with the same indentation.\n\n      Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: \"p.append(i)\" (with 4 spaces or the same as the if? The if is at the same level as the for loop? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces? We'll use 4 spaces.\n\n      But the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. \n\n      We are to output a json: \n          {\"program1\": \"completion for program1\", \"program2\": \"completion for program2\"}\n\n      For program1: the missing code is two lines (with proper indentation). The for loop is already there. We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      But note: the original code has a for loop that is:\n\n          for _ in range(q):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We must replace the TODO with two lines. The first line reads the query, the second prints the answer.\n\n      The indentation: each line should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for.\n\n      So the completion for program1 is:\n\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      But note: the original code uses a semicolon and compact style. We can write in two lines.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code\". So we output the two lines as a string? \n\n      We must represent the two lines as a string that can be inserted. \n\n      For program2: the completion is one line: \"    p.append(i)\" (with 4 spaces) because the for loop and if are already there.\n\n      But note: the if condition is written as: \n          if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We can write the append in the same line? \n\n      Actually, the code has a comment at the end of the if condition. We can write:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n      But that would be one line. \n\n      Alternatively, we can break it:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:\n              p.append(i)\n\n      The problem does not specify the style. But the original code for program2 uses a colon and then a comment. So we can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n      But the problem says: the missing code. The TODO is at the end of the line. We can simply append the code after the colon? \n\n      Actually, the line currently is:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We can replace the entire line? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the TODO. \n\n      Alternatively, we can just write: p.append(i) and note that the condition is already there.\n\n      But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". The missing code is the body of the if. \n\n      However, the condition is already written. So we only need to write the body.\n\n      But the body is one statement: p.append(i)\n\n      So we write: \"    p.append(i)\" (with 4 spaces) for program2.\n\n      But note: the for loop is:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are to replace the TODO with the body. We can write:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      But that would be changing the existing line? \n\n      Alternatively, we can write the body without changing the condition. \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can write:\n\n          p.append(i)\n\n      and that's the only missing part? \n\n      But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n      Therefore, for program1, the missing block is two lines:\n\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      For program2, the missing block is one line:\n\n          p.append(i)\n\n      However, we must note the indentation:\n\n        For program1: \n          The for loop is already there. The two lines must be indented one level more.\n\n        For program2:\n          The if condition is already there. The line must be indented one level more than the if.\n\n      But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\n      Since the existing code in program1 uses 4 spaces? Actually, the original program1:\n\n          from itertools import accumulate\n          I=input;R=lambda:map(int,I().split())\n          n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n          for _ in range(q):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n              x,y=R()\n              print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      So the two lines are indented by 4 spaces (relative to the for) and then 4 more? Actually, the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. \n\n      Therefore, the two lines should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. However, the program1.py as given has the for loop and then a comment with 4 spaces of indentation. \n\n      We'll output:\n\n          program1: \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n\n      But note: the original code uses no extra spaces? Actually, the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. \n\n      Similarly, for program2:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to add a line after the if condition. We can write:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      But the problem says: only the missing code. The missing code is the line \"p.append(i)\" with 8 spaces? (4 for the for, 4 for the if) \n\n      Alternatively, we can write the body in the same line? \n\n      The problem does not specify. But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". \n\n      We'll output:\n\n          program1: \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n          program2: \"    p.append(i)\"\n\n      But wait: in program2, the if condition is already written. We are only adding the body. The body should be indented one more level. \n\n      However, the existing code in program2 has:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We can simply write the body in the same line? \n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n      But that would be changing the existing line? \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the TODO. \n\n      We have two options:\n\n        Option 1: replace the entire line of the if condition with:\n            if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n        Option 2: add a new line with the body.\n\n      The problem does not specify. But the TODO is at the end of the line. We can do either.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the body. \n\n      Since the condition is already written, we only need to write the body. \n\n      Therefore, we write the body as a new line? \n\n      But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n      We'll do:\n\n          program2: \"    p.append(i)\"\n\n      with 4 spaces (so that it is one more level than the if, which is already in the for loop that is indented by 4 spaces). \n\n      Actually, the for loop body (the line n=str(i)) is indented by 4 spaces. The if condition is also indented by 4 spaces. Then the body of the if should be 8 spaces? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. \n\n      However, the problem says: the code must run correctly. \n\n      We'll output:\n\n          program1: two lines, each indented by 4 spaces (relative to the for loop) -> so 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n          program2: one line, indented by 8 spaces? \n\n      But the original program2 has:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to add a line after the if condition? Actually, we can break the if condition and put the body in the next line. \n\n      How about:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:\n              p.append(i)\n\n      Then the body is one line with 8 spaces? \n\n      But the problem says: the TODO is at the end of the line. We are to fill in the TODO. \n\n      We can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:\n              p.append(i)\n\n      Then the existing line is changed? We break the line after the colon. \n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n      without changing the existing line? \n\n      The problem does not specify. \n\n      But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". The missing code is the body. \n\n      We'll output the body as a new line with 8 spaces. \n\n      However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n          program2: \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      But wait, that would be 8 spaces for program2? \n\n      Alternatively, we can output the body without the leading spaces? But the program requires indentation.\n\n      We must output the exact code that can be inserted.\n\n      Since the for loop in program2 is already indented by 4 spaces, and the if condition is also at 4 spaces, the body must be at 8 spaces.\n\n      So for program2: the missing code is one line: \"        p.append(i)\" (8 spaces).\n\n      But the problem says: the TODO is at the end of the line. We are to replace the TODO? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is a comment. We can simply remove the comment and put the body? \n\n      How about:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)   # without the comment\n\n      But the problem says: the missing code. The missing code is the body. \n\n      We'll do as follows:\n\n        For program1: \n            We output two lines (each with 4 spaces at the beginning) as a string with newline.\n\n        For program2:\n            We output one line: \"    p.append(i)\" (with 4 spaces) because the if condition is already at 4 spaces and we want the body to be at 8, but we are only outputting the body? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program2, the block we are missing is the body of the if. \n\n      We can output:\n\n          program2: \"    p.append(i)\"\n\n      but then when we insert it, we must insert it at the next line with 4 more spaces? \n\n      Alternatively, we can output the entire corrected line? \n\n      The problem is ambiguous. \n\n      Let me re-read: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n      For program2, the block we must fill in is the body of the if. So we output the body with the necessary indentation. \n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: \n              \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n\n          program2: \n              \"    p.append(i)\"   -> but this is not enough because the body must be indented one more level.\n\n      Actually, the existing code in program2 has:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to insert a line after the if condition. The inserted line should be:\n\n          (8 spaces) p.append(i)\n\n      So we output: \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      But note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n          program2: \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      However, for program2, we are replacing the TODO? We could also output:\n\n          program2: \"p.append(i)\"\n\n      and then the user would replace the TODO with that code? But then the indentation is not specified.\n\n      Given the ambiguity, I will follow the structure:\n\n        For program1: \n            The for loop body is two lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n        For program2:\n            The body of the if is one line, indented by 8 spaces.\n\n      But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". The missing code for program2 is the body of the if, which is one line at 8 spaces.\n\n      So the final answer:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\"}\n\n      However, let me test with the examples.\n\n      For program1: \n          The code after completion:\n\n            from itertools import accumulate\n            I=input;R=lambda:map(int,I().split())\n            n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n            for _ in range(q):\n                x,y=R()\n                print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n      This should work.\n\n      For program2:\n\n          R=range\n          m=40001\n          d=10**9+7\n          p=[]\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n          a=[1]+[0]*m\n          for i in p:\n              for j in R(i,m):\n                  a[j]+=a[j-i];a[j]%=d\n          for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\n      We are to replace the TODO with a line that has 8 spaces and then \"p.append(i)\"? \n\n      But that would be:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      But that is not valid: the if condition has a comment and then a colon and then a body? Actually, the body is the next line. \n\n      Alternatively, we can remove the comment and put the body in the same line? \n\n      The problem says: the TODO is to be filled. We can do:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      How do we achieve that? \n\n      We must output the body as a new line with 8 spaces. And we must remove the TODO comment? \n\n      But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are not to change the existing code? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is part of the existing code. We are to fill in the missing block. \n\n      We can output:\n\n          program2: \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      and then when inserted, it becomes:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      But that is not what we want. The condition has a comment and then the body is the next line. \n\n      We want to remove the TODO comment? \n\n      The problem does not say. \n\n      Alternatively, we can output for program2: the entire corrected block? \n\n      But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n      We can output for program2: two lines? \n\n          the corrected if condition line and the body? \n\n      But that would be:\n\n          \"    if n==n[::-1]:\\n        p.append(i)\"\n\n      Then we replace the existing if condition line with these two lines.\n\n      This would be:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      This is clean.\n\n      How about we do that? \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are missing two lines? \n\n      But the existing if condition line is already there. We are to change it to two lines? \n\n      The problem says: \"fill in\". We are filling in the body, but we also need to break the line. \n\n      Given the ambiguity, I think the intended solution for program2 is to have the body in a new line. \n\n      Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n          \"    if n==n[::-1]:\\n        p.append(i)\"\n\n      But wait, the existing line is:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to replace that line with:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]:\n              p.append(i)\n\n      So the missing block is two lines? \n\n      But the problem says: the TODO is at the end of the line. \n\n      Alternatively, we can simply output the body and assume that the user will break the line and insert the body? \n\n      Given the constraints, I will output for program2: one line with 8 spaces: \"        p.append(i)\" and hope that the system inserts it as the next line.\n\n      But the problem says: the command runs correctly. \n\n      In Python, we can have:\n\n          if condition:  # comment\n              statement\n\n      This is valid. The condition is followed by a comment and then the next line is the body. \n\n      So if we leave the comment and then on the next line put the body (with 8 spaces), it will work.\n\n      Therefore, we can output for program2: \"        p.append(i)\" (with 8 spaces).\n\n      So the final answer:\n\n          program1: \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n          program2: \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      But note: the program2 code after insertion:\n\n          for i in R(1,m):\n              n=str(i)\n              if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n                  p.append(i)\n\n      This is valid Python? \n          The condition line has a comment, and then the next line is the body. This is allowed.\n\n      Therefore, we'll do that.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\". The missing code for program2 is only the body, not the comment. \n\n      So we output the body with the necessary indentation.\n\n      Summary:\n\n        program1: two lines (each with 4 spaces) \n            \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n\n        program2: one line (with 8 spaces)\n            \"        p.append(i)\"\n\n      We output as a json string.\n\n      Example output:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\"}\n\n      But note: the newline in program1 must be represented as \\n.\n\n      We are to output a json string, so we must escape the newline.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then in the format: a json with two keys.\n\n      We'll output a valid json.\n\n      Let me write the json:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\",\n            \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\"\n          }\n\n      But without the newlines and spaces? \n\n      We can write it in one line.\n\n      However, the problem does not specify the format of the json. We'll output a compact json.\n\n      Final output:\n\n          {\"program1\": \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\", \"program2\": \"        p.append(i)\"}\n\n      But wait: in program1, the print statement: we are printing an integer. The problem says: for each query, print a single integer. \n\n      This is correct.\n\n      In program2, we are appending i to the list p. \n\n      This is correct.\n\n      We are done."
