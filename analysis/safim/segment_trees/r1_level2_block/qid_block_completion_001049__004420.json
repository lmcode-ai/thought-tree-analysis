Summary:\n\n        For program1.py: the missing line is:\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        For program2.py: the missing block is:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        We output in JSON format:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n          \"program2\": \"                swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n                r += 1 + swaps\\n                m += swaps\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1.py missing line is inside an if block and indented.",

Consider: \n            f(m) = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m.\n\n        Since m is the maximum frequency, then for any other frequency m' we have m' <= m, so:\n\n            ceil(n/m') >= ceil(n/m) [because m'<=m -> n/m' >= n/m -> ceil(n/m') >= ceil(n/m)]\n\n            and n - m' >= n - m.\n\n        Therefore, f(m') = ceil(n/m') - 1 + n - m' >= ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m = f(m). So the minimal operations is achieved when m is the maximum frequency. Therefore, we can use m = max frequency. Then we need to compute:\n\n            r = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m\n\n        But note: the while loop condition: while m<n. Then we do something? Actually, the code sets r=0 initially and then in the while loop we update r and m? But the problem does not require iterative steps? The example: n=6, m=2 -> then r = ceil(6/2)-1 + 6-2 = 3-1+4 = 6.\n\n        How to compute ceil(n/m)? ceil(n/m) = (n + m - 1) // m   [if n and m are positive integers] So: r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m.

Why?\n\n        Let me read the note again: the example did:\n\n          Step 1: clone -> now two arrays. Then we swap two elements (so two swaps? but one swap operation swaps two elements) -> actually, they did two swaps? But the problem says one swap operation swaps two elements. So they did two swap operations? Then they did a second clone? Then two more swaps? So total 6 operations. But the formula: 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        The while loop: \n\n            r=0\n            while m < n:\n                # we are going to simulate the operations? Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            r = 0\n            # Let k = number of clone operations = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n            # Then total operations = k + (n - m)\n\n            r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n\n        But note: if we do that, we don't need a while loop.

But the problem: the total n over test cases is 100000, and the sum of n is 100000, but the while loop might run O(n) per test case, and the total n is 100000, so worst-case 100000 test cases? But the input says t<=10000 and the sum of n<=100000. So the while loop over m doubling would run at most O(log(n)) per test case? How does m grow? Initially: m0 = max frequency. Then after one iteration: m1 = m0 + min(m0, n-m0) = min(2*m0, n)\n\n            Then m doubles each time? So the number of iterations is O(log(n)). Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                #",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is (length) if the sum is positive, 0 if zero, and -(length) if negative.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and segment trees (or Fenwick trees) to solve the problem. The key idea is to use DP where dp[i] is the maximum value we can get for the prefix ending at i.\n\nThe recurrence is:\ndp[i] = max( \n    dp[j] + sign(i, j) * (i - j)   for j in [0, i-1],\n    and also we consider the case when the entire segment from j+1 to i is taken as one segment.\n\nBut note: the sign depends on the sum of the segment from j+1 to i.\n\nWe can rewrite the value for a segment from j+1 to i as:\n   value = (i - j) if (pref[i]-pref[j] > 0) \n            0 if (pref[i]-pref[j] == 0)\n            -(i - j) if (pref[i]-pref[j] < 0)\n\nSo:\ndp[i] = max_{0<=j<i} { \n    dp[j] + (i-j)   if pref[i] > pref[j],\n    dp[j]           if pref[i] == pref[j],\n    dp[j] - (i-j)   if pref[i] < pref[j]\n}\n\nWe can break this into three cases and use data structures to compute the maximum efficiently.\n\nThe provided code uses two Fenwick trees (or one Fenwick and a dictionary) and coordinate compression for the prefix sums.\n\nWe have:\npref[0] = 0, pref[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1}\n\nThe code does:\n- It computes the prefix array.\n- It sorts the prefix array for two orders: one for positive and one for negative? Actually, it creates two sorted lists:\n   spos: sorted by (pref[i], -i)   [so that if two prefix are equal, the one with larger index comes first? Actually, note: we use -i so that when we sort, for the same prefix, the one with larger i (i.e., smaller negative) comes first? But then we assign ordpos and ordneg.\n\nActually, the two sorted lists are:\n   spos = sorted([(pref[i], -i) for i in range(n+1)])\n   sneg = sorted([(pref[i], i) for i in range(n+1)])\n\nThen it assigns:\n   ordpos[i] = the rank (starting index) of the pair (pref[i], -i) in spos.\n   ordneg[i] = the rank of the pair (pref[i], i) in sneg.\n\nThen we have two Fenwick trees: pfen and nfen.\n\nWe also have a dictionary dmx that maps a prefix value to the best dp[j] for j with that prefix.\n\nThe dp recurrence is computed as:\n\ndp[i] = max(\n   i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]),   # this corresponds to the case when pref[i] > pref[j] (because we are using the sorted order for positive? Actually, note: in the Fenwick tree for positive, we store dp[j]-j for j. Then when we query for indices j with ordpos[j] <= ordpos[i] (but note: we are using Fenwick tree for maximum prefix, and we are storing at the position of j's rank. However, we want j such that pref[j] < pref[i] OR pref[j] <= pref[i]? Actually, the condition for the positive case is pref[i] > pref[j]. But in the sorted list spos, if we take all j with rank less than the rank of i, then we have pref[j] <= pref[i]? But we need to separate by strict inequality.\n\nBut note: the code uses:\n   dp[i] = max(i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), ...)\n\nWait, the code has:\n   dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n\nSo three cases:\n\n1. Case when pref[i] > pref[j]: then we want to maximize dp[j] + (i-j) = (dp[j]-j) + i.\n   We store in pfen: at position ordpos[j] (which is the rank of (pref[j], -j)) the value (dp[j]-j). Then we query the maximum value for all j with ordpos[j] <= ordpos[i]? But note: the Fenwick tree pfen is queried with pfen.max(ordpos[i]). However, the rank in spos: if we have the same prefix, then the one with larger j (i.e., smaller negative) has a higher rank? Actually, we sorted by (pref, -j). So for the same prefix, a larger j (which is represented by a smaller negative) is considered larger? So when we do the Fenwick tree, we are storing by the rank. The query pfen.max(ordpos[i]) returns the maximum value for j with rank <= ordpos[i]. But note: if there are multiple j with the same prefix, we want to consider all? However, the condition for the positive case is pref[j] < pref[i]. But if pref[j] = pref[i], then we are in the zero case, not positive. So we must avoid including j with pref[j] = pref[i] in the positive case.\n\nBut the code does not do that. Instead, it uses a separate dictionary for the equal case.\n\nSo the three cases are:\n\n- Case 1: pref[j] < pref[i] -> then we use dp[j] + (i-j) = (dp[j]-j) + i. We store (dp[j]-j) in the Fenwick tree for positive (pfen) at the rank of j (in the sorted list of prefixes, and for the same prefix, we break by j?).\n\n- Case 2: pref[j] > pref[i] -> then we use dp[j] - (i-j) = (dp[j]+j) - i. We store (dp[j]+j) in the Fenwick tree for negative (nfen) at the rank of j (in the sorted list of prefixes, but in the negative case we use a different ordering? Actually, the negative case uses sneg which is sorted by (pref, j). Then we query for j with pref[j] > pref[i]? But note: the query in nfen is done with n+1 - ordneg[i]. Why?\n\nActually, the negative case: we want j such that pref[j] > pref[i]. In the sorted list sneg, the indices are sorted by pref in increasing order. So if we want pref[j] > pref[i], then we need the indices j that have a rank greater than the rank of i in sneg. But the Fenwick tree we built for nfen is a Fenwick tree that supports maximum prefix queries for indices from 1 to n+1. We store the value at the position: n+1 - ordneg[j] (so that the higher rank in sneg becomes a lower index in the Fenwick tree). Then we can query the Fenwick tree for indices from 1 to (n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1) to get the j with rank in sneg greater than i? Actually, we are storing at position = n+1 - ordneg[j]. Then when we query the Fenwick tree at position = n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1? But the code does: nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i]). That doesn't seem to exclude the equal ones.\n\nBut note: the negative case condition is pref[j] > pref[i]. In the sorted list sneg, if two have the same prefix, then we break by j? Actually, sneg is sorted by (pref, j). So if pref[j] = pref[i], then we compare j. But we don't want j with pref[j] = pref[i] in the negative case. So we must avoid them.\n\nThe code uses a third case: the dictionary dmx for the equal case: when pref[j] = pref[i]. Then the value is dp[j] (because the segment value is 0).\n\nSo the three cases are:\n\n   Case 1: j with pref[j] < pref[i] -> use pfen: we want max_{j: pref[j] < pref[i]} (dp[j]-j) and then add i.\n   Case 2: j with pref[j] > pref[i] -> use nfen: we want max_{j: pref[j] > pref[i]} (dp[j]+j) and then subtract i.\n   Case 3: j with pref[j] = pref[i] -> use dmx: we want max_{j: pref[j] = pref[i]} dp[j]\n\nBut the current code for the Fenwick trees does not separate by strict inequality? Actually, the way the ranks are assigned, we have:\n\n   In spos: sorted by (pref, -j). So if we have two indices j and k with the same pref, then the one with larger j (so -j is smaller) comes earlier? Actually, when we sort, (pref, -j) for the same pref: a larger j (so -j is more negative) would be considered smaller? Actually, no: in Python, when we compare tuples, (x, y) and (x, z): if x are equal, then we compare y. So for the same pref, we compare -j. Since j is the index, and we want to break ties so that we don't include the same prefix in the positive case? Actually, we want to include only j with pref[j] < pref[i] in the positive case. So if we have the same pref, we don't want to include them in the positive case. Therefore, when we assign the rank, we can do:\n\n   In the positive Fenwick tree, we store the value at the rank of j. Then when we query for the positive case, we want to query the ranks that are strictly less than the rank of the first occurrence of pref[i]? But the code does:\n\n        pfen.max(ordpos[i])\n\n   This includes all j with rank <= ordpos[i]. But if there are j with the same pref as i, they have the same pref and hence the same value in the tuple? But note: the tuple is (pref, -j). For the same pref, the j with a larger index (so -j is more negative) will have a lower tuple? Actually, no: for the same pref, we compare -j. A larger j (say j1) and a smaller j (j0) with j1>j0: then -j1 < -j0. So in the sorted list, the tuple (pref, -j1) is less than (pref, -j0). So the index j1 (larger) will come before j0 (smaller) in the sorted list? Then the rank of j1 is lower than j0? Then when we query for i (which has a tuple (pref[i], -i)), we get all j with tuple <= (pref[i], -i). This includes j with the same pref and index >= i? Actually, no: because we have the same pref, then we compare -j. For j with the same pref and j < i, then -j > -i? So the tuple (pref, -j) for j < i is (pref, -j) and since j < i, then -j > -i? So (pref, -j) > (pref, -i). Therefore, j with the same pref and j < i would have a higher rank? So they are not included in the query for indices <= ordpos[i]? Actually, the rank of i in spos is the position of (pref[i], -i). Then any j with the same pref and j < i has a tuple (pref[i], -j) and since j < i, then -j > -i, so (pref[i], -j) > (pref[i], -i). Therefore, they have a higher rank? So they are not included in the Fenwick tree query for indices <= ordpos[i]. Therefore, the query for pfen at ordpos[i] only includes j with (pref[j], -j) <= (pref[i], -i). But note: if pref[j] < pref[i], then (pref[j], ...) < (pref[i], ...) so they are included. And if pref[j] = pref[i] and j>=i, then (pref[j], -j) <= (pref[i], -i) because j>=i -> -j<=-i -> so the tuple is <=? But note: we are iterating i from 0 to n. And j must be < i. So j>=i doesn't occur? Actually, j runs from 0 to i-1. So j is always less than i. Therefore, for the same pref, j < i: then (pref, -j) > (pref, -i). So they are not included. Therefore, the query for pfen at ordpos[i] includes only j with pref[j] < pref[i]. Similarly, for the negative case:\n\n   We have sneg: sorted by (pref, j). Then for a given i, we have the tuple (pref[i], i). We want j with pref[j] > pref[i]. In sneg, the indices j with pref[j] > pref[i] have a higher rank. But we store in nfen at position = n+1 - ordneg[j]. Then we query nfen for the range [1, n+1 - ordneg[i] - 1]? But the code does:\n\n        nfen.max(n+1 - ordneg[i])\n\n   This query returns the maximum value in the Fenwick tree for indices from 1 to n+1 - ordneg[i]. But note: the rank in sneg: if j has a higher rank (meaning a larger index in the sorted list) then n+1 - ordneg[j] is smaller. So we want to include j with rank > ordneg[i] (because that means pref[j] > pref[i] or if same pref then j>i? but we don't want same pref). Actually, for the same pref, we break by j: so if j has the same pref as i and j < i, then (pref, j) < (pref, i) so it has a lower rank? Then we don't want to include it. But we want j with pref[j] > pref[i]. So we want j with rank in sneg greater than the rank of i. But the Fenwick tree nfen is built so that we store the value at position = n+1 - ordneg[j]. Then the query for n+1 - ordneg[i] would include positions from 1 to n+1 - ordneg[i]. The j that have ordneg[j] >= ordneg[i] (i.e., j that are at least as large as i in the sorted order) would be stored at positions n+1 - ordneg[j] <= n+1 - ordneg[i]. But we want j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i] (so that pref[j] > pref[i] or if same pref then j>i? but we don't want same). Actually, the condition for the negative case is pref[j] > pref[i]. So if pref[j] > pref[i], then in sneg, j has a higher rank (larger index) than i. So ordneg[j] > ordneg[i]. Then the position in the Fenwick tree: n+1 - ordneg[j] < n+1 - ordneg[i]. Therefore, the query for n+1 - ordneg[i] includes all j with ordneg[j] >= ordneg[i]? Actually, no: the Fenwick tree is built for indices 1..(n+1). We store at position = n+1 - ordneg[j]. Then the j with ordneg[j] = ordneg[i] is stored at position = n+1 - ordneg[i]. The j with ordneg[j] > ordneg[i] are stored at positions < n+1 - ordneg[i]. So the query for n+1 - ordneg[i] includes:\n\n   positions 1 to n+1 - ordneg[i]: which includes j with ordneg[j] >= ordneg[i]? Actually, no: because the position in the Fenwick tree is n+1 - ordneg[j]. The j with ordneg[j] = ordneg[i] is included. But we don't want that because we are in the negative case and we require pref[j] > pref[i]. So we must avoid the same prefix.\n\nBut note: the dictionary dmx already handles the same prefix. And for the negative case, we only want j with pref[j] > pref[i]. Therefore, we should not include j with the same prefix. However, the way we break ties in sneg: for the same pref, we use j. So if j has the same pref as i, then:\n\n   if j < i: then (pref, j) < (pref, i) -> so ordneg[j] < ordneg[i] -> then the position in the Fenwick tree: n+1 - ordneg[j] > n+1 - ordneg[i] -> so it is not included in the query for n+1 - ordneg[i]? Actually, the query for n+1 - ordneg[i] only includes positions <= n+1 - ordneg[i]. The j with the same pref and j>i: then (pref, j) > (pref, i) -> so ordneg[j] > ordneg[i] -> then the position in the Fenwick tree: n+1 - ordneg[j] < n+1 - ordneg[i] -> so it is included? But we don't want the same pref in the negative case.\n\nTherefore, we must adjust the negative Fenwick tree to not include the same prefix. The code does not do that. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can do a coordinate compression that breaks ties so that the same prefix gets the same rank? Actually, we are breaking ties by j. So the same prefix gets different ranks.\n\nBut the negative case condition is pref[j] > pref[i]. So we want to exclude j with pref[j] == pref[i]. Therefore, we should query for j with rank in sneg strictly greater than the rank of the last occurrence of pref[i]? Actually, we don't have the last occurrence, but we can note that the rank of i in sneg is the position of (pref[i], i). Then any j with the same pref and j>i has a higher rank? So we want to include j with rank > the maximum rank for the same pref? Actually, we don't know that. But we can adjust the query: we want j with rank > the rank of the last element with value pref[i]. But we don't know that.\n\nAlternatively, we can do: in the negative Fenwick tree, we store the value only for j that have pref[j] > pref[i]? But we are storing all j. Then when we query, we are including j with the same pref? How to avoid?\n\nThe code does not avoid it. But note: the value for j with the same pref is stored in the dictionary dmx, and we are not using the negative Fenwick tree for the same pref. So if we include a j with the same pref in the negative Fenwick tree, then the value (dp[j]+j) might be high, but then we subtract i and get a value that is not valid because the condition is not met. However, the condition for the negative case is pref[j] > pref[i]. So if we have a j with the same pref, then we are not in the negative case. Therefore, we must not include j with the same pref in the negative Fenwick tree? But the code does include them.\n\nThis might be a bug. But note: the problem constraints and the fact that the total n is 500000, and the note that the sum of n over test cases is 500000, so we can do a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   We break the three cases by:\n\n      Case 1: pref[j] < pref[i] -> use pfen: we store (dp[j]-j) at the rank of pref[j] (without j) and then we query for all ranks < the rank of pref[i] (without considering j). But then we need to break ties arbitrarily? Actually, we can compress the prefix values and then use the rank of the prefix value (ignoring j). Then:\n\n        Let comp = sorted(set(pref))\n        Then for a given j, we know the rank of pref[j] in comp.\n\n        Then for the positive case: we want j with pref[j] < pref[i] -> so we query the Fenwick tree for the range [1, rank(pref[i])-1].\n\n        Similarly, for the negative case: we want j with pref[j] > pref[i] -> so we query the Fenwick tree for the range [rank(pref[i])+1, n].\n\n        And for the equal case: we use a dictionary: dmx[pref[j]] = max(dmx.get(pref[j], -INF), dp[j])\n\nBut the provided code does not do that. It uses two different sorted lists that break ties by j. Why? Because we want to avoid including j with the same pref in the positive and negative cases? Actually, the provided code does break ties by j, so that each j has a unique rank. Then the positive Fenwick tree only includes j with (pref[j], -j) <= (pref[i], -i). But as argued, for the same pref, j with j>=i are included? But j must be < i. So for the same pref, j with j>=i are not present (because j runs from 0 to i-1). Therefore, the only j with the same pref that we have are j with j < i, and they are not included in the positive Fenwick tree query because they have a higher tuple. Similarly, in the negative Fenwick tree, j with the same pref and j>i are not present (because j < i). So the only j with the same pref that we have are j with j < i, and they have a lower tuple in sneg? So they are not included in the negative Fenwick tree query? Actually, in sneg, the tuple is (pref, j). For the same pref, j < i: then (pref, j) < (pref, i). So they have a lower rank. Then the negative Fenwick tree query for n+1 - ordneg[i] includes positions from 1 to n+1 - ordneg[i]. The j with the same pref and j < i have ordneg[j] < ordneg[i] (because (pref, j) < (pref, i)), so n+1 - ordneg[j] > n+1 - ordneg[i]. Therefore, they are not included in the query (which is for indices <= n+1 - ordneg[i]). So the negative Fenwick tree query does not include j with the same pref.\n\nTherefore, the code is safe.\n\nNow, the missing part in program1.py is the inner loop. The code has:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to update the dictionary dmx. The dictionary dmx stores for a given prefix value, the maximum dp[j] for j with that prefix. So we do:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: we are iterating i from 0 to n. We initialized dmx[0]=0 (for i=0). Then for i>=1, we update.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut the if condition is written, so we can do:\n\n            if pref[i] in dmx:\n                if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n            else:\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the code uses:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nThis is equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the missing line in program1.py is:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has the line:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must fill the TODO. So we write:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nDescription: We are given an array. We can do two operations: clone an array, or swap two elements from any two arrays (at any positions). We want the minimal number of operations to get one copy with all elements equal.\n\nThe note provides an example. The idea:\n\n   Let the target copy have all elements equal to x. Then we need to gather k (the length of the array) copies of x in one array. Initially, we have one copy of the array. We can clone to get more arrays, and then swap elements between arrays.\n\n   How many operations?\n\n   Operation 1: cloning. Each clone operation adds one array.\n\n   Operation 2: swapping. Each swap operation swaps two elements.\n\n   We start with one array. We can do:\n\n      Operation 1: clone the array -> now we have two arrays.\n      Then we can swap elements between the two arrays.\n\n   The goal: one array has all elements equal to x.\n\n   How many times does x appear in the entire multiset? Initially, we have one array. When we clone, we duplicate the entire array. But note: we can do multiple clones. However, we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can move all the x's from all the arrays into one array.\n\n   Let f(x) = frequency of x in the original array.\n\n   After k clone operations, we have k+1 arrays. The total number of x's is f(x) * (k+1). We need to have at least n copies of x in one array (because the array has n elements). Therefore:\n\n        f(x) * (k+1) >= n\n\n   But note: we can also swap in x's from other arrays? Actually, we can only swap elements that exist. The total number of x's in the entire system is f(x) * (k+1). We need to have at least n of them in one array. But we can move them arbitrarily. So the condition is that the total number of x's must be at least n.\n\n        f(x) * (k+1) >= n   =>   k >= ceil(n / f(x)) - 1.\n\n   Then the number of clone operations is k = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1.\n\n   Then we need swap operations: we start with one array that has f(x) copies of x. Then we clone k times, so we have k+1 arrays, each initially having f(x) copies of x. Then we need to move x's from the other arrays to the target array. The target array initially has f(x) copies. We need n - f(x) more. Each swap operation can bring one x from another array to the target array? But note: when we swap, we take an x from another array and put it in the target array, and we put some other element in its place. But we can also swap within the same array? Actually, the problem allows swapping from any two arrays (maybe the same) and any positions.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to only moving x's. We can also swap non-x elements out of the target array. But the target array initially has f(x) x's and n - f(x) non-x's. We want to replace the non-x's with x's. For each non-x element in the target array, we can swap it with an x from another array. That would take one swap per non-x. So we need n - f(x) swaps.\n\n   But wait: we can also use multiple swaps? Actually, the minimal number of swaps is exactly the number of non-x in the target array? But we can also do:\n\n      We can swap two non-x elements? That doesn't help. We can swap an x from the target array with a non-x from another array? That would reduce the number of x's in the target array, which is bad.\n\n   Therefore, the best is to swap each non-x in the target array with an x from another array. That requires n - f(x) swaps.\n\n   However, note: we might not have enough x's in the other arrays? But the total number of x's is f(x)*(k+1). We are using n of them in the target array. Since we have at least n x's (because k was chosen so that f(x)*(k+1)>=n), we have enough.\n\n   Therefore, the total operations is:\n\n        clone operations: k = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1\n        swap operations: n - f(x)\n\n        total = k + (n - f(x)) = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1 + n - f(x)\n\n   But note: we can choose x arbitrarily. We want the minimal total operations over all x that appear in the array.\n\n   However, the example: \n        [0,1,3,3,7,0] \n        They chose x=0. Then f(0)=2.\n        k = ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1 = 2.\n        swaps = 6-2 = 4.\n        total = 2+4 = 6.\n\n   But the example says 6 operations.\n\n   However, the example also shows:\n\n        Operation 1: clone -> 2 arrays.\n        Then they do 4 swaps? Actually, the example does 4 swaps? But then they do a second clone? Then two more swaps? Actually, the example does:\n\n          Step 1: clone -> 2 arrays.\n          Step 2: swap two elements (so two swaps? but one swap operation swaps two elements) -> they did two swaps? Actually, the example says:\n\n            After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: \n            [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> that took two swaps? (they swapped two zeros from the second array with two non-zeros from the first array) -> that would be two swaps? But then they did:\n\n            Step 3: clone the first array -> now 3 arrays.\n            Step 4: swap two elements: they swapped two zeros from the first array with two non-zeros from the second array? Actually, they swapped two non-zeros (3 and 7) from the first array with two zeros from the second array? But the first array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] and the second array becomes [3,7,0,3,7,0]? \n\n          They say: \"swap elements in the first two copies\" -> that is one swap operation? But they swapped two pairs? Actually, one swap operation swaps two elements. They did two swaps? So total swaps: 2 (first step) + 2 (second step) = 4? Then total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions\" -> one swap operation swaps two elements.\n\n        Therefore, the total swaps is 4.\n\n        And the formula: 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        But the formula we have: k = ceil(6/2)-1 = 2, and swaps = 6-2 = 4 -> total 6.\n\n   However, wait: the example did two clone operations: one at the beginning and one later. So k=2.\n\n   Therefore, the total operations for x is: ceil(n/f(x)) - 1 + n - f(x)\n\n   Then we minimize this over all x that appear in the array.\n\n   But note: we can also choose not to do any operation? If the array is already all x, then we need 0 operations.\n\n   Now, the code:\n\n        from collections import*\n        for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n            while m<n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(r)\n\n   We are iterating over test cases. The input is read as: \n        t = first integer, then t test cases: each has n and then a list of n integers.\n\n   But note: the array a is read as strings. We split the line and then assign to a. Then we set n = len(a). Then m = max frequency of any element.\n\n   Then we set r=0. Then we have a while loop: while m < n.\n\n   The idea: if m==n, then the array is already constant -> r=0.\n\n   Otherwise, we need to compute the minimal operations.\n\n   How to compute? We have:\n\n        r = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m   ??? But note: we are minimizing over x? But the code sets m = max frequency. So we are using the x that has the maximum frequency. Why? Because the formula: ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m is minimized when m is as large as possible? \n\n        Let f(m) = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m.\n\n        We want to minimize f(m) over m in the set of frequencies? But note: the frequency m we are using is the maximum frequency. Is that optimal?\n\n        Consider: \n            f(m) = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m.\n\n        Since m is the maximum frequency, then for any other frequency m' we have m' <= m, so:\n\n            ceil(n/m') >= ceil(n/m)   [because m'<=m -> n/m' >= n/m -> ceil(n/m') >= ceil(n/m)]\n\n            and n - m' >= n - m.\n\n        Therefore, f(m') = ceil(n/m') - 1 + n - m' >= ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m = f(m).\n\n        So the minimal operations is achieved when m is the maximum frequency.\n\n        Therefore, we can use m = max frequency.\n\n        Then we need to compute:\n\n            r = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m\n\n        But note: the while loop condition: while m<n. Then we do something? Actually, the code sets r=0 initially and then in the while loop we update r and m? But the problem does not require iterative steps? \n\n        The example: n=6, m=2 -> then r = ceil(6/2)-1 + 6-2 = 3-1+4 = 6.\n\n        How to compute ceil(n/m)? \n\n            ceil(n/m) = (n + m - 1) // m   [if n and m are positive integers]\n\n        So: r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m.\n\n        But the code has a while loop. What is the while loop doing?\n\n        The code:\n\n            while m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then it prints r.\n\n        How can we avoid the while loop? We can compute r directly.\n\n        But the note: the total n over test cases is 100000, so we can do a direct formula.\n\n        However, the code structure has a while loop. Why?\n\n        Let me read the note again: the example did:\n\n          Step 1: clone -> now two arrays. Then we swap two elements (so two swaps? but one swap operation swaps two elements) -> actually, they did two swaps? But the problem says one swap operation swaps two elements. So they did two swap operations? Then they did a second clone? Then two more swaps? So total 6 operations.\n\n        But the formula: 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        The while loop: \n\n            r=0\n            while m < n:\n                # we are going to simulate the operations?\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            r = 0\n            # Let k = number of clone operations = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n            # Then total operations = k + (n - m)\n\n            r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n\n        But note: if we do that, we don't need a while loop.\n\n        Why is there a while loop? \n\n        The problem: we are allowed to do operations arbitrarily. The minimal operations is the formula above. But the example does:\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> r=1, then we have two arrays. Then we do two swaps? that would be two operations -> r=3? Then we do a clone -> r=4, then two swaps -> r=6.\n\n        But the formula gives 6.\n\n        The while loop condition: while m < n. Then we break when m>=n.\n\n        How can we simulate? \n\n          Initially, we have one array. We have m copies of the most frequent element.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Operation: clone -> now we have two arrays. Then we can swap: we can take one x from the new array and swap it with a non-x in the original array. Then the original array now has m+1 copies of x.\n\n          So after one clone and one swap, we have increased m by 1? \n\n          But note: we can do multiple swaps in one operation? Actually, one swap operation swaps two elements. So to get one more x in the target array, we need one swap.\n\n          Therefore, to get from m to m+1, we do one clone and one swap? But wait: we can use the same clone to get multiple x's? \n\n          Actually, after we clone, we have two arrays. We can swap as many times as we want. Each swap can bring one x from the clone to the target array. So we can do:\n\n            Clone: 1 operation -> now we have two arrays, each with m x's.\n            Then we do k swaps: each swap takes one x from the clone and puts it in the target array, and we put a non-x in the clone. Then the target array has m+k x's, and the clone has m-k x's.\n\n            But we cannot take more than m x's from the clone? So k <= m.\n\n          Then we can do up to m swaps? Then the target array becomes m+m = 2m x's? But we only need n x's. \n\n          Actually, we don't need to do all m swaps. We can do as many as needed until the target array has n x's.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations for one clone is: we can get up to m additional x's (if we do m swaps). But we only need n - m x's. So we can do:\n\n            If n - m <= m, then we can do one clone and then n-m swaps -> total operations = 1 + (n-m).\n\n            But if n - m > m, then we need more clones.\n\n          So:\n\n            Step 1: we do one clone -> now we have two arrays. Then we can do m swaps: then the target array becomes m + m = 2m x's. Operations: 1 (clone) + m (swaps) = m+1.\n\n            Then we still need n - 2m x's? Then we do:\n\n            Step 2: clone again -> now we have three arrays. Then we can do m swaps? But note: the new clone has 2m x's? Actually, no: when we clone, we clone the current state of the target array? But we are allowed to clone any array. We can clone the original array again? But the original array has been changed? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify which array we clone. We can choose any array at any time. And we can swap arbitrarily. So we can always clone the array that has the most x's? \n\n          Therefore, the process:\n\n            Let k = number of clone operations.\n            After k clones, we have k+1 arrays. The total number of x's is m*(k+1). We need to have at least n x's in the target array. But we can move at most m from each non-target array? Actually, we can move all x's from the other arrays to the target array? \n\n          However, the minimal operations is the formula: k + (n - m)   [because we need n-m additional x's, and each swap brings one x from another array to the target array]? But note: we can only move as many x's as exist in the other arrays. The total x's is m*(k+1). We leave at least m in the target array initially? Actually, we can move all x's from the other arrays to the target array. The only constraint is that the total x's must be at least n. So k must be at least ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m)-1? Then the total operations is k (clones) + (n-m) (swaps) = ceil(n/m)-1 + n-m.\n\n          This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m.\n\n        But the code has a while loop. Why? \n\n        The problem: the total n over test cases is 100000, but the while loop would run at most 100000 times per test case? And the sum of n is 100000, but the worst-case n per test case is 100000, and the while loop condition is while m<n, and m doubles? Actually, m starts at the maximum frequency. Then we do:\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # do something that increases m and counts operations\n\n        How to simulate? \n\n          We can simulate the process:\n\n            Let current number of arrays = 1.\n            Let current number of x's in the target array = m.\n\n            We want to get to at least n.\n\n            Operation 1: clone -> now arrays=2, operations++.\n            Then we can swap: we can swap up to min(m, n - m) times? But each swap gives one x to the target array. So we do:\n\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                m += swaps\n                r += swaps   # for the swaps\n\n                and we did one clone, so r++ for the clone.\n\n            But note: we can do the swaps one by one? Actually, we can do one swap per operation. So we can do:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    # if we haven't used the current clones to the maximum? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                r = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    # We do a clone operation: then we have one more array. Then we can swap up to m times (if we have m x's in the new array) to the target array.\n                    # But we only need n - m more.\n                    # How many swaps we do? We can do up to m swaps, but we only need n - m.\n                    # Actually, we can do as many swaps as we have x's in the non-target arrays? But after a clone, the new array has m x's. We can take all of them? But then the new array becomes 0 x's? That's allowed.\n\n                    # So we do:\n                    #   clone: r += 1\n                    #   then we swap min(m, n-m) times: \n                    #        r += min(m, n-m)\n                    #        m += min(m, n-m)\n\n                    # But note: we can do multiple clones and then multiple swaps? But the problem: we can do operations in any order. The minimal operations is the formula. \n\n            However, the formula is more efficient.\n\n        But the problem: the total n over test cases is 100000, and the sum of n is 100000, but the while loop might run O(n) per test case, and the total n is 100000, so worst-case 100000 test cases? But the input says t<=10000 and the sum of n<=100000. So the while loop over m doubling would run at most O(log(n)) per test case? \n\n        How does m grow? \n\n            Initially: m0 = max frequency.\n            Then after one iteration: m1 = m0 + min(m0, n-m0) = min(2*m0, n)\n\n            Then m doubles each time? So the number of iterations is O(log(n)).\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n            r = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # We do a clone operation: cost 1\n                # Then we can swap up to m times (because the new clone has m x's) to the target array. But we only need n-m more.\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1   # for the clone\n                r += swaps   # for the swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n            But wait: after the clone, we have two arrays. Then we do swaps: each swap moves one x from the new array to the target array. So we do 'swaps' swaps. Then the target array becomes m + swaps, and the new array loses swaps x's. But we don't care about the new array. Then we can discard the new array? Actually, we can use it again? But we are going to do another clone? \n\n            However, after we move the x's from the new array, it becomes less useful. But we can clone the target array again? \n\n            Actually, the next clone: we clone the target array (which now has m+swaps x's). Then we can move up to m+swaps x's from the new clone to the target array.\n\n            But note: we are not simulating the state of the entire system, only the number of x's in the target array.\n\n            Therefore, the simulation:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    # We do a clone: cost 1\n                    # Then we move as many x's as we can from the new clone to the target array, but limited by the number of x's in the clone (which is the current m) and the remaining need (n-m).\n                    swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += 1 + swaps   # one clone and 'swaps' swaps\n                    m += swaps\n\n            Then we break when m>=n.\n\n        Example: n=6, m=2.\n\n            Iteration1: \n                swaps = min(2, 4) = 2\n                r += 1+2 = 3 -> r=3\n                m = 2+2 = 4\n\n            Iteration2: \n                swaps = min(4, 2) = 2\n                r += 1+2 = 3 -> r=6\n                m = 4+2 = 6 -> break.\n\n            So r=6.\n\n        But the formula: ceil(6/2)-1 + 6-2 = 3-1+4 = 6.\n\n        Another example: n=3, m=1.\n\n            Iteration1:\n                swaps = min(1,2)=1\n                r=0+1+1=2\n                m=1+1=2\n\n            Iteration2:\n                swaps = min(2,1)=1\n                r=2+1+1=4\n                m=2+1=3 -> break.\n\n            Formula: ceil(3/1)-1 + 3-1 = 3-1+2 = 4.\n\n        Therefore, the simulation matches the formula.\n\n        But note: the formula: ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0, where m0 is the initial max frequency.\n\n        The simulation: \n            r = 0\n            m = m0\n            while m < n:\n                swaps = min(m, n-m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        We can prove that this equals: ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0.\n\n        However, we don't need to. We just fill the code.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1   # for the clone\n            # then we do 'swaps' swaps\n            swaps = min(m, n - m)\n            r += swaps\n            m += swaps\n\n        But note: we can write:\n\n            r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n            m += min(m, n-m)\n\n        So:\n\n            while m < n:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        This is the missing block.\n\n        However, the code has:\n\n            while m < n:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We write:\n\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But note: the variables: n and m are defined. \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But wait: the example in the problem: \n            Input: \n                3\n                4\n                1 1 2 2\n                5\n                1 2 3 4 5\n                6\n                0 1 3 3 7 0\n\n            For the first test case: n=4, m=2 (because two 1's and two 2's -> max frequency=2). Then:\n\n                while 2<4: \n                    swaps = min(2,2)=2\n                    r = 0+1+2 = 3\n                    m = 2+2=4 -> break.\n\n                Output: 3.\n\n            But what is the minimal operations?\n\n                We want to get an array of all 1's (or all 2's). \n                Operations:\n                    Clone: now two arrays.\n                    Then we swap: we need to swap two non-1's from the target array with two 1's from the other array? \n                    So two swaps: total operations = 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            So 3 is correct.\n\n            Second test case: n=5, m=1 (each element appears once). Then:\n\n                Iteration1: swaps = min(1,4)=1 -> r=0+1+1=2, m=1+1=2.\n                Iteration2: swaps = min(2,3)=2 -> r=2+1+2=5, m=2+2=4.\n                Iteration3: swaps = min(4,1)=1 -> r=5+1+1=7, m=4+1=5.\n\n                Output: 7.\n\n            Formula: ceil(5/1)-1 + 5-1 = 5-1+4 = 8? \n\n            But wait: the formula I gave: ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0 = ceil(5/1)-1 + 5-1 = 5-1+4=8.\n\n            But the simulation gives 7.\n\n            Why the discrepancy?\n\n            Let me do the simulation step by step for n=5, m0=1.\n\n                Start: target array: [1,2,3,4,5] -> m=1 (say we choose 1 as x).\n\n                Step1: clone -> now two arrays: [1,2,3,4,5] and [1,2,3,4,5]. \n                        Then we swap: we can swap one x from the second array to the target array? \n                        Swap the 1 in the second array with the 2 in the target array? \n                        Then target array becomes [1,1,3,4,5] -> now has two 1's. \n                        The second array becomes [2,2,3,4,5]. \n                        Operations: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2.\n\n                Now m=2.\n\n                Step2: clone the target array? -> now three arrays: \n                        Array1: [1,1,3,4,5]   (target)\n                        Array2: [2,2,3,4,5]\n                        Array3: [1,1,3,4,5]   (new clone)\n\n                Then we swap: we can swap two x's from the new clone to the target array? \n                        Swap the 3 in the target array with a 1 in the clone: \n                            Target: [1,1,1,4,5] -> m=3\n                            Clone: [3,1,3,4,5]\n                        Then swap the 4 in the target array with a 1 in the clone? \n                            Target: [1,1,1,1,5] -> m=4\n                            Clone: [3,3,3,4,5]\n                        So two swaps? Operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3, total=2+3=5.\n\n                Now m=4.\n\n                Step3: clone the target array? -> now four arrays.\n                        Array1: [1,1,1,1,5] \n                        Array2: [2,2,3,4,5]\n                        Array3: [3,3,3,4,5]\n                        Array4: [1,1,1,1,5]   (new clone)\n\n                Then we swap: we swap the 5 in the target array with a 1 in the new clone? \n                        Target: [1,1,1,1,1] -> done.\n                        Operation: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2, total=5+2=7.\n\n            So the simulation is 7.\n\n            But the formula: ceil(5/1)-1 + 5-1 = 5-1+4 = 8.\n\n            Why the difference? \n\n            The formula: ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0 = ceil(5/1)-1 + 5-1 = 4+4=8.\n\n            But the minimal operations is 7.\n\n            What went wrong? \n\n            The formula assumed that we can only move one x per swap? But we moved one x per swap. The total swaps was 1+2+1=4, and clones=3, total=7.\n\n            The formula: clones = ceil(5/1)-1 = 4, swaps = 5-1=4, total=8.\n\n            Why is the formula 8? \n\n            The formula: \n                clones = ceil(n/m0)-1 = ceil(5/1)-1 = 4.\n                swaps = n - m0 = 4.\n\n            But note: after we have 5 arrays (because 4 clones), the total x's is 1*5=5. We need to move 4 x's from the other arrays to the target array. But each swap moves one x. So we need 4 swaps. Total operations=4+4=8.\n\n            But the simulation did it in 7 operations. How? \n\n            The simulation did not use 4 clones. It used 3 clones. \n\n            Why is the formula for clones ceil(n/m0)-1? \n\n                We need the total x's to be at least n. Initially, we have m0=1. After k clones, we have k+1 arrays, so total x's = 1*(k+1). We need 1*(k+1) >= 5 -> k>=4.\n\n            But the simulation only used 3 clones. How did it get 5 x's? \n\n            After 3 clones, we have 4 arrays. The total x's is 1*4=4? But we have 5 x's in the target array? \n\n            Actually, the simulation did not preserve the x's in the other arrays. We moved x's from the clones to the target array. Then the clones lost x's. But then we cloned the target array (which had been augmented) so the new clone had more than one x? \n\n            Therefore, the formula for the total x's is not m0*(k+1) because we are moving x's around. The total number of x's is fixed: initially 1. Then we clone: we duplicate the entire array, so the total x's becomes 2. Then we move one x from the clone to the target array: then the target array has 2 x's, and the clone has 0. Then we clone the target array: now we have three arrays: the target has 2, the new clone has 2. Then we move two x's from the new clone to the target array: then the target array has 4, and the new clone has 0. Then we clone the target array: now we have four arrays: the target has 4, the new clone has 4. Then we move one x from the new clone to the target array: the target array has 5, and the new clone has 3. \n\n            The total x's in the entire system: 5 (in the target) + 0 (first clone) + 0 (second clone) + 3 (third clone) = 8? But initially we had one array with one x. Then we cloned three times: each clone duplicates an array that had at least one x? Actually, the first clone: duplicated the initial array (1 x). Then the second clone: duplicated the target array that had 2 x's. Then the third clone: duplicated the target array that had 4 x's. So the total x's: \n                Initially: 1\n                After first clone: 1 (original) + 1 (clone) = 2.\n                Then we moved one x from the clone to the target: so the original target becomes 2, the first clone becomes 0.\n                Then we clone the target (which has 2): so we add 2 -> total x's=2+0+2=4.\n                Then we move two x's from the new clone to the target: the target becomes 4, the new clone becomes 0 -> total x's=4.\n                Then we clone the target (which has 4): we add 4 -> total x's=4+0+0+4=8.\n\n            So the total x's is 8. We only need 5 in the target array. The formula for the number of clones: we need total x's >= n? 8>=5 -> so k=3 clones is enough.\n\n            The formula ceil(n/m0) is the minimal k+1 such that m0*(k+1) >= n. But 1*4=4<5 -> so we need k+1=5? Then k=4. But we did it with k=3. Why? \n\n            Because after we move x's to the target array, the arrays we clone later have more x's. Therefore, the total x's grows faster.\n\n            Therefore, the formula ceil(n/m0) is not the minimal number of clones needed. We have to account for the fact that we can clone an array that has been augmented.\n\n            The simulation we did: \n                m = current number of x's in the target array.\n                We do a clone: then we get a new array with m x's.\n                Then we can swap up to m x's from the new array to the target array, so the target array becomes m + min(m, n-m) = min(2*m, n).\n\n            This is the greedy approach: always clone the target array (which has the most x's) and then move as many as possible.\n\n            Therefore, the simulation is correct.\n\n            The formula we initially thought (ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0) is not correct because it does not account for the fact that we can get more x's by cloning an already augmented array.\n\n            Therefore, we must use the simulation.\n\n        So the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n            while m < n:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases is 100000. The while loop runs O(log(n)) per test case, and the total n is 100000, so the total iterations over all test cases is O( (number of test cases) * log(n) ). The number of test cases t<=10000, but the sum of n<=100000, so the total number of test cases is at most 100000? Actually, the sum of the lengths of the arrays is 100000. So the number of test cases is at most 100000? But the input says t<=10000 and the sum of n<=100000. So the worst-case is 10000 test cases, each with n=10. Then the while loop runs at most 4 iterations per test case -> 10000*4 = 40000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we fill the while loop as above.\n\n        However, the code in program2.py has:\n\n            n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\n        But note: the array a is split into strings. The frequency count: we are counting the frequency of the string representation. This is correct because the array elements are integers but read as strings? But the problem says integers, but the example has negative numbers? \n\n        The input: \n            The second line of each test case contains n integers.\n\n        The code: \n            a = a.split()   # list of strings\n\n        Then we do: \n            m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n        This counts the frequency of each string. But if the same integer appears as different strings? For example, the integer 0 and the string \"0\" are the same? But the input is read as string. So if the array is [0, -0] -> but there is no negative zero in integers. \n\n        But note: the integers can be negative. The string representation of negative numbers will have a minus sign. So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        So the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        But note: the variable 'n' is the length of the array, and 'm' is the max frequency. \n\n        We are done.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        For program1.py: the missing line is:\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n        For program2.py: the missing block is:\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n        We output in JSON format:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n          \"program2\": \"                swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n                r += 1 + swaps\\n                m += swaps\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the program1.py missing line is inside an if block and indented. We must preserve the indentation.\n\n        However, the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing code is exactly one line: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n        But the context:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the line.\n\n        For program2.py, the missing code is three lines.\n\n        We output as JSON.\n\n        Let me write the exact strings.\n\n        For program1: the missing line is: \"                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n        For program2: the missing block is: \"                swaps = min(m, n - m)\\n                r += 1 + swaps\\n                m += swaps\"\n\n        But note: the program2 block has three lines. We use a newline to separate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write the three lines as three separate strings?
