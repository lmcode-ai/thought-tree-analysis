    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b (initially zeros) strictly increasing by performing moves that either add or subtract a_i to b_i.\n\nThe provided code has several functions and a main part. However, the function `e` has a TODO. Also, the overall logic might be incomplete.\n\nAfter reading the problem, we note that the problem is known and can be solved by dynamic programming. The idea is to let dp[i][j] be the minimum moves to have the first i elements increasing and the i-th element being exactly j (but j can be very large). However, note that the moves change b_i by multiples of a_i. Therefore, we can note that b_i must be of the form k * a_i for some integer k (positive or negative). But note: we are allowed to do multiple moves on the same index? Actually, the problem does not say we can only do one move per index. We can do multiple moves on the same index. Therefore, for index i, the value of b_i can be any multiple of a_i (positive or negative).\n\nHowever, the constraints (n up to 5000) and the fact that a_i can be as large as 10^9 make it impossible to iterate over all multiples.\n\nAlternative approach: \nWe want to assign a value to each b_i: b_i = x_i * a_i, where x_i is an integer (possibly negative). We require:\n  b_0 < b_1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\nWe wish to minimize the total moves: |x_0| + |x_1| + ... + |x_{n-1}|.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to choose any integers x_i. However, the condition is:\n  x_0 * a_0 < x_1 * a_1 < ... < x_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\n\nWe can try to use dynamic programming that iterates from left to right and for each position i, we consider the value of x_i and the condition that x_i * a_i > x_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. But the values can be huge.\n\nAnother known solution for this problem is to use the following idea:\n  We want to minimize the total moves. We can also note that we can set b_0 arbitrarily (by choosing x_0 appropriately) and then for each next element, we must have b_i > b_{i-1}. The minimal moves for the entire sequence is the sum of absolute values of the x_i.\n\nBut note: we can also adjust the entire sequence by shifting? However, the problem is non-trivial.\n\nKnown similar problem: \"Increasing by Modulo\" but that is modulo. This is absolute.\n\nAfter reading the provided code structure:\n\nThe code defines:\n  f(b, i) = e(b[::-1], i)\n  e(b, i): which has a TODO and then a loop that doesn't use i? and then returns a count.\n\nThen we have:\n  c(b, i) = e(b[i+1:], 0) + f(b[:i], 0)\n\nIn the main:\n  We read n and the array b (which is actually the array a in the problem).\n  Then we set d = c(b, 1)\n  Then for i from 2 to a-2 (i.e., n-2) we do d = min(d, c(b, i))\n\nThis suggests that the function c(b, i) is computing the cost for a configuration that fixes the element at index i as the \"center\" and then independently solves the left and the right.\n\nBut the function e is defined for a list b and an index i (which is not used in the body). The body of e does:\n\n  if b == []: ... (we must complete this)\n  count = 0\n  ggg = [0] * len(b)\n  for i in range(len(b)):\n      ggg[i] = (b[i-1] * ggg[i-1]) // b[i] + 1\n      count += ggg[i]\n\nThis loop uses i from 0 to len(b)-1, but then uses b[i-1] and ggg[i-1] at i=0: that would be b[-1] and ggg[-1] (the last element). That doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the provided code structure is incomplete and possibly incorrect, we must reconsider.\n\nLooking at known solutions for the problem \"Minimum moves to make increasing\" (or similar) we find:\n\nThere is a known solution for this exact problem on CodeForces: \n  Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1667/problem/A?locale=en\n  Solution: \n\nWe can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the minimal total moves for the prefix ending at i, and the i-th element is set to j (but j is too big). Instead, we note that the value of b_i must be a multiple of a_i, and we can use the fact that the relative ordering of the multiples matters.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a different state: let dp[i] be the minimal moves for the prefix ending at i, and we do not fix the value. But then we need to know the last value.\n\nAnother idea: we can set the entire sequence to be as close to zero as possible? But the condition is strictly increasing.\n\nKnown solution in C++ for the same problem:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long ll;\nconst int N = 5005;\nconst ll inf = 1e18;\nll a[N], dp[N][N];\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) dp[i][j] = inf;\n    dp[0][0] = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        ll mn = inf;\n        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {\n            mn = min(mn, dp[i-1][j]);\n            if (j <= a[i]) \n                dp[i][j] = mn + abs(a[i] - j);\n            else \n                dp[i][j] = mn + abs(a[i] - j);\n        }\n    }\n    ll ans = inf;\n    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) ans = min(ans, dp[n][j]);\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut note: this solution is not for the same problem? The above does not consider that we can do multiple moves on the same index? And the moves are adding or subtracting a_i? Actually, the problem allows multiple moves. The value at index i is set to x_i * a_i. The above solution seems to set the value to j (which is an integer between 0 and n) and then the cost is |a_i - j|? That doesn't match.\n\nAfter rethinking: the problem states that we start with b_i=0 and we can do operations: add a_i or subtract a_i. Therefore, the value of b_i must be a multiple of a_i. So the above solution that sets b_i to j (which is not necessarily a multiple of a_i) is invalid.\n\nAnother known solution (from a known contest):\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 10**18\nfor i in range(n):\n    prev = 0\n    cur = 0\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        # How many moves to make a[j] greater than prev?\n        # We need b[j] > prev\n        # b[j] must be a multiple of a[j]. We can choose the smallest multiple of a[j] that is greater than prev.\n        # Let k = ceil(prev / a[j]) \n        # Then b[j] = k * a[j]\n        # moves = |k| (because we do k moves: if k positive then add k times, if negative then subtract |k| times)\n        # But note: k can be negative? Actually, we can also use negative multiples. However, we want to minimize |k| and also satisfy k * a[j] > prev.\n        # We can also consider negative multiples? But if prev is positive, then negative multiples would be less than prev. So we only consider positive multiples? \n        # However, if we are at the first element, we might set it to negative? \n        # But the problem does not require the first element to be positive. So we must consider both.\n\n        # Actually, the known solution for the problem \"A. Make it Increasing\" (Codeforces Round 783) is:\n\n        # Let's fix the position that we set to 0. Then we can compute the moves for the entire array.\n\n        # However, the problem does not require any element to be zero. We require strictly increasing.\n\n        # Known solution from a participant:\n\n        # n = int(input())\n        # a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # res = 10**18\n        # for i in range(n):\n        #     b = [0] * n\n        #     cost = 0\n        #     for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n        #         # We need b[j] < b[j+1]\n        #         # How many moves on j? We need to make b[j] = k * a[j] such that b[j] < b[j+1] and we want to minimize |k| and then the total cost.\n        #         # We want the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than b[j+1]? But then we can also go negative? \n        #         # Actually, we can choose the number of moves (k) such that k is the smallest nonnegative integer in absolute value that makes k*a[j] < b[j+1]. \n        #         # But note: we can also go negative? However, if we go negative we might get a very large |k|. So we want the multiple that is immediately below b[j+1].\n        #         # Let k = floor((b[j+1] - 1) / a[j])   -> then b[j] = k * a[j]\n        #         # Then cost += |k|\n        #         k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]\n        #         # But if b[j+1] is negative, then we want the floor division to be more negative? Actually, we want the largest multiple that is less than b[j+1].\n        #         # However, the known solution does:\n        #         k = (b[j+1]) // a[j]  # but this might be not less than b[j+1]? \n        #         # Actually, we need strictly less. So we do:\n        #         # If b[j+1] is positive, then we can take k = (b[j+1]-1) // a[j] but if (b[j+1]-1) is negative then we have to use negative multiples.\n        #         # Alternatively, we can do:\n        #         #   if b[j+1] > 0:\n        #         #       k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]   # but if (b[j+1]-1) is negative, then this floor division will be negative? \n        #         #   else:\n        #         #       k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]   # which is the same? \n        #         # Actually, we want the largest integer k such that k * a[j] < b[j+1].\n        #         # This can be written as: k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]   if a[j] is positive? But if b[j+1] is negative, then (b[j+1]-1)//a[j] is the same as floor((b[j+1]-1)/a[j]).\n        #         # However, if a[j] is positive, then we can also write: \n        #         #   k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]   # but if b[j+1] is negative, then (b[j+1]-1) is more negative, so k will be more negative? \n        #         #   then the cost is |k| which is large.\n        #         # But we might have a better option: we could set b[j] to a negative multiple that is closer to zero? \n        #         # However, the known solution in the contest does:\n        #         #   k = (b[j+1]) // a[j]\n        #         #   if k * a[j] >= b[j+1]: then we subtract one? \n        #         #   or if k * a[j] <= b[j+1] for the left side? \n        #         # Actually, we need strictly less. So if we let k = floor((b[j+1]-1)/a[j]) then we get the largest multiple that is < b[j+1].\n        #         # But note: if b[j+1] is negative, then floor((b[j+1]-1)/a[j]) is the same as floor(b[j+1]/a[j]) - 1? Not exactly.\n\n        #         # Instead, we can compute k as:\n        #         #   if b[j+1] > 0:\n        #         #       k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]\n        #         #   else:\n        #         #       k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]   # but this is the same? \n        #         # However, we can use: k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j] if b[j+1] > 0, but if b[j+1] <= 0, then we can use k = (b[j+1]) // a[j] - 1? \n\n        #         # Actually, a unified way: \n        #         #   k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]\n        #         #   if a[j] > 0, then this gives the floor of (b[j+1]-1)/a[j], which is the largest integer k such that k * a[j] <= b[j+1]-1, so k * a[j] < b[j+1].\n        #         #   if a[j] is positive, then this works. The problem states a[i] are positive.\n\n        #         # So since a[j] > 0, we can do:\n        #         k = (b[j+1] - 1) // a[j]\n        #         # But if (b[j+1]-1) is negative, then k is negative? \n        #         # Example: b[j+1] = -5, a[j]=2 -> (b[j+1]-1) = -6, then k = -6//2 = -3 -> then b[j] = -3*2 = -6, which is < -5? -> yes.\n        #         # But we want the largest multiple that is < b[j+1]. -6 is less than -5, but is there a larger one? -4 is -2*2 = -4, which is greater than -5? -> no, because -4 > -5, but we need < -5? \n        #         # Actually, we need b[j] < b[j+1] = -5.

So we cannot have two zeros. \n        #   But note: we set b[i]=0. For the left, we set b[j] to be < b[j+1]. So if we have two indices set to 0, that would break. \n        #   But we only set b[i]=0. The others are set to multiples that are not zero? \n        #   For the left: we set b[i-1] to be a multiple of a[i-1] that is < 0 -> so not zero. \n        #   For the right: we set b[i+1] to be a multiple of a[i+1] that is > 0 -> so not zero.\n\n        # Therefore, the solution is to iterate over every index i that we leave at 0, and then compute the cost for the left and right, and take the minimum.\n\n        # But note: the problem does not require that we leave any index at 0.

We are not changing that. We only complete the TODO for the empty list.\n\n        #   This is what the problem asks.\n\n        #   Therefore, the answer is:\n        #        {\"program1\": \"        return 0\", \"program2\": \"        x = i\\n        break\"}\n\n        #   But note: the TODO in program1.py is in a comment, and we must replace the comment with the code.\n\n        #   The code for the TODO in program1.py is: return 0\n\n        #   We must indent properly.\n\n        #   In program1.py, the TODO is at the same indentation as the comment.\n\n        #   So we output \"        return 0\" for program1.\n\n        #   For program2.py, we output \"        x = i\\n        break\", and note that the break is to break the for loop.\n\n        #   But the for loop is over i, and we are in an if. So we break out of the for loop.\n\n        #   This is safe.\n\n        #   Let's hope it works.\n\n        #   Note: program1.py might not work for the reasons discussed, but we are only to output the missing code.\n\n        #   We output only the missing code.\n\n        #   For program1.py, the missing code is the body of the if when b==[].\n\n        #   For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the if when 3*i+2<=n.\n\n        #   Therefore, the answer is as above."
