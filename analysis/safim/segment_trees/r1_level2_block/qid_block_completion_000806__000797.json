Therefore, the missing code in program1 is simply:\n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: the entire array might be covered? then L+R = n, which is valid. So we can do that. However, the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, and we are only storing prefix sums that are <= half the total, and the suffix sums are increasing, so we are safe. Therefore, for program1, the missing code is:\n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1) But note: we are iterating the suffix from the right.",

We start with r = len(n)-1. Every time we add a candy to Bob, we do r -= 1, so the number of candies Bob has eaten is (len(n)-1 - r) -> because initially r is the last index, and after eating one candy, r becomes len(n)-2, so the number of candies eaten is 1. Therefore, the total candies = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + len(n) - r - 1. So the expression is correct. But note: the while condition: l<=r -> we can continue until the pointers meet or cross. And we update f every time a==b. But we want the maximum total candies. So we should take the maximum f over the entire process. However, the code currently sets f to the current total candies whenever a==b. But we want the maximum. The code: \n            f = 0 initially. then when a==b, we set f = ... then after the while loop, we print(f) But if there are multiple times when a==b, we want the last one?",

How about we break when l==r and not let the other condition take it? But the while condition is l<=r, so after we take the last candy, we break.

Step3: \n                l=1, r=1 -> then a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> a += n[1]=2, l=2 -> then a=3, b=1 -> not equal. Step4: l=2, r=1 -> break. So we do get f=2. But then later we set f=2, and then we set a=3, b=1, and then we break. So we print 2.",

When we give a candy to Alice, we take n[l] and then do l+=1. When we give a candy to Bob, we take n[r] and then do r-=1. In the state: l=1, r=1: the available candy is only index1. We give it to Alice: then we do l=2. Then the available candies are from l=2 to r=1 -> which is an empty set. Then we break the while. So we never give the same candy twice. Therefore, in the example [1,2,1]:\n            Step1: \n                a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> true -> a=1, l=1. Step2: \n                a=1, b=0 -> b<a -> true -> b=1, r=1? But wait, after step1: l=1, r=1 -> then we are in the while. We do: a<=b? 1<=0? false -> then b<a -> true -> then we do: b += n[1]=2 -> b=2, then r = 0. Then we check a==b? 1!=2 -> skip. Step3: l=1, r=0 -> l>r -> break. Then f remains 0? But we did have a state after step1: \n                after step1: a=1, b=0 -> then we haven't updated f.\n          Then after step2: a=1, b=2 -> not equal. But we never had a state where a==b. However, after step1: we haven given to Alice only, then we have a=1, b=0 -> not equal. After step2: we have given to Alice and Bob: a=1, b=2 -> not equal. But we want to have a=1 and b=1. How do we achieve that?",

But not necessarily: \n            Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then f = 0 + (len(n)- (len(n)-1) - 1) = 0+ (1-1)=0? Then as we add candies, the total candies increases. Actually, the total candies = l + (len(n)-r-1) \n            = (l) + (n - r - 1) [if we let n=len(n)]\n\n          As l increases and r decreases, the total candies increases. Therefore, the last time we have a==b will be the maximum. But is that true? Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n            We want: Alice=[1,2,3] and Bob=[1,2,3] -> total=6, and sum=6. But the entire array sum=12, so half=6. Steps:\n              l=0, r=5, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=1, l=1 -> a=1, b=0 -> not equal. a=1>0 -> b<a -> false? wait, b=0<1 -> true -> b+=n[5]=1, r=4 -> a=1, b=1 -> equal -> f = 1 + (6-4-1)=1+1=2. Then l=1, r=4 -> a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> a+=n[1]=2, l=2 -> a=3, b=1 -> not equal. a=3>1 -> true -> b+=n[4]=2, r=3 -> a=3, b=3 -> equal -> f = 2 + (6-3-1)=2+2=4. Then l=2, r=3 -> a<=b? 3<=3 -> true -> a+=n[2]=3, l=3 -> a=6, b=3 -> not equal.\n              a=6>3 -> true -> b+=n[3]=3, r=2 -> a=6, b=6 -> equal -> f = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6. Then l=3, r=2 -> break.

So we output:\n\n          program2: \"b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n          The existing code has 8 spaces for the body, so we use 8 spaces for each line.

The body of the if (a<=b) is two lines: \n                a+=n[l]\n                l+=1\n          which are indented by 8 spaces (two levels: 4 spaces per level, so two levels: 8 spaces). So we should output two lines, each starting with 8 spaces. But in the json string, we can do:\n\n          \"program2\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n          However, that would be 8 spaces at the beginning of the first line and then a newline and then 8 spaces for the second line. But the existing code has the body of the elif at the same indentation as the body of the if.",

How about n=3, [1,2,3]? \n            total=6, half=3 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s=3 -> d[3]=2 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [3,2,1]\n                idx0: s=3 -> in d: total_candies = d[3] (which is 2) + 1 = 3 <=3 -> update r=3. then we continue: \n                idx1: s=3+2=5 -> not in d? \n                idx2: s=5+1=6 -> not in d? so we get 3. But is it valid? prefix: [1,2] -> sum=3\n            suffix: [3] -> sum=3\n            non overlapping: prefix indices0,1; suffix index2 -> valid. And total candies=3. But note: the entire array is covered? yes.",

We must complete them so that when run as \"python3 program1.py | python3 program2.py\" they produce the correct output for the problem.\n\nProblem summary:\n- t test cases.\n- For each test case: n and a list of n integers (weights of candies).\n- Alice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left), Bob from the right (contiguous from the right).\n- They cannot eat the same candy. They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob.\n- We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten (i.e., the sum of the number of candies Alice eats and the number Bob eats).\n\nApproach:\nWe are to find two non-overlapping sequences (one prefix and one suffix) such that the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and we want to maximize the total number of candies (i.e., len(prefix) + len(suffix)).\n\nWe can use two pointers:\n  - One starting at the beginning (for Alice) and one at the end (for Bob).\n  - We maintain two sums: `a` for Alice and `b` for Bob.\n  - We traverse:\n        if a <= b: then we add the next left candy to Alice (to try to catch up)\n        else: we add the next right candy to Bob.\n  - Whenever a == b, we record the total candies eaten so far (which is (left index) + (n - 1 - right index) + 1? Actually, we have to note: \n        left index: how many candies Alice has eaten (from 0 to l-1)\n        right index: how many candies Bob has eaten (from r+1 to n-1)\n        so total candies = l + (n - r - 1)\n        but note: when we add a candy to Alice, we do l+=1, meaning l is the next available on the left. Similarly, r is the next available on the right.\n        Actually, in the code for program2, we see: f = len(n) - r + l - 1. Let me check with a small example.\n\nExample: [1,1] -> n=2\n  Initially: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=1, f=0.\n  Since a<=b (0<=0), we add n[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1.\n  Then condition: a==b? 1==0 -> no.\n  Then since a>0, we do: b += n[1]=1, then r=0 -> now a==b? yes -> then f = 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2? Actually: \n      len(n)=2, so 2 - 0 (r is now 0) + 1 (l is 1) - 1 = 2? But the total candies are 2 (Alice ate 1, Bob ate 1). So that matches.\n\nBut note: the expression in program2: f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n  = (l) + (len(n) - r - 1) ? \n  Actually: \n      l: the number of candies Alice has eaten (because we started at index0 and now l is 1, meaning we've taken 1 candy)\n      and Bob: we started at index n-1 and now r is 0, meaning we've taken 1 candy (from the right: indices 1 to 1, which is 1 candy).\n  So total = 1+1 = 2.\n\nBut the expression: len(n)=2, r=0, l=1 -> 2 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n  total candies = l (from left) + (n - r - 1) (from right) = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2.\n\nSo the expression is correct.\n\nNow, what about the two programs?\n\nProgram1.py has:\n  t = number of test cases\n  Then for each test case:\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list of n integers\n\n  Then:\n        x = sum(a) // 2   # This is half the total sum. But note: we are not going to use the entire array? Actually, we are only considering non overlapping prefix and suffix.\n\n  Then it builds a dictionary `d`:\n        s=0\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n            s += i\n            if s > x: break   # because the total sum of the two segments cannot exceed the entire array? Actually, the two segments are disjoint and the total sum of both is 2*s (if they are equal) and must be <= total sum. But we break when s exceeds x (which is half the total). This is safe because if s becomes more than half the total, then we cannot have a matching suffix that equals s without exceeding the total? Actually, it's an optimization: the prefix sum we are interested in must be at most half the total.\n\n        Then we store in d: d[s] = idx+1   (so for a prefix sum `s`, the number of candies (which is index+1) is stored. Note: if the same sum appears again, we want the earliest occurrence? Actually, we are traversing from left, so we are storing the first time we get a prefix sum? But note: we want the maximum total candies? Actually, we are going to traverse from the right and when we get a suffix sum that equals a prefix sum, we can compute the total candies as (prefix_length) + (suffix_length). And we want the maximum.\n\n        However, note: if the same prefix sum appears again, we don't need to update because we want the prefix to be as short as possible? Actually, no: we want the prefix to be as long as possible? Actually, we are storing the prefix length for a given sum. But when we traverse from the right, we are going to get a suffix sum and then we look for that sum in the prefix. The total candies is the prefix length (which we stored) plus the current suffix length. We want the maximum total candies.\n\n        But note: if we have the same sum appearing again in the prefix, we would have stored the first occurrence (which is the smallest index). That gives a shorter prefix and then we can have a longer suffix? Actually, no: we want the prefix to be as short as possible to leave more for the suffix? Actually, no: we are going to use the entire array? Actually, we are breaking when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. And then we traverse the suffix.\n\n        Actually, the method in program1 is:\n          Precompute all prefix sums (until the prefix sum exceeds half the total) and store the prefix length for that sum. Then traverse the suffix from the right, and for each suffix sum, if that sum is in the prefix, then we can have a total of (prefix_length + suffix_length). We take the maximum.\n\n        However, note: the same prefix sum might appear multiple times? But we are storing the last occurrence? Actually, we are storing the last occurrence that we see? Because we break when s > x, and we are storing every prefix until then. And if the same sum appears again, we overwrite. But we want the earliest occurrence? Actually, no: we want the prefix to be as long as possible? Actually, no: we want the total candies to be as large as possible. The prefix length for a given sum: if we have two prefixes with the same sum, we want the one with the larger prefix length? Actually, no: we want the one that when added to the suffix length (which is fixed for a given suffix) gives the maximum total. But note: the suffix we are building: we start from the right and add one by one. For a fixed suffix sum, we look for the same sum in the prefix. The total candies is the prefix length (which we stored) plus the number of candies in the suffix we have so far.\n\n        However, if we have two prefixes with the same sum, we want the one with the larger prefix length? Because that would give a larger total? Actually, no: the suffix length is fixed? Actually, no: the suffix length is the number of candies we have taken from the right. But if we have a prefix that gives the same sum with a longer prefix, then we have taken more candies on the left and we are adding the same suffix, so total is larger. Therefore, we should store the maximum prefix length for a given sum? But note: we are traversing from left to right, so the prefix length is increasing. Therefore, if we see the same sum again, we can update to the later index (which has a longer prefix). But wait: the prefix must be contiguous from the left. So the same sum appearing again would be at a later index? Actually, the prefix sums are increasing? Because all weights are positive. So the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Therefore, we won't have the same sum twice. So we can store the first occurrence? Actually, we don't care: we are going to use the last stored value? But since the prefix sums are increasing, we break when we exceed x, and we store every step.\n\n        Actually, the problem: the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Yes, because w_i>=1. So each prefix sum is unique.\n\n        Then the program1 does:\n          s, r = 0, 0\n          for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   # traversing from the right\n                s += i\n                if s in d:   # then we have a prefix that has the same sum\n                    # then the total candies would be: \n                    #   prefix length = d[s]   (which is the number of candies in the prefix)\n                    #   suffix length = idx+1   (because we are at index idx in the reversed array, which is the (idx+1) candies from the right)\n                    #   total = d[s] + (idx+1)\n                    # and we want the maximum total over all such matches.\n\n          Then we print r (which is the maximum total candies for the test case).\n\n        But note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so this is efficient.\n\n        However, the current program1 has:\n            if s in d: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to update r to be the maximum of the current r and (d[s] + (idx+1))? But note: we are iterating and we want the maximum.\n\n        So we can do: \n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: the suffix we are building: we are starting from the right and adding one by one. The index in the reversed array: \n            original array: [w0, w1, ..., w_{n-1}]\n            reversed: [w_{n-1}, w_{n-2}, ... , w0]\n            when we are at index idx (0-indexed in the reversed array), we have taken (idx+1) candies.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the prefix and suffix must not overlap. But note: we break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. And then we start the suffix. But what if the prefix and suffix overlap? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3] -> total=6, half=3.\n          Prefix: \n            s=1 -> d[1]=1\n            s=3 -> d[3]=2\n            s=6 -> break? because 6>3? no, 3 is half? Actually, x = 6//2 = 3. So we break when s>3. So we store 1 and 3.\n          Suffix: \n            reversed: [3,2,1]\n            s=3 -> then we check d: d has 3 -> then total = d[3] (which is 2) + 1 (because idx=0 -> 1 candy) = 3.\n            But wait: the prefix of [1,2] (which is 3) and the suffix [3] (which is 3) -> but the prefix [1,2] and suffix [3] do not overlap? \n            The prefix takes indices0 and 1, the suffix takes index2 -> so total candies=3.\n\n          Then we continue: \n            s=3+2=5 -> not in d? \n            s=5+1=6 -> in d? d[6] is not stored because we broke at 6? Actually, we broke at the prefix when s>3, so we didn't store 6.\n\n          So we get 3.\n\n          But what if we try: prefix [1] and suffix [1]? that would be 1+1=2, which is less than 3.\n\n          How about prefix [3]? but the prefix [3] is the first candy? no, the first candy is 1. The prefix [3] would be the first two? Actually, we stored d[3]=2. So we are considering the entire prefix that gives 3.\n\n          However, note: the prefix [1,2] and suffix [3] is valid and non overlapping.\n\n          But what if we have [1,1,1]? \n            total=3, half=1.5 -> x=1 (integer division: 3//2=1). \n            Prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then s=2 (which is >1) -> break.\n            Suffix:\n                reversed: [1,1,1]\n                s=1 -> in d: then total = 1 (prefix length) + 1 (suffix length) = 2.\n                then s=2 -> not in d? \n                then s=3 -> not in d?\n            So we get 2.\n\n          But we can also have: prefix [1] and suffix [1] -> total 2, or prefix [1,1] and suffix [1] -> that would be 3? but 1+1=2 and 1=1? no: prefix [1,1] is 2, suffix [1] is 1 -> not equal.\n\n          Actually, the only valid is 2.\n\n          However, note: we can also have prefix [1] and suffix [1] (the first and the last) -> total 2.\n\n          So the answer is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1: we need to update r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1) when we see s in d.\n\n        But note: we break the prefix when s>half. But what if the suffix sum also becomes greater than half? Then we break? Actually, the code for the suffix doesn't break. But note: the suffix sum might become large, but we are only interested in sums that are in the prefix dictionary. And the prefix dictionary only has sums <= half. So if the suffix sum becomes greater than half, then we might not find it in the dictionary? But that's okay.\n\n        However, we can also break the suffix if s>half? But the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, so we don't have to. But the worst-case suffix might go until the entire array? But note: the entire array as suffix: then the prefix would be empty? but we didn't store 0? Actually, we did not store the prefix sum 0? \n\n        The problem: can we have an empty prefix? The problem says they eat the same total weight. If both eat 0, that's allowed? But the problem says \"non-zero\" in the example? Actually, the third test case: no non-zero -> answer 0. So we don't count 0.\n\n        Therefore, we should not consider the empty set? \n\n        How do we handle that? \n          In the prefix, we start from the first candy. We don't store the prefix sum 0? \n          Similarly, the suffix: we start from the last candy. \n\n        But note: the problem says they want to be fair: same total weight. The total weight must be positive? because each candy has weight>=1. So if they eat at least one candy, the weight is at least 1.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to consider 0.\n\n        However, the problem says: the answer for the third test case is 0. So if we don't find any matching, we output 0.\n\n        In program1: we initialize r=0. Then if we find a match, we update r. Then we print r. So if no match, we output 0.\n\n        So the missing code in program1 is:\n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: we must be cautious: the prefix and suffix must not overlap. How do we ensure that? \n          The prefix we stored is from the left, and the suffix we are building is from the right. The condition for non-overlap: the prefix length + suffix length <= n. \n          But note: if we have a prefix of length L and a suffix of length R, then the condition is L + R <= n. \n          However, in our dictionary, we stored the prefix of sum s with length L. Then we are building a suffix of sum s with length R = idx+1. \n          The total candies is L+R. But if L+R > n, that would mean they overlap? \n\n        Example: [1,1] -> n=2.\n          Prefix: \n            s=1 -> stored d[1]=1 -> then s=2 (which is >1 -> break) -> so stored only 1.\n          Suffix:\n            reversed: [1,1]\n            s=1 -> in d: then total = 1 (from prefix) + 1 (from suffix) = 2 -> which is <=2 -> valid.\n\n        How about [1,2,1]? \n          total=4, half=2.\n          Prefix:\n            s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n            s=3 -> break (because 3>2)\n          Suffix:\n            reversed: [1,2,1]\n            s=1 -> in d: total=1+1=2 -> valid? \n                prefix: [1] (index0) and suffix: [1] (index2) -> non overlapping -> valid.\n            then s=1+2=3 -> not in d? \n            then s=3+1=4 -> not in d.\n\n          So we get 2.\n\n          But what about prefix [1,2]? we broke because 3>2 -> so we didn't store it. Suffix: we have [1,2]? that would be 3? but we don't have a prefix with 3? and also we broke the prefix at 3.\n\n          How about prefix [2]? but we didn't store 2? because the prefix [1,2] is 3, and we broke at 3. But the prefix [2] is the second candy? but we have to take contiguous from the left. The prefix [2] would require skipping the first candy? which is not allowed. So we only have the prefix [1] and [1,2] (but we broke at [1,2] because 3>2, so we didn't store 3? and we don't need 3 because the suffix we are building: we are building from the right, and we don't have a suffix that sums to 3? we have [1] (1) and [2,1] (3) but we didn't store 3 in the prefix? so we don't use it.\n\n          Actually, we can have a prefix [2]? but we cannot skip the first candy. So we cannot have [2] as a prefix without the first candy.\n\n          Therefore, the answer 2 is correct.\n\n        But note: what if the prefix and suffix overlap? \n          We are storing the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right. The condition for non-overlap: the prefix must end before the suffix starts. \n          The prefix of length L: covers indices [0, L-1]\n          The suffix of length R: covers indices [n-R, n-1]\n          We require L-1 < n-R  => L+R < n+1 -> which is always true if L+R <= n? \n\n          Actually, if L+R = n, then the entire array is covered? and the last candy of the prefix is at L-1 and the first candy of the suffix is at n-R = n - R = L (because L+R=n) -> so they don't overlap? because the prefix ends at L-1 and the suffix starts at L. So they are adjacent? non overlapping.\n\n          Therefore, as long as L+R <= n, they don't overlap.\n\n          But note: we break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds half the total? that doesn't guarantee non-overlap? but we are building the suffix from the right independently. However, the condition for non-overlap is inherent: because the prefix is from the left and the suffix from the right, and we are not using any candy twice. The only issue is if the prefix and suffix cover the same candy? but we are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right, and we stop the prefix when we exceed half? that doesn't relate to the index. \n\n          Actually, the dictionary `d` stores the prefix sum and the length (which is the number of candies). The suffix we build: we are adding from the right. The total candies we are considering is L+R. We require that L+R <= n? \n\n          But note: we are building the prefix until the prefix sum exceeds half the total. Then we build the suffix until the entire array is covered? \n\n          However, the condition L+R <= n is automatically satisfied? because the entire array has n candies. But we are not using any candy twice? \n\n          How do we avoid using the same candy? \n            The prefix uses the first L candies, the suffix uses the last R candies. The condition for non-overlap is L <= n-R? because the prefix ends at L-1 and the suffix starts at n-R. We require L-1 < n-R -> L+R < n+1 -> which is always true because L and R are at least 1 and L+R<=n? \n\n          Actually, if L+R > n, then the prefix and suffix would overlap. \n\n          How can we have L+R>n? \n            Example: n=3, L=2, R=2 -> then the prefix covers [0,1] and the suffix covers [1,2] -> they overlap at index1.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid that.\n\n          How does our method avoid that? \n            We are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right independently. We are not relating the indices. \n\n          But note: the dictionary `d` stores the prefix sum and the length. Then when we build the suffix, we are adding from the right. The total candies we are considering is L+R. We must check that L+R <= n? \n\n          Actually, the condition for non-overlap is: the starting index of the suffix (n-R) must be greater than the last index of the prefix (L-1). \n            => n-R > L-1  => L+R < n+1 -> which is always true? because L and R are integers and L<=n, R<=n, so L+R <= 2n? but we need L+R <= n? \n\n          Actually, no: we are building the suffix from the right, and we are not skipping any candy? but we are building independently. \n\n          However, note: the entire array is fixed. The prefix takes the first L, the suffix takes the last R. The condition for non-overlap is that the two segments do not share any candy. That is: L <= n - R. \n          => L + R <= n.\n\n          Therefore, we must only consider pairs (L,R) such that L+R<=n.\n\n          But in our method: \n            We store all prefix sums (with their length L) that are <= half the total. Then we build the suffix (with length R) and if we find a suffix sum s that is in the prefix, then we have a candidate L+R. \n\n          How do we know that L+R<=n? \n            Note: the prefix we stored: the prefix of length L is the first L candies. The suffix we are building: the last R candies. The condition: the entire array has n candies. The two segments are disjoint if and only if L <= n-R. \n            But note: the suffix we are building: we are building from the right, and we are not using any candy that is in the prefix? Actually, we are building the suffix independently without knowing the prefix. \n\n          But wait: the prefix we stored is from the entire array? and the suffix we are building is from the entire array? and we are adding the suffix from the right until we cover the entire array? \n\n          However, the condition for non-overlap is not checked in the code. \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4,5] \n            total=15, half=7 (integer division: 15//2=7)\n            Prefix:\n                s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s=3 -> d[3]=2\n                s=6 -> d[6]=3 -> then s=10 -> break? 10>7 -> break.\n            Suffix:\n                reversed: [5,4,3,2,1]\n                s=5 -> not in d\n                s=5+4=9 -> not in d\n                s=9+3=12 -> not in d\n                ... \n            So we don't get any candidate? \n\n          But what if we have prefix [1,2,3] (sum=6) and suffix [5,4]? that would be 5+4=9 -> not 6. \n          How about prefix [1,2,3] (6) and suffix [5]? 5 !=6.\n\n          How about prefix [3]? we didn't store 3? because we stored the prefix that ends at the first candy? no: we stored the prefix that ends at the first candy: 1, then the first two: 3, then the first three:6. So we have 3 stored. \n          Then suffix: \n                s=5 -> not 3\n                s=5+4=9 -> not 3\n                s=9+3=12 -> not 3\n                ... \n          So we don't get 3.\n\n          How about prefix [1,2] (3) and suffix [3]? \n            prefix [1,2] -> stored: d[3]=2\n            suffix: we start from the right: \n                first:5 -> not 3\n                then 5+4=9 -> not 3\n                then 5+4+3=12 -> not 3\n                then 5+4+3+2=14 -> not 3\n                then 5+4+3+2+1=15 -> not 3.\n\n          So we don't get 3? \n\n          But wait: the suffix [3] is the third candy? but the prefix [1,2] is the first two. Then the suffix [3] is the third candy -> non overlapping? and 3==3 -> valid. Total candies=2+1=3.\n\n          How do we get the suffix [3]? \n            The reversed array: [5,4,3,2,1]\n            We are adding: \n                first:5 -> s=5 -> not 3\n                then 4 -> s=9 -> not 3\n                then 3 -> s=12 -> not 3? \n            But we are building the suffix from the right: the suffix [3] is the last third candy? actually, the last candy is 5? then the next is 4? then 3? so the suffix of length 1: [5], length2: [5,4], length3: [5,4,3] -> which is the entire right segment? \n\n          But we want the suffix that is contiguous from the right? so the suffix of length 1: [5] -> sum=5\n          suffix of length 2: [5,4] -> sum=9\n          suffix of length 3: [5,4,3] -> sum=12\n          suffix of length 4: [5,4,3,2] -> 14\n          suffix of length 5: 15\n\n          How do we get the suffix that is [3]? that would be the third candy from the left? but that is not contiguous from the right. \n\n          Therefore, the suffix must be contiguous from the right. So we cannot skip the last candy to take the third candy? \n\n          So the only valid suffix that includes the candy 3 is the entire segment from the right that ends at 3? which is [5,4,3]? \n\n          But then the sum is 12, not 3.\n\n          Therefore, the candidate we are missing: we cannot get the suffix [3] because it is not contiguous from the right without taking 5 and 4.\n\n          So the answer for [1,2,3,4,5] is 0? \n\n          But wait: what about prefix [1,2,3] (6) and suffix [4,5]? 4+5=9 -> not 6.\n          prefix [1,2] (3) and suffix [4,5]? 4+5=9 -> not 3.\n\n          So indeed 0.\n\n          But note: we can have prefix [1,5]? but we cannot skip: we must take contiguous from the left. So we cannot skip 2 to take 5? \n\n          Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n        So the missing code in program1 is:\n            if s in d:\n                # We have a candidate: prefix length = d[s], suffix length = idx+1\n                # Check non-overlap? we don't need to because if the prefix length + suffix length <= n, then non-overlap? but note: we are building the suffix from the right, and the prefix from the left. The condition for non-overlap is that the prefix length + suffix length <= n? \n                # Actually, the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes the first d[s] candies, the suffix takes the last (idx+1) candies. The condition: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n                # But note: we broke the prefix when the prefix sum exceeded half the total, but that doesn't guarantee that the prefix length + suffix length <= n. \n\n          Example: n=3, [1,1,1] \n            total=3, half=1 -> so we break the prefix at the first candy? \n            prefix: s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then next: s=2>1 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,1,1]\n                s=1 -> in d: then total = 1+1=2 -> which is <=3 -> valid.\n                then s=2 -> not in d? \n                then s=3 -> not in d.\n\n          But 1+1=2<=3 -> valid.\n\n          How about n=2, [10,10]? \n            total=20, half=10 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=10 -> store d[10]=1 -> then s=20>10 -> break.\n            suffix:\n                reversed: [10,10]\n                s=10 -> in d: total=1+1=2 -> which is <=2 -> valid.\n\n          How about n=2, [10,20]? \n            total=30, half=15 -> \n            prefix: s=10 -> store d[10]=1 -> then s=30>15 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [20,10]\n                s=20 -> not in d? \n                s=20+10=30 -> not in d? \n            so we get 0.\n\n          But what if we take prefix [10] and suffix [10]? that would be 10==10 -> valid? but the suffix [10] is the last candy? which is 20? no, the last candy is 20. The suffix of length1: [20] -> 20. \n          How do we get the suffix [10]? we can't because the suffix must be contiguous from the right: so we have to take the last candy (20) first. \n\n          Therefore, the answer 0 is correct.\n\n        So we don't need to check for non-overlap? because the way we build the suffix: we are taking contiguous from the right. The prefix is contiguous from the left. The two sets are disjoint by the structure: the prefix is [0, L-1] and the suffix is [n-R, n-1]. The condition for non-overlap is L <= n-R. \n          => L+R <= n.\n\n        But note: in our candidate: we have L = d[s] and R = idx+1. \n          We must have L+R <= n? \n          How do we know that? \n            The prefix we stored: we stored the prefix that starts at the left and goes to index L-1. The suffix we built: we started at the right and went to index n-R. \n            The condition: the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes L candies and the suffix takes R candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two segments do not share any candy. The first candy of the suffix is at index n-R. The last candy of the prefix is at index L-1. \n            We require L-1 < n-R -> L+R < n+1 -> which is always true? because L and R are integers -> L+R <= n.\n\n          Why? \n            The prefix covers indices [0, L-1] -> L candies.\n            The suffix covers indices [n-R, n-1] -> R candies.\n            The condition for non-overlap: L-1 < n-R  => L+R < n+1 -> which is equivalent to L+R <= n.\n\n          But note: if L+R = n, then the entire array is covered? and the prefix ends at L-1 and the suffix starts at n-R = n - R = L (because L+R=n) -> so they are adjacent? non overlapping.\n\n          Therefore, the candidate L+R is always <= n? \n\n          Actually, no: what if L+R > n? \n            Then the prefix would extend to at least L-1 >= n-R? meaning the prefix and suffix overlap.\n\n          How can we have L+R>n? \n            Example: n=3, L=2, R=2 -> then L+R=4>3 -> overlap.\n\n          How can that happen in our code? \n            We store the prefix of length L (which is 2) and then we build a suffix of length R=2. \n            The condition: we break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds half the total? \n            total=6, half=3. \n            prefix: \n                s1 = w0 -> if w0<=3 -> store d[w0]=1\n                s2 = w0+w1 -> if <=3 -> store d[s2]=2 -> then if s2>3? if w0+w1>3 then break? \n            In this example, if the array is [1,3,2]: \n                prefix: \n                    s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                    s=1+3=4 -> break? because 4>3 -> so we don't store 4? \n                then suffix: \n                    reversed: [2,3,1]\n                    s=2 -> not in d? \n                    s=2+3=5 -> not in d? \n                    s=5+1=6 -> not in d? \n                so we don't get L=2 and R=2.\n\n          How about [1,1,1]? \n            n=3, total=3, half=1 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then break? because next would be 2>1? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,1,1]\n                s=1 -> then candidate: L=1, R=1 -> total=2 (<=3) -> valid.\n                then s=2 -> not in d? \n                then s=3 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about [1,2,1]? \n            total=4, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=3 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,2,1]\n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2 -> valid? \n                then s=1+2=3 -> not in d? \n                then s=3+1=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about [2,1,1]? \n            total=4, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=2 -> store d[2]=1 -> then s=3 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,1,2]\n                s=1 -> not in d? \n                s=1+1=2 -> in d: candidate: 1 (prefix length) + 2 (suffix length) = 3 -> which is <=3? yes -> valid.\n\n          But is it non overlapping? \n            prefix: [2] -> index0\n            suffix: [1,1] -> indices1 and 2? \n            so non overlapping -> valid.\n\n          Therefore, the candidate 3 is found.\n\n          But note: the entire array is covered? prefix [0] and suffix [1,2] -> but the prefix is [0] and the suffix is [1,2] -> total 3 candies -> valid.\n\n          So the condition L+R<=n is automatically satisfied? because the entire array has n candies and we are taking two disjoint sets? \n\n          Actually, the condition for non-overlap is inherent: the prefix is from the left and the suffix from the right, and we are not skipping any candy in between? but we are skipping the middle? \n\n          However, the two sets are disjoint by the indices: the prefix is the first L, the suffix is the last R, and the condition for non-overlap is L<=n-R -> which is equivalent to L+R<=n. \n\n          But note: in our candidate, we have L and R. The condition L+R<=n must hold? \n            In the example [2,1,1]: L=1, R=2 -> 1+2=3<=3 -> holds.\n\n          How can we get L+R>n? \n            We store the prefix of length L and then we build a suffix of length R. The condition: the prefix is stored only for the left part and we break when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. The suffix we build: we start from the right and go until we cover the entire array? \n            The maximum R we build is n. \n            The maximum L we store: we break when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. The maximum prefix length is n? but we break when the sum exceeds half? so L might be less than n. \n\n          But note: the condition for non-overlap: L+R<=n is not enforced by the algorithm. \n\n          However, if we have a candidate with L+R>n, that would mean that the prefix and suffix overlap. But then the same candy would be counted twice? which is not allowed. \n\n          Therefore, we must avoid such candidates.\n\n          How do we avoid them? \n            We can check: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then we update r. \n            But note: the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes d[s] candies and the suffix takes (idx+1) candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two sets are disjoint, which requires d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          But wait: the condition for non-overlap is d[s] <= n - (idx+1) -> which is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          Therefore, we should only update if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          However, note: the prefix and suffix are built from the two ends. The prefix covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix covers [n - (idx+1), n-1]. The condition for non-overlap is that d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1) -> which is d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1 -> d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          But note: if d[s] + (idx+1) == n, then the entire array is covered? and the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at n - (idx+1) = d[s] (because d[s] + (idx+1)=n -> n - (idx+1)=d[s]). So the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at d[s] -> non overlapping.\n\n          Therefore, we require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          But in the example [2,1,1]: \n            d[2]=1, and when we have suffix sum=2 (which is the last two: [1,1] -> but wait, the suffix sum=2? \n            reversed: [1,1,2] -> \n                first:1 -> s=1 -> not in d? \n                then 1+1=2 -> in d: then candidate: 1 (d[2]) + 2 (suffix length) = 3 <=3 -> valid.\n\n          How about if we have an array of 4 candies: [1,1,1,1]? \n            total=4, half=2.\n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> d[2]=2 -> then s=3>2 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,1,1,1]\n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2 (<=4) -> valid.\n                s=1+1=2 -> candidate: 2+2=4 (<=4) -> valid.\n                s=3 -> not in d? \n                s=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get max=4.\n\n          But note: the entire array: prefix [1,1] and suffix [1,1]? but the prefix [1,1] is the first two, and the suffix [1,1] is the last two? non overlapping? yes. And they both sum to 2. Total candies=4.\n\n          How about if we have [1,1,1,1,1]? \n            total=5, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> d[2]=2 -> then s=3>2 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2 (<=5) -> valid.\n                s=1+1=2 -> candidate: 2+2=4 (<=5) -> valid.\n                s=2+1=3 -> not in d? \n                s=3+1=4 -> not in d? \n                s=4+1=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 4.\n\n          But we can also have: prefix [1,1] and suffix [1,1] -> total 4, which is valid.\n\n          However, note: we can also have prefix [1] and suffix [1] -> 2, but 4 is better.\n\n          So the candidate 4 is found.\n\n          Therefore, we must update only when the total candies (d[s] + (idx+1)) <= n.\n\n          But wait: what if we have a candidate that is greater than n? \n            Example: n=3, [1,1,1] -> we break the prefix at 1 (because half=1) -> stored d[1]=1.\n            suffix: \n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=3 -> valid -> r=2.\n                s=2 -> not in d? \n                s=3 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about if we have an array that allows a candidate with L+R>n? \n            Example: n=3, [1,1,3] -> total=5, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then s=5>2 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [3,1,1]\n                s=3 -> not in d? \n                s=3+1=4 -> not in d? \n                s=4+1=5 -> not in d? \n            so no candidate? \n\n          How about [1,3,1]? \n            total=5, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=4 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,3,1]\n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=3 -> valid -> r=2.\n                s=1+3=4 -> not in d? \n                s=4+1=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about [3,1,1]? \n            prefix: \n                s=3 -> break? because 3>2 -> so we don't store 3? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,1,3]\n                s=1 -> not in d? \n                s=1+1=2 -> in d: candidate: d[2]? but we didn't store 2? \n            so we get 0? \n\n          But wait: we stored d[1]=1? no, because the prefix: \n                first candy:3 -> break? so we break immediately? then d is empty? \n            then suffix: \n                s=1 -> not in d? \n                s=2 -> not in d? \n                s=5 -> not in d? \n            so 0.\n\n          But we can have: prefix [3]? but we broke at the first candy? we stored nothing? because 3>2 -> break. But we didn't store the first candy? \n\n          We should store the prefix even if it is the first candy? but we break after we add the first candy? \n          The code: \n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: break\n                d[s] = idx+1\n\n          So for [3,1,1]: \n            s=3 -> then check if s>2 -> yes -> break -> so we don't store d[3]=1? \n\n          But we are allowed to take a prefix that is just [3]? and then a suffix that is [1,1]? but 3 != 2 -> not valid.\n\n          So the answer 0 is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we must update the candidate only if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          But note: the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes d[s] candies and the suffix takes (idx+1) candies. The condition for non-overlap is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          So the missing code in program1 is:\n            if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we are not storing too many.\n\n        But wait: what if the same suffix sum s appears multiple times? but the suffix sums are increasing? because we are adding positive numbers. So the suffix sums are strictly increasing? so each suffix sum is unique.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if s in d:\n                total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\n                if total_candies <= n:\n                    r = max(r, total_candies)\n\n        However, note: the condition total_candies<=n might always hold? because the entire array has n candies. But we are taking two disjoint sets? the maximum total candies we can take is n. So total_candies cannot exceed n? \n\n        Why? \n          The prefix takes d[s] candies and the suffix takes (idx+1) candies. The entire array has n candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two sets are disjoint, which requires d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n        Therefore, we must enforce that.\n\n        But note: it is possible that d[s] + (idx+1) > n? \n          Example: n=3, [1,1,1] -> we break the prefix at the first candy? \n            prefix: s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                idx0: s=1 -> total_candies=1+1=2<=3 -> update r=2.\n                idx1: s=2 -> not in d? \n                idx2: s=3 -> not in d? \n          So no problem.\n\n        How about n=3, [1,2,3]? \n            total=6, half=3 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s=3 -> d[3]=2 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [3,2,1]\n                idx0: s=3 -> in d: total_candies = d[3] (which is 2) + 1 = 3 <=3 -> update r=3.\n                then we continue: \n                idx1: s=3+2=5 -> not in d? \n                idx2: s=5+1=6 -> not in d? \n            so we get 3.\n\n          But is it valid? \n            prefix: [1,2] -> sum=3\n            suffix: [3] -> sum=3\n            non overlapping: prefix indices0,1; suffix index2 -> valid.\n\n          And total candies=3.\n\n          But note: the entire array is covered? yes. \n\n          How about if we have a candidate that is exactly n? that's valid.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is necessary to avoid candidates that would overlap? but in reality, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? because the entire array has n candies and we are taking two disjoint sets? \n\n        Actually, the condition for non-overlap is exactly d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. \n\n        But note: if we take the entire array, then d[s] + (idx+1) = n. \n\n        However, what if we have a candidate with d[s] + (idx+1) > n? \n          Example: n=3, and we have a prefix of length 2 and a suffix of length 2 -> 2+2=4>3 -> which would overlap. \n          But how would we get such a candidate? \n            We store the prefix of length 2: so the prefix covers indices0 and 1.\n            The suffix of length 2: covers indices1 and 2 -> they overlap at index1.\n\n          How do we avoid storing such a candidate? \n            We break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds half the total? \n            In the example: [1,1,1] -> we break the prefix at the first candy? so we don't store the prefix of length 2? \n            But in [1,1,1] we did store the prefix of length 1 only? \n\n          How about [2,1,1]? \n            We stored the prefix of length 1: [2] -> and then the suffix of length 2: [1,1] -> 1+2=3<=3 -> valid.\n\n          How about [1,2,1]? \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=3 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=3 -> valid.\n                s=3 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about if we have [1,1,2]? \n            total=4, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [2,1,1]\n                s=2 -> in d: candidate: d[2]=2 + 1 = 3 <=3 -> valid.\n                then s=3 -> not in d? \n                then s=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get 3.\n\n          But is it valid? \n            prefix: [1,1] -> indices0,1 -> sum=2\n            suffix: [2] -> index2 -> sum=2\n            valid.\n\n          How about if we have [1,1,1,1] and we try to take prefix of length 3 and suffix of length 2? \n            total=4, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2\n                s=3 -> break? \n            so we don't store d[3]=3.\n            suffix: \n                s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2\n                s=2 -> candidate: 2+2=4\n                s=3 -> not in d? \n                s=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get 4.\n\n          But 4 is the entire array: prefix [1,1] and suffix [1,1]? but wait: the entire array is covered by the prefix and suffix? \n            prefix: [1,1] -> indices0,1\n            suffix: [1,1] -> indices2,3? \n            non overlapping -> valid.\n\n          But note: the candidate for suffix sum=2: \n            The suffix of length2: the last two candies: [1,1] -> sum=2.\n            prefix: d[2]=2 -> which is the first two: [1,1] -> then total=2+2=4.\n\n          So it's valid.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need the condition? because the way we build the prefix and suffix, the two sets are always disjoint? \n\n          Why? \n            The prefix is built from the left and the suffix from the right. The prefix we stored is for the entire left part until we break. The suffix we build from the right until we cover the entire array. \n            The two sets are disjoint because the prefix is a prefix and the suffix is a suffix, and they meet in the middle? \n\n          But note: the condition for non-overlap is that the prefix length + suffix length <= n. \n          And we are not storing any prefix that would cause overlap? \n\n          Actually, the prefix and suffix are built independently. The only constraint is that the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes the first L candies and the suffix takes the last R candies. The condition for non-overlap is L+R<=n. \n          But note: the prefix and suffix might overlap if L+R>n. \n\n          How can we have L+R>n? \n            We store the prefix of length L and then we build a suffix of length R. \n            The condition: the entire array has n candies. The prefix takes L candies and the suffix takes R candies. The maximum L we store: we break when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. The maximum R we build: we go until the entire array is covered. \n            But there is no direct constraint that prevents L+R>n.\n\n          Example: n=3, [1,1,1] -> we break the prefix at the first candy? so L=1, and then we build the suffix: R=1,2,3. \n            When R=3: then L+R=4>3 -> overlap.\n\n          But note: we break the prefix at the first candy? so we only store L=1. \n          Then in the suffix: \n                R=1: s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=3 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=2 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=3 -> not in d? \n          so we don't get a candidate for R=3.\n\n          How about if we have a prefix that is not broken until later? \n            Example: n=3, [1,1,1] with half=1.5 -> but integer division: 3//2=1 -> so we break at the first candy? \n\n          How about if we have a different array: n=3, [1,1,2] -> total=4, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [2,1,1]\n                R=1: s=2 -> in d: candidate: 2+1=3<=3 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get 3.\n\n          How about if we have [1,1,3]? \n            total=5, half=2 -> \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then s=5>2 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [3,1,1]\n                R=1: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=2: s=4 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 0.\n\n          How about [1,3,1]? \n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=4 -> break? \n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,3,1]\n                R=1: s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=3 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=4 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          How about [3,1,1]? \n            prefix: \n                s=3 -> break? -> so we don't store anything? \n            suffix: \n                R=1: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=2: s=4 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=5 -> not in d? \n            so 0.\n\n          Therefore, we never get a candidate with L+R>n? \n\n          Why? \n            Because the suffix sum we are building: if we build a suffix of length R, then the sum is the sum of the last R candies. \n            For the candidate to be valid, we require that this sum s is in the prefix dictionary. \n            The prefix dictionary only has sums that are at most half the total. \n            But the suffix sum for the last R candies: if R is large enough that L+R>n, then the suffix has covered some of the prefix? \n            Specifically, if L+R>n, then the suffix has covered at least R - (n-L) = L+R-n >0 candies that are in the prefix. \n            But then the same candy is counted in both the prefix and the suffix? which is not allowed. \n\n          However, in our method, the prefix and suffix are computed independently. The prefix is computed from the left without any knowledge of the suffix. The suffix is computed from the right without any knowledge of the prefix. \n          But the candy that is in both the prefix and the suffix is counted twice in the total sum? \n\n          Therefore, the sum of the entire array is at least (prefix sum) + (suffix sum) - (sum of the overlap) = s + s - (overlap sum) = 2s - (overlap sum) <= total_array_sum.\n          => 2s <= total_array_sum + overlap_sum.\n\n          But we require s to be at most half the total_array_sum? because we break the prefix when it exceeds half. \n          So s <= total_array_sum//2.\n\n          Then 2s <= total_array_sum.\n\n          But the equation: 2s - overlap_sum <= total_array_sum -> which is always true because 2s<=total_array_sum and overlap_sum>=0.\n\n          So it doesn't prevent anything.\n\n          Therefore, we might get a candidate with L+R>n? \n\n          Example: n=3, [1,1,1] -> we break the prefix at the first candy? so we store d[1]=1. \n          Then in the suffix: \n                R=3: s=3 -> not in d? \n          so we don't get a candidate.\n\n          How about if we don't break the prefix? \n            We break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds half the total. In [1,1,1]: half=1 (integer division of 3//2=1). \n            So we break after the first candy.\n\n          How about if we have an array where the prefix sum does not exceed half until after we have stored a prefix that, when combined with a long suffix, would overlap? \n            Example: n=4, [1,1,1,1] -> total=4, half=2.\n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then break? \n            suffix: \n                R=1: s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=4 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=2 -> candidate: 2+2=4<=4 -> valid.\n                R=3: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=4: s=4 -> not in d? \n            so we get 4.\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          How about n=4, [1,1,1,2] -> total=5, half=2.\n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then s=3>2 -> break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [2,1,1,1]\n                R=1: s=2 -> in d: candidate: 2+1=3<=4 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=4 -> not in d? \n                R=4: s=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 3.\n\n          How about if we have [1,1,2,1]? \n            total=5, half=2.\n            prefix: \n                s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then break.\n            suffix: \n                reversed: [1,2,1,1]\n                R=1: s=1 -> candidate: 1+1=2<=4 -> valid.\n                R=2: s=3 -> not in d? \n                R=3: s=4 -> not in d? \n                R=4: s=5 -> not in d? \n            so we get 2.\n\n          Therefore, it seems we never get a candidate with L+R>n because the suffix sum for R> (n - L) would include candies that are in the prefix, and then the sum would be larger than the prefix sum we stored? \n\n          Specifically, if the suffix has R > n - L, then it includes at least one candy that is in the prefix. But then the sum of the suffix would be at least (sum of the last n-L candies) + (sum of the overlap candies) > (sum of the last n-L candies). \n          But the prefix sum we stored is the sum of the first L candies. The sum of the last n-L candies is total_sum - (sum of the first L candies) = total_sum - s. \n          And the actual suffix sum for R>n-L would be > total_sum - s. \n          But we are matching to s. \n          So we require s = (suffix sum) > total_sum - s -> 2s > total_sum.\n          But we only stored s that are <= total_sum//2 -> 2s<=total_sum. \n          Therefore, we cannot have 2s > total_sum. \n          So we will never see a suffix sum of s (the same s as in the prefix) for R>n-L.\n\n          Therefore, any candidate we get will automatically satisfy L+R<=n.\n\n          So we don't need the extra condition.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code in program1 is simply:\n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: the entire array might be covered? then L+R = n, which is valid.\n\n        So we can do that.\n\n        However, the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, and we are only storing prefix sums that are <= half the total, and the suffix sums are increasing, so we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing code is:\n            if s in d:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: we are iterating the suffix from the right. We might get the same suffix sum twice? but because the suffix sums are strictly increasing, we won't.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Now, program2:\n\n        The code for program2 is:\n\n            for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = [*map(int, n.split())]\n                a, b, l, f = [0]*4\n                r = len(n)-1\n                while l<=r:\n                    if a<=b:\n                        a += n[l]\n                        l += 1\n                    elif b<a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if a==b:\n                        f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n                print(f)\n\n        We see that it uses two pointers: l from the left, r from the right.\n        a = sum of Alice (prefix)\n        b = sum of Bob (suffix)\n        f = the total number of candies eaten so far when a==b? \n\n        The expression: f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n          = (l) + (len(n) - r - 1) \n          But wait: \n            l: the number of candies Alice has eaten? because we start l=0, and we do l+=1 after adding a candy. So after adding, l is the next index. So the number of candies Alice has eaten is l.\n            r: initially len(n)-1, and we are decrementing? but we don't see any decrement in the TODO part.\n\n        The TODO part is in the elif: when b < a, we need to add a candy to Bob.\n\n        So the missing code should be:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        Then, after that, we check if a==b, then update f.\n\n        But note: the condition: \n            if a<=b: \n                we add to a and move l to the right.\n            elif b<a: \n                we add to b and move r to the left.\n\n        And then if a==b, we update f.\n\n        The expression: \n            f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n            = l + (len(n) - r - 1)\n\n        What does this represent?\n            l: the number of candies Alice has eaten (because we've done l increments, and the last increment moved l to the next, so the number of candies is l).\n            the number of candies Bob has eaten: initially the entire array is from index0 to index(len(n)-1). \n                We start with r = len(n)-1.\n                Every time we add a candy to Bob, we do r -= 1, so the number of candies Bob has eaten is (len(n)-1 - r) -> because initially r is the last index, and after eating one candy, r becomes len(n)-2, so the number of candies eaten is 1.\n\n            Therefore, the total candies = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + len(n) - r - 1.\n\n        So the expression is correct.\n\n        But note: the while condition: l<=r -> we can continue until the pointers meet or cross.\n\n        And we update f every time a==b.\n\n        But we want the maximum total candies. So we should take the maximum f over the entire process.\n\n        However, the code currently sets f to the current total candies whenever a==b. But we want the maximum. \n\n        The code: \n            f = 0 initially.\n            then when a==b, we set f = ... \n            then after the while loop, we print(f)\n\n        But if there are multiple times when a==b, we want the last one? or the one with the maximum total candies?\n\n        Example: [1,2,1] \n            Initially: a=0, b=0, l=0, r=2, f=0.\n            a<=b (0<=0) -> a += n[0]=1 -> l=1 -> now a=1, b=0 -> a!=b.\n            then b<a (0<1) -> so we do: b += n[2]=1 -> r=1 -> now a=1, b=1 -> a==b -> then f = 3 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 2? \n                len(n)=3, r=1, l=1 -> 3-1+1-1 = 2.\n            then l<=r: 1<=1 -> true.\n                a<=b: 1<=1 -> true -> a += n[1]=2 -> a=3, l=2.\n                then a!=b -> then b<a: 1<3 -> true -> b += n[1] -> but wait, r is 1, so n[1]=2 -> b=3, r=0.\n                then a==b? 3==3 -> then f = 3 - 0 + 2 - 1 = 4? \n            then l>r: 2>0 -> break.\n\n            We print 4.\n\n          But the array only has 3 candies. And we cannot eat the same candy twice: we ate the middle candy twice? \n\n          How did we do that?\n            First: Alice ate [1] (index0), Bob ate [1] (index2) -> then f=2.\n            Then Alice ate the next: [1,2] (indices0,1) -> a=3.\n            Then Bob ate the next from the right: but the next from the right is index1? which is the middle candy. But that candy was not eaten by Alice? \n            However, in the code, when we do b += n[r] and r was 1, we are taking the candy at index1. But Alice already took index1? \n\n          The issue: the two pointers are moving independently. When Alice moves, she takes the candy at index l (which is then incremented). When Bob moves, he takes the candy at index r (which is then decremented). \n          But when l and r meet, we are allowing both to take the same candy? \n\n          We must ensure that the candy at the meeting point is not taken by both.\n\n          The condition: we are in a while l<=r. \n            If we are at a state where l==r, then we are at the middle candy. \n            We will add it to either Alice or Bob? \n            But then the other one cannot take it.\n\n          In the example: \n            After the first two steps: \n                Alice: [1] -> l=1\n                Bob: [1] -> r=1\n            Then we are at l==r==1.\n            Then we do: \n                a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> so we add n[1] to Alice -> a=1+2=3, l=2.\n                Then we check a==b? 3!=1 -> skip.\n                Then the condition: l=2, r=1 -> l>r -> break.\n\n            Then we never added the middle candy to Bob? \n\n          But then in the next step: \n                after Alice took the middle candy, we then check: b<a -> 1<3 -> true -> then we do: b += n[1] -> but wait, r is 1, so we take n[1] which is the middle candy. But Alice already took it.\n\n          How to avoid this? \n            We should not allow the same candy to be taken twice.\n\n          The problem: the candy at index1 is taken by Alice at the step when we did a+=n[1] and l became 2. Then when we do b+=n[1], we are taking the same candy.\n\n          We need to use a different approach: \n            We should only allow one of them to take the candy at the meeting point.\n\n          But the current code structure: \n            We have two pointers l and r. \n            We start with l=0, r=len(n)-1.\n            We have a=0, b=0.\n            While l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a += n[l]; l+=1\n                else:\n                    b += n[r]; r-=1\n                if a==b:\n                    f = l + (len(n)-r-1)\n\n          The issue is that when l==r, we are at the last candy. We add it to one of them. Then we move the pointer so that l becomes l+1 and r remains? or r becomes r-1? \n          Then the other condition might fire and try to take the same candy? \n\n          How about we break when l==r and not let the other condition take it? \n            But the while condition is l<=r, so after we take the last candy, we break.\n\n          But in the example: \n            After the first two steps: l=1, r=1 -> then we are in the while.\n            We do: a<=b -> true -> a += n[1]=2, l becomes 2.\n            Then we break the while? because l=2, r=1 -> l>r -> break? \n            Then we don't do the b part.\n\n          But then we did the a part and then after that we check a==b? \n            a=3, b=1 -> not equal.\n\n          Then we never do the b part for the last candy? \n\n          But then how do we give Bob a chance? \n\n          The candy at index1 is only given to Alice.\n\n          But what if we had given it to Bob? \n            After the first two steps: l=1, r=1.\n            Then we do: a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> we could have given it to Alice, but what if we give it to Bob? \n            The condition is: if a<=b, we give to Alice. \n\n          We could change the condition to give to Bob when a>=b? but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n          The problem: they want to be fair. They can choose arbitrarily? \n\n          But the condition in the code: \n            if a<=b: give to Alice\n            else: give to Bob\n\n          This ensures that we try to balance.\n\n          In the example [1,2,1]: \n            We want to achieve: Alice=[1], Bob=[1] -> total=2.\n            But the code also tries to give the middle candy to Alice and then to Bob? which is invalid.\n\n          How to fix? \n            We should not allow the same candy to be taken twice. \n            The candy at index1 is taken by Alice at step when l=1. Then we move l to 2. Then the next step: we are at l=2, r=1 -> then we do b<a -> we try to take n[1] again? \n\n          We must ensure that when we take a candy, we move the pointer and then that candy is gone.\n\n          But in the example, after Alice takes the candy at index1, we set l=2. Then the candy at index1 is gone. Then when we do b+=n[1], we are taking a candy that is already gone? \n\n          This is a flaw in the logic.\n\n          We should only use the candy at the current pointers that are available.\n\n          The available candies are from index l to index r (inclusive).\n\n          When we give a candy to Alice, we take n[l] and then do l+=1.\n          When we give a candy to Bob, we take n[r] and then do r-=1.\n\n          In the state: l=1, r=1: the available candy is only index1.\n          We give it to Alice: then we do l=2. Then the available candies are from l=2 to r=1 -> which is an empty set. \n          Then we break the while.\n\n          So we never give the same candy twice.\n\n          Therefore, in the example [1,2,1]:\n            Step1: \n                a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> true -> a=1, l=1.\n            Step2: \n                a=1, b=0 -> b<a -> true -> b=1, r=1? \n                But wait, after step1: l=1, r=1 -> then we are in the while.\n                We do: a<=b? 1<=0? false -> then b<a -> true -> then we do: b += n[1]=2 -> b=2, then r = 0.\n                Then we check a==b? 1!=2 -> skip.\n            Step3: l=1, r=0 -> l>r -> break.\n\n          Then f remains 0? \n\n          But we did have a state after step1: \n                after step1: a=1, b=0 -> then we haven't updated f.\n          Then after step2: a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n\n          But we never had a state where a==b.\n\n          However, after step1: we haven given to Alice only, then we have a=1, b=0 -> not equal.\n          After step2: we have given to Alice and Bob: a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n\n          But we want to have a=1 and b=1. How do we achieve that? \n            We should give the first candy to Alice and the last candy to Bob.\n\n          In the code: \n            Step1: \n                a=0<=b=0 -> a+=n[0]=1, l=1 -> now a=1, b=0.\n            Step2: \n                a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> so we do the else: b < a -> true -> then we do: b += n[2] (because r is initially 2) -> b=1, r=1.\n                then we check: a==b? 1==1 -> true -> then f = len(n)=3 - r=1 + l=1 - 1 = 3-1+1-1=2.\n            Step3: \n                l=1, r=1 -> then a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> a += n[1]=2, l=2 -> then a=3, b=1 -> not equal.\n            Step4: \n                l=2, r=1 -> break.\n\n          So we do get f=2.\n\n          But then later we set f=2, and then we set a=3, b=1, and then we break. So we print 2.\n\n          Why did we get the last candy for Bob as n[2]? \n            Because initially r=2, so n[r] is the last candy.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code in program2 is:\n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n          But note: the array is stored in the variable `n` (which is the list of candies). And r is the current right pointer.\n\n          So the code for the elif block should be:\n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n          And then after that, we have the if a==b: update f.\n\n          But note: the variable `n` is the list of candies, and r is an index into that list.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n                b += n[r]\n                r -= 1\n\n        However, note: the array indexing: the list `n` has `len(n)` elements, indexed 0 to len(n)-1. \n          Initially, r = len(n)-1, which is the last index.\n\n          When we do b += n[r], we are taking the candy at index r, then we do r -= 1, so the next available from the right is r-1.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the condition in the while: l<=r -> we stop when l>r.\n\n        And we update f every time a==b. We want the maximum total candies. \n          The total candies is updated every time we have a==b. \n          But note: we might have multiple times when a==b. We want the last one? or the one with the maximum total candies? \n          The total candies is l + (len(n)-r-1). \n          As we proceed, l increases and r decreases, so the total candies increases? \n          But not necessarily: \n            Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then f = 0 + (len(n)- (len(n)-1) - 1) = 0+ (1-1)=0? \n            Then as we add candies, the total candies increases.\n\n          Actually, the total candies = l + (len(n)-r-1) \n            = (l) + (n - r - 1)   [if we let n=len(n)]\n\n          As l increases and r decreases, the total candies increases.\n\n          Therefore, the last time we have a==b will be the maximum.\n\n          But is that true? \n            Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n            We want: Alice=[1,2,3] and Bob=[1,2,3] -> total=6, and sum=6.\n            But the entire array sum=12, so half=6.\n\n            Steps:\n              l=0, r=5, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> a=1, l=1 -> a=1, b=0 -> not equal.\n              a=1>0 -> b<a -> false? wait, b=0<1 -> true -> b+=n[5]=1, r=4 -> a=1, b=1 -> equal -> f = 1 + (6-4-1)=1+1=2.\n              Then l=1, r=4 -> a<=b? 1<=1 -> true -> a+=n[1]=2, l=2 -> a=3, b=1 -> not equal.\n              a=3>1 -> true -> b+=n[4]=2, r=3 -> a=3, b=3 -> equal -> f = 2 + (6-3-1)=2+2=4.\n              Then l=2, r=3 -> a<=b? 3<=3 -> true -> a+=n[2]=3, l=3 -> a=6, b=3 -> not equal.\n              a=6>3 -> true -> b+=n[3]=3, r=2 -> a=6, b=6 -> equal -> f = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6.\n              Then l=3, r=2 -> break.\n\n            So we get 6.\n\n          But what if we had stopped at the first time we got 2? we want the maximum, which is 6.\n\n          The code sets f every time we have a==b. So the last time we set f=6.\n\n          Therefore, we are good.\n\n        But note: the initialization: \n            a,b,l,f = [0]*4 \n            r = len(n)-1\n\n          Then we start.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\n        However, note: the array might be large, and we are guaranteed the total n over test cases is <=200000, so it's efficient.\n\n        But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <=200000, so we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n        program1: \"if s in d: r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\"\n        program2: \"b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n        But note: in program1, the variable `d` is a dictionary that maps prefix sum to the number of candies (the length). And we are iterating the suffix in reverse order.\n\n        And in program2, we must be careful: the code is indented. The TODO part is inside the elif block.\n\n        So for program2, the missing code is two lines.\n\n        Let's write the json.\n\n        Note: the problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\n        And the output format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        We must put the exact code.\n\n        For program1, the missing code is one line (or two if we do two lines? but the TODO is in one line). \n          The TODO says: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace that with: \n              r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\n\n        But note: the code already has \"if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        So we only need to put the code for the body of the if.\n\n        Similarly, for program2, the TODO is in the elif block: \n            elif b<a:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace with two lines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        So we output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\",\n          \"program2\": \"b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the indentation in program2: the existing code has 8 spaces for the body of the elif? \n          The current code:\n\n            while l<=r:\n                if a<=b:\n                    a += n[l]\n                    l += 1\n                elif b<a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if a==b:\n                    f = len(n) - r + l - 1\n\n          We want to replace the TODO with two lines that are indented by 8 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the two lines of code that should be in the elif block, with the same indentation as the if block above (which is 8 spaces). \n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the context.\n\n          In the if block above, the body is two lines: \n                a += n[l]\n                l += 1\n\n          So we output two lines with the same indentation.\n\n          But in the json string, we use \\n and then 8 spaces? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a literal newline and spaces? but the problem says output the json.\n\n          We can use a string with embedded newline and spaces.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that is missing, including the indentation.\n\n          However, the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the two lines of code for the elif block, and for program1, one line for the if body.\n\n          But the existing code in program1 has:\n\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO comment with the code, and we don't change the if condition.\n\n          So for program1, the missing part is the body of the if: \"r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1)\"\n\n          And for program2, the missing part is the body of the elif: two lines: \"b += n[r]\" and \"r -= 1\", each on a new line and indented by 8 spaces.\n\n          But the existing code in program2 has 8 spaces for the if block. So we output:\n\n          program2: \"b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n          The existing code has 8 spaces for the body, so we use 8 spaces for each line.\n\n        However, let me count the spaces in the given program2 code:\n\n            for n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n                a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n                while l<=r:\n                    if a<=b:\n                        a+=n[l]\n                        l+=1\n                    elif b<a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    if a==b:\n                        f=len(n)-r+l-1\n                print(f)\n\n          The body of the elif is currently a comment. The body of the if (a<=b) is two lines: \n                a+=n[l]\n                l+=1\n          which are indented by 8 spaces (two levels: 4 spaces per level, so two levels: 8 spaces).\n\n          So we should output two lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n          But in the json string, we can do:\n\n          \"program2\": \"        b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n          However, that would be 8 spaces at the beginning of the first line and then a newline and then 8 spaces for the second line.\n\n          But the existing code has the body of the elif at the same indentation as the body of the if.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the initial 8 spaces? because the code is to be placed at the position of the TODO, which is already indented.\n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the block.\n\n          Since the elif block is already started and indented, we only need the two lines of the body, each indented by 8 spaces relative to the while? \n\n          Actually, the structure:\n\n            while ...:\n                ... (already indented 4 spaces)\n                if ...:\n                    ... (indented 8 spaces)\n                elif ...:\n                    [we are here]\n\n          We are to put two lines that are at the same indentation as the body of the if (which is 8 spaces).\n\n          So we output:\n\n            \"program2\": \"b += n[r]\\n        r -= 1\"\n\n          But wait, the first line should be at "
