Therefore, the algorithm for a test case:\n        distinct = set(s)\n        if len(distinct) == 1:\n            ans = \"YES\"\n        else:\n            found = False\n            for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            ans = \"NO\" if found else \"YES\"\n\n   However, wait: what if the distinct set has size>=2, but we have a run of length>=2? Then we return \"NO\". Otherwise, we return \"YES\". But is that sufficient? Consider the example: \"abcde\" -> distinct set size=5 -> no adjacent same -> \"YES\". But is it balanced? Consider the substring \"a\": \n            for any two distinct characters, say 'a' and 'b': |1-0|=1 -> okay. Consider the substring \"ab\": \n            a:1, b:1 -> okay. Consider the substring \"abc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay. But what about a longer substring? The entire string: each distinct character appears once -> so for any two: |1-1|=0 -> okay.

So \"aba\" is balanced? But then why did we get for \"abac\" (which is \"aba\" with a 'c' at the end) that the substring \"aba\" fails? Because in \"abac\", the distinct set is {'a','b','c'}, and in the substring \"aba\", we have:\n                a:2, b:1, c:0 -> then |a-c|=2 -> fails. Therefore, the condition for \"aba\" (with distinct set {'a','b'}) is acceptable, but if we add a 'c' at the end then the distinct set becomes larger and the same substring \"aba\" now fails because of the missing 'c'. So the condition depends on the distinct set of the entire string. Therefore, the condition is:",

Consider \"abc\", distinct set size=3: \n            windows of length 3: only one window \"abc\" -> distinct count=3 -> skip -> ans remains \"YES\". -> correct.

Therefore, we can complete the template as:\n\n            t = int(input()) while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                k = len(var)\n                n = len(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                # We are going to check every window of length k\n                for i in range(n - k + 1):\n                    # Extract the window\n                    window = s[i:i+k]\n                    if len(set(window)) ! = k:\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break   # break out of the for-loop as soon as we find one bad window\n                print(ans)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000, so the total windows we check is the sum_{test cases} (n_i - k_i + 1) and the sum of n_i is 200,000, and k_i>=1, so the total windows is at most 200,000. However, worst-case: one test case with n=200,000 and k=1, then we do 200,000 windows, each of which we do a set of a string of length 1 -> 200,000 * 1 = 200,000 operations -> acceptable. But if k=26, then each set creation is O(26) -> 200,000 * 26 = 5,200,000 -> acceptable in Pyton.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 200,000, so we can do an O(n) or O(n * alphabet_size) solution per test case, but note that the alphabet is limited to 26.\n\n However, note the problem: We require that for every substring t and for every pair of characters u and v that appear in the entire string s, the absolute difference |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every substring t? Actually, the problem says: for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s.\n\n However, note the example: \"abb\" fails because of the substring \"bb\": for u='a' and v='b', we have |0-2| = 2.\n\n How to solve?\n Observation 1: The condition must hold for every substring. In particular, it must hold for every contiguous substring.\n\n But note: the condition is only required for characters u and v that are present in the entire string s. So if a character does not appear in s, we don't care.\n\n However, the problem becomes: for every substring t, and for every two distinct characters u and v that appear in s, we require |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n This is a very strong condition. Let's think:\n\n Consider the entire string s: then for any two characters u and v, we must have |f_s(u) - f_s(v)| <= 1. So the entire string must have frequencies that differ by at most 1. But note: the problem does not require the entire string to have that? Actually, it requires for every substring.\n\n However, note the example: \"abc\" is balanced. But what about \"aab\"? \n For \"aab\": \n   entire string: a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n   substring \"aa\": a:2, b:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> not okay.\n\n So the condition fails for the substring \"aa\". Therefore, \"aab\" is not balanced.\n\n Therefore, we must check for every substring? That is O(n^2) and n can be up to 200,000 -> too expensive.\n\n We need a better insight.\n\n Observation 2: The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. In particular, it must hold for every contiguous substring of length 2. Why?\n   Consider a substring of length 2: if it has two same letters, say \"aa\", then for u='a' and v='b' (if 'b' is present in s) we have |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n Therefore, if there is any contiguous substring of length 2 that has the same character, then the string is not balanced? \n But note: what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then the condition for any two characters: but there is only one character. So we don't have two distinct characters? Actually, the condition says \"u and v are characters present in s\". If there is only one character, then we don't have two distinct characters to compare? \n\n However, the problem says: \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". \n If there is only one distinct character, then we cannot choose two distinct u and v? So the condition is vacuously true? \n\n Therefore, we can say:\n   Condition 1: The string must not contain two consecutive same characters? Not exactly: because if the entire string has two distinct characters, then we must avoid having two consecutive same characters? But what about \"aba\": \n        substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> okay.\n        but what about \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        and \"ba\": same.\n\n   However, what about \"aab\": \n        substring \"aa\": fails.\n\n   So if we have two consecutive same characters, then we have a substring of length 2 that is \"aa\", and if there exists at least one other character in the entire string (say 'b'), then we have a problem? But what if the entire string is \"aaa\"? \n        Then the only character is 'a'. So we don't have two distinct characters? Then condition holds? \n\n   Therefore, we can break down:\n      Let distinct = set(s)\n      If we have any two consecutive same characters, then we must check: if the distinct set has size 1, then it's okay. Otherwise, it's not.\n\n   But wait: what about a substring of length 3: \"aaba\" -> \n        distinct = {'a','b'}, and we have \"aa\" at the beginning -> fails.\n\n   However, what about a substring of length 1? \n        For a substring of length 1, say \"a\": then for u='a' and v='b', we have |1-0|=1 -> okay? \n        But note: the condition says \"the difference ... is not more than 1\", so 1 is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the only problem is when we have two consecutive same characters and the distinct set has at least two characters? \n\n   But what about three distinct characters? \n        Example: \"aabc\": \n          substring \"aa\": for u='a' and v='b': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n   So the condition is: if the string has at least two distinct characters and there is any repeated adjacent character, then it fails.\n\n   However, what about non-adjacent? \n        Example: \"aba\": \n          adjacent: 'a' and 'b' -> different, then 'b' and 'a' -> different -> no adjacent same? \n          and it is balanced.\n\n   But what about \"abba\": \n        distinct = {'a','b'}\n        substring \"bb\": fails.\n\n   Therefore, we can say: \n        Condition 1: The string must not contain two consecutive same characters (if the distinct set has at least two characters). \n        But what if the consecutive same are not adjacent? Actually, the problem says contiguous substring. So if we have \"a\" then later \"a\" but separated by other characters, that's okay? Because the substring \"a\" and then the next \"a\" is not adjacent? \n\n        However, note: the substring \"bb\" in \"abba\" is contiguous and adjacent.\n\n   Therefore, we can check: \n        For i in range(len(s)-1):\n            if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                if len(set(s)) > 1:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n   But wait: what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then we don't break? \n\n   However, we must also consider: what if the string has two distinct characters but the consecutive same is at the beginning and then we break? \n\n   But note: the problem says the condition must hold for every substring. So if we have two consecutive same, then we have a substring of two same letters. Then if there is at least one other character in the entire string (so the distinct set has at least two), then we can choose u as that same letter and v as the other letter, and then the substring of two same letters has frequency 2 for u and 0 for v -> difference 2 -> fails.\n\n   However, what if the entire string has two distinct characters, but the consecutive same is not adjacent? Actually, we are only checking adjacent indices. But if two same are adjacent, then we have a contiguous substring of two same. But if two same are not adjacent, then we don't have a contiguous substring of two same? \n\n   But note: the condition fails only when we have a contiguous substring that has two same? Actually, the condition fails when we have a contiguous substring that has two same and there is at least one other character in the entire string? \n\n   However, what about a substring of length 3: \"aaa\" in a string that has two distinct characters? \n        Then for the substring \"aaa\", we have u='a' and v='b': |3-0|=3 -> fails.\n\n   So we must also avoid any run of the same character of length>=2? \n\n   But note: if the entire string has only one distinct character, then we don't have two distinct characters to compare? So runs of any length are okay? \n\n   Therefore, we can say:\n        If the distinct set has size 1: then we can have runs of any length -> then condition holds? \n        If the distinct set has size >=2: then we must have no run of the same character of length>=2? \n\n   But what about a run of length 3? Then we have a substring of two consecutive same (which is contained in the run) -> so we already break at the first adjacent same? \n\n   However, what if the run is of length 3: then we have two adjacent pairs: (0,1) and (1,2) are both same. So we would break at the first adjacent same.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n        If the distinct set has size >= 2:\n            for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n            else:\n                # if we didn't break, then no adjacent same -> then condition holds?\n                ans = \"YES\"\n\n   But wait: is that sufficient? \n        Consider \"abc\": distinct set size=3 -> no adjacent same -> so we return \"YES\" -> correct.\n        Consider \"aba\": distinct set size=3 -> no adjacent same? \n            a and b: different, b and a: different -> so no adjacent same -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n        But what about \"aab\": distinct set size=2 -> we see s[0]=='a' and s[1]=='a' -> break and return \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n        What about \"abac\": distinct set size=3 -> we check: \n            a and b: different -> skip\n            b and a: different -> skip\n            a and c: different -> skip -> then \"YES\"\n\n        But is \"abac\" balanced?\n            Consider substring \"aba\": \n                a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            Consider substring \"abac\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> for any two: \n                    a and b: |2-1|=1 -> okay\n                    a and c: |2-1|=1 -> okay\n                    b and c: |1-1|=0 -> okay\n            But what about substring \"aa\"? \n                Actually, there is no contiguous substring \"aa\" in \"abac\". \n            However, what about substring \"a\" (the first one) and the last one? \n                The substring \"a\" is okay.\n\n        But wait: the substring \"a\" (the first one) and the substring \"a\" (the last one) are not contiguous together? \n\n        However, the problem says contiguous substring. So we don't have a contiguous substring \"aa\" in \"abac\". \n\n        Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n   But what about a more complex example: \"aabc\" -> \n        distinct set size=3 -> we see the first two: 'a' and 'a' -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n   However, what about a string with three distinct characters and a run of two in the middle? \n        Example: \"abba\": \n            distinct set size=2 -> we see the first: 'a' and 'b' -> skip, then 'b' and 'b' -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the distinct set has size 2, but the run is of length 1? Then we don't have consecutive same? \n\n   Therefore, the algorithm for a test case:\n        distinct = set(s)\n        if len(distinct) == 1:\n            ans = \"YES\"\n        else:\n            found = False\n            for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            ans = \"NO\" if found else \"YES\"\n\n   However, wait: what if the distinct set has size>=2, but we have a run of length>=2? Then we return \"NO\". Otherwise, we return \"YES\".\n\n   But is that sufficient? \n\n   Consider the example: \"abcde\" -> distinct set size=5 -> no adjacent same -> \"YES\". \n        But is it balanced?\n        Consider the substring \"a\": \n            for any two distinct characters, say 'a' and 'b': |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n        Consider the substring \"ab\": \n            a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        Consider the substring \"abc\": \n            a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n        But what about a longer substring? \n            The entire string: each distinct character appears once -> so for any two: |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n\n        So it is balanced.\n\n   However, what about a string with two distinct characters and no consecutive same? \n        Example: \"abab\" -> \n            distinct set size=2 -> no consecutive same? \n                a and b: different\n                b and a: different\n                a and b: different -> so no consecutive same -> we return \"YES\".\n\n        But is it balanced?\n            Consider substring \"aba\": \n                a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n            Consider substring \"ab\": \n                a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n            Consider substring \"ba\": \n                same.\n            Consider substring \"bab\": \n                b:2, a:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n        So it is balanced.\n\n   But wait: what about a substring that is \"a\" and then a substring that is \"b\"? \n        The condition is for a contiguous substring and for two distinct characters that appear in the entire string. \n\n        The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. \n\n        In \"abab\", we don't have a contiguous substring that has two same? \n\n        Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n   However, what about the example in the note: \"abb\" -> fails because of \"bb\". \n\n   Therefore, the above algorithm seems to work.\n\n   But wait: what about a run of length 3? \n        Example: \"aaabc\", distinct set size=3 -> we break at the first adjacent same (the first two 'a') -> \"NO\".\n\n   And indeed, the substring \"aa\" fails.\n\n   But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 200,000. So we can do a single pass per string.\n\n   However, the problem says: the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200,000. So we can do:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        for each test case:\n            s = input()\n            distinct = set(s)\n            if len(distinct) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        break\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait: what if the string has distinct set size>=2 and we break in the middle? Then we print \"NO\" and break the for-loop, then move to next test case.\n\n   However, we must not break the outer loop? We break the inner for-loop and then print \"NO\", then we go to the next test case.\n\n   But note: the else clause of the for-loop: it is executed only if the loop did not break.\n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n   However, let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct set = {'a','b'} -> size=2 -> then we check:\n            i=0: 'a' and 'b' -> not equal -> continue.\n            i=1: 'b' and 'a' -> not equal -> continue.\n            then else: print \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"abb\" -> distinct set = {'a','b'} -> size=2 -> \n            i=0: 'a' and 'b' -> not equal -> continue.\n            i=1: 'b' and 'b' -> equal -> break and print \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"abc\" -> distinct set = {'a','b','c'} -> \n            no adjacent same -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: \"a\" -> distinct set = {'a'} -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 5: \"aa\" -> distinct set = {'a'} -> \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 6: \"aab\" -> distinct set = {'a','b'} -> \n            i=0: 'a' and 'a' -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n   But wait: what about a string with more than two distinct characters and a run? \n        Example: \"aabbcc\" -> distinct set = {'a','b','c'} -> \n            i=0: 'a' and 'a' -> break -> \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n   However, what about a string that has two distinct characters and no consecutive same, but a run of one character separated by another? \n        Example: \"ababa\" -> distinct set = {'a','b'} -> \n            i0: a==b? no.\n            i1: b==a? no.\n            i2: a==b? no.\n            i3: b==a? no. -> then \"YES\" -> correct.\n\n   But wait: what about the substring \"aaa\" in a string? \n        Actually, if we have a run of three, we break at the first adjacent same. \n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct = set(s)\n            if len(distinct) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                found = False\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if found else \"YES\")\n\n   However, note the problem statement: the total length of all strings is <= 200,000. So the above loop over each string is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200,000\". So we are safe.\n\n   However, the provided code template is:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        while (t > 0):\n            t -= 1\n            s = str(input())\n            var = set(s)\n            ans = \"YES\"\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            print(ans)\n\n   This template is different. It is trying to check for a contiguous substring of length = len(var) that does not have all distinct characters? \n\n   How does that relate?\n\n   Let me think: \n        The condition: the string must be such that every contiguous substring of length = (number of distinct characters) must have all distinct characters? \n\n   Why? \n\n   Consider: if the entire string has k distinct characters. Then if we have a contiguous substring of length k that does not have all distinct characters, then it must have a duplicate? \n\n   But note: the condition we deduced above is that if there is any adjacent duplicate (any two consecutive same) and k>=2, then the string is not balanced. \n\n   However, the template is checking for a window of length k (where k = |var|) that is not having all distinct characters. \n\n   How does that relate to our condition?\n\n   Example: \"aba\": k=2 -> we check windows of length 2: \n        s[0:2] = \"ab\" -> set has size 2 -> okay.\n        s[1:3] = \"ba\" -> set has size 2 -> okay.\n\n   Then we don't set ans to \"NO\", so we print \"YES\".\n\n   Example: \"abb\": k=2 -> \n        s[0:2] = \"ab\" -> set size=2 -> okay.\n        s[1:3] = \"bb\" -> set size=1 -> not equal to 2 -> then we set ans to \"NO\" -> and then break? \n\n   But note: the template does not break, it just sets something? \n\n   The template:\n\n        ans = \"YES\"\n        for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n            if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must set ans to \"NO\" and break? \n\n   But wait: what if we find one window that fails? Then the string is not balanced? \n\n   However, is that sufficient? \n\n   Consider \"aab\": \n        distinct = {'a','b'} -> k=2.\n        windows: \n            i=0: \"aa\" -> set has size 1 -> not 2 -> set ans to \"NO\", then break? \n\n   Then we print \"NO\" -> correct.\n\n   But what about \"abac\": \n        distinct = {'a','b','c'} -> k=3.\n        windows:\n            i=0: \"aba\" -> set has size 2 -> not 3 -> set ans to \"NO\", then break? \n        Then we print \"NO\".\n\n   But wait, we argued earlier that \"abac\" is balanced? \n\n   However, let me check: \n        substring \"aba\": \n            for u='a' and v='c': |2-0|=2 -> fails? \n\n        Oh no! I made a mistake earlier.\n\n        In \"abac\", consider the substring \"aba\": \n            u='a' and v='c': \n                frequency of 'a' in \"aba\" is 2, frequency of 'c' is 0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, \"abac\" is not balanced.\n\n   So what is the condition? \n\n   We must have that in every contiguous substring, the frequencies of any two characters that appear in the entire string differ by at most 1.\n\n   In \"abac\", the entire string has characters {'a','b','c'}. The substring \"aba\" has a:2, b:1, c:0. \n        For u='a' and v='c': |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n   Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n   How to fix? \n\n   We must avoid having a substring that has two of one character and zero of another? \n\n   How can we characterize? \n\n   Observation: \n        In any contiguous substring, the frequencies of the characters that appear in the entire string must be as balanced as possible. \n\n        In fact, the condition requires that for any two characters u and v, |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n        This implies that in the substring t, the frequencies of the characters that appear in the entire string can differ by at most 1. \n\n        But note: it is possible that in t, some characters of the entire string do not appear? Then the frequency is 0. \n\n        Therefore, if the entire string has k distinct characters, then in the substring t, the frequency of the most frequent character and the least frequent character (among the k) can differ by at most 1? \n\n        However, the condition is for every pair. So if we have three characters: a:2, b:1, c:0 -> then |a-b|=1, |a-c|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails if there is a character in the entire string that does not appear in the substring and there is a character that appears at least twice? \n\n        In fact, the condition requires that in every contiguous substring t, every character that is present in the entire string s must appear in t at least once? \n\n        Why? \n            If a character v is missing in t, then f_t(v)=0. Then for a character u that appears at least twice in t, we have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = f_t(u) >= 2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must have that every contiguous substring t that we consider must contain every distinct character of s? \n\n        But note: the condition is for every contiguous substring? \n\n        Consider a contiguous substring of length 1: \n            It contains only one character. Then if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then there is at least one character missing. Then for the character that is present (say u) and a missing character (v), we have |1-0|=1 -> acceptable? \n\n        The condition says \"not more than 1\", so 1 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for a substring of length 1 is acceptable.\n\n        Now consider a substring of length 2: \n            It must contain two distinct characters? \n            If it contains two distinct characters: then for any two characters u and v in s: \n                if u and v are both in the substring: then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n                if one of them is missing: then the one that is present has frequency 1 and the missing one has 0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n            But what if the substring has two same? \n                Then it has one distinct character. Then for that character u and a distinct character v (that is in s but not in t): |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails for a substring of two same if the entire string has at least two distinct characters.\n\n        Now consider a substring of length 3 in a string that has three distinct characters: \n            It must contain all three? \n            If it does: then each appears once -> |1-1|=0 for any two -> okay.\n            If it does not: then at least one character is missing. Then if one character appears twice and the other two are missing? \n                Then for the character that appears twice and a missing character: |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n            If it contains two distinct characters: \n                Then one character appears twice and the other once? \n                    Then for the character that appears twice and a missing character: |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, in a string that has k distinct characters, every contiguous substring of length k must contain all k distinct characters? \n\n        But note: what about a substring of length k-1? \n            Then it must be missing at least one character. Then if one character appears twice? \n                Then |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n            Therefore, we must avoid having a substring of length k-1 that has a duplicate? \n\n        Actually, we must avoid having any duplicate in any contiguous substring? \n\n        But wait: if we have a substring that has a duplicate, then we have at least one character appearing twice. Then if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then there is at least one character missing in that substring? Then |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is equivalent to: \n            The string must not contain any duplicate? \n\n        But that would mean the string must have all distinct characters? \n\n        However, consider \"aba\": \n            It has a duplicate: two 'a's. And we saw that it fails? \n\n        But wait: we just saw that \"aba\" fails because of the substring \"aba\" (which has two 'a's and one 'b') and then we compare 'a' and 'c'? Actually, in \"aba\", the entire string has distinct set {'a','b'}, so we don't have 'c'. \n\n        Then why did we think \"aba\" was balanced? \n\n        Let me recalculate for \"aba\" (with distinct set {'a','b'}):\n            substring \"aba\": \n                u='a', v='b': |2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"aa\": does not exist.\n            substring \"a\": \n                u='a', v='b': |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"b\": \n                u='a', v='b': |0-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"ab\": \n                u='a', v='b': |1-1|=0 -> acceptable.\n            substring \"ba\": \n                same.\n\n        So \"aba\" is balanced? \n\n        But then why did we get for \"abac\" (which is \"aba\" with a 'c' at the end) that the substring \"aba\" fails? \n            Because in \"abac\", the distinct set is {'a','b','c'}, and in the substring \"aba\", we have:\n                a:2, b:1, c:0 -> then |a-c|=2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for \"aba\" (with distinct set {'a','b'}) is acceptable, but if we add a 'c' at the end then the distinct set becomes larger and the same substring \"aba\" now fails because of the missing 'c'.\n\n        So the condition depends on the distinct set of the entire string.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            For every contiguous substring t, and for every character u in the entire distinct set, the frequency of u in t must be at least the maximum frequency in t minus 1? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: for every two characters u and v in the entire distinct set, |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n            Let M = max{ f_t(u) for u in distinct_set } and m = min{ f_t(u) for u in distinct_set }.\n            Then M - m <= 1.\n\n        And note: the min might be 0.\n\n        Therefore, if there is any character in the distinct set that does not appear in t, then m=0, and then we require M<=1.\n\n        That is, no character can appear more than once in t.\n\n        And if all characters in the distinct set appear in t, then we require M-m<=1, meaning that the frequencies are either all equal or one more for some.\n\n        But note: the entire distinct set might be large, and we are considering every contiguous substring.\n\n        How to check without iterating over all substrings? \n\n        We know that if the distinct set has size k, then:\n          - Every contiguous substring of length < k must have no duplicate? Why?\n                Because if a substring of length < k has a duplicate, then one character appears at least twice, and since the length is less than k, at least one character of the distinct set is missing -> then m=0 and M>=2 -> fails.\n          - Every contiguous substring of length k must have exactly one occurrence of each character? \n                Why? Because if it has a duplicate, then one character appears twice and then (since the substring has length k) we have one character missing? Actually, no: if we have k distinct characters and one duplicate, then we have k+1 characters? \n                Actually, the substring of length k must have k distinct characters? But if it has a duplicate, then it has k-1 distinct characters? \n                Then we are missing at least one character -> then m=0 and M>=2 -> fails.\n\n          - Every contiguous substring of length k+1: \n                It must have exactly k distinct characters? And then the frequencies: one character appears twice and the others once -> then M=2, m=1 -> M-m=1 -> acceptable.\n\n          - Every contiguous substring of length k+2: \n                It must have exactly k distinct characters? And then the frequencies: either one character appears 3 and the others 1? -> then M=3, m=1 -> 3-1=2 -> fails.\n                or two characters appear twice and the others once -> then M=2, m=1 -> 2-1=1 -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid having a contiguous substring of length k+2 that has one character appearing 3 times? \n\n        But note: if we have a contiguous substring of length k+2 that has one character appearing 3 times, then we are missing no character? Actually, we have k distinct characters? Then the min frequency is 1 and the max is 3 -> 3-1=2 -> fails.\n\n        How to enforce? \n\n        We see that the only acceptable contiguous substrings are those that have length at most k, and those that have length>=k must have the property that the frequencies are at most floor(length/k) or ceil(length/k)? \n\n        This becomes complex.\n\n        Alternative insight from known problems: \n            This problem is known as \"Perfectly Balanced\" and has appeared in Codeforces (Round #785 (Div. 2), problem B). \n\n        Known solution: \n            The string is perfectly balanced if and only if for every contiguous substring of length L, and for every two characters, the condition holds. \n\n        But efficient solution: \n            We know that the condition fails if there exists a contiguous substring t and two characters u and v such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2.\n\n            This is equivalent to: \n                There exists a contiguous substring t and a character u such that f_t(u) >= 2 and there exists a character v in the distinct set that does not appear in t? \n                OR \n                There exists a contiguous substring t and two characters u and v that appear in t such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2.\n\n            But note: if there is a character v missing in t, then we are in the first case: then we require that no character appears twice in t.\n\n            The second case: if all characters of the distinct set appear in t, then we require that the frequencies are balanced.\n\n        However, the known solution in Codeforces for this problem is: \n            The string is perfectly balanced if and only if for every contiguous substring of length 2, the two characters are different, and for every contiguous substring of length 3, the three characters are distinct? \n            But that is not sufficient: consider \"abacaba\": \n                distinct set = {'a','b','c'} -> k=3.\n                contiguous substrings of length 2: all distinct? \n                    \"ab\", \"ba\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"ab\", \"ba\" -> distinct.\n                contiguous substrings of length 3: \n                    \"aba\": not distinct -> fails.\n\n            And indeed, \"aba\" has a duplicate and is missing 'c' -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must check for every contiguous substring of length k (the distinct count) and also for every contiguous substring of length k+1? \n\n        But note: the total length of all strings is 200,000, but k can be up to 26. \n\n        We can do: \n            For each test case, we iterate over the string and for each starting index i, we consider the substring starting at i of length k and k+1? \n            The number of such substrings is O(n) and for each we do O(k) or O(1) with a sliding window? \n\n        However, the total n over test cases is 200,000, and k<=26, so we can do:\n\n            k = len(set(s))\n            # We want to check: \n            #   For every contiguous substring of length < k: must have no duplicate? \n            #   But wait: if a contiguous substring of length < k has a duplicate, then we have a duplicate and also we are missing at least one character -> fails.\n            #   For every contiguous substring of length >= k: must have the property that the frequency of the most frequent letter is at most 1 more than the minimum frequency? \n\n            However, the condition is very strong.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to check for the condition: \n            We know that if there is any contiguous substring that has a duplicate and also is missing at least one letter, then it fails.\n\n            But note: if a contiguous substring has a duplicate, then it must be of length at least 2. And if it has a duplicate and the distinct set has size at least 2, then it is missing at least one letter (because the distinct set has size>=2 and the substring has at most (length) distinct letters, but if it has a duplicate then the number of distinct letters is at most length-1, and if the distinct set has size k, then if k>=2, then the substring might be missing at least one letter).\n\n            However, if the distinct set has size 1, then we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if k == 1:\n                return \"YES\"\n            else:\n                # Check for any contiguous substring of length L (>=2) that has a duplicate and for which there exists at least one letter in the distinct set that is missing in the substring.\n                # But note: if the substring has a duplicate, then the number of distinct letters in the substring is at most L-1. And since the distinct set has size k, if L-1 < k, then the substring is missing at least one letter -> fails.\n                # Also, if L>=k, then even if the substring has a duplicate, it might have exactly k distinct letters? Then we require that the frequencies are balanced? \n\n                # However, we can simplify: \n                #   The condition fails if there is any contiguous substring that has a duplicate and has length < k+ (what?) \n\n                # Actually, if we have a contiguous substring of length L that has a duplicate, then if L < k+ (the number of distinct letters in the entire string), then it is missing at least one letter -> fails.\n\n                # But note: the number of distinct letters in the substring is at most L-1 (because of the duplicate). And if L-1 < k, then it is missing at least one letter -> fails.\n\n                # Therefore, we require that for every contiguous substring of length L < k+1, there is no duplicate? \n                #   Because if L < k+1, then L-1 < k, so it is missing at least one letter.\n\n                # And for L>=k+1, we might be okay? \n\n                # But wait: what if L = k+1 and the substring has one letter appearing twice and the others once?

Let t be minimal in length. \n                If the length is 1: then for any two letters u and v in the distinct set, |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1 -> holds (because one letter has frequency 1 and the others 0, so difference 1). \n                If the length is 2: then if it has two same letters, then for the letter u that appears twice and a letter v that is in the distinct set and not in t, we have |2-0|=2 -> fails. And if it has two distinct letters, then it holds.\n                If the length is 3: \n                    It might fail if:\n                      - It has three same letters: then for u= that letter and v any other in distinct set: |3-0|=3 -> fails.\n                      - It has two of one letter and one of another: then if there is a third letter in the distinct set that is missing, then |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n                If the length is 4 or more: \n                    We can always find a shorter substring that fails? \n                    For example, if we have a substring of length 4 that fails, then consider:\n                      - If it has a letter that appears 3 times and the others once? But then we have at least two distinct letters? \n                      - But wait, if the distinct set has size 2, then in a substring of length 4: \n                            frequencies: [3,1] -> then |3-1|=2 -> fails. \n                      - But then we can take a substring of length 2: if there is a run of two same, then we are done. \n                      - If not, then the string must be alternating: abab. \n                            Then the substring of length 4: a:2, b:2 -> |2-2|=0 -> okay.\n                      - So how do we catch \"aaab\" (with distinct set size=2) in a substring of length 4? \n                            The substring \"aaab\": a:3, b:1 -> fails.\n                            But we can take a substring of length 2: \"aa\" -> fails.\n\n                    Therefore, if there is a substring that fails, then there is one of length at most 3.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to check all contiguous substrings of length 2 and 3.\n\n        Algorithm for a test case:\n            distinct = set(s)\n            if len(distinct) == 1:\n                return \"YES\"\n            else:\n                # Check all substrings of length 2 and 3.\n                n = len(s)\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    # Check substring of length 2: s[i:i+2]\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        return \"NO\"\n                    # Check substring of length 3 if possible\n                    if i < n-2:\n                        if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                            # This is \"aba\" -> then if the distinct set has size>=3, then this substring has two 'a's and one 'b', and is missing at least one letter (if distinct set has size>=3) -> fails.\n                            # But wait, what if distinct set has size 2? \n                            #   Then the distinct set is {'a','b'}. \n                            #   In the substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n                            #   So it is not a problem.\n                            # However, what if distinct set has size 3? \n                            #   Then we are missing one letter, say 'c'.

\n\n        The template is checking: for every window of length = len(var), the number of distinct characters in the window is exactly len(var). \n\n        But we know that if there is any window of length = len(var) that does not have all distinct characters, then the string is not balanced? \n\n        Why? \n            Let k = len(var)\n            If a window of length k does not have all distinct characters, then it has at most k-1 distinct characters. \n            Then it has a duplicate and is missing at least one character (because the entire distinct set has size k, and the window has at most k-1 distinct characters, so it is missing at least one). \n            Then for the duplicate letter u and a missing letter v: |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| = |at least 1 (actually at least 2) - 0| = at least 2 -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, if we find one window of length k that does not have all distinct characters, then we can set ans = \"NO\", and break? \n\n        But is that sufficient? \n\n        Consider: we also need to check windows of length not equal to k? \n            We argued that any window that has a duplicate and is missing at least one letter fails. \n            And a window of length k that does not have all distinct characters is such a window.\n\n        But what about windows of length < k? \n            If there is a window of length L < k that has a duplicate, then it has at most L-1 distinct characters. Since L<k, it is missing at least one letter (because the distinct set has size k, and the window has at most L-1 < k distinct letters). Then it fails.\n\n        How to catch windows of length < k? \n            We are only checking windows of length k.\n\n        Therefore, we must also check windows of length 2 and 3? \n\n        But note: if there is a window of length 2 that has a duplicate, then it is of length 2 and has only one distinct character. Then if k>=2, it is missing at least one letter -> fails.\n\n        How to catch that with the window of length k? \n            We might not catch it if k>2.\n\n        Example: \"aabc\", k=3.\n            We check windows of length 3:\n                i0: \"aab\" -> distinct count = 2 != 3 -> set ans=\"NO\".\n            But what about the window \"aa\" (length2)? \n                We didn't check it.\n\n        But note: the window \"aab\" (length3) already fails, so we return \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        However, consider a string \"aa\" with distinct set size=2: \n            We would check window of length 2: \n                \"aa\" -> distinct count = 1 != 2 -> set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\n        Consider a string \"a\" with distinct set size=1: \n            the loop: range(len(s)-len(var)+1) = range(1-1+1)=range(1) -> i=0: window = s[0:1]=\"a\" -> distinct count=1 -> skip -> then ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        Consider \"aba\", distinct set size=2: \n            windows of length 2: \n                i0: \"ab\" -> distinct count=2 -> skip.\n                i1: \"ba\" -> distinct count=2 -> skip.\n            then ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        Consider \"abac\", distinct set size=3: \n            windows of length 3:\n                i0: \"aba\" -> distinct count=2 !=3 -> set ans=\"NO\", and we break?

\n                We don't check windows of length 1. \n                However, the condition fails at the window of length 2, so we catch it.\n\n        But what if the string is \"aba\", k=2: \n            windows of length 2: \n                i0: \"ab\" -> distinct count=2 -> skip.\n                i1: \"ba\" -> distinct count=2 -> skip.\n            then ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        However, consider a string \"abc\", k=3: \n            windows of length 3: \n                i0: \"abc\" -> distinct count=3 -> skip.\n            then ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        But consider a string \"aabcd\", distinct set size=3: \n            windows of length 3:\n                i0: \"aab\" -> distinct count=2 !=3 -> set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is to check every window of length k (the distinct count) and if any window does not have exactly k distinct characters, then the string is not balanced.\n\n        Why is that equivalent to the condition? \n            We argued that if there is any window (contiguous substring) that has a duplicate and is missing at least one letter, then it fails. \n            And a window of length k that does not have k distinct characters is such a window: it has a duplicate (because the window length is k and distinct count < k implies at least one duplicate) and is missing at least one letter (because distinct count < k).\n\n            And conversely, if there is a window that fails, then we can find a window of length at most 3 that fails, and note that 3<=k when k>=3, and if k=2 then we only need to check windows of length 2. \n\n            But what if k>=4 and there is a window of length 2 that fails? \n                Example: \"aa\" in a string with distinct set size=4. \n                Then we will have a window of length 2 that has distinct count=1 !=4 -> we catch it.\n\n            Therefore, we are checking windows of length k, but if there is a window of length L (with L<k) that has a duplicate, then consider any window of length k that contains this window. \n                But note: we are also checking windows of length k that start at the same starting index? \n                Actually, we are not checking windows of length L<k.\n\n            However, if there is a window of length L<k that has a duplicate, then we can extend it to a window of length k by adding k-L characters to the right (if possible). \n                But the extended window might have more distinct characters? \n\n            But note: we are not required to extend. We are only checking windows of length k. \n\n            However, we have an example: \"aa\" in a string of distinct set size=3. \n                We must check a window of length 3 that starts at the same index: \n                    If the string is \"aab...\", then the window starting at index0 of length3 is \"aab\", which has distinct count=2 !=3 -> we catch it.\n\n            What if the duplicate is not at the beginning? \n                Example: \"baa\", distinct set size=3. \n                We check windows of length3:\n                    i0: \"baa\" -> distinct count=2 !=3 -> catch.\n\n            What if the duplicate is isolated and not in a window of length k? \n                Example: \"a\" followed by many distinct letters, but then we have a duplicate far away? \n                But then we will check the window that starts at the duplicate: \n                    For instance, s = \"a\" + (k-1 distinct letters) + \"a\", and the distinct set size = k (because we have k distinct letters: the 'a' and the k-1 others). \n                    Then we check the window that starts at the last 'a'? \n                        But the window length is k, and we are at the last character: the window would be the last k characters. \n                        This window includes the last 'a' and the k-1 distinct letters? \n                        Then distinct count = k -> okay.\n\n                But wait, is this string balanced? \n                    The entire string has distinct set size = k.\n                    The substring \"a\" (the first one) is not a problem? \n                        For the substring \"a\": \n                            u='a', v= any other letter in the distinct set: |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                    The substring that is the entire string: \n                        a:2, and the other k-1 letters:1 -> then for u='a' and v= any other: |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n                Therefore, it is balanced.\n\n            Therefore, the solution is to check every window of length k. \n\n        But note: the total length of all strings is 200,000, and k is at most 26. \n            The number of windows per string: n - k + 1, and the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the total windows is at most 200,000 * 26? \n            But note: k is the distinct count, which is at most 26, but the window length is k, and we are taking set of the window -> which is O(k) per window. \n            Total operations: (n - k + 1) * k <= n * k, and k<=26, so total operations <= 200,000 * 26 = 5,200,000 -> acceptable in Python.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n - k + 1):\n                substring = s[i:i+k]\n                if len(set(substring)) != k:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        However, we can optimize by using a sliding window and a frequency array to avoid creating a set for each window? \n            But k is at most 26, and the total n is 200,000, and the total over test cases is 200,000, so 200,000 * 26 = 5.2e6 which is acceptable in Pyton.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000. So the total number of windows is the sum_{test cases} (n_i - k_i + 1) and the sum of n_i is 200,000, and k_i<=26, so the total windows is at most 200,000 (since n_i - k_i + 1 <= n_i). \n\n        Actually, the total number of windows is the sum_{test cases} max(0, n_i - k_i + 1). \n            Since k_i>=1, then n_i - k_i + 1 <= n_i, and the sum of n_i is 200,000, so the total windows is at most 200,000.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(n - k + 1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+k])) != k:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        But note: creating a set of a string of length k: the set operation is O(k), and k<=26, so the total cost is 200,000 * 26 = 5,200,000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the template is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while t:\n                t -= 1\n                s = input().strip()\n                k = len(set(s))\n                n = len(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                # If the string length is less than k, then we don't enter the loop -> but k is the distinct count, so k<=n, so we are safe.\n                for i in range(n - k + 1):\n                    # Check the substring s[i:i+k]\n                    if len(set(s[i:i+k])) != k:\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break\n                print(ans)\n\n        Let me test with a small example: \n            s = \"aa\", k = 1, n=2.\n            range(2-1+1) = range(2) -> i=0: substring = s[0:1] = \"a\" -> set has size 1 -> skip.\n                         i=1: substring = s[1:2] = \"a\" -> set has size 1 -> skip.\n            then ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        But wait: we also need to consider that the condition fails if there is a window of length less than k that has a duplicate? \n            But note: k is the distinct count. \n            In \"aa\", k=1, and there is no window of length 1 that has a duplicate? \n            Actually, a window of length 1 has one distinct -> okay.\n\n        However, we argued that if there is a window of length L<k that has a duplicate, then we will catch it in a window of length k that contains it? \n            But in \"aa\", k=1, and L=2: but we are not checking windows of length 2? \n            But note: k=1, so we only check windows of length 1. \n\n        But the condition for the entire string: \n            The distinct set has size 1, so we don't have two distinct characters to compare? -> vacuously true.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n        However, what about \"aab\", k=2: \n            windows of length 2: \n                i0: \"aa\" -> set has size 1 !=2 -> set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"aba\", k=2: \n            windows of length 2: \n                i0: \"ab\" -> set size=2 -> skip.\n                i1: \"ba\" -> set size=2 -> skip.\n            ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"abac\", k=3: \n            windows of length 3:\n                i0: \"aba\" -> set size=2 !=3 -> set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"abc\", k=3: \n            one window: \"abc\" -> set size=3 -> skip -> ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"a\", k=1: \n            window: s[0:1]=\"a\" -> set size=1 -> skip -> ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"ab\", k=2: \n            window: s[0:2]=\"ab\" -> set size=2 -> skip -> ans=\"YES\". -> correct.\n\n        What about \"abb\", k=2: \n            windows:\n                i0: \"ab\" -> set size=2 -> skip.\n                i1: \"bb\" -> set size=1 !=2 -> set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can complete the template as:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                k = len(var)\n                n = len(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                # We are going to check every window of length k\n                for i in range(n - k + 1):\n                    # Extract the window\n                    window = s[i:i+k]\n                    if len(set(window)) != k:\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break   # break out of the for-loop as soon as we find one bad window\n                print(ans)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is 200,000, so the total windows we check is the sum_{test cases} (n_i - k_i + 1) and the sum of n_i is 200,000, and k_i>=1, so the total windows is at most 200,000. \n\n        However, worst-case: one test case with n=200,000 and k=1, then we do 200,000 windows, each of which we do a set of a string of length 1 -> 200,000 * 1 = 200,000 operations -> acceptable.\n\n        But if k=26, then each set creation is O(26) -> 200,000 * 26 = 5,200,000 -> acceptable in Pyton.\n\n        Therefore, we output the completed template.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and the missing code is in the TODO part.\n\n        The template:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                    if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                print(ans)\n\n        We need to set ans to \"NO\" and break.\n\n        So the TODO part is:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        But note: we must break to avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n        Therefore, the completed code for program1.py is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                    if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break\n                print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py? \n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the output format is: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        But we are only given one template: for program1.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        So what is program2.py? \n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        But in the input, we are only given one template for program1.py. \n\n        And the example output format includes both.\n\n        Therefore, we must also provide the completion for program2.py? \n\n        But the problem does not show program2.py. \n\n        Let me reread the problem: \n            \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        And the example output format is a json with two fields.\n\n        How can we complete program2.py if we are not given it? \n\n        I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in the input we are only given one program? \n\n        Looking back: \n            The user input has:\n                # program1.py\n                ... template ...\n\n            But there is no program2.py template.\n\n        The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        So I think we are expected to complete both. But we are only given one.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps program2.py is not provided and we have to write it from scratch? \n\n        But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", implying that we are given a template for both.\n\n        However, the user input only shows program1.py.\n\n        Let me check the sample test: \n            The problem says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" \n            That was for a different problem (candies) and now we are on a different problem (balanced string).\n\n        I see: the problem has two parts? \n\n        Actually, the problem we are solving now is the balanced string problem, and the example of the candies was for a different problem? \n\n        The user input has:\n\n            You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\n\n            Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n            Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n            # program1.py\n            ... template for the balanced string problem ...\n\n        And there is no program2.py template.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but only one is provided. \n\n        I think there might be a mistake. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps program2.py is the same for all problems? \n\n        The command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        This pipes the output of program1.py to program2.py.\n\n        What is the output of program1.py? \n            For each test case, it prints \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n        What should be the output of the entire pipeline? \n            The problem does not specify. \n\n        But the problem says: \"runs correctly\", meaning that the entire pipeline should output the correct answers for the test cases.\n\n        How can we design program2.py? \n\n        We are not given any template for program2.py.\n\n        I think we are expected to complete only program1.py, and program2.py is not needed? \n\n        But the output format requires both.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps program2.py is provided in the system and we don't need to change it? \n\n        But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\" for both.\n\n        Given the confusion, and since the problem states that we are only given program1.py, I will assume that program2.py is not provided and we don't need to change it? \n\n        But the output format requires a string for program2.\n\n        Or perhaps program2.py is trivial and we can leave it as an identity (just print the input)? \n\n        But then the pipeline would output the same as program1.py, which is the answers for the test cases.\n\n        And that is the desired output.\n\n        Therefore, program2.py might be:\n\n            import sys\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line.strip())\n\n        But that is not modifying anything.\n\n        Or it might be that program2.py is not provided and we are only to complete program1.py.\n\n        Given the problem statement, I think we are only given one program to complete. \n\n        But the output format requires two.\n\n        I see the example: \n            \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n        And the completion for program2 might be an empty string? \n\n        Or we are expected to provide the entire program2.py if it is missing? \n\n        But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so if program2.py is completely missing, then we have to provide the whole program.\n\n        How should program2.py look? \n            It should take the output of program1.py and produce the final output.\n\n            The output of program1.py is a sequence of \"YES\" and \"NO\" for each test case, one per line.\n\n            The final output should be the same.\n\n        Therefore, program2.py can be a simple pipe that passes through, but we must output the same.\n\n        But the problem does not specify any transformation.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume program2.py is not needed and we can output an empty string for its completion? \n\n        Or we can output a program that does nothing.\n\n        However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", implying that we are given a template for program2.py and we have to complete it. \n\n        Since we are not given any template for program2.py, I will assume that we are only to complete program1.py, and for program2.py we output an empty string.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", so if program2.py is not provided, then we cannot complete it.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I will output the completion for program1.py and for program2.py I will output a simple identity program.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program2.py if there is no template, then the entire program is missing.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, we output the entire program.\n\n        What should program2.py do? \n            It should read from stdin and write to stdout the same thing.\n\n        So:\n\n            import sys\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line.strip())\n\n        But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are not given any template, so we provide the whole program.\n\n        However, the output format is a json with two string fields.\n\n        Therefore, we will output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\",\n                \"program2\": \"import sys\\nfor line in sys.stdin:\\n    print(line.strip())\"\n            }\n\n        But wait, the completion for program1.py is two lines: \n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        We can write it as: \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\nbreak\"\n\n        However, the template for program1.py has an indentation level. The for-loop is indented, and the TODO is inside the for-loop.\n\n        So the two lines should be indented. But in the template, the TODO is at the same indentation as the if.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"    ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n    break\"\n\n        But the template already has the for-loop and the if, so we only need to replace the TODO comment with two lines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\nbreak\"\n\n        and when inserted, it will be:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        The indentation in the template: the TODO is at 8 spaces of indentation? \n\n        We can output the two lines with the same indentation.\n\n        Since the template uses 4-space indentation, and the for-loop is at 4, the if is at 8, then the two lines should be at 12.\n\n        But the TODO comment is at 8, so we need to indent the two lines by 8 more spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the if body.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        But let me count: \n            The template:\n\n                for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                    if ...:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The if body is indented by 8 spaces (if the for is 4 and the if is 8, then the if body is 12). \n\n        But in the template, the TODO is at 8? \n\n        Actually, the template:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if ...:   [indented by 4 more than the for?]\n                    # TODO   [indented by 8 more?]\n\n        In Python, we use consistent indentation. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the template uses spaces, we can assume 4 spaces per level.\n\n        The for-loop: \n            for ...:   [indent level 1: 4 spaces]\n                if ...: [indent level 2: 8 spaces]\n                    ... [indent level 3: 12 spaces]\n\n        But the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the template has:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the TODO is at 8 spaces (if 4 spaces per indent, then for:4, if:8, TODO:12).\n\n        But the code we want to put is:\n\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        So at 12 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        But that would be 12 spaces for the first line and 12 for the second? \n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        However, the template already has 8 spaces for the if, and we are replacing the TODO comment with two lines at the same indentation level.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact spaces and let the template's indentation be maintained by the existing structure.\n\n        But the TODO is at a certain indentation, and we are replacing it with two lines at the same indentation.\n\n        Since the template uses:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can replace that comment with:\n\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        So the completion string for program1.py is:\n\n            \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        (assuming 8 spaces for the if body)\n\n        But the template might have more or less. However, the problem does not specify.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I will assume the template uses 4 spaces per indent, and the if body is indented by 8 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the two lines should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\n        But wait, the for-loop body is indented by 4, the if is at 4, and the if body is 8. \n\n        So:\n\n            for ...:\n                if ...:\n                    line1\n                    line2\n\n        So the two lines should be at 8 spaces.\n\n        In the completion string, we write the two lines with a newline and then 8 spaces for the second line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\nbreak\"\n\n        and hope that the existing indentation of the if body is maintained.\n\n        But the TODO comment is at the same level as the if body, so when we replace the comment, we are at the correct indentation.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply write:\n\n            \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\nbreak\"\n\n        and when inserted, it will be:\n\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        But the TODO comment is a single line, and we are replacing it with two lines. \n\n        How to represent in JSON: \n            We need to escape the quotes and newline.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\nbreak\"\n\n        For program2.py, since we are not given a template, we output a complete program:\n\n            import sys\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line.strip())\n\n        But note: the output of program1.py might not have newlines? \n            In program1.py, we do: print(ans) -> which prints without a newline? \n            Actually, print in Python adds a newline.\n\n        And program2.py reads by line and then prints with a newline (because print adds a newline) -> so we get two newlines.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            for line in sys.stdin:\n                print(line, end='')\n\n        But then if the output of program1.py is:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n\n        then program2.py would print:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n\n        without extra newlines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            import sys\n            sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())\n\n        But that might be simpler.\n\n        Or we can do nothing: program2.py is not needed.\n\n        Given the problem, I think the pipeline is just to run program1.py and then program2.py, and if program2.py is the identity, then it's the same.\n\n        Therefore, I will output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\",\n                \"program2\": \"import sys\\nfor line in sys.stdin:\\n    print(line, end='')\"\n            }\n\n        But the program1.py completion: I added 8 spaces for the two lines? \n\n        Actually, in the template, the TODO is at 8 spaces, so we want the two lines to be at 8 spaces. But the for-loop is at 4, and the if is at 4, and the if body is at 8. \n\n        So the two lines should be at 8 spaces.\n\n        But the break should be at the same level as the assignment.\n\n        Alternatively, to be safe, we can output the two lines without specifying the spaces and hope the existing indentation is maintained by the template. \n\n        Since the template has:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        and we replace that with:\n\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        then the completion string is exactly:\n\n            \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        assuming that the TODO line is 8 spaces and we want the break to be at 8 spaces too.\n\n        But the assignment and break are two separate lines, both at 8 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\"\n\n        And for program2.py, we output a complete program.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program2.py the entire program is missing, so we output the entire program.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so for program2.py we are missing the whole block.\n\n        We'll output the following JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\",\n                \"program2\": \"import sys\\nfor line in sys.stdin:\\n    print(line, end='')\"\n            }\n\n        But wait, the program2.py I wrote uses print(line, end='') to avoid double newlines. \n        Why? \n            Because program1.py prints a line with a newline, and then program2.py reads by line and then by default print adds a newline.\n\n        So we get:\n\n            program1.py: prints \"YES\\n\"\n            program2.py: reads \"YES\\n\" -> then prints \"YES\\n\" (because print by default adds a newline) -> so we get \"YES\\n\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, we use end='' to avoid the extra newline.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            import sys\n            print(sys.stdin.read(), end='')\n\n        But that reads the whole input at once.\n\n        Given the constraints (total output of program1.py is at most 20000 lines? because t<=10000, but the total n is 200000, but the number of test cases t is up to 10000, so the output has up to 10000 lines) -> we can read all.\n\n        But we'll do:\n\n            import sys\n            data = sys.stdin.read()\n            sys.stdout.write(data)\n\n        This preserves exactly.\n\n        Or even simpler:\n\n            import sys\n            sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())\n\n        Therefore, I'll use:\n\n            \"program2\": \"import sys\\nsys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())\"\n\n        This is efficient and preserves exactly.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\",\n                \"program2\": \"import sys\\nsys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\".\n\n        We are outputting a JSON string.\n\n        Let me write the exact string:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n        break\", \"program2\": \"import sys\\nsys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())\"}\n\n        However, the program1 completion: the break must be at the same indentation as the assignment. And in the template, the TODO is at 8 spaces, so we have 8 spaces for the assignment and 8 spaces for the break.\n\n        But the template might have used 1 tab or something else. We assume spaces.\n\n        Given the problem, this should work.\n\n        But let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example: \"aa\" -> program1.py: \n            k = 1\n            n = 2\n            for i in range(2-1+1)=range(2): \n                i=0: window = \"a\" -> set size=1 -> skip.\n                i=1: window = \"a\" -> set size=1 -> skip.\n            then print \"YES\"\n\n        Example: \"aab\" -> k=2, n=3\n            i=0: window = \"aa\" -> set size=1 !=2 -> set ans=\"NO\", break -> print \"NO\"\n\n        Example: \"aba\" -> k=2, n=3\n            i=0: \"ab\" -> set size=2 -> skip.\n            i=1: \"ba\" -> set size=2 -> skip.\n            then \"YES\"\n\n        Example: \"abac\" -> k=3, n=4\n            i=0: \"aba\" -> set size=2 !=3 -> set \"NO\", break.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n        Note: the program2.py is an identity transformer.\n\n        We are done."
