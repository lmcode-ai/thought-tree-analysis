So we output 4? which is the last time we had equality? and that is the maximum? But note: we could have stopped at 2? but 4 is more. So we want the maximum `cur` for which a==b. Therefore, we should set `ans = max(ans, cur)`? But the problem says: the maximum number of candies they can eat in total. So we want the maximum `cur` for which a==b. However, the provided code sets: \n                if a==b:\n                    ans = cur\n\n          This sets `ans` to the current `cur` every time we have equality. So the last time we have equality is stored. But note: the count `cur` is increasing? So the last time we have equality might be the largest `cur`? But in the example [1,1,1,1,1] we have two equalities: at cur=2 and cur=4.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Alice and Bob eat candies from the two ends. They want the total weight eaten by Alice (from left) and Bob (from right) to be equal, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses a deque and a while loop. However, the current code has a TODO in the else part and the logic might not be complete.\n\n We note the following:\n   - The current code initializes a deque `l` of the candies.\n   - It uses `a` for Alice's total weight (from the left) and `b` for Bob's total weight (from the right).\n   - `cur` counts the total number of candies eaten so far.\n   - The loop condition is while `l` is not empty.\n\n However, the current logic:\n   - It always increments `cur` at the beginning of the loop.\n   - Then, if `a>=b`, it pops from the right and adds to Bob.\n   - Otherwise, in the else block, we have a TODO.\n\n But note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. The current code only adds to Bob when `a>=b` and does nothing for Alice? That doesn't seem right.\n\n Actually, the initial code has:\n      if a>=b:\n          b += l.pop()\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n We need to add to Alice when `a < b`? But note: the condition is `a>=b` then we add to Bob (right). So when `a < b`, we should add to Alice (left). \n\n However, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They can choose how many to eat arbitrarily (but in a row without skipping). The goal is to have the same total weight and maximize the total number of candies.\n\n Alternate approach: We can use two pointers. Let:\n   - `left` = 0, `right` = n-1\n   - `a = 0`, `b = 0`\n   - `ans = 0`\n\n Then, we can do:\n   while left <= right:\n        if a <= b:\n            a += w[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += w[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            ans = (left) + (n - 1 - right)   # because left pointer has advanced to the next, so left candies are [0, left-1] -> count=left, and right has moved to [right+1, n-1] -> count = n-1-right.\n\n But note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice ate (which is the number taken from the left) plus the number Bob ate (from the right). And we want the maximum total candies.\n\n However, the provided code uses a deque and pops from the ends. We can fix the provided code:\n\n   We have a deque `l`. Initially, `a=0, b=0, cur=0, ans=0`.\n   The loop runs while the deque is not empty.\n\n   We can do:\n        if a <= b:\n            # then we take from the left? But note: the condition in the provided code is `a>=b` then we take from the right. \n            # Actually, the provided code condition is: if a>=b, then we add to Bob (right). So when a < b, we should add to Alice (left).\n\n   But the provided code condition is `a>=b` -> then we add to Bob (pop from right). So when `a < b`, we should add to Alice (pop from left).\n\n   So we can change the else block to:\n        else:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\n   However, we must note: the condition in the provided code is `a>=b` then we add to Bob. So when `a < b` we add to Alice.\n\n   Then, after updating, if `a==b`, we set `ans = cur` (which is the current total count of candies eaten).\n\n   But note: the problem says that they can choose arbitrarily how many to eat. However, the greedy process we are doing is: we start with no candies, and then we decide to take from the left if Alice's current total is less than Bob's, or from the right if Bob's total is less than or equal? Actually, the condition is symmetric: we are always adding to the smaller one.\n\n   However, the problem does not require that they take turns? But note: the problem says Alice can eat any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. But they are eating simultaneously? Actually, the note examples: \n        Example 1: Alice eats one from the left, Bob one from the right -> so they each eat one.\n        Example 2: Alice eats the first three, Bob eats the first three from the right -> so they eat in a row without interleaving.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the order of eating. However, the key is that the candies they eat must be contiguous from the ends and non overlapping.\n\n   The greedy two-pointer approach is standard for this problem (known as \"Candies\" in CodeForces). We simulate:\n\n        a = 0, b = 0\n        left = 0, right = n-1\n        count = 0\n        best = 0\n\n        while left <= right:\n            if a <= b:\n                a += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n                count += 1\n            if a == b:\n                best = count   # because we have eaten 'count' candies and they are equal.\n\n        But note: the above simulation does not necessarily maximize the total number of candies? Actually, we are always adding one candy at a time. However, the problem is that we are forced to take contiguous segments? Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. But they don't have to take turns? However, the greedy process of taking one at a time and always adding to the smaller side is valid because:\n\n          - The moment we have a==b, we record the total count.\n\n        But note: we might have multiple opportunities? We want the maximum total candies. So we record every time we have a==b and take the maximum count? However, the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum count for which a==b.\n\n        However, the above greedy might not capture the maximum? Actually, we are traversing the entire array? And we record the last time they were equal? But note: we might have an equal sum at multiple points. We want the maximum count.\n\n        Therefore, we should set `ans = cur` every time we have a==b, and then at the end, the last time we had a==b might not be the maximum? Actually, the count increases as we go. The maximum count we see when a==b is the answer.\n\n        But note: the problem examples:\n\n          Example 1: [1,2,1] -> \n              Initially: a=0, b=0 -> then we take from left? because a<=b? Actually, 0<=0 -> we take from the right? But the condition in the provided code was: if a>=b then take from right. So we take from right: b=1, then a=0, b=1 -> then we take from left: a=1, then a==b -> count=2 -> ans=2.\n\n          Example 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,10,2,1] -> \n              The example says the answer is 7. How?\n                Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n                Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30? but wait, the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> but the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,10,2,1]? \n                Actually, the example says: Alice: [7,3,20] and Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> but wait, the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,10,2,1]? \n                The example says: Bob eats from the right: [1,2,10,8]? but then the next from the right is 10? and then 5? but 5 is in the middle.\n\n          Actually, the example in the note: \n                \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          How does Bob get 10,8,11,1? The array is: \n                w1=7, w2=3, w3=20, w4=5, w5=10, w6=8, w7=10, w8=2, w9=1.\n\n          Bob eats from the right: \n                He eats the last one: 1 -> then 2 -> then 10 (the 7th) -> then 8 (the 6th) -> then 10 (the 5th) would be next? but then the total would be 1+2+10+8+10 = 31, which is too much.\n\n          Actually, the example says: Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> but 11 is not in the array? \n\n          Correction: the example in the problem statement for the fourth test case: \n                \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\" -> but the input array is not provided? \n\n          The note says: \n                \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          But wait, the example input is not given? Actually, the problem says: \n                \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n          The fourth test case: \n                n is not given, but the weights: [7,3,20,5,10,8,10,2,1] is not matching because the Bob part: 10,8,11,1 -> 11 is not present.\n\n          Actually, the problem note says: \n                \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          This seems to be a typo? The sample input for the fourth test case must be: \n                n=9, and the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,2,1]? \n          Then Bob eats from the right: \n                [1,2,11,8] -> but that would be 1,2,11,8 -> 1+2+11+8 = 22, which is not 30.\n\n          Alternatively, Bob eats: [1,2,11,8,10]? then 1+2+11+8+10 = 32.\n\n          Let me recalc: \n                Alice: 7+3+20 = 30\n                Bob: 1+2+11+8+10 = 32 -> not 30.\n\n          Actually, the example says: \"they each eat 30\". \n\n          So the array must be: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? \n          Then Alice: [7,3,20] = 30\n          Bob: [1,11,8,10] = 1+11+8+10 = 30? -> but 10 is the fifth, then 8 is the sixth, then 11 is the seventh, then 1 is the eighth? \n          But the array: \n                index0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:10, index5:8, index6:11, index7:1.\n\n          Bob eats from the right: \n                first: 1 (index7) -> then 11 (index6) -> then 8 (index5) -> then 10 (index4) -> that's 1+11+8+10 = 30.\n\n          So the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] (n=8). \n\n          Now, how does our greedy two-pointer work?\n\n          We have: \n            a=0, b=0\n            Step1: a<=b (0<=0) -> we take from the right? But the provided code condition: if a>=b -> then we take from the right? \n                    So we take the rightmost: 1 -> b=1, a=0 -> cur=1 -> no equality.\n            Step2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> so we take from the left: a=7 -> cur=2 -> no equality.\n            Step3: a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> take from the right: b=1+11=12 -> cur=3 -> no equality.\n            Step4: a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> take from the left: a=7+3=10 -> cur=4 -> no equality.\n            Step5: a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> take from the left: a=10+20=30 -> cur=5 -> now check: a=30, b=12 -> not equal.\n            Step6: a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> take from the right: b=12+8=20 -> cur=6 -> not equal.\n            Step7: a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> take from the right: b=20+10=30 -> cur=7 -> now a==b -> set ans=7.\n\n          Then we break? because the deque is now [5]? and we continue? \n            Step8: a=30, b=30 -> then we take? condition: a>=b -> so we take from the right? but the deque has only 5? \n                    we pop from the right: 5 -> b=30+5=35 -> cur=8 -> then a=30, b=35 -> not equal.\n            Then we break? because the deque is empty? and we output 7.\n\n          So the answer is 7.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code with the else block fixed to take from the left when a < b should work.\n\n          However, note: the provided code uses a deque and pops from the ends. We must pop from the left in the else block.\n\n          So the missing code in program1.py is: \n                a += l.popleft()\n\n          But wait: the provided code initializes `l` as a deque of the entire list. And we are popping from the right with `pop()` and from the left with `popleft()`.\n\n          However, the provided code has a variable `cur` that is incremented at the beginning of the loop. That means every time we enter the loop, we are going to eat one candy. And we do that until the deque is empty.\n\n          But note: we are only setting `ans = cur` when `a==b`. So the last time we had equality is recorded. However, we might have multiple equalities? And we want the maximum total candies? Actually, the total candies eaten when we have equality is `cur`. And we are traversing the entire array? So we record the last time we had equality? But note: the count `cur` is increasing. The last time we have equality might be the maximum? \n\n          However, consider: \n                [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \n          We want to eat as many as possible? \n          Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1 -> cur=1 -> not equal.\n          Step2: a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1 -> cur=2 -> now a==b -> ans=2.\n          Step3: now the deque has [1,1,1] -> \n                a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=1+1=2 -> cur=3 -> not equal.\n          Step4: a=1, b=2 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1+1=2 -> cur=4 -> now a==b -> ans=4.\n          Step5: now the deque has [1] -> \n                a=2, b=2 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=2+1=3 -> cur=5 -> not equal -> then break.\n\n          So we output 4? which is the last time we had equality? and that is the maximum? \n\n          But note: we could have stopped at 2? but 4 is more. So we want the maximum `cur` for which a==b. \n\n          Therefore, we should set `ans = max(ans, cur)`? But the problem says: the maximum number of candies they can eat in total. So we want the maximum `cur` for which a==b.\n\n          However, the provided code sets: \n                if a==b:\n                    ans = cur\n\n          This sets `ans` to the current `cur` every time we have equality. So the last time we have equality is stored. But note: the count `cur` is increasing? So the last time we have equality might be the largest `cur`? \n\n          But in the example [1,1,1,1,1] we have two equalities: at cur=2 and cur=4. The last one is 4, which is the maximum. \n\n          However, what if we have an equality at a lower `cur` and then we never get a higher one? Then we would have the last one which is the maximum? \n\n          But consider: \n                [1, 2, 1, 2] \n          Step1: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=2 -> cur=1 -> not equal.\n          Step2: a=0, b=2 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1 -> cur=2 -> not equal.\n          Step3: a=1, b=2 -> a<b -> pop left: a=1+2=3 -> cur=3 -> not equal.\n          Step4: a=3, b=2 -> a>=b -> pop right: b=2+1=3 -> cur=4 -> a==b -> ans=4.\n\n          Then we break? because the deque is empty? \n\n          But what if we have: \n                [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1] \n          We want to get 6? \n          Step1: a=0, b=0 -> pop right: b=1 -> cur=1 -> not equal.\n          Step2: a=0, b=1 -> pop left: a=1 -> cur=2 -> not equal.\n          Step3: a=1, b=1 -> pop right: b=1+2=3 -> cur=3 -> not equal.\n          Step4: a=1, b=3 -> pop left: a=1+2=3 -> cur=4 -> a==b -> ans=4.\n          Step5: a=3, b=3 -> pop right: b=3+3=6 -> cur=5 -> not equal.\n          Step6: a=3, b=6 -> pop left: a=3+3=6 -> cur=6 -> a==b -> ans=6.\n\n          So we get 6.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n                from collections import deque\n                for _ in range(int(input())):\n                    n = int(input())\n                    l = deque(map(int, input().split()))\n                    a, b = 0, 0\n                    ans = 0\n                    cur = 0\n                    while l:\n                        cur += 1\n                        if a >= b:\n                            b += l.pop()\n                        else:\n                            a += l.popleft()\n                        if a == b:\n                            ans = cur   # we update to the current count, which is the total number of candies eaten so far.\n                    print(ans)\n\n          But note: what if we never have a==b? then ans remains 0? which is correct.\n\n          However, the problem says: for the third test case, the answer is 0.\n\n          Therefore, we are done for program1.py.\n\n For program2.py:\n        The problem: Count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n. (Partition of n using only palindromic numbers, and two partitions are the same if they have the same multiset.)\n\n        The provided code:\n            R=range\n            m=40001\n            d=10**9+7\n            p=[]\n            for i in R(1,m):\n                n=str(i)\n                if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n            a=[1]+[0]*m\n            for i in p:\n                for j in R(i,m):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\n        We are generating a list `p` of all palindromic numbers up to 40000.\n\n        Then we have an array `a` of size m (indexed 0..40000) where `a[0]=1` (the base case: one way to make sum 0 - the empty partition) and the rest 0.\n\n        Then we iterate over each palindromic number `i` and then for each `j` from `i` to m-1.\n\n        This is a typical unbounded knapsack (each palindromic number can be used any number of times) for counting the number of partitions.\n\n        The recurrence: \n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\n\n        Why? Because for each palindromic number `i`, we can use it and then the remaining sum is `j-i`, and we add the number of ways to form `j-i` to `a[j]`.\n\n        However, note: the order of iteration? We iterate over the palindromic numbers (which are the items) and then for each j from i to m.\n\n        This is the standard way to count the number of partitions.\n\n        Therefore, the missing line is:\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        But note: the array `a` is being updated. We are iterating over the palindromic numbers and then for each j from i to m.\n\n        Example: for n=5, we want 7 ways.\n\n        Steps:\n          Initialize a[0]=1, a[1..5]=0.\n\n          Then we take the first palindromic number: 1.\n            j from 1 to 5:\n                j=1: a[1] += a[0] -> a[1]=1\n                j=2: a[2] += a[1] -> a[2]=1\n                j=3: a[3] += a[2] -> a[3]=1\n                j=4: a[4] += a[3] -> a[4]=1\n                j=5: a[5] += a[4] -> a[5]=1\n\n          Then next palindromic number: 2.\n            j from 2 to 5:\n                j=2: a[2] = 1 + a[0] = 1+1 = 2\n                j=3: a[3] = 1 + a[1] = 1+1 = 2\n                j=4: a[4] = 1 + a[2] = 1+2 = 3\n                j=5: a[5] = 1 + a[3] = 1+2 = 3\n\n          Then 3: \n            j from 3 to 5:\n                j=3: a[3]=2 + a[0]=1 -> 3\n                j=4: a[4]=3 + a[1]=1 -> 4\n                j=5: a[5]=3 + a[2]=2 -> 5\n\n          Then 4:\n            j from 4 to 5:\n                j=4: a[4]=4 + a[0]=1 -> 5\n                j=5: a[5]=5 + a[1]=1 -> 6\n\n          Then 5:\n            j=5: a[5]=6 + a[0]=1 -> 7\n\n          So a[5]=7 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing line in program2.py is:\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n        However, note: the modulus is 10^9+7, so we do modulo arithmetic.\n\n        So the code for program2.py is:\n\n            R=range\n            m=40001\n            d=10**9+7\n            p=[]\n            for i in R(1,m):\n                n=str(i)\n                if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n            a=[1]+[0]*m\n            for i in p:\n                for j in R(i,m):\n                    a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n            for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n                print(a[int(n)])\n\n        But note: the array `a` is being updated in a way that we are using the same array. This is the standard way for unbounded knapsack.\n\n        However, we are iterating j from i to m. This is the correct order for unbounded knapsack (allowing multiple uses of the same coin) because we are updating the array in increasing order of j, so that when we get to j, we have already considered the possibility of using the same coin for j-i.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n Summary:\n\n   program1.py: \n        The missing line in the else block: \n            a += l.popleft()\n\n        But note: the entire block is:\n\n            else:\n                a += l.popleft()\n\n   program2.py:\n        The missing line in the inner loop:\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified format.\n\n   But note: the TODO in program1.py is only one line? Actually, the else block currently has only a TODO comment. We are replacing that with one line.\n\n   Similarly, in program2.py, the inner loop has a TODO and we are replacing it with one line.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   And the output format: \n        {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n   What is \"completion\"? For program1, the missing part is the else block. But the else block is only one line? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only missing one line in each.\n\n   But note: in program1, the else block is currently:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing that with:\n\n        else:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program1, the missing block is:\n\n            a += l.popleft()\n\n   And for program2, the missing line is:\n\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that we are adding. We are not including the existing code.\n\n   Therefore, for program1, the completion string is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n   For program2, the completion string is: \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n   But note: the program1 code has an indentation level. The else block is indented by 8 spaces? and the next line is 12? \n\n   We must output the code exactly as it would appear in the program? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the context:\n\n        while l:\n            cur+=1\n            if a>=b:\n                b += l.pop()\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if a==b:\n                ans = cur\n\n   We are replacing the TODO line with:\n\n                a += l.popleft()\n\n   So the missing block is one line: \"a += l.popleft()\", and it should be at the same indentation as the line in the if block.\n\n   Similarly, in program2, the inner loop:\n\n        for j in R(i,m):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n   So the missing line is: \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n   Therefore, the JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n            \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 line uses the modulus variable `d`. We are using the existing variable.\n\n   However, the problem says: the entire program is provided except the missing lines. So we assume the variable `d` is defined.\n\n   Let me write the JSON string.\n\n   Important: the quotes in the JSON must be double quotes. And the entire output must be a valid JSON.\n\n   We output:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\", \"program2\": \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"}\n\n   But note: the program1 code: we are using the variable `a` and `l`. They are defined in the existing code.\n\n   This should be correct."
