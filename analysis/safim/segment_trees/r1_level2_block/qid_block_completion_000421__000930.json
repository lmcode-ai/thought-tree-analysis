    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about determining if we can obtain the array `a` with the given operations and having the pointer end at the first element.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py is:\n\nI=input\nfor _ in [0]*int(I()):\n  I();p,z,zero=0,1,0\n  for v in I().split():\n    p+=int(v)\n    if zero and p>0: # TODO: Your code here\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n  print(['NO','YES'][zero and z])\n\nWe note that the current code has a TODO in the middle. The logic of the solution is as follows:\n\nWe are simulating the operations. The variable `p` represents the current value of the \"effect\" that we have to balance. The operations are:\n1. Move forward: increases the current element by 1 and moves to the next. This operation adds a +1 at the current position and then moves forward. But note that when we move backward, we are decreasing the current and moving back. \n\nHowever, note the problem: we start at the first element, and we must end at the first element.\n\nThe key idea is to note that the entire process can be thought of as a sequence of moves. We can model the operations as:\n- Each forward move from i to i+1 adds 1 to a[i].\n- Each backward move from i to i-1 subtracts 1 from a[i] (and then we are at i-1).\n\nBut note that the entire journey must end at the first element. Therefore, the net movement must be balanced.\n\nWe can think of the array as being built by a sequence of moves that start at index0 and end at index0. The operations are:\n  Operation1: (forward) a[i] += 1, then move to i+1.\n  Operation2: (backward) a[i] -= 1, then move to i-1.\n\nWe can model the entire process as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let d[i] be the number of times we move forward from i to i+1, and e[i] be the number of times we move backward from i to i-1 (or equivalently, the backward move that starts at i and goes to i-1).\n\nThen, for the first element (index0):\n  We start at index0. We can only do forward moves from index0 (since we cannot go backward from index0). Also, we end at index0, so the last move must have been a backward move to index0? Actually, we end at index0 without necessarily having a backward move at the last step? But note: we end at index0 and we are not moving after that.\n\nHowever, note that the operations are only two. The entire journey is a sequence of moves that form a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\nThe net effect on the array:\n  For index0: \n      We leave index0 by a forward move (which adds 1) and we come back to index0 by a backward move from index1 (which does not affect index0). But note: we also start at index0 without having left? Actually, the first operation must be a forward move? Not necessarily: we can do nothing. But if we do nothing, then the array remains zeros and the pointer is at the first element.\n\n  Actually, the value at index0 is:\n      a0 = (number of forward moves from index0) - (number of backward moves from index0) \n  But note: we cannot do a backward move from index0 because the pointer is at the first element and we cannot move back. So the backward moves from index0 are 0.\n\n  However, wait: we can come to index0 from index1 by a backward move (which subtracts 1 from index1 and then we are at index0). But that backward move does not affect index0. So the value at index0 is only the forward moves that started at index0? \n\n  Actually, the operations:\n      When we are at index0 and we do a forward move: we add 1 to a0 and move to index1.\n      When we are at index1 and we do a backward move: we subtract 1 from a1 and move to index0.\n\n  Therefore, the value at index0 is the number of forward moves from index0 minus the number of backward moves that ended at index0? Actually, the backward moves that end at index0 are the ones that started at index1 and then moved to index0. But that move subtracts from a1, not a0.\n\n  So the value at index0 is only the forward moves that started at index0? And we never subtract from a0? \n\n  However, note: we can also have multiple passes. For example, we might go from 0->1, then 1->0 (which subtracts from a1 and then we are at 0). Then from 0 we can go forward again. So the value at index0 is the net forward moves that started at index0 (without any backward move at index0 because we cannot do that).\n\n  Therefore, a0 = (forward moves from 0) - (backward moves from 0). But we cannot do backward moves from 0, so backward moves from 0 are 0. Hence, a0 = (forward moves from 0).\n\n  For index1:\n      We can get forward moves from 1 (which add to a1) and backward moves from 1 (which subtract from a1). Also, we get a forward move from 0 to 1 (which does not affect a1) and a backward move from 2 to 1 (which subtracts from a2 and then moves to 1, but then if we then do a backward move from 1, that subtracts from a1). \n\n  Actually, the value at index i is:\n      a_i = (number of times we left i to go forward) - (number of times we left i to go backward)\n\n  But note: we also enter i from i-1 (by a forward move from i-1) and from i+1 (by a backward move from i+1). However, the operations only record the leaving.\n\n  Alternatively, we can model the entire walk as a sequence of steps. Let f[i] = number of times we go from i to i+1, and b[i] = number of times we go from i to i-1.\n\n  Then:\n      a0 = f[0] - b[0]\n      But we cannot have b[0] because we cannot move back from 0, so b[0]=0 -> a0 = f[0].\n\n      For i>=1, the net at position i is: \n          a[i] = f[i] - b[i]\n\n  However, we also have the constraint that the walk must be connected and start and end at 0. The net flow at each node (except the start/end) must be balanced? Actually, the walk is a single path that starts and ends at 0. So the net flow at 0 is 0? But note we start and end at 0, so the net flow at 0 is 0? \n\n  Actually, the conservation of moves:\n      For node0: \n          We start at 0 (so we have one extra presence at the beginning and one at the end). \n          The moves: \n              We leave 0: f[0] times (to 1)\n              We come to 0: b[1] times (from 1)\n          The net: the number of times we are at 0 is: 1 (start) + b[1] (arrivals) = 1 + f[0] (departures) + 1 (end) ??? \n\n  This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a known solution for this problem. The known solution for \"Pointer and Array\" is:\n\n  We traverse the array from left to right. We maintain a variable `p` that represents the \"excess\" of moves that we have to account for. The idea is that we start at index0 and we must end at index0, so the entire journey must have a net zero movement? \n\n  Actually, the known solution (from similar problems) is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          # We start at index0 with 0. We are going to simulate the process backwards?\n          # Alternatively, we note:\n          #   The operations are reversible. We can think of the array as being built by a sequence of moves that must satisfy:\n          #   Let d[0] = a[0] (which must be nonnegative? and then we have a \"debt\" for the next element)\n          #   Actually, we can use a greedy simulation:\n\n          # Conditions:\n          #   1. The entire array must be nonnegative until the last step? \n          #   2. We know that we cannot go below zero at any step? \n\n          # But note: the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n          #   p = 0\n          #   valid = True\n          #   for i in range(n):\n          #       p += a[i]\n          #       if p < 0: \n          #           valid = False\n          #       if p == 0:\n          #          # then we break early? Actually, we must check that after that we have zeros?\n          #          # but note: we can have non-zero after a zero? \n          #   Also, we must have p==0 at the end and the first non-zero must be positive.\n\n          # However, the provided code already has:\n\n          #   p,z,zero=0,1,0\n          #   for v in I().split():\n          #       p += int(v)\n          #       if zero and p>0: # TODO: Your code here\n          #       if p==0: zero=True\n          #       if p<0: z=0; break\n\n          #   Then print ['NO','YES'][zero and z]\n\n          # The variable `z` is initially 1 (meaning valid) and if we ever get p<0 we set z=0 and break (meaning invalid).\n          # The variable `zero` is set to True when we have encountered at least one zero in the cumulative p? Actually, when p becomes zero we set zero=True.\n\n          # The TODO line: \"if zero and p>0\"\n\n          # What should we do in that case? \n\n          # Let me think: if we have already encountered a zero (meaning we have finished one segment that started at 0 and returned to 0) and then we get a positive p, that means we are starting a new segment? But the problem requires that the entire journey ends at the first element. So we cannot have a positive p after having returned to zero? Because that would mean we are leaving the first element again? \n\n          # Actually, the condition is: once we have returned to zero (i.e., the pointer has come back to the start and the cumulative effect is zero) then we cannot have any further operations that leave the start? Because the operations are done and the pointer must be at the first element. So if we have a non-zero after a zero, that is invalid.\n\n          # Therefore, if we have already set `zero` to True (meaning we have had p==0 at some point) and then we get p>0, that is invalid. Because we are not allowed to leave the start again after having returned.\n\n          # So we should break and set z=0? \n\n          # But note: the array might be [0, 1, -1, 0]. After the first element: p=0 -> zero=True. Then we process the second element: p=1 -> then we have zero and p>0 -> invalid? But wait, the example in the note: \n          #   The second test case: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> which is valid.\n\n          # How does our simulation run for [2, -1, -1, 0]?\n          #   Start: p=0, z=1, zero=0 (False)\n          #   v=2: p=2 -> then check: if zero (False) -> skip. Then set zero? p!=0 -> skip. p>0 -> skip. Then next.\n          #   v=-1: p=1 -> then check: if zero (False) -> skip. Then set zero? p!=0 -> skip. p>0 -> skip. Then next.\n          #   v=-1: p=0 -> set zero=True. Then next.\n          #   v=0: p=0 -> then we do: if zero and p>0? -> no. Then we set zero=True (but already true). Then we finish.\n          #   Then we output: zero and z -> True and 1 -> YES.\n\n          # Now consider [0, 1, 0]: \n          #   Start: p=0 -> set zero=True.\n          #   Then next: v=1 -> p=1 -> then we have: if zero and p>0 -> we must break and set z=0? \n\n          # But [0,1,0] is invalid? Why? Because after having returned to the start (at the first element) we then leave again? But the problem says: after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element. So if we have [0,1,0], we can do:\n          #   Start at 0: we do nothing (so we are at 0). Then we leave: 0->1: becomes (1,0) and then we are at 1. Then we cannot leave at the last step? We must end at 0. So we have to come back: from 1 we do a backward move: then a[1] becomes 0-1 = -1? and then we are at 0. So we get [1, -1] for the two elements? \n\n          # Actually, the array [0,1,0] is not achievable. Because the first element is 0: we never leave? Then the second element is 1: how? We must leave the first element to get to the second? But then we add 1 to the first element? So the first element becomes 1, not 0. \n\n          # Therefore, [0,1,0] is impossible.\n\n          # So the condition: if we have already had a zero (meaning we have returned to the start) and then we get a positive p, that means we are leaving the start again? But we are not allowed to leave again because we are in the middle of the array? And then we must end at the start? \n\n          # Actually, the condition is: once we have returned to the start (p=0) then the rest of the array must be zeros? Because we cannot leave again? \n\n          # Therefore, in the TODO line, we should break and set z=0? \n\n          # So the missing code for program1.py might be:\n\n          #   if zero and p>0:\n          #       z = 0\n          #       break\n\n          # But what about negative? We already have a check for p<0: which breaks and sets z=0.\n\n          # Also, note that if we get p>0 and we haven't had a zero yet, that's okay? Because we are still in the first segment.\n\n          # However, what if we get p>0 after having had a zero? That is invalid.\n\n          # Therefore, we complete the TODO as:\n\n          #   if zero and p>0:\n          #       z = 0\n          #       break\n\n          # But note: the problem says the total n is up to 200000 and the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so breaking early is efficient.\n\n          # Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n          # Example 1: [0,0,...,0] (all zeros) -> \n          #   p=0 at the first element -> zero becomes True. Then the rest are zeros: p remains 0. Then we output YES.\n\n          # Example 2: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> \n          #   p=2 -> no break (because zero is False). Then p=1 -> no break. Then p=0 -> set zero=True. Then last element: p=0 -> no break. Then output YES.\n\n          # Example 3: [0,1,0] -> \n          #   first element: p=0 -> zero=True.\n          #   second element: p=1 -> then we check: zero is True and p>0 -> set z=0 and break.

Then we are at 0. Then we want to get a1=1? But to get to a1 we must leave 0 (which adds 1 to a0) so a0 becomes 1, not 0. Then we are at a1. Then we cannot come back? because we must end at 0. So we have to come back: then a1 becomes 1-1=0? So we get [1,0] and then we are at 0. So [0,1] is impossible.\n\n          # Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n          # So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          #   if zero and p>0:\n          #       z = 0\n          #       break\n\n          # But note: the code already has the condition for p<0: which sets z=0 and breaks.\n\n          # Also, we must note that the entire array must end with p=0?

For example, [1,0,-1]: \n          #       a0=1: p=1 -> no zero.\n          #       a1=0: p=1 -> no zero (because p!=0) -> then we don't set zero.\n          #       a2=-1: p=0 -> then we set zero=True. Then we break? no, because we are at the end.\n          #       Then output: zero and z -> True and 1 -> YES.\n\n          #   But [1,0,-1] is valid? \n          #       Start: [0,0,0] at index0.\n          #       Operation1: index0->index1: [1,0,0] at index1.\n          #       Operation1: index1->index2: [1,1,0] at index2. -> but we want a1=0? \n          #       Alternatively: \n          #          Operation1: from 0->1: [1,0,0] at 1.\n          #          Operation2: from 1->0: [1,-1,0] at 0. -> then we have [1,-1,0] not [1,0,-1].\n          #       How to get [1,0,-1]? \n          #          Start at 0: \n          #             Operation1: 0->1: [1,0,0] at 1.\n          #             Operation1: 1->2: [1,1,0] at 2.\n          #             Operation2: 2->1: [1,1-1,0] = [1,0, -1] at 1.\n          #             Operation2: 1->0: [1,0-1,-1] = [1,-1,-1] at 0. -> not [1,0,-1].\n          #       Actually, we cannot get [1,0,-1] because the element at index1 is 0: that means we never did a backward move from index1? but then how did we get the -1 at index2? \n\n          #   Alternatively: \n          #          Start at 0: \n          #             Operation1: 0->1: [1,0,0] at 1.\n          #             Operation1: 1->2: [1,1,0] at 2.\n          #             Operation2: 2->1: [1,1, -1] at 1. -> then we have [1,1,-1] and we are at 1. Then we do a backward move from 1: [1,0,-1] at 0. \n          #          Then we are done? \n          #          So the array becomes [1,0,-1] and we are at 0. So it is valid.\n\n          #   In our simulation for [1,0,-1]:\n          #       a0=1: p=1 -> zero=False.\n          #       a1=0: p=1 -> then we check: if zero (False) -> skip. Then check p==0? no -> then next.\n          #       a2=-1: p=0 -> then set zero=True.\n          #       Then output: zero and z -> True and 1 -> YES.\n\n          #   But note: we never broke the condition because we set zero only at the last element. And the condition \"if zero and p>0\" was never triggered because at the last element p=0.\n\n          #   Therefore, the condition at the end: we require that the last p is zero? Actually, we don't check the last p explicitly, but we set zero=True at the last element. So at the end, zero is True.\n\n          #   However, what if the array is [1, -1, 1]? \n          #       total sum=1 -> invalid? \n          #       In our simulation: \n          #           a0=1: p=1 -> zero=False.\n          #           a1=-1: p=0 -> set zero=True.\n          #           a2=1: p=1 -> then we have: if zero and p>0 -> set z=0 and break -> NO.\n\n          #   So the condition is satisfied.\n\n          #   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          #       if zero and p>0:\n          #           z = 0\n          #           break\n\n          #   We output that.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe problem: stamping neighboring cells to get a pattern. We can use a stamp that colors two neighboring cells as (B,R) or (R,B). The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. The stamp must fit entirely on the grid.\n\nThe provided code:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe idea: \n  We split the string by 'W'. Why? Because white cells are not colored and they break the contiguous segments. Each contiguous segment of non-white (which are R and B) must be independently checkable.\n\n  Conditions for a contiguous segment (without any white in the middle) to be valid:\n      - The segment must be non-empty? Actually, if the segment is empty (i.e., we have consecutive W's) then we skip.\n      - The segment must have at least one R and one B? Actually, we can have a segment of one cell? But the stamp covers two cells. So a segment of one cell is impossible? \n          However, note: we can stamp multiple times on the same cell? But the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So if we have a segment of one cell, we cannot stamp it without affecting an adjacent cell that is white? which is not allowed because the stamp must fit entirely on the grid? and the adjacent cell is white and we cannot change it? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: the stamp must completely fit on the given n cells. So we cannot stamp a cell that is at the boundary with white? \n\n          Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n      - Also, a segment of length 2: \n          Possibilities: \n            \"RR\": impossible? because the stamp always produces one R and one B? \n            \"RB\": valid? yes, one stamp.\n            \"BR\": valid? yes, one stamp.\n            \"BB\": impossible.\n\n      - For a segment of length>=2: \n          We note that the stamping operations can be done in any order and multiple times. The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to check that the segment is not unicolor? \n\n          Actually, the known solution: \n              We can form the segment if and only if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'.\n\n          Why? \n            Because if the entire segment is R, then how do we get the R's? \n                Each stamp must cover two cells: one R and one B. So if we have a contiguous segment of R's, then we must have at least one B in the segment? \n\n          Therefore, for each contiguous segment (without white) we check:\n              if the segment is empty: skip.\n              else: if the segment has only R's or only B's -> invalid.\n                     else: valid.\n\n          How to check? \n              We can do: \n                 if the segment is non-empty and (all characters are 'R' or all are 'B') then invalid.\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"RBRB\" which is valid.\n\n          So the condition: \n              if the segment is non-empty and (('R' not in segment) or ('B' not in segment)) -> then invalid.\n\n          Then we set b=1 (meaning invalid) for the entire test case? \n\n          The variable `b` is initially 0. Then we iterate over the segments. If we find at least one invalid segment, we set b=1? \n\n          The print statement: \n              print('YNEOS '[b::2]) \n          This is a trick: \n              'YNEOS' is a string of 5 characters? Actually, it's 'YES' and 'NO' interleaved? \n              If b=0: then we take [0::2] -> 'YES'\n              If b=1: then we take [1::2] -> 'NO'\n\n          But wait: \n              'YNEOS' -> \n                 index0: 'Y'\n                 index1: 'N'\n                 index2: 'E'\n                 index3: 'O'\n                 index4: 'S'\n\n              [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> 'Y'+'E'+'S' = \"YES\"\n              [1::2] -> indices 1,3 -> 'N'+'O' = \"NO\"\n\n          So if we set b=1 for any invalid segment, then we output \"NO\". Otherwise, we output \"YES\".\n\n          Therefore, the code for the TODO:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if i == '': # skip empty segments\n                  continue\n              if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1   # mark this test case as invalid\n\n          But note: we might have multiple segments. We must check every segment. We cannot break because we are in a for loop. But if we set b=1, then even if we find one invalid segment, the entire test case is invalid.\n\n          However, we can break early? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, so we can do the entire loop.\n\n          But note: the variable `b` is initially 0. If we find one invalid segment, we set b=1. Then we continue to check other segments? But if we set b=1, then the entire test case is invalid. We don't need to check further? But it doesn't hurt to check. However, we can break? But the problem does not require to break.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          for seg in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              if seg != \"\":\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      b = 1\n                      # We don't break because we are in a for loop? but we can break? \n                      # Actually, we can break early to save time? but the problem says the total n is 10^5, and the sum of n is 10^5, so we can break if we want.\n\n          However, the problem does not require to break. We can simply set b=1 and continue.\n\n          But note: what if we have multiple segments? We must check every segment? Because if one segment is invalid, the entire test case is invalid.\n\n          So we can break? or not? It doesn't matter because we are setting b=1 and then the rest of the segments don't change the result.\n\n          However, we can break to save time? But the problem constraints are small (each test case total n<=10^5, and the sum of n over test cases is 10^5) so we don't need to break.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              if i != '' and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n\n          But note: the condition: \n              if the segment is non-empty and (it does not contain at least one 'R' OR it does not contain at least one 'B') -> then invalid.\n\n          This is equivalent to: if the segment is non-empty and (it is missing 'R' or missing 'B') -> invalid.\n\n          Example: \n              segment \"R\": -> 'B' not in segment -> invalid -> set b=1.\n              segment \"RR\": -> 'B' not in segment -> invalid -> set b=1.\n              segment \"RB\": -> has 'R' and 'B' -> skip.\n              segment \"RBB\": -> has 'R' and 'B' -> skip.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, what about a segment of length 1? It will be caught: because it will be missing either 'R' or 'B'? Actually, if it is \"R\", then it has no 'B'. Similarly, \"B\" has no 'R'. So it is caught.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: the line: \"z = 0; break\"\n          program2: the block: \n                if i != '' and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py is:\n\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\nWe are iterating over segments. The variable `i` is a string for one segment.\n\nWe must be cautious: the condition can be written as:\n\n    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n        b = 1\n\nBecause `i` is a string, and if it is non-empty then we check.\n\nBut note: the condition \"if i\" is equivalent to \"if i != ''\".\n\nSo we can write:\n\n    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n        b = 1\n\nBut note: the condition \"if i\" is more efficient.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"z = 0; break\"\n  program2: the two lines (with proper indentation):\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: the existing code has a for-loop and we are inside the for-loop. The indentation level is one more than the for.\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So for program1, we output the line that goes in the TODO. For program2, we output the two lines that go in the TODO block.\n\nHowever, the TODO in program2 is inside the for-loop and we are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2 has:\n\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nSo we output:\n\n  For program1: the string: \"z = 0; break\"\n  For program2: the string: \n        \"if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\"\n\nBut note: the indentation in program2: the for-loop is already indented. The TODO is at the same level as the for-loop body. So the two lines we add must be indented by one more level? \n\nActually, the existing code:\n\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut the first line of the block must be at the same indentation level as the TODO comment? and the second line one more? \n\nIn the provided code, the TODO is at the same level as the for-loop body. So we assume the code is using 4 spaces per indent? But the problem does not specify. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces? \n\nBut note: the provided code for program2: \n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b = 0\n        for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nWe are to put two lines in the for-loop body. The first line should be indented by 8 spaces (if the for-loop is indented by 4 and the body by 8) and the second by 12? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We can output with the minimal necessary indentation? \n\nAlternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact indentation? But the problem says the program must run.\n\nWe must output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\nSince the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent, we assume:\n\n  The for-loop: \n      for i in ...: \n          [here we put the code]\n\n  The TODO is at 4 spaces of indentation (relative to the for-loop). Then the if statement should be at 4 spaces, and the body of the if at 8.\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n        b = 0\n        for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe for-loop over i is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for). The TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\nActually, the entire program:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b = 0\n    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\nThe outer for: 0 spaces.\nThe inner for: 4 spaces? \n\nBut in Python, we use consistent indentation. The provided code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 should be:\n\n    if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n        b = 1\n\nBut note: the existing for-loop body is already at 8 spaces (if the outer for is 4 and the inner for is 8). Then the if statement should be at 8+4=12? and the assignment at 12+4=16? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we can output:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut the existing TODO is at the same level as the for-loop body. So we output the two lines at the same indentation level as the TODO? \n\nActually, the TODO is a comment. We are replacing it with two lines. We must use the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\nWe assume 4 spaces per indent. Therefore:\n\n  The for-loop: \n      for i in ...: \n          [line1]   # at 4 more spaces than the for\n          [line2]   # at 4 more spaces than the for, and the body of the if is 4 more than the if.\n\nBut the existing code has the for-loop at 4 spaces (relative to the outer for) and the TODO at 8 spaces? \n\nActually, the outer for: \n    for s in ...: \n        b = 0   -> 4 spaces\n        for i in ...:   -> 4 spaces\n            # TODO -> 8 spaces\n\nSo the if statement should be at 8 spaces, and the assignment at 12.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: the variable `b` is defined at the outer level (b=0) and we are setting it to 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without breaking the indentation? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO comment? \n\nBut the TODO comment is at 8 spaces. Then the if statement should be at 8 spaces, and the body at 12.\n\nSo the two lines:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut note: the first line is 8 spaces and the second 12? \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But we know the structure.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the code as it would be inserted in the TODO block.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"z = 0; break\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the newline character \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as separate strings? But the problem says: output the missing code.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\nWe output the exact code that would replace the TODO in each program.\n\nFor program1, the TODO is in the middle of a line. We are replacing the entire TODO comment with the line \"z = 0; break\". But note: the existing line:\n\n    if zero and p>0:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with the code. So the line becomes:\n\n    if zero and p>0: z = 0; break\n\nBut note: we can write:\n\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut the existing code is written in a compact form. The provided code for program1 has:\n\n    if zero and p>0:# TODO: Your code here\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n\nWe can do:\n\n    if zero and p>0: z=0; break\n\nBut that is one line. And then the next lines are still there.\n\nAlternatively, we can break it into multiple lines? But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the two statements: set z=0 and break.\n\nBut note: the existing code has a colon at the end of the if condition. So we can write:\n\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut then we have to adjust the indentation for the next lines? \n\nThe existing code:\n\n    if zero and p>0:# TODO: Your code here\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n\nIf we replace the TODO with:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nThen the code becomes:\n\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n\nThat is valid.\n\nBut note: the next two if statements are at the same level as the for-loop body. So we must not indent them.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is two lines:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut the TODO is at the same level as the for-loop body. So we output:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nWith the same indentation as the for-loop body.\n\nBut the existing for-loop body is at 4 spaces? \n\nThe program1 code:\n\nI=input\nfor _ in [0]*int(I()):\n  I();p,z,zero=0,1,0\n  for v in I().split():\n    p+=int(v)\n    if zero and p>0:# TODO: Your code here\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n  print(['NO','YES'][zero and z])\n\nThe for-loop over v: \n    for v in ...:\n        ...   -> each line in the body is indented by 4 spaces.\n\nSo the TODO line is at 4 spaces. We are replacing the TODO comment with two lines that are at 8 spaces? \n\nBut we can write:\n\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nThe first line (the if) is at 4 spaces, and the two lines in the body at 8.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut note: the existing line has the condition and the comment. We are replacing the entire line? \n\nActually, the existing line is:\n\n    if zero and p>0:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that line with:\n\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut then the next two if statements are still at 4 spaces. \n\nSo the code becomes:\n\n  for v in I().split():\n    p+=int(v)\n    if zero and p>0:\n        z = 0\n        break\n    if p==0:zero=True\n    if p<0:z=0;break\n\nThis is valid.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \n        if zero and p>0:\\n        z = 0\\n        break\n\nBut note: the existing condition \"if zero and p>0\" is already there. We are only adding the body. But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the entire line with a block.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines of the body? \n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are missing the body of the if.\n\nBut the existing line has the condition and a comment. We are replacing the comment with a newline and two lines.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the entire block that goes in that place? \n\nThe problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the two lines of the body.\n\nBut note: the condition is already there. So we only need to output the two lines that form the body.\n\nTherefore, for program1, we output:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nWith the indentation of 8 spaces (relative to the outer for) or 4 spaces relative to the inner for? \n\nWe output:\n\n        z = 0\n        break\n\nBut the exact string: \"        z = 0\\n        break\"\n\nFor program2, we output:\n\n        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n            b = 1\n\nBut the exact string: \"        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        z = 0\\n        break\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the newline characters.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as a single string with embedded newlines.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact representation, but we use JSON so we use \\n.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
