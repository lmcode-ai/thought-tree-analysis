But when z==0, we don't want to compute that. Therefore, we should avoid accessing f[z-1] when z==0. The current code does: d += ... * (z!=0)\n\n      But the arguments to pow: f[x+1]*f[z-1] is computed even if z==0. So we get an index error for z-1 = -1? We need to avoid that. We can restructure to only compute when z!=0, but the problem says: output only the missing code.",

But mathematically, C(0,1) is 0, and we want to add 0. But the formula: \n          C(x+z, x+1) = C(0,1) = 0. So the term is 0. The flaw is that we are using f[z-1] for z=0, which is f[-1], and that is not the factorial of -1, but the last element of the list. This is incorrect. Therefore, we must avoid the access when z==0.",

But the provided code does not read t. \n\n  Therefore, we must read t first. But the problem says: output only the missing code. And the provided code has:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n\n  This reads n as the first integer, which in a multi-test-case input would be t. Then the next line has n+1 integers? but if n is t, then we are reading t+1 integers? This doesn't work. Given the complexity, and since the sample test case works if we avoid z==0, and the note says the sum of n over test cases is <=10^5, it is likely that the input has at least one test case and the first integer is the number of test cases t. \n\n  Then the provided code is not reading the input correctly.",

Then we find \"ac\": \n              same first char 'a', different second char: so we add mul (which is 2) -> so we count two pairs: (first \"ab\", \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", \"ac\"). This is correct. But what if we have two \"ac\" strings? We have: \n              jj: first \"ab\", then we find the second \"ab\": mul=2, mark the second \"ab\". then we find the first \"ac\": add mul=2 -> two pairs: (first \"ab\", first \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              then we find the second \"ac\": add mul=2 -> two pairs: (first \"ab\", second \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n\n          total for \"ab\" and \"ac\": 4 pairs. But the actual pairs: \n              (first \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              (first \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n              (second \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              (second \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n          -> 4 pairs. But what if we then have jj at the first \"ac\"? Since the first \"ac\" is not marked, we will start an iteration for jj = first \"ac\". We set mul=1. Then we find the second \"ac\": then we mark the second \"ac\", and mul becomes 2. Then we find no more? But we haven't counted the pairs between \"ac\" and \"ab\"? But we already counted them when jj was at \"ab\". So it's correct. However, the condition for different first char and same second char: \n          Example: \"ab\", \"ab\", \"cb\"\n          When jj is at the first \"ab\": \n              we find the second \"ab\": mul=2, mark the second \"ab\". we find \"cb\": different first char, same second char -> add mul=2: two pairs: (first \"ab\",\"cb\") and (second \"ab\",\"cb\") Then when jj is at \"cb\", we skip because we never mark \"cb\" in the identical condition? and we haven't marked it, so we do:\n              mul=1, and iterate ... but there's no string after? So we count 2 pairs. But the actual pairs: \n          (first \"ab\", second \"ab\") -> not counted because they are identical? but the condition is for exactly one difference, so identical doesn't count. (first \"ab\", \"cb\"): one difference -> count. (second \"ab\", \"cb\"): one difference -> count.\n          -> 2 pairs. So it's correct. Therefore, for the TODO, we should do:\n\n          co += mul So the code for the TODO is:\n\n          co += mul\n\n  But note: the code has an elif and then the next condition is an elif. We fill in:\n\n      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n          co += mul",

Then when we find a string \"cb\" (same second char 'b', different first char 'c'), we count 3 pairs: (jj, kk), (kk1, kk), (kk2, kk) ?

We'll provide 8 spaces. But the existing condition above has: if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n              co+=mul So we can mimic: elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n              co += mul But the provided code already has the condition, so we only need to put the action. So the missing line is:\n\n          co += mul\n\n  with 8 spaces. Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"        co += mul\", \"program2\": \"    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"}\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the for-loop body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop?",

Actually, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", but the input specification says the first line is t (number of test cases). However, the provided code does not have t.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100)\" and then the description of test cases. Then for each test case, we are given n and then n+1 integers? \n\nBut the provided code starts with:\n  n = int(input())\n  then reads a list of n+1 integers.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the problem statement and the code template might be mismatched.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement: \n  \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\nWait, that was for program1.py? But now we are in program2.py.\n\nActually, the problem for program2.py is different. The description for program2.py is:\n\n  Description: We say an infinite sequence ... \n  Input Specification: The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000). The second line of input contains n+1 integers a0, a1, ..., an.\n\nSo there is no t for multiple test cases? The note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", but the input only has one test case? \n\nWait, the note in the problem statement of program2.py says: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nBut the input specification says the first line is n. This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program2.py:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  then we read a list of n+1 integers.\n\nBut the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases\" \u2014 so there are multiple test cases? \n\nActually, the problem statement for program2.py does not mention multiple test cases. The input specification says:\n  The first line: n\n  The second line: n+1 integers\n\nHowever, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases\" \u2014 meaning that the input might have multiple test cases? But the problem says \"The first line of input contains one integer n\", so that implies one test case.\n\nBut wait: the note in the problem statement of program2.py says: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nThis suggests that there are multiple test cases. However, the input specification does not mention t. \n\nThis is a contradiction. Let me check the sample: \n  The first example: \n      Input: \n          2\n          0 0\n      But wait, the example in the note: \n          \"Consider the first example. In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n      How do we get that? \n          We are given n and then a0, a1, ... an.\n\n      The example says: \n          \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n\" \u2014 but then the example input?\n\n      Actually, the example input for the first example in the note is not provided in the problem statement for program2.py.\n\nLooking at the provided code for program2.py:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  Then we have a loop that iterates over the list of a's? \n\nBut the code has:\n\n  for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n      d += ... \n\nSo it's reading one line of n+1 integers and iterating over each value (which is z).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence a is non-increasing and for i>n, a_i=0.\n\nWe are to compute the minimum number of operations.\n\nHow to solve:\n\nWe start with a doll at (0,0). We can do operations: remove a doll at (x,y) and put two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). The goal is to have 0 dolls on every white cell. The white cells are defined by the sequence a: for a cell (x,y), it is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise.\n\nNote: the sequence a is non-increasing and we are given a0, a1, ... an, and for i>n, a_i=0.\n\nWe note that the grid is infinite. The dolls can only be moved to the right (increasing y) or down (increasing x). The white cells are only in the first a_x columns of row x. Since a_i becomes 0 for i>n, the white cells are only in rows 0 to n and columns 0 to a_0-1 (because a0>=a1>=...>=an, and then zeros).\n\nWe are to remove all dolls from white cells. Note that we can have multiple dolls at a cell, and we remove one at a time.\n\nWe can think of the process as: we start with one doll at (0,0). We must remove every doll that ever appears on a white cell. However, note that when we remove a doll at (x,y) (which is a white cell, because we are only allowed to remove from white cells? but note: the problem doesn't say we can only remove from white cells, but the goal is to have white cells with 0 dolls. We can remove a doll from any cell? However, if we remove a doll from a black cell, that doesn't help because the goal only requires white cells to be 0. But note: if we leave a doll in a black cell, that's allowed. So we only need to remove dolls that are in white cells.\n\nBut the operation: when we remove a doll at (x,y), we put two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). If (x,y) is white, then we remove one doll from a white cell, but we add two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). Now, note that (x,y+1) might be black (if y+1 >= a_x) and (x+1,y) might be white (if y < a_{x+1}) or black.\n\nSo the problem is to remove all dolls that ever appear in white cells. We start with one doll at (0,0) which is white (if a0>=1, which it is because at (0,0): y=0 < a0? but note: if a0==0 then (0,0) is black? but the problem says: the cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x. So if a0==0, then (0,0) is black? but then we start with a doll on a black cell? and we don't need to remove it? but the goal is to have white cells with 0 dolls. So if we start at (0,0) and a0==0, then we don't need to do anything? \n\nBut the example: \n  \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" \n  so a0 must be at least 2? because (0,0) and (0,1) are white -> a0>=2, and (1,0) and (1,1) are white -> a1>=2.\n\nThe example input: \n  We are not given explicitly, but the note says: \n      Initially: (0,0,1)\n      After 5 operations: ... \n\nHow to compute the answer?\n\nWe note that the process is similar to a branching process. Each doll at (x,y) that we remove (if it is in a white cell) must be removed, and then we create two new dolls. However, if a doll is in a black cell, we leave it.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to remove a doll from a black cell? The problem does not forbid it. However, removing a doll from a black cell would create two new dolls and that might be counterproductive? Actually, we don't need to remove black dolls. So we only remove white dolls.\n\nTherefore, the process: we start with a white doll at (0,0) (if a0>0). We must remove it. Then we get two dolls: (0,1) and (1,0). Now, if (0,1) is white (if 1 < a0) and (1,0) is white (if 0 < a1), then we have two white dolls. Then we remove one of them, and so on.\n\nThe key is: every time we remove a white doll at (x,y), we get two new dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). We must remove these new dolls if they are white.\n\nTherefore, the entire process is determined: we must remove every doll that ever appears in a white cell. And the propagation is deterministic: the doll at (x,y) will be removed and then it will generate two dolls: (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). \n\nTherefore, the total number of operations is exactly the total number of white dolls that ever appear during the process.\n\nBut note: we start with one white doll at (0,0). Then when we remove it, we get two new dolls. Then we remove each of those if they are white, and so on.\n\nSo the total number of operations is the total number of white cells that are \"reached\" by the process? \n\nBut note: a doll might be generated multiple times? because there might be multiple ways to get to (x,y). For example, (1,1) can be generated from (0,1) and from (1,0). So we have to count the total number of times a white cell is visited by a doll? and each time we have a doll in a white cell, we must remove it (which counts as one operation) and then we generate two new dolls.\n\nTherefore, the total operations is the total number of white cells that are reached, but each cell (x,y) is counted as many times as the number of dolls that appear at (x,y). \n\nSo we need to compute: \n  total_operations = sum_{all white cells (x,y)} (number of ways a doll appears at (x,y))\n\nHow to compute the number of ways to reach (x,y)? \n\nThe doll at (x,y) can only come from:\n  - from (x-1, y) by moving down: then the doll at (x-1,y) was removed and generated (x-1,y+1) and (x,y). So one way is from (x-1,y).\n  - from (x, y-1) by moving right: then the doll at (x,y-1) was removed and generated (x,y) and (x+1,y-1). So one way is from (x,y-1).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to get to (x,y) is: \n  dp[x][y] = (if x>0 then dp[x-1][y]) + (if y>0 then dp[x][y-1])\n\nBut note: we start at (0,0): dp[0][0] = 1.\n\nHowever, the grid is infinite? and we only care about white cells? and the white cells are only for x from 0 to n (because for x>n, a_x=0, so no white cells) and for y from 0 to a_x-1.\n\nBut note: the sequence a is non-increasing. So a0>=a1>=...>=an>=0.\n\nBut the grid we care about: \n  x in [0, n] and for each x, y in [0, a_x-1].\n\nBut note: the propagation: a doll at (x,y) might generate (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). But if (x,y) is white, then we remove it and generate the two. But if (x,y) is black, we leave it and do nothing. So the propagation only happens from white cells.\n\nTherefore, the number of dolls that appear at (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that go only through white cells? \n\nBut note: when we are at a black cell, we don't remove the doll, so we don't generate the next ones. Therefore, the propagation stops at black cells.\n\nSo the recurrence for the number of dolls at (x,y) is:\n  dp[x][y] = 0 if (x,y) is black? but wait: we only count the white cells? Actually, we only remove white dolls, so we only care about the white cells. For black cells, we don't remove them, so they don't generate new dolls. Therefore, the propagation only happens in white cells.\n\nBut note: the starting cell (0,0) is white if a0>0. If a0==0, then we don't do any operation.\n\nSo the recurrence: \n  dp[x][y] = 0 if (x,y) is black (i.e., if y>=a_x) \n  otherwise, \n      dp[x][y] = (if x==0 and y==0 then 1 else 0) \n                 + (if x>0 then dp[x-1][y]) \n                 + (if y>0 then dp[x][y-1])\n\nBut note: the propagation: \n  The doll at (x,y) is generated by:\n      - the doll that was at (x-1,y) and then moved down to (x,y) only if (x-1,y) was white (so we removed it and generated (x,y))? \n      - similarly, from (x,y-1) if (x,y-1) was white.\n\nBut wait: the generation: \n  When we remove a doll at (x',y'), we generate (x',y'+1) and (x'+1,y'). \n  So the doll at (x,y) can be generated by:\n      - a doll at (x-1, y) that was removed (so (x-1,y) must be white) and then generated (x,y) as the down move.\n      - a doll at (x, y-1) that was removed (so (x,y-1) must be white) and then generated (x,y) as the right move.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is:\n  dp[x][y] = 0 if (x,y) is black.\n  if (x,y) is white:\n      dp[x][y] = 1 if (x,y)==(0,0) \n                 else ( (dp[x-1][y] if x>0 and (x-1,y) is white? but note: we don't require (x-1,y) to be white for the generation? Actually, the generation happens only if we remove the doll at (x-1,y) and that removal requires that (x-1,y) is white. But if (x-1,y) is black, we don't remove it, so we don't generate (x,y) from (x-1,y). Similarly for (x,y-1).\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n  dp[x][y] = 0 if y>=a_x (black) \n            = 1 if (x,y)==(0,0) and y<a0\n            = ( (if x>0 and y < a_{x-1} then dp[x-1][y] else 0) \n              + (if y>0 and y-1 < a_x then dp[x][y-1] else 0) ) \n\nBut note: for (x,y) to be generated from (x-1,y), we require that (x-1,y) is white (so that the doll at (x-1,y) was removed and generated (x,y)). Similarly, for (x,y-1) to generate (x,y), we require that (x,y-1) is white.\n\nHowever, note that if (x-1,y) is black, then the doll at (x-1,y) is not removed, so it doesn't generate (x,y). Similarly for (x,y-1).\n\nBut wait: what if (x-1,y) is black? then we don't get a doll at (x,y) from (x-1,y). \n\nTherefore, the recurrence is:\n  dp[x][y] = 0 if y>=a_x\n  else:\n      ways = 0\n      if x==0 and y==0: \n          ways = 1\n      else:\n          if x>0 and y < a[x-1]:   # then (x-1,y) is white, so we can come from above\n              ways += dp[x-1][y]\n          if y>0: \n              # we can come from the left: (x,y-1) must be white? but note: we are at row x, and the condition for (x,y-1) is y-1 < a_x? \n              # But note: we are in the branch that (x,y) is white -> y < a_x, so y-1 < a_x? not necessarily: if y==0 then y-1 is negative? but y>0 so y>=1, then y-1>=0. And since y < a_x, then y-1 < a_x is always true? \n              # However, we require that (x,y-1) is white? which is y-1 < a_x? yes, because y-1 < y < a_x? \n              # But wait: the condition for (x,y-1) to be white is y-1 < a_x? and we have y < a_x, so y-1 < a_x is true? \n              # However, note: the sequence a is non-increasing, but a_x is the value for row x. \n              # So for the same row, the condition for (x,y-1) is y-1 < a_x, which is true because y < a_x and y-1 < y < a_x.\n              # Therefore, we don't need to check the whiteness of (x,y-1) for the left move? \n              # But wait: the generation from (x,y-1) only happens if we remove the doll at (x,y-1). And we only remove it if it is white. So we must check that (x,y-1) is white? \n              # However, we are in the branch that (x,y) is white -> y < a_x. Then (x,y-1) is also white? because y-1 < y < a_x -> y-1 < a_x. \n              # Therefore, if (x,y) is white and y>0, then (x,y-1) is white. \n              # But what if a_x is 0? then we wouldn't be in the white branch. So we are safe.\n\n          However, wait: what if a_x is 1? then y must be 0. Then (x,y-1) = (x,-1) which is not in the grid? and we don't consider negative indices. \n\n      So we can write:\n          if y>0: \n              ways += dp[x][y-1]\n\n      But note: we must also consider that if we are at row x, and we are at y=0, then we cannot come from the left.\n\n  Therefore, the recurrence for (x,y) white is:\n      dp[x][y] = 0\n      if x==0 and y==0: \n          dp[0][0] = 1\n      else:\n          if x>0 and y < a[x-1]:   # then we can come from (x-1,y) because (x-1,y) is white? \n              dp[x][y] += dp[x-1][y]\n          if y>0:\n              dp[x][y] += dp[x][y-1]\n\nBut note: the condition for (x-1,y) to be white is y < a_{x-1}. We are given the array a for indices 0..n. For x-1 in [0, n] we have a[x-1]. For x-1>n, a_{x-1}=0, so if x-1>n then (x-1,y) is black (unless y<0, which is not possible). So we only consider x-1 in [0, n] and then we check y < a[x-1]. \n\nBut note: the grid we care about: x from 0 to n (because for x>n, a_x=0, so no white cells). And for each row x, y from 0 to a_x-1.\n\nHowever, the problem: the total n is up to 200000, and a0 up to 200000, so the grid has about n * a0 cells which can be 200000*200000 = 40e9, too many.\n\nWe need a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nWe note that the process is similar to a lattice path. The total number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that only go through white cells? and then we stop at a black cell? \n\nBut note: the propagation stops at black cells? Actually, when we hit a black cell, we don't remove the doll, so we don't generate the next. Therefore, the paths that go through a black cell are not extended. \n\nBut note: the recurrence above is defined only for white cells. And the value at a white cell (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay entirely in white cells? \n\nYes: because we only traverse white cells. \n\nSo the total operations is the sum_{x=0}^{n} sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} dp[x][y]\n\nBut the grid is too big. We need to compute this without iterating over every cell.\n\nWe note that the sequence a is non-increasing. So the white region is a Young diagram. \n\nWe can use dynamic programming that goes row by row and uses prefix sums? \n\nBut note: the recurrence:\n  dp[x][y] = \n      if x==0: \n          then for y in [0, a0-1]: dp[0][y] = 1? but wait: \n          at (0,0): 1\n          at (0,1): from (0,0) -> so 1\n          at (0,2): from (0,1) -> 1\n          ... until (0, a0-1): 1.\n\n      So for row0: dp[0][y] = 1 for all y in [0, a0-1].\n\n  For row1: \n      dp[1][0] = (if 0 < a0? then dp[0][0] = 1) + (if y>0? no) -> 1.\n      dp[1][1] = (if 1 < a0? then dp[0][1] = 1) + dp[1][0] = 1+1 = 2.\n      dp[1][2] = (if 2 < a0? then dp[0][2] = 1) + dp[1][1] = 1+2 = 3? \n      but only for y < a1.\n\n  So for row x, the dp[x][y] = \n        (if y < a_{x-1} then dp[x-1][y] else 0) + (if y>0 then dp[x][y-1] else 0)\n\nBut note: the condition for the left move: we don't require anything beyond the row x? \n\nWe can compute row by row. However, the row x has a_x entries. The total sum of a_x over x is at most 200000? but note: the input says the sum of n over test cases is <= 100000, but here we have one test case? and n up to 200000, and a0 up to 200000, so the total white cells is a0 + a1 + ... + a_n, which might be large (if a0=200000, a1=200000, ... but the sequence is non-increasing, so the total is at most a0 * (n+1) which is 200000*200000 = 40e9, too many).\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternative Insight from Combinatorics:\n\nWe note that the entire process is a branching process and the total operations is the total number of white cells that are reached? but with multiplicities (the number of paths to that cell). \n\nWe can use generating functions or combinatorial identities.\n\nConsider: the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay in the white region is the binomial coefficient C(x+y, x) minus the paths that go through a black cell? \n\nBut the white region is defined by: for each row i, we cannot go beyond a_i-1. \n\nThis is the classical problem of counting lattice paths in a Young diagram. \n\nThe total number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay in the diagram is given by the hook-length formula? or by iterated sums? \n\nBut we need the sum over all (x,y) in the diagram of the number of paths to (x,y). \n\nWe define:\n  F(x) = sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} dp[x][y]\n\nBut note: the recurrence for the entire row? \n\nWe can use a DP that goes row by row and uses a Fenwick tree? or segment tree? \n\nBut note: the recurrence for a fixed row x:\n  dp[x][y] = \n      if y < a_x: \n          term1 = (if x>0 and y < a_{x-1} then dp[x-1][y] else 0)\n          term2 = (if y>0 then dp[x][y-1] else 0)\n          so dp[x][y] = term1 + term2\n\n  But note: if we define S(x) = sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} dp[x][y], then we cannot easily express S(x) in terms of S(x-1) because the term1 involves individual dp[x-1][y] for y in [0, min(a_x-1, a_{x-1}-1)]? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a recurrence that accumulates the row as a prefix sum.\n\nLet F(x,y) = dp[x][y] (for y in [0, a_x-1])\nThen for row x, we have:\n  F(x,0) = (if x>0 and 0 < a_{x-1} then F(x-1,0) else 0)   [because y=0, so no left]\n          = (if x>0 and a_{x-1}>0 then F(x-1,0) else 0) \n          and if x==0, then F(0,0)=1.\n\n  F(x,1) = (if x>0 and 1 < a_{x-1} then F(x-1,1) else 0) + F(x,0)\n  F(x,2) = (if x>0 and 2 < a_{x-1} then F(x-1,2) else 0) + F(x,1)\n\nSo we can write:\n  F(x,y) = (if x>0 and y < a_{x-1} then F(x-1,y) else 0) + F(x,y-1)   [for y>=1, and for y=0 as above]\n\nThen the entire row x can be computed if we know the previous row and the current row's a_x and the previous row's a_{x-1}. \n\nBut note: the row x has a_x elements. The total sum of a_x over x is the total number of white cells. And the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is <= 100000? but wait, the input says: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nBut here we have one test case? and n up to 200000? \n\nActually, the problem says: \n  \"The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000).\"\n  and then a list of n+1 integers.\n\nBut then it says: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \n  \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\"\n\nBut then the code template for program2.py does not have t? \n\nThe code template for program2.py:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  a = list(map(int, input().split())   # this is n+1 integers\n\nSo it seems there is only one test case. But the note says \"the sum of n over all test cases\" \u2014 implying multiple test cases. \n\nHowever, the problem statement for program2.py does not mention t. The input specification says the first line is n. \n\nThis is a contradiction. But the problem statement also says: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nSo there are multiple test cases? \n\nBut the code template does not read t. \n\nWe must reconcile: the problem statement for program2.py might have a mistake? or the code template is for one test case? \n\nBut the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases\" \u2014 so there are multiple test cases. \n\nTherefore, the input should start with t. \n\nBut the code template does not read t. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nLooking at the provided code template:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  and then a loop that iterates over the list a? \n\nBut the list a has n+1 integers. \n\nAnd then we have:\n\n  d=0, and then \n  for z in a: \n      d += ... \n\nBut the variable n is the number of test cases? no, n is the first integer, and then we read n+1 integers. \n\nBut the problem says: the first integer is n, then a0, a1, ... an.\n\nSo we have one test case. \n\nBut the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases\" \u2014 so there are multiple test cases? \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n  \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\nThis suggests that there are multiple test cases. \n\nBut the input specification does not mention t. \n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\nHowever, the provided code template does not read t. \n\nBut then the note says: the sum of n over all test cases <= 10^5, and n<=200000, so if there is only one test case, then n<=200000, but 200000>100000, so it must be that there are multiple test cases. \n\nTherefore, the input must start with t. \n\nBut the code template does not read t. \n\nThis is a discrepancy. \n\nHow to resolve? \n\nLooking at the sample: \n  The example in the note: \n      \"Consider the first example. In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n  This implies that n=1? because we have a0 and a1? but the input for a test case is: \n      n \n      a0, a1, ... an   (n+1 integers)\n\n  For the example, n=1, and then a0, a1. And a0>=2, a1>=2.\n\n  Then the total operations is 5.\n\n  So if there is one test case, then we read n=1, then two integers: a0, a1.\n\n  But the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so if we have multiple test cases, the sum of the n's (which is the number of test cases times the n per test case) is <= 10^5. \n\n  But the problem says: the first line of each test case is n, and then the next line has n+1 integers. \n\n  Therefore, the overall input: \n      t = number of test cases\n      for each test case:\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))   # n+1 integers\n\n  But the code template does not have t. \n\n  This means the code template is incomplete. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n  And the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n      for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n      for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n          d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\n          x+=1\n      print(d%m)\n\n  This code does not read t. \n\n  But the problem says: the first line is n (which is the n for the test case) and then the next line has n+1 integers.\n\n  And the note says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so there must be multiple test cases. \n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  I think the intended solution does not iterate over test cases in the provided code? \n\n  Or perhaps the note is from a different problem? \n\n  Let me read the problem statement again: \n      \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n  But the input specification says: \n      The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000). \n      The second line of input contains n+1 integers ...\n\n  This implies one test case. \n\n  However, 10^5 is the bound on the sum of n over test cases, but if there is only one test case, then n<=200000 which is greater than 10^5, so the guarantee \"sum of n over test cases <=10^5\" would be violated if n>100000. \n\n  Therefore, there must be multiple test cases. \n\n  So the input format must be:\n\n      t\n      for each test case:\n          n\n          a0 a1 ... an   (n+1 integers)\n\n  But the provided code does not have t. \n\n  This means the provided code template is for one test case only, but the problem has multiple test cases. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we can iterate over test cases and the total n (which is the sum of the n's of each test case) is <=10^5.\n\n  Therefore, we must read t test cases, but the code template does not. \n\n  This suggests that the code template is not complete and we have to fill in the missing parts, including the reading of t.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is for program1.py and program2.py. \n\n  And the provided code for program2.py has a loop that iterates over the list of integers (which is the n+1 integers) and does some computation.\n\n  How can we reconcile?\n\n  Insight from the provided code in the template:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n      for i in range(1,9**6): \n          # TODO: Your code here   -> this loop is not closed? \n      for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n          d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n          x+=1\n      print(d%m)\n\n  This code has a syntax error: the for-loop for i in range(...) is not indented and then we have a for-loop over z that is not aligned.\n\n  Also, the range(1,9**6) is 9**6 = 531441, and then we have a for-loop over z in the list. \n\n  The expression: \n      d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n\n  This looks like a combinatorial coefficient: \n      C(z+x, x+1) or something? \n\n  Note: pow(a, b, c) is a^b mod c.\n\n  The term: pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) is the modular inverse of (f[x+1]*f[z-1]) mod m.\n\n  And f is a list that is initialized as [1]. The loop for i in range(1, 9**6) is probably meant to build a factorial array.\n\n  So we can assume that f is a list of factorials: f[i] = i! mod m.\n\n  Then the term: \n      f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1] * f[z-1] mod m) mod m \n      = factorial[z+x] / ( factorial[x+1] * factorial[z-1] ) \n      = C(z+x, x+1) * factorial[z+x] / ( factorial[x+1] * factorial[z-1] ) \n      but note: C(z+x, x+1) = factorial[z+x] / ( factorial[x+1] * factorial[z-1] ) is not standard.\n\n  Standard combination: C(n, k) = factorial[n] / (factorial[k] * factorial[n-k])\n\n  Here, we have: \n      n = z+x, and then we are dividing by factorial[x+1] and factorial[z-1]. \n      But (x+1) + (z-1) = x+z, so this is C(z+x, x+1) * factorial[z+x] / ( factorial[x+1] * factorial[z-1] ) is not matching.\n\n  Alternatively, it might be: \n      factorial[z+x] / ( factorial[x+1] * factorial[z-1] ) = C(z+x, x+1) * (factorial[z+x] / factorial[z+x])? \n\n  This is not making sense.\n\n  Another possibility: \n      We have: \n          term = f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1]) % m * inv(f[z-1]) % m \n          = factorial[z+x] * inv_fact[x+1] * inv_fact[z-1] \n\n  And then multiplied by (z!=0).\n\n  What could this be counting?\n\n  We recall that we are counting the total number of paths in the Young diagram. \n\n  There is a known combinatorial identity: the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that do not go above the diagonal is given by ballot numbers, but here the diagram is defined by a non-increasing sequence.\n\n  Another known fact: the generating function for the number of paths in a Young diagram can be expressed using a product.\n\n  Or: the total number of paths that stay in the diagram might be computed by a recurrence that involves the a_i's.\n\n  Insight from the provided code: \n      We are iterating over the list a (which is a0, a1, ... an) with index x (from 0 to n) and the value z = a_x.\n\n      Then we do:\n          d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n\n      But note: if z==0, then we skip.\n\n      And x starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each z.\n\n      So for x=0, z = a0, then we add: \n          term0 = f[a0+0] * inv(f[1]*f[a0-1]) mod m * 1   [if a0!=0]\n\n      = factorial[a0] / ( factorial[1] * factorial[a0-1] ) = a0.\n\n      For x=1, z = a1, then we add:\n          term1 = f[a1+1] * inv(f[2]*f[a1-1]) mod m * 1 \n                 = factorial[a1+1] / ( factorial[2] * factorial[a1-1] ) \n                 = [ (a1+1)! ] / [ 2 * (a1-1)! ] = (a1+1)*a1 / 2.\n\n      For x=2, z=a2, then:\n          term2 = factorial[a2+2] / ( factorial[3] * factorial[a2-1] ) \n                 = (a2+2)*(a2+1)*a2 / 6.\n\n      This does not resemble the total number of paths.\n\n  Alternatively, the total number of operations might be expressed as a sum over x of some function of a_x and x.\n\n  Known solution for a similar problem: \n\n      There is a problem: \"Count the number of increasing paths in a grid with obstacles\", but here the grid is defined by a non-increasing sequence.\n\n  Another known solution: \n\n      In fact, the total number of lattice paths from (0,0) to any cell in the Young diagram (i.e., the sum over all cells (x,y) in the diagram of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay in the diagram) is given by:\n\n          Sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x + a_x, x+1)\n\n      Why? \n\n      Consider the cell (x, a_x - 1) is the last white cell in row x. The number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x - 1) is C(x + a_x - 1, x). But we want the sum over y=0 to a_x-1.\n\n      There is a hockey-stick identity: \n          sum_{y=0}^{m} C(x+y, x) = C(x+m+1, x+1)\n\n      But note: our recurrence for a fixed x: \n          F(x,y) = C(x+y, x)   if there were no restrictions from above? but we have restrictions: we require that in previous rows, we didn't go beyond a_{x'}-1.\n\n      However, in our diagram, the allowed y in row x is [0, a_x-1], and the allowed region is a Young diagram. \n\n      There is a formula for the sum over the entire diagram: \n          total_paths = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x + a_x, x+1)\n\n      Let's test with the example: \n          Example: a0=2, a1=2, and then a_i=0 for i>=2? but n=1, so we only have a0 and a1.\n\n          The diagram: \n             row0: y=0,1 -> white.\n             row1: y=0,1 -> white.\n\n          We need to sum over all white cells the number of paths.\n\n          (0,0): 1\n          (0,1): 1\n          (1,0): 1 (path: (0,0)->(1,0))\n          (1,1): 2 (path1: (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1); path2: (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1))\n\n          total = 1+1+1+2 = 5.\n\n          Now, using the formula: \n             x=0: C(0+2, 0+1) = C(2,1) = 2.\n             x=1: C(1+2, 1+1) = C(3,2) = 3.\n             total = 2+3 = 5.\n\n          It matches.\n\n      Why is this true? \n\n      The identity: \n          sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n      But wait: \n          sum_{y=0}^{m} C(x+y, x) = C(x+m+1, x+1)   [hockey-stick]\n\n      Here, m = a_x - 1, so:\n          sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n      However, this is only true if there were no restrictions from above. In our case, the path must also stay in the previous rows within their a_i's. \n\n      But the formula for the entire diagram is not simply the sum over x of C(x+a_x, x+1) because the path must stay in the diagram in all rows.\n\n      However, there is a beautiful identity: \n          The total number of paths in the Young diagram defined by the sequence a0>=a1>=...>=an>=0 is:\n              sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n      We tested with n=1, a0=2, a1=2 -> 2+3=5, which matches.\n\n      Test with a0=1, a1=0:\n          Diagram: \n             row0: y=0 -> white.\n             row1: no white cells (a1=0)\n          Paths:\n             (0,0): 1\n          total = 1.\n          Formula: \n             x=0: C(0+1,1)=1\n             x=1: C(1+0,2)=C(1,2)=0\n          total=1.\n\n      Test with a0=3, n=0 (so only a0):\n          Diagram: row0: y=0,1,2.\n          Paths: \n             (0,0):1, (0,1):1, (0,2):1 -> total=3.\n          Formula: x=0: C(0+3,1)=3.\n\n      Test with a0=2, n=0: \n          total=2, formula= C(0+2,1)=2.\n\n      Test with two rows: a0=3, a1=2, n=1.\n          Diagram:\n             row0: y=0,1,2\n             row1: y=0,1\n          Paths:\n             (0,0):1\n             (0,1):1\n             (0,2):1\n             (1,0):1 (from (0,0))\n             (1,1): (from (0,1) and (1,0)) -> 1+1=2\n          total = 1+1+1+1+2 = 6.\n          Formula: \n             x=0: C(0+3,1)=3\n             x=1: C(1+2,2)=C(3,2)=3\n          total=6.\n\n      It matches.\n\n      Therefore, the total number of operations is:\n          answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x + a_x, x+1)\n\n      But note: if a_x==0, then the term is 0.\n\n      And we are to output the answer modulo 10^9+7.\n\n      The constraints: \n          n up to 200000, and a_x up to 200000.\n\n      We need to compute binomial coefficients C(n, k) for n up to 400000 (since x+a_x <= 200000+200000=400000) and k up to 200000+1=200001.\n\n      The provided code template is building a factorial array up to 9**6 = 531441, which is greater than 400000, so it's enough.\n\n      Then, the code iterates over the list a (which has n+1 elements, from a0 to an) and for each a_x (at index x) we compute:\n          if a_x != 0:\n              term = C(x + a_x, x+1) \n          else:\n              term = 0\n\n      And then sum the terms.\n\n      The code template:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))   # this is a0, a1, ... an -> n+1 numbers\n\n          We need to compute factorials up to N, where N = max_{x} (x+a_x) <= 400000.\n\n          The template has:\n              f = [1]\n              for i in range(1, 9**6):   # 9**6 = 531441\n                  f.append(f[-1]*i % m)\n\n          Then, for each index x from 0 to n (so x in [0, n]), we have z = a[x] (the x-th element of a, which is a_x)\n\n          Then:\n              d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[z-1] % m, m-2, m)   if z!=0\n\n          But wait, the binomial coefficient C(x+z, x+1) = f[x+z] * inv(f[x+1] * f[z-1] ?) \n\n          Let's check: \n              C(n, k) = f[n] * inv(f[k] * f[n-k]) mod m.\n\n          Here, n = x+z, k = x+1, then n-k = (x+z) - (x+1) = z-1.\n\n          So C(x+z, x+1) = f[x+z] * inv(f[x+1] * f[z-1]) mod m.\n\n          But note: if z==0, then we skip.\n\n          However, if z==0, then the term is 0, and also note that if z==0, then z-1 = -1, and we don't have f[-1]. So we skip when z==0.\n\n      Therefore, the code template is almost complete. \n\n      What is missing? \n          The factorial array f is built only up to 531441, but the loop for i in range(1, 9**6) is not closed? \n\n      The provided code:\n\n          n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n          for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n          for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n              d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\n              x+=1\n          print(d%m)\n\n      This has a syntax error: the first for-loop has no body. \n\n      We need to fill in the body of the first for-loop to extend the factorial array.\n\n      We should do:\n\n          for i in range(1, 9**6):\n              f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n      But note: 9**6 is 531441, which is enough because the maximum argument we need in f is up to 400000.\n\n      Also, we are iterating over the list a: for z in ... \n\n      But note: x starts at 0, and we do x+=1 for each z. And the list a has n+1 elements. \n\n      So x goes from 0 to n.\n\n      For each x, we use:\n          f[z+x]   -> which is factorial[z+x]\n          f[x+1]   -> factorial[x+1]\n          f[z-1]   -> factorial[z-1]   but if z==0, we skip, so z>=1.\n\n      However, what if z-1 is negative? we skip when z==0, so z>=1, so z-1>=0.\n\n      But what if z==1? then z-1=0, and we have f[0] which is defined (f=[1] initially, so f[0]=1).\n\n      But note: the factorial array f is built for indices 0 to 531440. \n\n      We need to make sure that we have computed factorials for all indices up to at most 400000.\n\n      The maximum index we use: \n          z+x: x<=n<=200000, z<=200000, so z+x<=400000, and 400000 < 531441, so it's safe.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code in the first for-loop is: \n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n      But note: the factorial of 0 is 1, and we have f[0]=1. Then for i from 1 to 531440, we do f[i] = f[i-1]*i % m.\n\n      Then the second for-loop: \n          for z in a:   # a is the list of n+1 integers\n              if z!=0:\n                  term = f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[z-1] % m, m-2, m) % m\n                  d = (d + term) % m\n              x += 1\n\n      But note: the code does: \n          d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n\n      This is equivalent to: \n          if z!=0: add the term, else add 0.\n\n      However, the multiplication by (z!=0) is safe because when z==0, the expression f[z+x] = f[x] and f[z-1]=f[-1] which is not defined? \n\n      But in the code, if z==0, then we multiply by 0, so the whole term is 0, and we avoid using f[z-1] when z==0? \n\n      Actually, in Python, the expression is evaluated fully before multiplying by 0? \n\n      So if z==0, then we try to compute f[0+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[0-1], ...) and then multiply by 0. But f[0-1] = f[-1] which is the last element of f? \n\n      That would be f[531440] for the last index? but we want f[-1] (which is the last element) but for negative index, Python uses f[-1] as the last element. \n\n      But when z==0, we don't want to compute that. \n\n      Therefore, we should avoid accessing f[z-1] when z==0. \n\n      The current code does: \n          d += ... * (z!=0)\n\n      But the arguments to pow: f[x+1]*f[z-1] is computed even if z==0. \n\n      So we get an index error for z-1 = -1? \n\n      We need to avoid that. \n\n      We can restructure to only compute when z!=0, but the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n      We are allowed to fix the existing code? \n\n      The problem says: \"fill in the missing lines or blocks\", so we can only fill in the missing parts. \n\n      The missing part is the body of the first for-loop. \n\n      The second for-loop is given, but it has a potential bug when z==0. \n\n      How to handle? \n\n      We note that when z==0, the term is 0, and we don't need to compute the binomial coefficient. \n\n      But the code as written will try to access f[z-1] = f[-1] when z==0. \n\n      However, in Python, negative indices are allowed: f[-1] is the last element of the list. \n\n      But that is not factorial[-1]! \n\n      We must avoid that. \n\n      Therefore, we must change the code to only compute the binomial coefficient when z!=0. \n\n      But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n      This suggests that the provided code might be intended to work only for z>0? \n\n      And the input guarantee: the sequence is non-increasing and a_i=0 for i>n, but we are only given a0 to an. \n\n      However, a0 could be 0? then the first term has z=0. \n\n      We must skip the computation when z==0. \n\n      We can do an if statement inside the for-loop, but we are not allowed to change that part? \n\n      Alternatively, we can precompute the factorials for negative indices? but that doesn't make sense.\n\n      But note: the factorial array f is only defined for indices 0 to 531440. \n\n      We must not access f at negative indices. \n\n      Therefore, the provided code has a flaw. \n\n      How did the example work? \n          Example: a0=2, a1=2.\n          Then the list a = [2,2]\n          For the first z=2, x=0: \n              term = f[2+0] * pow(f[0+1] * f[2-1], m-2, m) \n                   = f[2] * pow(f[1]*f[1], m-2, m)\n          We need f[0]=1, f[1]=1, f[2]=2.\n          So term = 2 * pow(1*1, ...) = 2.\n          Then x becomes 1.\n          Then z=2, x=1:\n              term = f[2+1] * pow(f[1+1]*f[2-1], ...) \n                   = f[3] * pow(f[2]*f[1], ...)\n                   = 6 * pow(2*1, ...) \n                   = 6 * pow(2, mod-2, mod) \n                   = 6 * (inverse of 2 mod 10^9+7) \n                   = 6 * ( (10^9+8)//2 ) ? \n              But 6/2 = 3, so term=3.\n          Then d=2+3=5.\n\n      But if we have a0=0, then the list a = [0] (if n=0) or [0, ...] if n>0.\n          For the first term: z=0, then we do:\n              f[0+0] = f[0]=1\n              f[0+1]=f[1]=1\n              f[0-1]=f[-1] -> which is the last element of f, which is factorial[531440] mod m, a huge number.\n\n          Then we multiply by 0? so the term becomes 0.\n\n          But we are accessing f[-1] which is not factorial[-1] but the last element, and then we multiply by 0, so it's 0.\n\n          However, the binomial coefficient for C(0,1) is 0, so it should be 0.\n\n      But mathematically, C(0,1) is 0, and we want to add 0. \n\n      But the formula: \n          C(x+z, x+1) = C(0,1) = 0.\n\n      So the term is 0. \n\n      The flaw is that we are using f[z-1] for z=0, which is f[-1], and that is not the factorial of -1, but the last element of the list. \n\n      This is incorrect.\n\n      Therefore, we must avoid the access when z==0. \n\n      Since we cannot change the given part (only fill in the missing part), we must hope that the input has no zero? \n\n      But the problem says a_i can be 0.\n\n      Alternatively, the problem guarantees that the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, but we have one test case? \n\n      Actually, we have multiple test cases? \n\n      But the code does not read t. \n\n      This is a mess.\n\n  After re\u2010examining the problem statement: \n      \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n  This is for program1.py? but we are in program2.py.\n\n  The program2.py description does not mention t. \n\n  But the input specification for program2.py says: \n      \"The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000).\"\n\n  So it is one test case. \n\n  And the note says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n  This must be a mistake. \n\n  Given the constraints, the intended solution is to use the formula:\n\n      answer = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)   [with the convention that if a_x==0 then the term is 0]\n\n  and the provided code template is building factorials and then iterating over the list a.\n\n  To fix the issue with z==0, we can precompute factorials for negative indices? but that doesn't make sense.\n\n  Or, we can change the code to not use negative indices. \n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  The missing code is only the body of the for-loop for i in range(1,9**6). \n\n  We are not allowed to change the rest.\n\n  However, the problem also says: \"with missing lines or blocks\", so perhaps the block for the factorial initialization is missing, and the rest is given and we cannot change.\n\n  But the provided code has a flaw in the second for-loop when z==0.\n\n  How to resolve within the constraints? \n\n  Note: the term is multiplied by (z!=0). In Python, the expression is evaluated in full before multiplying. So if z==0, we will have an index error for f[z-1] = f[-1] only if the list f has at least one element? and it does (f=[1] initially, so f[-1] is 1). \n\n  But is that the factorial of -1? No, but mathematically we want 0 anyway. \n\n  However, the binomial coefficient C(x+0, x+1) = 0, so the term should be 0. \n\n  But the expression we are using is:\n\n      f[x+0] * pow(f[x+1] * f[0-1], m-2, m) \n\n  = f[x] * pow(f[x+1] * f[-1], m-2, m)\n\n  This is not equal to 0. \n\n  For example, x=0, z=0:\n      f[0] = 1\n      f[1] = 1? (if we have built f[1] in the factorial array) \n      f[-1] = last element of f, which is factorial[531440] mod m.\n\n  Then the term = 1 * pow(1 * f[-1], m-2, m) = pow(f[-1], m-2, m) = modular inverse of f[-1] mod m, which is not 0.\n\n  So it's not 0.\n\n  Therefore, we must not use this when z==0.\n\n  Given the constraints of the problem (only fill in the missing part), we have to hope that the input has no zero? \n\n  But the problem says a_i can be 0.\n\n  Or, the intended solution might be to use a different formula for the binomial coefficient when z==0? \n\n  Alternatively, we can initialize the factorial array to have a dummy value at index -1? but we cannot.\n\n  Another idea: we can shift the indices of the factorial array. \n\n  But we are not allowed to change the given code.\n\n  This is a problem.\n\n  However, note that the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", and n is the number of test cases? \n\n  But the input for program2.py does not have t.\n\n  I think there is a misunderstanding: the problem statement for program2.py has multiple test cases, and the first line is t. \n\n  But the provided code does not read t. \n\n  Therefore, we must read t first.\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n  And the provided code has:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n\n  This reads n as the first integer, which in a multi-test-case input would be t. \n\n  Then the next line has n+1 integers? but if n is t, then we are reading t+1 integers? \n\n  This doesn't work.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the sample test case works if we avoid z==0, and the note says the sum of n over test cases is <=10^5, it is likely that the input has at least one test case and the first integer is the number of test cases t. \n\n  Then the provided code is not reading the input correctly.\n\n  How to fix without changing the provided code? \n\n  We are only allowed to fill in the missing part, which is the body of the first for-loop.\n\n  Therefore, we must output:\n\n      f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n  and hope that the input has no a_i=0? \n\n  But the example has a_i=2, not 0.\n\n  Or, the intended solution might be to use:\n\n      if z==0: \n          term = 0\n      else:\n          term = C(x+z, x+1)\n\n  and the given code does: \n          d += ... * (z!=0)\n\n  which is not safe because of the access to f[z-1].\n\n  Since the problem states that a_i can be 0, we must handle it.\n\n  Given the constraints of the problem (output only the missing code), we are forced to output only the factorial building and not change the rest.\n\n  Therefore, we output the factorial building and hope that the judge's input has no a_i=0? \n\n  But the problem says a_i>=0.\n\n  Or, note that in the binomial coefficient, if we define C(n, k)=0 when k<0 or k>n, then for z=0, we have n=x+z=x, and k=x+1, which is greater than n, so it's 0. \n\n  But our computation is not using the standard binomial coefficient formula for out-of-range.\n\n  We are accessing f[z-1] which is f[-1] when z=0, which is not defined in the factorial sense.\n\n  Therefore, we must change the given code. \n\n  But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so perhaps the entire code is not set in stone. \n\n  However, the instruction: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT the entire program\".\n\n  We are to output in JSON: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  For program2.py, the completion is the missing part.\n\n  The missing part is the body of the for-loop. \n\n  So we output:\n\n      \"program2\": \"    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n\n  And hope that the judge's input has no a_i=0? \n\n  But the sample in the note has a_i>=2.\n\n  Or, note that the problem says: for i>n, a_i=0. But we are only given a0 to an. \n\n  And in the list a, we have a0 to an, and then for the term with x>n, we don't iterate because we only have n+1 elements. \n\n  But what if for some x in [0,n], a_x=0? \n\n  For example, n=1, a0=0, a1=0.\n\n  Then the code will try to access f[-1] for the first term (x=0, z=0) and for the second term (x=1, z=0).\n\n  This will give wrong answer.\n\n  Therefore, we must find a way to only output the factorial building and also not change the given code, but the given code is flawed.\n\n  Alternatively, we can precompute the factorial array to have an extra value at a dummy index? but we cannot.\n\n  Given the time, I will output the factorial building and hope the test data has no a_i=0.\n\n  But the problem says a_i>=0, and the example has a_i=0 in the rows beyond n, but we are not iterating beyond n.\n\n  However, the given list a has exactly the values a0 to an, and these can be 0.\n\n  This is a known issue in the code.\n\n  There is a solution: we can note that when z==0, the binomial coefficient C(x+0, x+1) is 0, so we can avoid the computation by checking z>0. \n\n  But we are not allowed to change the given code.\n\n  Since the problem is from a contest, and the provided code is as given, I will output the factorial building.\n\n  And for the given example it works.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the first for-loop.\n\n  So:\n\n      for i in range(1,9**6):\n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n  But note: the range is from 1 to 9**6 - 1, so we do 9**6-1 iterations. \n\n  We start with f = [1] (for 0!), then we build up to 9**6.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Let me write the entire program2.py as it would be:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n      for i in range(1,9**6):\n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n      for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n          d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n          x += 1\n      print(d % m)\n\n  But note: the multiplication in the pow: f[x+1]*f[z-1] might be very large? but we are doing mod m in the pow? \n\n  The pow(a, b, c) does a^b mod c, and it does modular exponentiation. But here the exponent is m-2, and m=10**9+7, and the base is f[x+1]*f[z-1] which is a number mod m? \n\n  But we are not taking mod of the base before exponentiation? \n\n  We should do: base = (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) % m, then pow(base, m-2, m)\n\n  The current code: pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) \n\n  This might be a huge number and cause overflow in the multiplication f[x+1]*f[z-1] before mod? \n\n  The factorials are mod m, but they are stored as integers. The maximum factorial is about 531440! which is a number with about 6e6 digits, which is too big to compute.\n\n  But the problem says a0 up to 200000, and we are building factorials up to 531441, and 531441! is astronomically large and cannot be stored as an integer in practice.\n\n  Therefore, the factorial array f is storing factorials modulo m. \n\n  But then f[x+1] and f[z-1] are in the range [0, m-1]. \n\n  Then f[x+1]*f[z-1] might be as large as (10^9+6)^2 = 10^18+... which is within Python's integer range (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but multiplication of two integers up to 10^9 is fast), and then we do pow(..., m-2, m) which is fast exponentiation mod m.\n\n  So it's acceptable.\n\n  However, the multiplication f[x+1]*f[z-1] might be done in integers and then taken mod m in the pow? \n\n  But the pow(..., m-2, m) will reduce the base mod m first? \n\n  The documentation: pow(base, exp, mod) does base^exp mod mod, and it does the modular reduction at each step. But it also reduces the base mod mod first.\n\n  So it is efficient.\n\n  But the product f[x+1]*f[z-1] might be a very big integer? \n\n  We can do:\n\n          base = (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) % m\n\n  to keep the numbers smaller.\n\n  But the given code does not do that.\n\n  Given that we are not allowed to change the given code, we leave it.\n\n  But note: the product might be up to (10^9)^2 = 10^18, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n  Therefore, we output the missing code for program2.py as the factorial building.\n\n  And for program1.py, we have to complete it as well.\n\n  But the problem is about two programs.\n\n  We are only given one program2.py template.\n\n  And for program1.py, we are given:\n\n      for ii in range(int(input())):\n          n=int(input())\n          a=[]\n          co=0\n          x=set()\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          for jj in range(n):\n              mul=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          co+=mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n                          # TODO: Your code here\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          mul+=1\n                          x.add(kk)\n          print(co)\n\n  We will complete program1.py in a separate response.\n\n  For now, for program2.py, we output the factorial building.\n\n  But note: the range in the for-loop: range(1,9**6) goes from 1 to 9**6-1. We need to go to 9**6? \n\n  We have f[0]=1, then we build f[1] to f[9**6-1]. The maximum index we need is 400000, and 9**6-1 = 531440, which is enough.\n\n  So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n  We output in JSON:\n\n      {\"program1\": ... , \"program2\": \"    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"}\n\n  But note: the indentation. The for-loop is at the same level as the previous line. In the provided code, the for-loop is not indented? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We need to indent the body.\n\n  So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n      for i in range(1,9**6):\n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n  But the given code has the for-loop and then the next for-loop is not indented properly. \n\n  The provided code has:\n\n      for i in range(1,9**6): # TODO: Your code here\n      for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n\n  This is two consecutive for-loops at the same level. \n\n  We need to fill in the body of the first for-loop, so the first for-loop should have a body.\n\n  Therefore, the completed lines for the first for-loop are:\n\n      for i in range(1,9**6):\n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\n  And then the next for-loop is separate.\n\n  So the final answer for program2.py is the string:\n\n      \"    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n\n  with a tab or 4 spaces for the indentation.\n\n  We'll use 4 spaces.\n\n  Now, for program1.py, we have to complete the TODO.\n\n  Description for program1.py:\n\n      Given n strings, each of length 2, count the number of pairs (i,j) (i<j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n  Input: \n      t test cases.\n      for each test case: \n          n\n          n strings of length 2.\n\n  The provided code:\n\n      for ii in range(int(input())):\n          n=int(input())\n          a=[]\n          co=0\n          x=set()\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          for jj in range(n):\n              mul=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          co+=mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n                          # TODO: Your code here\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          mul+=1\n                          x.add(kk)\n          print(co)\n\n  The code is counting pairs (i,j) with i<j.\n\n  It iterates jj from 0 to n-1, and for each jj not marked in the set x, it iterates kk from jj+1 to n-1.\n\n  The set x is used to skip indices that have been grouped as duplicates? \n\n  The variable mul is initialized to 1 for each jj.\n\n  In the first condition: \n      if the two strings have the same second character and different first character, then we add mul.\n\n  In the third condition: \n      if the two strings are identical, then we increment mul and add kk to x.\n\n  The TODO is for the condition: same first character and different second character.\n\n  We should do something similar to the first condition.\n\n  In the first condition, we are counting pairs that have the same second character and different first character. And we add mul.\n\n  Why mul? \n\n  The mul is initially 1, and it is incremented every time we find an identical string to a[jj] (in the third condition). \n\n  So mul is the count of how many times we have seen the string a[jj] from index jj onwards? \n\n  But note: we skip indices in x, and when we find an identical string at kk, we add to mul and mark kk in x so that when we come to kk, we skip it.\n\n  This is a way to group duplicates.\n\n  For a fixed jj, we are iterating kk from jj+1 to n-1. \n      If we find a string that is identical to a[jj], we increment mul and mark kk as visited (so that when we later come to kk, we skip it because of the condition \"if jj not in x\" becomes false for jj=kk).\n\n  Then, when we find a string that has the same second char and different first char, we add mul.\n\n  Why mul? \n\n  Example: \n      Suppose we have the string \"ab\" at jj, and we have found 2 duplicates (so mul=3: the one at jj and two more at kk1 and kk2). \n      Then when we find a string \"cb\" (same second char 'b', different first char 'c'), we count 3 pairs: (jj, kk), (kk1, kk), (kk2, kk) ? \n\n  But wait, the pair (jj, kk) is between the original and the current kk, and also the duplicates of the original with the current kk.\n\n  However, the duplicates are not necessarily between jj and kk? \n\n  The mul counts the duplicates that we have encountered so far in the inner loop? \n\n  Actually, the mul starts at 1 (for jj) and then every time we find an exact duplicate of a[jj] at a later index kk, we increment mul and mark that kk as visited (so that when we come to that kk as jj, we skip it).\n\n  Then, when we find a string that has the same second char and different first char, we add mul (which is the count of duplicates of a[jj] found so far, including jj) for the pair (each of the duplicates with the current kk).\n\n  Similarly, for the condition with the same first char and different second char, we should also add mul.\n\n  But note: the pair (a[jj], a[kk]) is counted, and also (a[duplicate_index], a[kk]) for every duplicate of a[jj] that we have found so far.\n\n  However, the condition is: \n      a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]\n\n  Then the pair (a[jj], a[kk]) has the same first char and different second char.\n\n  And if there are mul duplicates of a[jj] (including jj), then we should add mul for the current kk.\n\n  But note: the duplicates are for the string a[jj], which is the same as a[jj]. The current kk has the same first char as a[jj] and a different second char. So each duplicate of a[jj] will form a valid pair with kk.\n\n  Therefore, we should do:\n\n      co += mul\n\n  in the TODO part.\n\n  But also, we might have duplicates of a[kk]? \n\n  The current code does not account for duplicates of a[kk] in this condition. \n\n  In the first condition, we only account for the duplicates of a[jj]. \n\n  Why not account for duplicates of a[kk]? \n\n  Let me see the entire algorithm:\n\n      We are iterating jj from 0 to n-1, skipping if jj is in x (which means jj has been found as a duplicate of an earlier string).\n\n      For a fixed jj, we set mul=1 (counting the current string jj) and then iterate kk from jj+1 to n-1.\n\n      For each kk:\n          if the string a[jj] and a[kk] are such that:\n              - if they have different first char and same second char: then we add mul (the count of duplicates of a[jj] found so far) and do not mark kk as anything? \n              - if they have same first char and different second char: then we should add mul? \n              - if they are identical: then we increment mul and add kk to x (so that we skip kk in the outer loop).\n\n      But note: if a[kk] is a duplicate of a[jj], then we mark it and skip it in the future. But if a[kk] is not a duplicate of a[jj] but might be a duplicate of another string, we don't mark it.\n\n      In the condition for same first char and different second char, we do not mark kk.\n\n      This is asymmetric to the identical case.\n\n      Why in the identical case we mark kk? because we want to skip it in the outer loop to avoid double counting? \n\n      The outer loop iterates jj, and if we leave kk unmarked, then when we come to kk (as jj) we would do the same for kk. But since we have already counted all pairs involving kk and the duplicates of a[jj] (which are the same as a[kk] if they are identical) in the current jj's iteration, we mark kk to skip it.\n\n      But for the other conditions, we do not mark kk. \n\n      This is because the other conditions are not about identical strings.\n\n      However, consider: \n          We have two strings: \"ab\" and \"ab\" (duplicates) and then \"ac\". \n          When jj is the first \"ab\", we find the second \"ab\": then mul becomes 2, and we mark the second \"ab\". \n          Then we find \"ac\": \n              same first char 'a', different second char: so we add mul (which is 2) -> so we count two pairs: (first \"ab\", \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", \"ac\").\n\n      This is correct.\n\n      But what if we have two \"ac\" strings? \n          We have: \n              jj: first \"ab\", then we find the second \"ab\": mul=2, mark the second \"ab\".\n              then we find the first \"ac\": add mul=2 -> two pairs: (first \"ab\", first \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              then we find the second \"ac\": add mul=2 -> two pairs: (first \"ab\", second \"ac\") and (second \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n\n          total for \"ab\" and \"ac\": 4 pairs.\n\n          But the actual pairs: \n              (first \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              (first \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n              (second \"ab\", first \"ac\")\n              (second \"ab\", second \"ac\")\n          -> 4 pairs.\n\n      But what if we then have jj at the first \"ac\"? \n          Since the first \"ac\" is not marked, we will start an iteration for jj = first \"ac\". \n          We set mul=1.\n          Then we find the second \"ac\": then we mark the second \"ac\", and mul becomes 2.\n          Then we find no more? \n          But we haven't counted the pairs between \"ac\" and \"ab\"? \n\n          But we already counted them when jj was at \"ab\".\n\n      So it's correct.\n\n      However, the condition for different first char and same second char: \n          Example: \"ab\", \"ab\", \"cb\"\n          When jj is at the first \"ab\": \n              we find the second \"ab\": mul=2, mark the second \"ab\".\n              we find \"cb\": different first char, same second char -> add mul=2: two pairs: (first \"ab\",\"cb\") and (second \"ab\",\"cb\")\n\n          Then when jj is at \"cb\", we skip because we never mark \"cb\" in the identical condition? and we haven't marked it, so we do:\n              mul=1, and iterate ... but there's no string after? \n\n          So we count 2 pairs.\n\n      But the actual pairs: \n          (first \"ab\", second \"ab\") -> not counted because they are identical? but the condition is for exactly one difference, so identical doesn't count.\n          (first \"ab\", \"cb\"): one difference -> count.\n          (second \"ab\", \"cb\"): one difference -> count.\n          -> 2 pairs.\n\n      So it's correct.\n\n      Therefore, for the TODO, we should do:\n\n          co += mul\n\n      So the code for the TODO is:\n\n          co += mul\n\n  But note: the code has an elif and then the next condition is an elif. \n\n  We fill in:\n\n      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n          co += mul\n\n  And then the next condition is an elif for identical.\n\n  But note: what if the two strings differ in both positions? \n      The conditions are:\n          if ...: # diff first, same second\n          elif ...: # same first, diff second\n          elif ...: # identical\n\n      So if they differ in both, we do nothing.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n\n      \"        co += mul\"\n\n  with appropriate indentation.\n\n  Now, we output the JSON.\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is the line \"        co += mul\" (with 8 spaces, because the TODO is inside a for-loop inside an if inside a for-loop).\n\n  The current indentation in the provided code for the TODO part is 8 spaces? \n\n  The code:\n\n          for jj in range(n):\n              mul=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      if ...:\n                          ...\n                      elif ...:\n                          # TODO: Your code here   -> at this indentation level, we need 8 spaces? \n\n  In Python, the body of the for-loop is indented by 4 more spaces, and the body of the if is 4 more, so the TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\n  We'll provide 8 spaces.\n\n  But the existing condition above has:\n\n          if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n              co+=mul\n\n  So we can mimic: \n\n          elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n              co += mul\n\n  But the provided code already has the condition, so we only need to put the action.\n\n  So the missing line is:\n\n          co += mul\n\n  with 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"        co += mul\", \"program2\": \"    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"}\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the for-loop body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop? \n\n  The for-loop in program2.py is at the top level, so we indent by 4 spaces.\n\n  The provided code for program2.py has the for-loop at the same indentation as the n,x,d,m,f assignment.\n\n  So we use 4 spaces.\n\n  Let me write the entire program2.py to check:\n\n      n,x,d,m,f = int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n      for i in range(1,9**6):\n          f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n      for z in list(map(int,input().split())):\n          d += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1], m-2, m) * (z!=0)\n          x += 1\n      print(d % m)\n\n  This should be the completed program2.py.\n\n  And for program1.py:\n\n      for ii in range(int(input())):\n          n=int(input())\n          a=[]\n          co=0\n          x=set()\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          for jj in range(n):\n              mul=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          co+=mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n                          co += mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj]["
