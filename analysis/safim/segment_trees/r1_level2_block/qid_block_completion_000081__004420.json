Then we update each position to the initial value. The update at position i: \n            old value = 0, new value = x.\n\n          We must consider the adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). For the left adjacent pair (i-1, i): \n            Before update: \n                tar[i-1] is the value we set in a previous update (if i>=1) or 0 if we haven't updated? Actually, we update in order from i=0 to n-1. So for i>=1, the element at i-1 has been updated to the initial value of arr[i-1]. Therefore, the old state for the left adjacent pair: \n                left element = arr[i-1] (if i>=1) and the current element = 0 (which is the old value at i). After update: \n                left element = arr[i-1] and the current element = x (the initial value at i). Similarly, for the right adjacent pair (i, i+1):\n            Before update: \n                current element = 0, and the next element = 0 (because we haven't updated i+1 yet) - > so they are equal? After update: \n                current element = x, and the next element = 0 -> so they are different? But wait: the next element will be updated later.

But the left adjacent pair uses the old value at i, and the right adjacent pair also uses the old value at i. Then we update. This is safe. Let's test with the example update: \n        After the initial array [1,2,2,4,5] (so after the 5 updates, we have total_aws=29). Then we get a query: i=3, x=2 (so change the 4 to 2). Before update: arr[3]=4, and the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. Left adjacent pair: i=3 -> j=2: \n            old_break: (arr[2]=2, arr[3]=4) -> 2!=4 -> 1.\n            new_break: (2,2) -> 0 -> so change1 = (0-1)* (2+1)*(5-1-2) = -1 * 3 * 2 = -6. Right adjacent pair: i=3 -> j=3: \n            old_break: (4,5) -> 1. new_break: (2,5) -> 1 -> change2 = 0. Then update arr[3]=2 -> the array becomes [1,2,2,2,5]. Then total_aws = 29 -6 = 23. Now, what is the correct total_aws for [1,2,2,2,5]?\n\n          We can compute by the formula: \n            T0 = 15. Breaks: \n                j0: (1,2) -> break -> 1 * 4 = 4\n                j1: (2,2) -> no break -> 0\n                j2: (2,2) -> no break -> 0\n                j3: (2,5) -> break -> 4 * 1 = 4\n            total = 15+4+4 = 23.

Then it computes m = max frequency of the array (by counting the string values). Then r=0, and then a while loop: while m<n, do something. But the problem: the minimal operations might be 0? Then we skip the while loop and output 0. However, the example: [0,0,0] -> m=3, n=3 -> skip while -> output 0.

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two distinct programming challenges. The first problem involves efficiently updating and querying the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each modification. The second problem requires determining the minimal number of operations needed to create a copy of an array where all elements are equal, using cloning and swapping operations.\n\n### Approach for Program 1: Sum of Awesomeness After Updates\nThe awesomeness of a subarray is defined as the number of blocks of consecutive identical elements. The total awesomeness over all subarrays can be derived by considering the initial total number of subarrays and adjusting for adjacent elements that differ. \n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The total number of subarrays is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). Each adjacent pair of elements that differ contributes to the awesomeness sum. Specifically, for each adjacent pair at index \\( j \\) (0-based), the contribution is \\( (j+1) \\times (n - j - 1) \\) if the elements differ.\n2. **Handling Updates**: When an element at index \\( i \\) is updated, it affects at most two adjacent pairs: \\( (i-1, i) \\) and \\( (i, i+1) \\). For each affected pair:\n   - Subtract the old contribution if the elements previously differed.\n   - Add the new contribution if the elements differ after the update.\n3. **Efficiency**: Each update is processed in constant time \\( O(1) \\), making the solution efficient for large inputs.\n\n### Approach for Program 2: Minimal Operations for Uniform Array\nThe goal is to create a copy of the array where all elements are the same using minimal cloning and swapping operations.\n\n1. **Frequency Analysis**: The key insight is that the minimal operations depend on the frequency of the most common element in the array. Let \\( m \\) be the maximum frequency of any element.\n2. **Operations Calculation**:\n   - **Cloning Operations**: The number of clones needed is \\( \\lceil \\frac{n}{m} \\rceil - 1 \\). This ensures there are enough copies of the chosen element to form a uniform array.\n   - **Swapping Operations**: The number of swaps required is \\( n - m \\), replacing non-target elements in the target array with the target element.\n3. **Total Operations**: The sum of cloning and swapping operations gives the minimal operations: \\( \\lceil \\frac{n}{m} \\rceil - 1 + n - m \\).\n\n### Solution Code for Program 1\n```python\n    n = len(arr)\n    change = 0\n    if i >= 1:\n        j = i - 1\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j + 1) * (n - 1 - j)\n    if i < n - 1:\n        j = i\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j + 1] else 0\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j + 1] else 0\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j + 1) * (n - 1 - j)\n    arr[i] = x\n    return curr_aws + change\n```\n\n### Solution Code for Program 2\n```python\n        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program 1**: The function `update_awesomeness` adjusts the total awesomeness by considering the impact of updating an element on its adjacent pairs. For each adjacent pair affected by the update, it calculates the change in contributions if the elements start or stop differing. The array is then updated, and the new total awesomeness is returned.\n- **Program 2**: The solution computes the minimal operations by leveraging the highest frequency element. The formula \\( \\lceil \\frac{n}{m} \\rceil - 1 + n - m \\) efficiently combines the number of clones needed to gather sufficient copies of the target element and the swaps required to replace non-target elements in the target array. The loop processes each test case, computes the result using the formula, and breaks after setting the result.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are to compute the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\n The awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\n Important note: The initial total awesomeness is computed for the initial array, and then we update after each query.\n\n Insight:\n The total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be computed by:\n   total_aws = (number of contiguous subarrays) - (number of adjacent pairs (i, i+1) that are different, counted in every subarray that contains both)\n\n Why?\n Consider: \n   The awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 (if the entire segment is the same) plus the number of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1].\n   Actually, it is exactly: 1 + (number of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1]).\n\n Therefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays is:\n   = sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} [1 + (# of indices j in [l, r-1] with a[j] != a[j+1])]\n   = (number of subarrays) + sum_{j=1}^{n-1} [number of subarrays that include the adjacent pair (j, j+1) and for which a[j]!=a[j+1] contributes 1]\n\n The number of subarrays is T0 = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n For a fixed adjacent pair (j, j+1) (with j from 0 to n-2 in 0-indexed), the number of subarrays that include this pair is:\n   The subarray must start at any index from 0 to j, and end at any index from j+1 to n-1.\n   So, (j+1) * (n - j - 1)\n\n Therefore, if we let:\n   total_aws = T0 + sum_{j=0}^{n-2} [ (j+1)*(n-j-1) * I_{a[j] != a[j+1]} ]\n\n But wait: actually the formula for the awesomeness of a segment [l, r] is:\n   g(l, r) = 1 + (# of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1])\n\n So the total is:\n   = T0 + sum_{j} [ (j+1)*(n-j-1) * I_{a[j]!=a[j+1]} ]\n\n However, note that the above formula does not hold because the contribution of a break at j is 1 for every segment that includes j and j+1 and that break exists.\n\n But observe: the initial total_aws = T0 (if there are no breaks) is not correct. Actually, if there are no breaks, then every contiguous subarray has awesomeness 1? \n   Actually, no: the entire array is one block, but a subarray of length 1 has awesomeness 1, a subarray of length 2 has awesomeness 1, etc. So indeed the awesomeness of every contiguous subarray is 1, so total = T0.\n\n Now if we have a break at j, then every contiguous subarray that includes both j and j+1 will have an extra 1. Therefore, the total becomes T0 plus the number of breaks multiplied by the number of subarrays that include that break.\n\n However, note: the break at j only adds 1 to the awesomeness of a segment that includes both j and j+1. So the formula is:\n\n   total_aws = T0 + sum_{j=0}^{n-2} [ (j+1)*(n-j-1) * (1 if a[j]!=a[j+1] else 0) ]\n\n But wait: the example in the note: \n   n=5, array [1,2,2,4,5] -> answer=29.\n\n   T0 = 5*6//2 = 15.\n\n   Now, breaks at:\n      j0: a0=1, a1=2 -> break -> count: (0+1)*(5-0-1) = 1*4 = 4\n      j1: a1=2, a2=2 -> no break -> 0\n      j2: a2=2, a3=4 -> break -> (2+1)*(5-2-1) = 3*2 = 6\n      j3: a3=4, a4=5 -> break -> (3+1)*(5-3-1) = 4*1 = 4\n\n   Total = 15 + 4+0+6+4 = 29 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, we can maintain:\n   total_aws = T0 + sum_{j=0}^{n-2} [ (j+1)*(n-j-1) * (1 if a[j]!=a[j+1] else 0) ]\n\n How to update?\n   We are updating one element at position i (0-indexed). This update can affect at most two adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1).\n\n   We need to:\n     - Remove the contributions of the old breaks at positions i-1 and i (if they existed) and then add the contributions of the new breaks at these positions (if they exist after the update).\n\n   Steps for update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n     Let the current array be stored in `arr` (we are updating the i-th element to x).\n\n     We are going to:\n       1. For each adjacent pair that might change: positions i-1 (if i>=1) and i (if i < n-1).\n       2. For each of these positions j (which are i-1 and i) in the old array (before update), if the pair (arr[j], arr[j+1]) was a break (i.e., they were different), then we subtract (j+1)*(n-1-j) [but note: j is 0-indexed, so the j-th adjacent pair is between j and j+1, and the factor is (j+1)*(n-1-j) but note: j+1 in the factor is the number of starting points? Actually, j is the index of the first element of the pair. The factor for the break at j is (j+1)*(n-1-j) because:\n            starting points: 0 to j -> j+1 choices\n            ending points: j+1 to n-1 -> n-1-j choices.\n\n       3. Update the array: set arr[i] = x.\n\n       4. For the same adjacent pairs (i-1 and i), if now the pair is a break (different), then add (j+1)*(n-1-j).\n\n     However, note: the factor (j+1)*(n-1-j) for j (the index of the adjacent pair) is fixed for that pair.\n\n   But note: the adjacent pair at index j (0-indexed) is between arr[j] and arr[j+1]. So for j = i-1, we look at arr[i-1] and arr[i] (which is being updated). Similarly, for j = i, we look at arr[i] and arr[i+1].\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n     old_contrib = 0\n     if i >= 1: \n        j = i-1\n        if arr[j] != arr[i]:   # old break at j\n            old_contrib -= (j+1) * (n-1-j)   # but note: j is 0-indexed, so the factor is (j+1)*(n-1-j) as above.\n\n     if i < n-1:\n        j = i\n        if arr[i] != arr[i+1]: # old break at j\n            old_contrib -= (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n     Now update arr[i] = x.\n\n     new_contrib = 0\n     if i >= 1:\n        j = i-1\n        if arr[j] != x: \n            new_contrib += (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n     if i < n-1:\n        j = i\n        if x != arr[i+1]:\n            new_contrib += (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n     Then: curr_aws = curr_aws + old_contrib + new_contrib   [because we subtracted the old contributions and added the new ones]\n\n   However, note: the old_contrib was subtracted from the current total, and then we add the new_contrib. But wait: the current total (curr_aws) already includes the old breaks? \n\n   Actually, the initial total_aws we set at the beginning was computed by iterating the initial array. Then we update by:\n\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n   So the current aws passed in is the total including the old breaks. Therefore, we must subtract the old contributions and add the new ones.\n\n   But note: the old_contrib we computed above is negative? Actually, we set old_contrib to the negative of the contributions? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total_change = new_contrib - ( - old_contrib)   -> but that is not.\n\n   Actually, we did:\n\n        old_contrib = 0\n        if condition: then we subtract a positive value? \n\n   Let me rework:\n\n        We have current total T = T0 + sum_{j} [ factor(j) * I_j ]\n\n        We are going to update the array at position i. This affects the breaks at j=i-1 and j=i.\n\n        Let the current contributions of these two breaks be:\n            c_old1 = (if arr[i-1]!=arr[i] then (i) * (n-i) else 0)   [for j=i-1: j+1 = i, and n-1-j = n-1-(i-1)=n-i]\n            c_old2 = (if arr[i]!=arr[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i) else 0) [for j=i: j+1 = i+1, n-1-j = n-1-i]\n\n        Then we update the array: set arr[i]=x.\n\n        Then the new contributions are:\n            c_new1 = (if arr[i-1]!=x then (i)*(n-i) else 0)\n            c_new2 = (if x!=arr[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i) else 0)\n\n        Then the change in total_aws = (c_new1 + c_new2) - (c_old1 + c_old2)\n\n        So: curr_aws = curr_aws + (c_new1 + c_new2) - (c_old1 + c_old2)\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        change = 0\n\n        if i>=1:\n            j = i-1\n            old1 = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\n            new1 = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\n            change += (new1 - old1) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)   # which is (i) * (n-i)   [since j=i-1 -> j+1 = i, n-1-j = n-i]\n\n        if i < n-1:\n            j = i\n            old2 = 1 if arr[i] != arr[i+1] else 0\n            new2 = 1 if x != arr[i+1] else 0\n            change += (new2 - old2) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)   # which is (i+1)*(n-1-i)\n\n        Then: curr_aws = curr_aws + change\n\n   However, note: we are updating the array. We must update the array at position i to x. But the function update_awesomeness is passed the array `tar` (which is the current array) and we are to update it.\n\n   Therefore, we must update `tar[i] = x` in the function? But note: the function is called as:\n\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n   So we can update the array inside the function.\n\n   Steps in update_awesomeness:\n\n        change = 0\n        n = len(arr)\n\n        # For the adjacent pair at (i-1, i)\n        if i >= 1:\n            j = i-1\n            # current state: arr[j] and arr[i] (the old value at i)\n            old_val_i = arr[i]   # we are going to change it to x, so save the old value for comparison?\n            # But note: the array `arr` currently has the old value at i. We are going to update it to x at the end of the function? \n            # Actually, we must compute the old break conditions before updating the array.\n\n            # Check the old break at j (i-1, i)\n            if arr[j] != arr[i]:\n                # This break currently exists -> we are going to remove it if after update it becomes the same?\n                old_break1 = 1\n            else:\n                old_break1 = 0\n\n            # Now, after update: we will have arr[j] and x\n            if arr[j] != x:\n                new_break1 = 1\n            else:\n                new_break1 = 0\n\n            change += (new_break1 - old_break1) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n        # For the adjacent pair at (i, i+1)\n        if i < n-1:\n            j = i\n            old_val_i = arr[i]\n            if old_val_i != arr[i+1]:\n                old_break2 = 1\n            else:\n                old_break2 = 0\n\n            if x != arr[i+1]:\n                new_break2 = 1\n            else:\n                new_break2 = 0\n\n            change += (new_break2 - old_break2) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n        # Now update the array at position i to x\n        arr[i] = x\n\n        return curr_aws + change\n\n   However, note: the initial setup:\n\n        We have an array `arr` (the initial array) and we are storing it in `tar`? Actually, the initial array is read into `arr` and then we create `tar = [0]*n`? \n\n        But then we do:\n\n            for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n        This is initializing `tar` by updating each position with the initial value? But initially `tar` is all zeros. \n\n        We must change: we should initialize `tar` to the initial array? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ... an.\n\n        Then we have:\n\n            n, m = ...\n            arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n            tar = [0] * n   # this is a mistake? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n        This sets each element of `tar` to the initial value. But initially, the array `tar` is zeros. Then we update each position to the initial value. \n\n        However, the update_awesomeness function uses the current array to check adjacent pairs. At the time of the initial update, the array `tar` is being built. \n\n        For the first element i=0: \n            We update tar[0] = x (the initial value). Then we check:\n                adjacent pairs: \n                  i=0: \n                    i>=1? -> no.\n                    i<n-1? -> if n>1 then yes. Then we check: \n                         old state: tar[0] (which was 0) and tar[1] (which is still 0) -> 0 != 0? no -> old_break2=0.\n                         new state: x (the initial value) and tar[1] (0) -> if x != 0? but the initial value x might be non-zero? \n\n        This is messy. We should initialize `tar` to the initial array. \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the initial setup:\n\n            Instead of creating `tar = [0]*n`, we can set `tar = arr[:]`? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"after each query you need to calculate ...\"\n\n        And the initial array is given. Then we have m queries.\n\n        The initial total is computed by processing the initial array.\n\n        How about we do:\n\n            tar = arr[:]   # make a copy\n\n        Then we can compute the initial total_aws as:\n\n            T0 = n*(n+1)//2\n            Then we add the contributions of the breaks in the initial array.\n\n        But the problem does: \n            for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n        This would update the array from zeros to the initial array? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the initial update by computing the initial total_aws without using the update function? \n\n        However, the update function is designed to update from the old value to the new value. In the initial setup, the old value is 0 and the new value is the initial value. \n\n        But the adjacent pairs in the initial array are the ones we want. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            total_aws = T0\n            for j in range(n-1):\n                if arr[j] != arr[j+1]:\n                    total_aws += (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n        Then we don't need the initial update_awesomeness calls? \n\n        But the code provided does:\n\n            for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n        So we must make the update_awesomeness function work for the initial setup.\n\n        How? \n\n          In the initial setup, the array `tar` is initially [0,0,...,0]. Then we update each position to the initial value.\n\n          The update at position i: \n            old value = 0, new value = x (the initial value)\n\n          This update will affect adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\n          But note: the adjacent pairs that are affected are the ones that involve i. \n\n          However, the initial array `tar` is being built sequentially? \n\n          For i=0: \n            We update index0 from 0 to x0.\n            Then we check:\n                left: i>=1 -> no.\n                right: i<n-1 -> if n>1 then yes. Then we compare: \n                    old: tar[0] (0) and tar[1] (0) -> 0==0 -> no break.\n                    new: x0 and tar[1] (0) -> if x0 != 0 -> break? \n\n          But the initial value at index1 is still 0. So if x0 != 0, then we add a break at j=0? \n\n          Then for i=1:\n            We update index1 from 0 to x1.\n            Then we check:\n                left: j=0: compare tar[0] (x0) and tar[1] (old value 0) -> if x0 != 0 -> break? Then we remove that break? \n                then update to x1: then left: x0 and x1 -> if x0 != x1 then break? \n                right: if n>2, then compare x1 and tar[2] (0) -> if x1 != 0 -> break? \n\n          This is messy because the array is being built from zeros to the initial array. \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the initial setup to set `tar` to the initial array and then compute the initial total_aws by the formula.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to change the provided code? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\" and we are to output the missing code. The provided code for program1.py is:\n\n            def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            INPUT = [*open(0)]\n\n            n, m = map(int, INPUT[0].split())\n            arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n            tar = [0] * n\n            aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n\n            for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n            for line in INPUT[2:]:\n                i, x = map(int, line.split())\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i - 1, x, aws)\n                print(aws)\n\n        We are only to complete the function update_awesomeness? \n\n        Then we must make the function work for the initial setup. \n\n        How? \n\n          In the initial setup, the array `tar` is initially zeros. Then we update each position to the initial value. \n\n          The update at position i: \n            old value = 0, new value = x.\n\n          We must consider the adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\n          For the left adjacent pair (i-1, i): \n            Before update: \n                tar[i-1] is the value we set in a previous update (if i>=1) or 0 if we haven't updated? Actually, we update in order from i=0 to n-1. \n                So for i>=1, the element at i-1 has been updated to the initial value of arr[i-1]. \n            Therefore, the old state for the left adjacent pair: \n                left element = arr[i-1] (if i>=1) and the current element = 0 (which is the old value at i).\n            After update: \n                left element = arr[i-1] and the current element = x (the initial value at i).\n\n          Similarly, for the right adjacent pair (i, i+1):\n            Before update: \n                current element = 0, and the next element = 0 (because we haven't updated i+1 yet) -> so they are equal? \n            After update: \n                current element = x, and the next element = 0 -> so they are different? \n\n          But wait: the next element will be updated later. So the break at (i, i+1) in the initial setup is temporary? \n\n          Actually, the total_aws we are building is the total for the entire array? \n\n          However, the update_awesomeness function is called for each update. The initial updates are the building of the array. \n\n          But the problem: the initial array is given. We are to compute the initial total_aws for the initial array. \n\n          The provided code does:\n\n            aws = (n*(n+1))//2   [which is T0]\n\n            then for each i, we update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n          This means that after the last update (i=n-1), we have the total_aws for the initial array.\n\n          However, the intermediate updates are not the entire array? \n\n          But note: the update_awesomeness function is designed to update the array and adjust the total_aws. \n\n          The function must be able to handle the fact that the array is being built from zeros to the initial array. \n\n          How? \n\n            The adjacent pairs that we consider are only the ones that have been updated? \n\n          Actually, the entire array is updated in order. So when updating index i, the indices 0 to i-1 have been updated to the initial values, and indices i to n-1 are still 0.\n\n          Therefore, the adjacent pairs we consider:\n\n            (i-1, i): \n                old: (arr[i-1], 0) -> if arr[i-1] != 0, then break? \n                new: (arr[i-1], x) -> if arr[i-1] != x, then break? \n\n            (i, i+1):\n                old: (0, 0) -> no break.\n                new: (x, 0) -> if x != 0, then break? \n\n          But note: the initial array values are at least 1 (according to input: 1<=a_i<=10^9). So x is at least 1. Therefore, the new break at (i, i+1) will always be added? \n\n          Then when we update the next index i+1, we will remove the break at (i, i+1) and then set the new break at (i, i+1) to the correct state? \n\n          Example: n=2, initial array [1,2]\n\n          Step0: i=0, update tar[0] from 0 to 1.\n            left: i>=1? no.\n            right: i=0 < n-1 (which is 1) -> yes.\n                old: (0,0) -> no break -> old_break2=0.\n                new: (1,0) -> break -> new_break2=1.\n                change = (1-0) * (0+1)*(n-1-0) = 1 * 1 * (2-1) = 1.\n                aws becomes 3 (T0=2*3//2=3) -> 3+1=4? \n\n          Then step1: i=1, update tar[1] from 0 to 2.\n            left: i=1>=1 -> yes, j=0: \n                old: (tar[0]=1, tar[1]=0) -> 1!=0 -> break -> old_break1=1.\n                new: (1,2) -> break -> new_break1=1.\n                change1 = (1-1)*... = 0.\n            right: i=1 < n-1? n-1=1 -> no.\n            change=0.\n            aws remains 4.\n\n          But the correct total_aws for [1,2] is:\n            [1]:1, [2]:1, [1,2]:2 -> total=4. So it matches.\n\n          Now, what if the initial array is [1,1]? \n            Step0: i=0: \n                right: (1,0) -> break -> change=1 -> aws=3+1=4.\n            Step1: i=1:\n                left: (1,0) -> break -> old_break1=1; then (1,1) -> no break -> new_break1=0 -> change1 = (0-1)* (0+1)*(n-1-0) = -1 * 1 * (2-1) = -1.\n                aws=4-1=3.\n\n            The correct total: \n                [1]:1, [1]:1, [1,1]:1 -> total=3. \n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we can write the update_awesomeness function as described.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We assume the array `arr` is the current array (which we are updating). We are updating the element at index i to x.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          change = 0\n          n = len(arr)\n\n          # For the left adjacent pair (i-1, i)\n          if i >= 1:\n              j = i-1\n              # The current state (before update) for the pair (j, i): arr[j] and arr[i]\n              old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\n              # After update: the pair becomes (arr[j], x)\n              new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\n              change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n          # For the right adjacent pair (i, i+1)\n          if i < n-1:\n              j = i\n              old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[i+1] else 0\n              new_break = 1 if x != arr[i+1] else 0\n              change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n          # Update the array at position i to x\n          arr[i] = x\n\n          return curr_aws + change\n\n   But note: the factor for the left adjacent pair: \n        j = i-1 -> the factor is (j+1) * (n-1-j) = i * (n - i)   [because j+1 = i, and n-1-j = n-1 - (i-1) = n-i]\n\n   For the right adjacent pair:\n        j = i -> factor = (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Let's test with the example: \n        n=5, initial array: [1,2,2,4,5] -> then we update? Actually, the initial array is built by 5 updates.\n\n        We start with tar = [0,0,0,0,0] and aws = 15.\n\n        Step0: i=0, x=1.\n            left: i>=1? no.\n            right: i<4 -> yes: j=0 -> factor = (0+1)*(5-1-0)=1*4=4.\n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0 -> 0\n                new_break: (1,0) -> 1 -> 1\n                change = 4\n                aws = 15+4 = 19.\n\n        Step1: i=1, x=2.\n            left: i=1>=1 -> j=0: \n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0? but wait: at this point, the array is: [1,0,0,0,0] -> so at j=0: (1,0) -> 1 -> old_break=1.\n                new_break: (1,2) -> 1 -> 1 -> change1 = 0.\n            right: i=1<4 -> j=1: factor = (1+1)*(5-1-1)=2*3=6.\n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0 -> 0\n                new_break: (2,0) -> 1 -> 1\n                change2 = 6\n                total change=6 -> aws=19+6=25.\n\n        Step2: i=2, x=2.\n            left: i=2>=1 -> j=1: \n                old_break: (2,0) -> 1 -> 1   [because the array at step2 before update: [1,2,0,0,0] -> at j=1: (2,0) -> break]\n                new_break: (2,2) -> 0 -> 0\n                change1 = (0-1)* (1+1)*(5-1-1) = -1 * 2*3 = -6.\n            right: i=2<4 -> j=2: factor = (2+1)*(5-1-2)=3*2=6.\n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0\n                new_break: (2,0) -> 1\n                change2 = 6\n                total change = -6+6=0 -> aws=25.\n\n        Step3: i=3, x=4.\n            left: i=3>=1 -> j=2: \n                old_break: (2,0) -> 1   [array: [1,2,2,0,0] -> at j=2: (2,0) -> break]\n                new_break: (2,4) -> 1 -> 0? no, 2!=4 -> 1 -> so change1 = (1-1)*...=0.\n            right: j=3: factor = (3+1)*(5-1-3)=4*1=4.\n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0\n                new_break: (4,0) -> 1\n                change2 = 4\n                aws=25+4=29.\n\n        Step4: i=4, x=5.\n            left: i=4>=1 -> j=3: \n                old_break: (0,0) -> 0? but the array before update: [1,2,2,4,0] -> at j=3: (4,0) -> break -> 1.\n                new_break: (4,5) -> 1 -> 1 -> change1=0.\n            right: i=4<4? no.\n            aws=29.\n\n        So the initial total_aws=29 -> matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the function accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the array `arr` is passed and we are updating it. We must update the array at the end.\n\n   Code for update_awesomeness:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            n = len(arr)\n            change = 0\n            # left adjacent pair: (i-1, i)\n            if i >= 1:\n                j = i-1\n                # Before update: the pair is (arr[j], arr[i])\n                old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\n                # After update: the pair becomes (arr[j], x)\n                new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\n                change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n            # right adjacent pair: (i, i+1)\n            if i < n-1:\n                j = i\n                old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\n                new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\n                change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n\n            # update the array at position i\n            arr[i] = x\n            return curr_aws + change\n\n   But note: in the left adjacent pair, we use the current value of arr[i] (the old value) and then we update it to x. \n        However, in the right adjacent pair, we use the old value at arr[i] (which is the same as the one we used in the left) and then we update it to x.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the array `arr` is being updated in the function. We do the left adjacent pair first, then the right, then update the array.\n\n   But the left adjacent pair uses the old value at i, and the right adjacent pair also uses the old value at i. Then we update.\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Let's test with the example update: \n        After the initial array [1,2,2,4,5] (so after the 5 updates, we have total_aws=29).\n\n        Then we get a query: i=3, x=2 (so change the 4 to 2). \n\n        Before update: arr[3]=4, and the array is [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n        Left adjacent pair: i=3 -> j=2: \n            old_break: (arr[2]=2, arr[3]=4) -> 2!=4 -> 1.\n            new_break: (2,2) -> 0 -> so change1 = (0-1)* (2+1)*(5-1-2) = -1 * 3 * 2 = -6.\n\n        Right adjacent pair: i=3 -> j=3: \n            old_break: (4,5) -> 1.\n            new_break: (2,5) -> 1 -> change2 = 0.\n\n        Then update arr[3]=2 -> the array becomes [1,2,2,2,5].\n\n        Then total_aws = 29 -6 = 23.\n\n        Now, what is the correct total_aws for [1,2,2,2,5]?\n\n          We can compute by the formula: \n            T0 = 15.\n            Breaks: \n                j0: (1,2) -> break -> 1 * 4 = 4\n                j1: (2,2) -> no break -> 0\n                j2: (2,2) -> no break -> 0\n                j3: (2,5) -> break -> 4 * 1 = 4\n            total = 15+4+4 = 23.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the function as above.\n\n   But note: the problem says the array is 1-indexed in the input. The update query: \"i\" is given (1-indexed) and we convert to 0-indexed by i-1 in the main loop.\n\n   The function update_awesomeness is called with i (0-indexed).\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Now, for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n          We have an array a of n integers. We can do:\n            Operation1: clone any existing array.\n            Operation2: swap two elements from any two copies (or same) at any positions.\n\n          We want the minimal number of operations to obtain at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n        Example: \n          [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> answer=6? (as per the note)\n\n        How to solve?\n\n          Note: We start with one copy. We can do:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> then we have two copies. Then we can swap elements arbitrarily (any two elements from any two arrays) to try to make one array all equal.\n\n          We are allowed to do any number of swaps? But we want minimal operations.\n\n          Operation1 counts as one operation, and each swap counts as one operation.\n\n          We are to output the minimal total operations.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          We want to create one array with all elements equal to some value, say x.\n\n          How do we get x? We can only use the numbers that are present in the initial array (because we can only swap existing numbers).\n\n          Let the frequency of x be f. Then we have f copies of x in the entire multiset (across all arrays). \n\n          How many arrays do we need? \n            We need at least one array that has n copies of x. \n\n          How do we get n copies of x? \n            We must gather n copies of x. But initially we have f copies. \n\n          How to get more copies? \n            We can clone the arrays arbitrarily. Each clone operation gives one more array. Then we can swap elements arbitrarily.\n\n          The key: we can swap elements arbitrarily. So we can think of the entire set of arrays as a multiset of elements. \n\n          We start with one array: so we have one copy of each element. Then we do k clone operations: then we have k+1 arrays, and the total number of elements is (k+1)*n.\n\n          We want to form one array that has n copies of x. We can use the entire multiset to form the arrays arbitrarily. \n\n          Conditions:\n            - We must have at least n copies of x to form one array of n x's.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to leave the other arrays in any state. \n\n          Therefore, the minimal k (number of clone operations) must be such that:\n\n            (k+1) * (number of times x appears in the initial array) >= n   ?\n\n          However, we can also use other numbers? But we are swapping: we can take an x from any array and put it in the target array. \n\n          So the total number of x's available is f * (k+1) [if we clone the initial array k times, then we have k+1 copies of the initial array, so k+1 copies of each element?]\n\n          Actually, when we clone, we get an exact copy. So if the initial array has f copies of x, then after k clones we have (k+1)*f copies of x.\n\n          We need at least n copies of x to fill the target array. Therefore, we require:\n\n            (k+1)*f >= n   =>   k >= ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n          Then the total operations = k (for cloning) + (number of swaps).\n\n          How many swaps? \n\n          Note: we are going to form the target array. We start with one array (which we are going to turn into the target). We can use the other arrays as reservoirs.\n\n          We need to put n copies of x in the target array. Initially, the target array has some number of x's. Let the initial count of x in the target array be c0 (which is the count in the initial array? but note: we are free to choose which array becomes the target). Actually, we can choose any array to be the target. \n\n          However, we are going to do swaps. Each swap can bring one x from another array to the target, or remove a non-x from the target to somewhere else.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We need to have n x's in the target. Initially, the target array has some x's (say t0). Then we need n - t0 more x's. \n\n          How do we get an x from another array? We can swap an x from another array with a non-x in the target. This swap:\n            - removes one non-x from the target and adds one x to the target.\n\n          Also, we can swap an x from the target with a non-x in the target? That would be counterproductive.\n\n          Alternatively, we can swap a non-x in the target with an x in a non-target array. This is one swap and it increases the count of x in the target by 1.\n\n          Therefore, the number of swaps required is (n - t0). \n\n          But note: we can also use the x's that are already in the target? \n\n          Actually, we don't need to swap out the x's that are already in the target. We only need to remove the non-x's and replace them by x's. \n\n          However, we can also swap two non-x's? That doesn't help. \n\n          So the minimal number of swaps is the number of non-x's in the target array? \n\n          But we can choose the target array arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, we can choose any array to be the target. So we can choose the array that has the most x's? \n\n          But note: we are going to form one array of all x's. We are free to choose which array becomes the target. \n\n          Therefore, we can choose the array that initially has the most x's to be the target. Then the number of swaps needed is (n - max_frequency_in_an_array?).\n\n          However, wait: initially, every array (after cloning) is a copy of the initial array. So every array has the same frequency of x: f. \n\n          But then we do swaps. \n\n          Actually, we are going to use the entire multiset of (k+1)*n elements. We are going to assign one array to be the target and we want it to have n x's. \n\n          The total number of x's available is (k+1)*f. \n\n          The number of x's that are not in the target array is (k+1)*f - t0, where t0 is the number of x's in the target array. But we can choose the target array arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, we can choose which array becomes the target. We can choose the one that has the most x's? But all arrays are identical initially. \n\n          Therefore, initially every array has f x's. So we set one array as the target: it has f x's. Then we need to bring n - f x's from the other arrays. \n\n          But note: we can also take x's from the target array? No, because we are going to use the target array: we don't want to remove x's from it. \n\n          Actually, we can rearrange arbitrarily. We are going to use the entire multiset. \n\n          The target array must have n x's. The total available x's is (k+1)*f. Therefore, we require (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n          Then the number of swaps: \n            We need to move x's from the non-target arrays to the target. But also, we need to move the non-x's out of the target. \n\n          How many non-x's are in the target? Initially, the target has n - f non-x's. \n\n          We can swap a non-x from the target with an x from a non-target. This swap removes one non-x from the target and adds one x to the target. \n\n          Therefore, we need exactly (n - f) swaps: because we need to remove all non-x's from the target and replace them by x's. \n\n          But note: we might have more than one x in the non-target arrays? \n\n          However, each swap reduces the non-x's in the target by one and increases the x's in the target by one. \n\n          Therefore, the number of swaps is (n - f).\n\n          Then the total operations = k (clone operations) + (n - f) (swaps).\n\n          And k = ceil(n/f) - 1, because we require (k+1)*f >= n -> k >= ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n          But note: k must be an integer and we take the minimal k.\n\n          Therefore, total_ops = (ceil(n/f) - 1) + (n - f)\n\n          However, let's test with the example:\n\n            Example1: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, and we choose x=0? \n                frequency of 0: f=2.\n                k = ceil(6/2) - 1 = ceil(3) - 1 = 3-1 = 2.\n                swaps = 6-2 = 4.\n                total_ops = 2+4 = 6 -> matches.\n\n            Example2: [0,0,0] -> n=3, choose x=0: f=3.\n                k = ceil(3/3)-1 = 1-1=0.\n                swaps = 3-3=0 -> total_ops=0 -> matches.\n\n            Example3: [1,1,2,2] -> n=4, if we choose x=1: f=2.\n                k = ceil(4/2)-1 = 2-1=1.\n                swaps = 4-2=2 -> total_ops=3.\n\n            But what if we choose x=2? same: f=2 -> total_ops=3.\n\n            How to do it? \n                Start: [1,1,2,2]\n                Clone: now two copies: [1,1,2,2] and [1,1,2,2]\n                Then swap: \n                    swap the 2 at index2 of the first array with the 1 at index0 of the second array -> \n                        first: [1,1,1,2] -> not all equal.\n                        second: [2,1,2,2] -> not all equal.\n                Then swap: swap the 2 at index3 of the first array with the 1 at index1 of the second array? \n                        first: [1,1,1,1] -> done.\n\n                Total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            Example4: [1,2,3,4] -> n=4, f=1 for any x.\n                k = ceil(4/1)-1 = 4-1=3.\n                swaps = 4-1=3.\n                total_ops=6.\n\n            How to do?\n                We need 3 clones: so 4 arrays total.\n                We choose x=1: we need 4 ones. There are 4 ones (one in each array). \n                Then we swap: \n                  We have the target array: initially [1,2,3,4]. We want to make it [1,1,1,1].\n                  We can swap:\n                    swap the 2 in the target with a 1 from array2: then target becomes [1,1,3,4] -> one swap.\n                    swap the 3 in the target with a 1 from array3: then target becomes [1,1,1,4] -> two swaps.\n                    swap the 4 in the target with a 1 from array4: then target becomes [1,1,1,1] -> three swaps.\n\n                Total: 3 clones + 3 swaps = 6.\n\n          But wait: is there a better way? \n\n          However, note: we can also swap between non-target arrays? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: we can swap any two elements from any two arrays. So we can also build the target array by gathering ones from the other arrays without necessarily swapping the non-ones out? \n\n          But the target array initially has one one and three non-ones. We need to remove the three non-ones and replace them by ones. The ones are in the other arrays. \n\n          How do we get a one into the target? We must swap it with a non-one in the target? \n\n          Therefore, we need one swap per non-one in the target. \n\n          So the formula holds.\n\n          But note: what if we choose a different x? \n\n          We must choose x to minimize the total operations? \n\n          The total operations for a candidate x is: \n                k = ceil(n/f) - 1\n                swaps = n - f\n                total = ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f\n\n          Therefore, we must choose x that minimizes: ceil(n/f) + n - f - 1.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not say we can choose x arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, we are free to choose which value to make the array equal to? \n\n          So we iterate over the distinct numbers? \n\n          But note: the array can have negative numbers? The input says: -10^9<=a_i<=10^9.\n\n          How to compute f? We can use a frequency map.\n\n          However, the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n            for each test case:\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                freq = Counter(a)\n                ans = a big number\n                for f in freq.values():\n                    candidate = ( (n + f - 1) // f - 1 ) + (n - f)   # because ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f\n                    ans = min(ans, candidate)\n\n            But wait: what if there are multiple distinct numbers? We must consider each distinct number that appears.\n\n          However, note: the formula: ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f? \n\n          Example: n=6, f=2: (6+2-1)//2 = 7//2=3 -> then candidate = 3-1 + (6-2)=2+4=6.\n\n          Example: n=4, f=1: (4+1-1)//1=4 -> candidate=4-1+3=6.\n\n          Example: n=4, f=2: (4+2-1)//2=5//2=2 -> candidate=2-1+2=3.\n\n          But note: what if n is divisible by f? \n            n=4, f=4: ceil(4/4)=1 -> candidate = 1-1 + (4-4)=0.\n\n          So the formula for ceil(n/f) is: (n-1)//f + 1? \n            Actually: \n                ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f   (integer division)\n\n          Therefore, candidate = (n+f-1)//f - 1 + n - f = (n+f-1)//f + n - f - 1.\n\n          But note: we must consider that we cannot use a number that does not appear enough? \n\n          However, we are iterating over the distinct numbers that appear. \n\n          But what if there is no x that appears at least once? Then we skip? But every element appears at least once.\n\n          However, what if we choose a number that does not appear in the array? Then we cannot form an array of that number. So we only consider numbers that appear.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"create at least one copy where all elements are equal\" -> so we can choose any value? But we are constrained by the available numbers.\n\n          Therefore, we only consider x that appears in the array.\n\n          But wait: what if we choose a number that does not appear? Then we have 0 copies. Then we require (k+1)*0>=n -> impossible. So we skip.\n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n            ans = a big number (like 10**18)\n            for count in freq.values():\n                k = (n + count - 1) // count - 1   # = ceil(n/count)-1\n                swaps = n - count\n                total_ops = k + swaps\n                if total_ops < ans:\n                    ans = total_ops\n\n          Then output ans.\n\n          However, let's test with the example from the note: \n                [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, frequencies: \n                    0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1.\n\n                For 0: k = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, swaps=4 -> total=6.\n                For 1: k = ceil(6/1)-1=6-1=5, swaps=5 -> total=10.\n                For 3: same as 0 -> 6.\n                For 7: same as 1 -> 10.\n\n                So the minimal is 6.\n\n          But the note says 6 operations.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"For each test case output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of operations\"\n\n          But wait: what if we can do better by not using the entire multiset? \n\n          Actually, the above formula is derived from the fact that we must have at least n copies of x. \n\n          But note: we can also use the same element multiple times in the target? \n\n          However, we are constrained by the total available copies.\n\n          Therefore, the above candidate is the minimal for a fixed x.\n\n          But note: the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 10^5. The distinct numbers in one test case can be up to n, but the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is <= 10^5. So we can iterate over distinct numbers.\n\n          However, what if the array has many distinct numbers? The frequency count for each distinct number is at least 1, and the sum of frequencies is n. So the distinct numbers in one test case can be up to n, but the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the worst-case one test case has n=10^5, and then distinct numbers 10^5. Then we iterate 10^5 times per test case? \n\n          But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So the number of test cases t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of the lengths of the arrays is <=10^5. Therefore, the worst-case is one test case with n=10^5, and then we iterate 10^5 distinct numbers? \n\n          Actually, the distinct numbers in one test case: the maximum distinct numbers is n, but the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n          How? \n\n            The input: \n                t test cases, and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n            Therefore, the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n          Actually, no: the distinct numbers in one test case can be up to n, and the sum of n is 10^5, so the total distinct numbers over test cases is at most 10^5? \n\n          But note: the distinct numbers in one test case: if one test case has n=10^5, then distinct numbers can be 10^5. Then the total distinct numbers over test cases is 10^5? \n\n          Actually, the sum of n is 10^5, so the maximum n for one test case is 10^5, but then there is only one test case. \n\n          Therefore, worst-case we have one test case with n=10^5, and we iterate over 10^5 distinct numbers -> O(n) per test case -> acceptable.\n\n          However, we can optimize by only iterating over the distinct frequencies? \n\n          But the distinct frequencies might be many. \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the candidate value for a frequency f is:\n\n                total_ops = ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f\n\n          And we want the minimum over f in the set of frequencies that appear.\n\n          But note: the same frequency might appear for multiple distinct numbers, but we only need to compute once per distinct frequency? \n\n          Actually, the candidate only depends on f (the frequency). So we can iterate over distinct frequencies? \n\n          However, the distinct frequencies might be O(sqrt(n))? \n\n          But worst-case the distinct frequencies can be O(n). \n\n          But the total n over test cases is 10^5, so worst-case one test case with n=10^5, and distinct frequencies: the frequencies are the counts of distinct numbers. The distinct frequencies are the distinct values in the frequency map. The number of distinct frequencies is at most O(sqrt(n))? \n\n          Actually, the distinct frequencies are the distinct divisors? Not exactly. \n\n          But we can simply iterate over the distinct frequencies by:\n\n                freqs = set(freq.values())\n\n          Then for each f in freqs, compute candidate = (n+f-1)//f - 1 + n - f.\n\n          Then ans = min(candidate for f in freqs)\n\n          However, note: what if the same frequency f appears for multiple numbers? Then we only compute once.\n\n          But the candidate value only depends on f. \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            freqs = set(freq.values())\n            ans = 10**18\n            for f in freqs:\n                k = (n + f - 1) // f - 1\n                swaps = n - f\n                total_ops = k + swaps\n                if total_ops < ans:\n                    ans = total_ops\n\n          But wait: what if there is a frequency that is 0? We skip because we are iterating the set of frequencies that appear, and they are at least 1.\n\n          However, what if n is large and f is 1? Then k = (n+1-1)//1 - 1 = n-1, and swaps = n-1, total_ops = 2*(n-1). \n\n          But we can also consider: what if we choose a number that appears more than once? \n\n          But we are iterating over all frequencies that appear.\n\n          Therefore, we output the minimal total_ops.\n\n          However, let's test with the example: [1,2,3,4] -> n=4, frequencies: [1,1,1,1] -> distinct frequency: {1}. \n                candidate = (4+1-1)//1 - 1 + 4-1 = 4-1+3 = 6.\n\n          But the example: [0,0,0] -> distinct frequency: {3}. \n                candidate = (3+3-1)//3 - 1 + 3-3 = (5//3) - 1 + 0 = 1-1+0=0.\n\n          But what if we have [1,1,2,2,3,3]? n=6, distinct frequencies: {2} (if each appears twice) or {2,2,2} -> distinct frequency set {2}. \n                candidate = (6+2-1)//2 - 1 + 6-2 = (7//2) - 1 + 4 = 3-1+4=6.\n\n          How to do? \n                We choose x=1: \n                  k = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2 -> so we do 2 clones -> total arrays=3.\n                  swaps: 6-2=4.\n                  total_ops=6.\n\n          But is there a better way? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Operation1: clone -> 2 arrays.\n            Operation2: swap the 2 at index2 of array1 with the 1 at index0 of array2? -> then array1: [1,1,1,2,3,3] -> not done.\n            Then Operation1: clone array1 -> 3 arrays.\n            Then swap: ... \n\n          But the formula gives 6.\n\n          However, note: the problem says: minimal number of operations. \n\n          But wait: the note for the example [0,1,3,3,7,0] says 6 operations. \n\n          Therefore, we output the candidate.\n\n          But note: what if we choose a frequency that does not appear? We are iterating only the frequencies that appear.\n\n          However, one more issue: what if the frequency f is 0? Then we skip. But we are iterating the frequencies that appear, and they are at least 1.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            # The next 2*t lines: for each test case, one integer n and then a list of n integers.\n\n            # But the provided code: \n            #   for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            #       n=len(a:=a.split()); m=max(Counter(a).values()); r=0\n            #       while m<n:\n            #           # TODO\n            #       print(r)\n\n          The provided code for program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n          This code is not complete. We are to complete the while loop.\n\n          How does the provided code work?\n\n            It reads all lines, then skips the first two lines? Actually, the first line is t, then the next t test cases: each test case has two lines: the first is n, the second is the array.\n\n            [*open(0)][2::2] -> starting from index2 (so the third line) and then every two lines: so the array lines (the second line of each test case).\n\n            Then for each array line a, it splits the line and sets n to the length of the split list (which is the n of the test case). Then it computes m = max frequency of the array (by counting the string values). Then r=0, and then a while loop: while m<n, do something.\n\n          But the problem: the minimal operations might be 0? Then we skip the while loop and output 0.\n\n          However, the example: [0,0,0] -> m=3, n=3 -> skip while -> output 0.\n\n          But the example [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (because the max frequency is 2? for 0 and 3) -> then we enter the while loop.\n\n          How to compute the minimal operations? \n\n          We have derived: \n                total_ops = min_{f in frequencies} { ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f }\n\n          But the provided code does not compute this. \n\n          How can we compute it without iterating over distinct frequencies? \n\n          The provided code only uses m = max frequency. \n\n          Why max frequency? \n\n          Note: the candidate for the number with the highest frequency f_max:\n\n                total_ops = ceil(n/f_max) - 1 + n - f_max\n\n          But is this the minimal? \n\n          Example: [1,1,2,2] -> n=4, f_max=2 -> candidate= ceil(4/2)-1+4-2 = 2-1+2=3.\n\n          But if we choose a number with frequency 1: candidate= ceil(4/1)-1+4-1=4-1+3=6.\n\n          So the minimal candidate is 3, and it is achieved by the max frequency.\n\n          Why? \n\n          The function ceil(n/f) is decreasing in f, and n-f is decreasing in f? \n\n          Actually, as f increases, ceil(n/f) decreases and n-f decreases. Therefore, the minimal candidate is achieved at the maximum frequency.\n\n          Proof sketch:\n\n            Let F(f) = ceil(n/f) + n - f - 1.\n\n            We want to minimize F(f) for f in the set of frequencies that appear.\n\n            Since f is at most the maximum frequency, and the maximum frequency is the largest f, then F(f) is minimized at the maximum frequency? \n\n            Let f1 < f2. Then:\n\n                ceil(n/f1) >= ceil(n/f2)   [because f1<f2 => n/f1 > n/f2 => ceil(n/f1)>=ceil(n/f2)]\n                and n-f1 > n-f2.\n\n            Therefore, F(f1) = ceil(n/f1)+n-f1-1 > ceil(n/f2)+n-f2-1 = F(f2).\n\n            So F(f) is strictly decreasing in f? \n\n            Example: n=6, f1=1: F(1)=ceil(6/1)+6-1-1=6+4=10.\n                     f2=2: F(2)=ceil(6/2)+6-2-1=3+3=6.\n                     f3=3: F(3)=ceil(6/3)+6-3-1=2+2=4.\n                     f4=6: F(6)=ceil(6/6)+6-6-1=1-1=0.\n\n            So indeed, the larger the frequency, the smaller the F(f).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal candidate is achieved at the maximum frequency.\n\n          Then we can compute:\n\n                total_ops = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m   [where m = max frequency]\n\n          But note: the provided code has:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO\n\n          And then it prints r.\n\n          How to compute without a loop? \n\n          We can set:\n\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n\n          But wait: the while condition is m<n, meaning that if m==n, we skip. But if m==n, then the array is constant -> 0 operations.\n\n          So:\n\n            if m==n: r=0\n            else: r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n\n          But the provided code does:\n\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # we do something and then break? or we do multiple things?\n\n          However, the problem says: output the minimal number of operations. \n\n          Therefore, we can break out of the loop by setting r to the value and then break? \n\n          But the while loop condition is m<n, and we don't change m or n in the loop. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n\n          and then break? \n\n          But the while loop is set to run while m<n. We only need to run once? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          But the problem says: complete the code. \n\n          We can write:\n\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          However, the while loop condition is m<n, and we break in the first iteration. \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the while loop? \n\n          But the problem says: complete the while loop.\n\n          How about:\n\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          But note: the problem says \"complete the code\", and the while loop body is missing.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n                r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          However, what if we don't break? Then it would be an infinite loop. \n\n          So we break.\n\n          But the problem says: the minimal number of operations. \n\n          Therefore, the completed code for program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = len(a := a.split())\n                m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                r = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n                    break   # to break the while loop after one iteration\n                print(r)\n\n          But wait: what if we don't break? Then the while loop would run again? But m and n are unchanged, so it would run infinitely. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                if m < n:\n                    r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n                else:\n                    r = 0\n\n          But the provided code sets r=0 and then the while loop runs only if m<n. \n\n          We can do without break? \n\n          Actually, we can set:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + n - m\n                    m = n   # to break the loop? \n\n          But that would be more operations. \n\n          Alternatively, we can simply break.\n\n          But the problem says: \"complete the code\", and we are allowed to output the missing code.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n                r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the while loop.\n\n          But the while loop body is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are to replace the TODO with two lines? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          And the output format is json: { \"program1\": \"...\", \"program2\": \"...\" }\n\n          For program2, we output the two lines? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do it in one line? \n\n          How about:\n\n                r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m; break\n\n          But the problem does not specify the style.\n\n          However, the provided code uses multiple lines. \n\n          We output the two lines.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the block that is missing. \n\n          For program2, the missing code is the body of the while loop.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n                r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n          But wait: what if we have multiple test cases? The break breaks the while loop, then we move to the next test case.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the array elements are integers, but the input is read as strings. The frequency is computed by the string representation. \n\n   But the array can have negative numbers? Then the string representation of negative numbers is with a minus sign. \n\n   Example: ['-1','-1','1'] -> then the frequency of '-1' is 2, and '1' is 1. \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we have the solutions.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        program1.py: \n            We complete the function update_awesomeness as:\n\n                n = len(arr)\n                change = 0\n                if i >= 1:\n                    j = i-1\n                    old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\n                    new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\n                    change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n                if i < n-1:\n                    j = i\n                    old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\n                    new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\n                    change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\n                arr[i] = x\n                return curr_aws + change\n\n        program2.py:\n            We complete the while loop body as:\n\n                r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\n                break\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so for program1 we output the entire function body? \n\n   Actually, the function is already defined. We are to complete the TODO part. The TODO part is the entire function body? \n\n   The provided function:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with the code above? \n\n   But the function must return the updated curr_aws.\n\n   Therefore, we output the entire function body (without the function definition) for program1? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n   For program1, the missing code is the body of the function.\n\n   Similarly, for program2, the missing code is the body of the while loop.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        program1: \n            \"n = len(arr)\\n    change = 0\\n    if i >= 1:\\n        j = i-1\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        j = i\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    return curr_aws + change\"\n\n        program2:\n            \"r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n   But note: the indentation. The function body in program1 should be indented. We use 4 spaces per level? \n\n   The provided code in program1: the function body is indented by 4 spaces. The if statements are indented by 8 spaces? \n\n   We output the code as a string with the same level of indentation? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not specify, but we assume the code is inserted as is.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the code without extra indentation? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n   We output the code that would replace the TODO.\n\n   For program1, the entire function body (without the def line) is the missing code.\n\n   For program2, the two lines for the while loop body are the missing code.\n\n   Therefore, we write the json.\n\n   Note: the string must be escaped? \n\n   We output the raw string.\n\n   But the problem says: output the json.\n\n   Example output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    n = len(arr)\\n    change = 0\\n    if i >= 1:\\n        j = i-1\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        j = i\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    return curr_aws + change\",\n            \"program2\": \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 code: the while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n   The provided code:\n\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to replace the TODO with two lines that are indented by 8 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the while loop is already indented by 4 spaces. The body should be indented by 8.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        for program2: \n            \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n   But the break should be on the next line and also indented by 8? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output:\n\n        \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n   This is two lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we follow the level of the while loop.\n\n   Since the while loop is at 4 spaces, the body should be 8.\n\n   But the provided code in the problem for program2 has:\n\n        while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   So the body is not indented? \n\n   Actually, the TODO is at the same line. We are to write the body in the next lines? \n\n   We write:\n\n        while m<n:\n            # our code\n\n   But the problem says: the missing code is the body. \n\n   We output the two lines with 8 spaces of indentation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output without specifying the indentation? \n\n   But the problem says: the code must run.\n\n   We assume the code is inserted at the same indentation level as the while loop body.\n\n   Therefore, we output the two lines with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines as:\n\n        \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n   This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we only output the body.\n\n   Final output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"    n = len(arr)\\n    change = 0\\n    if i >= 1:\\n        j = i-1\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        j = i\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    return curr_aws + change\", \n            \"program2\": \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n        }\n\n   But note: in program1, the function body should be indented relative to the function definition. The function definition is at 0 indentation, then the body is indented by 4. We have the first line with 4 spaces? \n\n   Actually, the provided code for program1 has:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with the code, which should be at the same indentation level (4 spaces). \n\n   Therefore, we output the code for program1 with 4 spaces for the first level? \n\n   But the code we wrote above has:\n\n        n = len(arr)   -> at 4 spaces\n        change = 0      -> at 4 spaces\n        if ...:         -> at 4 spaces\n            ...         -> at 8 spaces\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"    n = len(arr)\\n    change = 0\\n    if i >= 1:\\n        j = i-1\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        j = i\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    return curr_aws + change\"\n\n   This uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n   For program2, the while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces (because the while is at 4). \n\n   We output:\n\n        \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"\n\n   This uses 8 spaces per line.\n\n   We write the json.\n\n   Note: the string must be escaped for newlines and quotes? \n\n   We use raw string or let the json handle the escape.\n\n   We output the json as a string.\n\n   But the problem says: output the json.\n\n   We write:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"    n = len(arr)\\n    change = 0\\n    if i >= 1:\\n        j = i-1\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[j] != arr[i] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if arr[j] != x else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        j = i\\n        old_break = 1 if arr[i] != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        new_break = 1 if x != arr[j+1] else 0\\n        change += (new_break - old_break) * (j+1) * (n-1-j)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    return curr_aws + change\", \"program2\": \"        r = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + n - m\\n        break\"}\n\n   But note: the program2 code has a division and subtraction. We use integer arithmetic.\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   Let's hope.\n\n   We output the json."
