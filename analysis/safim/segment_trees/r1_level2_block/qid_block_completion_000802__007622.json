But the example [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6): \n        candidate1: i=0, j=5: best=0+(6-1-5)+2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=1+1=2 -> then we have 2 vs 1? -> then move j to 4: rsum=1+1=2 -> candidate2: i=1, j=4: best=1+(6-1-4)+2=1+1+2=4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=2+1=3 -> then move j to 3: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate3: i=2, j=3: best=2+(6-1-3)+2=2+2+2=6 -> then move i to 3: then break? so we output 6. So the code is:\n\n        for s in inp:\n            n = int(s[0]) arr = [int(x) for x in s[1].split()]\n\n            i = 0\n            j = n-1\n            lsum = arr[i]\n            rsum = arr[j]\n\n            best = 0\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n            print(best) But wait: what if we get an equality and then after moving i, we break the condition? Example: i=2, j=3: then we set best=6, then we do i+=1 -> i becomes 3, then we break the loop? But what if we have an equality at i=2, j=3 and then we move i to 3 and then we break? that's acceptable. However, there is a potential bug: when we move i in the else block, we do:\n\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i] But what if i was j-1? then i+1 becomes j? then we break the loop? but we are still in the else block? and we do the addition? Example: n=3, arr = [1,1,1]\n            i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we enter else: \n                best = 0 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then i becomes 1, then we add arr[1]=1 -> lsum=2. Then we break the loop? because i=1, j=2 -> then next iteration: i<j -> true? Then we check: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> then we do the elif: rsum<lsum -> then j becomes 1 -> then we break the loop? But then we output 2? which is correct? because they eat two candies: Alice eats [1,?] -> actually, in the first equality: Alice ate [0] and Bob ate [2] -> total 2. But then we moved Alice to [0,1] and Bob still at [2] -> then we break? So we output 2. But note: we could have eaten all three? Alice: [0,1] -> 2\n        Bob: [2] -> 1 -> not equal. Alice: [0] -> 1\n        Bob: [1,2] -> 2 -> not equal. So 2 is the maximum. Therefore, the code for program1.py is complete with the TODO block filled as:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing O(n) per test case?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the problem about Alice and Bob eating candies. The current code has a while loop that uses two pointers (i from left, j from right) and two running sums (lsum for Alice, rsum for Bob). The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (which is the count from the left plus the count from the right) such that the total weights are equal.\n\nThe current code has a TODO in the elif block for when rsum < lsum. We should update j and rsum similarly to how we update i and lsum when lsum < rsum.\n\nAdditionally, note that in the else block (when lsum == rsum), we record the current total candies eaten (i+1 from the left and (n-1-j) from the right, so total is (i+1) + (n-1-j) = i + (n-1-j) + 1? Actually, note: \n- i is the current left index (0-indexed), so the number of candies Alice has eaten is i+1 (because she started at index0 and then moved to index i, inclusive). \n- Similarly, Bob has eaten from the right: starting at index n-1 and then moving left to j, so the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - j + 1) = n - j.\n\nBut in the code, when they are equal, they do:\n    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\nWhy +2? \n- i is the current left index (so she has eaten from index0 to i, which is i+1 candies).\n- (n-1-j) is the number of candies Bob has eaten? Actually, Bob started at n-1 and has eaten down to j (inclusive). The count is (n-1 - j) + 1 = n - j.\nBut note: the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (n - j). And note that i and j are indices that have been included. However, in the code they write: i + (n-1-j) + 2 = (i+1) + (n-1-j+1) = (i+1) + (n - j). So that is correct.\n\nBut note: the while loop condition is i < j. When we update in the else block, we do:\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]\nThis moves the left pointer and then adds the next candy. However, after updating, we break the condition? Also, we might overshoot? \n\nActually, the code has a flaw: when we are in the else block, we update i and then we continue. But what if i becomes >= j? Then the loop breaks. But we have updated the sums and then we break. Also, we set best to the current count, but then we update and then the next iteration might break.\n\nHowever, note the problem: we are allowed to have non-overlapping. The problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy. So we must have i < j.\n\nBut the current code in the else block does:\n    best = ...   # which is the current state (at the moment of equality) and then we update i to i+1 and add arr[i] to lsum. Then we continue.\n\nThis might break the condition. Also, we are updating even after we found an equality? Why? Because we are trying to see if we can get a better (longer) sequence? But note: if we have an equality at (i, j), then we record that as a candidate. Then we try to extend by moving the left pointer to see if we can get another equality? However, moving the left pointer alone will break the equality? \n\nActually, the standard solution for this problem is to use two pointers and when the left sum is less than the right, move the left pointer; when the right is less, move the right; and when they are equal, record the candidate and then move one of the pointers (because we want to see if we can get another equality with more candies?).\n\nBut note: the total number of candies eaten is fixed: we are counting the left part and the right part. If we move the left pointer after an equality, we break the equality? So we should record the candidate and then try to continue? Actually, we can break the equality by moving one pointer and then try to get a new equality? But the problem is that we are allowed to have only one contiguous segment from the left and one from the right. So we are not going to have multiple segments.\n\nThe standard solution is:\n\nInitialize:\n  left = 0, right = n-1\n  lsum = 0, rsum = 0\n  best = 0\n\nBut note: in the provided code, they start with:\n  lsum = arr[0] (so left pointer at 0)\n  rsum = arr[n-1] (right pointer at n-1)\n\nThen in the while loop (left < right):\n  if lsum == rsum:\n      best = (left+1) + (n - right)   [because left has eaten left+1 candies, right has eaten n - right candies]\n      then we move the left pointer? Why? Actually, we can move either. The provided code moves the left pointer.\n\nBut note: if we move the left pointer, then we break the equality. But we are trying to see if we can get a longer sequence? Actually, we are not. The next state will be lsum > rsum? Then we will move the right? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the equality and then continue to see if we can get another equality? But the problem asks for the maximum total candies. So we want the maximum (left+1 + n-right) for which lsum==rsum.\n\nSo we can do: when we have an equality, we record the candidate and then we move the left pointer (or the right) to try to find the next equality? But note: we are allowed to take only contiguous segments from the left and right. So we are not going to skip candies arbitrarily.\n\nActually, the standard solution is to do:\n\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i] (i+1 candies) and Bob has eaten [j, n-1] (n-j candies)\n          # Then we move one of the pointers to try to extend? Actually, we can move both? But note: if we move both, then we are effectively starting a new segment? But we are not allowed to skip. So we have to extend the segments? \n\n      if lsum <= rsum:\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      else:\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: in the provided code, they have:\n\n  if lsum < rsum:\n      i += 1\n      lsum += arr[i]\n  elif rsum < lsum:\n      # TODO: we need to do the symmetric: move j to the left and add to rsum\n  else:\n      best = ...   # record candidate\n      i += 1\n      lsum += arr[i]\n\nBut the problem: after recording the candidate, they move the left pointer. Why not move both? Because if we move only one, then the next state might be unbalanced. But we are trying to see if we can get a longer segment? Actually, we can also move both? \n\nHowever, note: if we have an equality at (i, j), then we can try to extend by one candy on the left and one on the right? But that would break the equality? So we cannot extend both at the same time? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the equality and then try to build up again? The provided code only moves the left pointer. But then we might miss the opportunity to move the right? \n\nActually, the standard solution is to move one of the pointers when they are equal? And then continue. But note: we have already recorded the candidate. We are free to break the equality and then try to get a new one? \n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to take only one contiguous segment from the left and one from the right. So we are not going to have multiple segments. The candidate we recorded is one valid partition. Then we break the partition and then try to form a new one? But the new one might be longer? \n\nWait: if we have an equality at (i, j), then the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (n-j). Then we move the left pointer: now Alice has eaten [0, i+1] and Bob [j, n-1]. Then we might get an equality again at a later time? But that would be a different partition. And we are looking for the maximum total candies. So we want the maximum over all such partitions.\n\nTherefore, we should record every time we have an equality and then update best to the maximum candidate. Then we break the equality by moving the left pointer (or the right) and continue.\n\nBut note: if we move the left pointer, we break the equality and then we might get an equality again? \n\nSo the provided code in the else block does:\n    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2   # which is (i+1) + (n - j) as explained\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]\n\nBut what if we get an equality again? Then we update best again? And we take the last one? But we want the maximum total candies. So we should take the maximum candidate? \n\nActually, we are updating best every time we get an equality. And we are traversing the entire array until i < j. So we will record every equality we meet. And then we output the best? But note: the problem says \"the maximum number of candies\", so we want the maximum candidate we ever had.\n\nBut the current code does not take the maximum? It just sets best to the current candidate. We should do:\n\n    best = max(best, i + (n-1-j) + 2)\n\nBut the provided code does not do that. It sets best to the current candidate and then overwrites any previous candidate. That is a bug.\n\nLooking at the initial code: \n    best = 0\n    then in the else block: best = ... \n\nSo we are not taking the maximum? We should.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten must be maximized. So we should record the maximum candidate.\n\nSo we should change the else block to:\n    candidate = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n    if candidate > best:\n        best = candidate\n    # and then move the left pointer? \n\nBut why move the left pointer? Why not the right? Or both? Actually, we can move either. The idea is to break the equality and then continue. We can move the left pointer. \n\nAlternatively, we can move both? But if we move both, we skip two candies? Then we are not including them in either part? But we are allowed to skip candies in the middle? The problem says: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous segment from the left) and Bob from the right (any contiguous segment from the right). The candies in the middle are not eaten. So we can skip arbitrarily in the middle. \n\nBut note: we are moving the pointers independently. We are not forced to move both. \n\nThe standard solution I know is:\n\n  i = -1\n  j = n\n  lsum = 0\n  rsum = 0\n  best = 0\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum == rsum:\n          best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i] and Bob [j, n-1]\n          # then we move both? \n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break\n      elif lsum < rsum:\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      else:\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000. So we can do a two-pointer that runs in O(n) per test case? But the sum of n is 200000, so overall O(200000). \n\nBut the provided code starts with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then the pointers are at 0 and n-1. \n\nWe have to fix the else block to update best with the maximum candidate and then we have to break the equality by moving one pointer? But which one? Actually, we can move either. The provided code moves the left. But then we might miss a candidate that would have been found by moving the right? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the equality by moving both? But that would skip the middle candy? And then we are effectively starting a new segment? \n\nBut note: we are allowed to have a gap in the middle. So we can move both? \n\nActually, the standard solution I recall for \"Two Candies\" (or similar) is to move both when they are equal. Why? Because if we move only one, then we break the equality and then we might never get the same equality again? But if we move both, we are adding one candy to Alice and one to Bob? Then we can get a new equality? \n\nBut the problem: we are not forced to have the same number of candies on both sides. The weights can be different. \n\nHowever, the note in the problem: the fourth test case: \n    Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n    Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n    total candies: 3+4 = 7.\n\nHow would we get that? \n    n = 8? \n    arr = [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]   (from the example: the fourth test case)\n\nBut the example says: \n    Alice: [7,3,20] -> indices 0,1,2\n    Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> indices 4,5,6,7\n\nSo the middle candy (index3: 5) is skipped.\n\nIn the two-pointer method:\n\n    We start:\n        i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> lsum>rsum -> move j to 6: rsum=1+11=12 -> lsum=7, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> move i to 1: lsum=7+3=10 -> lsum=10, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> move i to 2: lsum=10+20=30, rsum=12 -> now lsum>rsum -> move j to 5: rsum=12+8=20 -> still lsum>rsum -> move j to 4: rsum=20+10=30 -> now lsum==rsum. \n        Then we record: i=2, j=4 -> total candies = (2+1) + (8-4) = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\n    Then we move both? \n        i becomes 3, j becomes 3 -> then we break because i>=j? \n\nSo we record 7.\n\nBut in the provided code, in the else block, they only move the left pointer. Then we would have:\n\n    At (i=2, j=4): lsum=30, rsum=30 -> record best = 2 + (8-1-4) + 2 = 2 + (3) + 2 = 7 -> then move i to 3: lsum=30+5=35 -> then we have i=3, j=4: 35 vs 30 -> then we move j? but j is 4, we move j to 3? but then j becomes 3 and i=3 -> break. \n\nSo we get 7.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then we get another equality? \n\nExample: [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n    n=6\n    i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> record candidate: 0 + (6-1-5) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=1+2=3 -> then we have i=1, j=5: 3 vs 1 -> move j to 4: rsum=1+2=3 -> then we have i=1, j=4: lsum=3, rsum=3 -> record candidate: 1 + (6-1-4) + 2 = 1 + (1) + 2 = 4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3+3=6 -> then i=2, j=4: 6 vs 3 -> move j to 3: rsum=3+3=6 -> then i=2, j=3: lsum=6, rsum=6 -> record candidate: 2 + (6-1-3) + 2 = 2 + (2) + 2 = 6 -> then move i to 3: but then i=3 and j=3 -> break.\n\nBut wait: the total candies eaten would be 6? But the entire array? But note: the middle is not skipped? Actually, we have:\n    Alice: [1,2,3] -> indices0,1,2 -> 3 candies\n    Bob: [1,2,3] -> indices3,4,5 -> 3 candies\n    total 6.\n\nBut the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. And here, the candy at index3 is the first of Bob? and index2 is the last of Alice? so they are adjacent? that's allowed.\n\nBut note: the problem says: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous segment from the left) and Bob from the right (any contiguous segment from the right). They can meet in the middle? as long as they don't overlap. \n\nSo 6 is valid.\n\nBut the provided code in the else block only moves the left pointer. Then we get the candidate 2, then 4, then 6. And we set best to 6 at the end. But we are overwriting best each time? So we output 6? which is correct.\n\nBut the problem: we are not taking the maximum? We are setting best to the last candidate. But in this example, the last candidate is the maximum. But what if we have:\n\n    [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]\n\n    We might get an equality at:\n        i=0, j=6: 1==1 -> candidate=2\n        then move i to 1: lsum=2, then move j to 5: rsum=2 -> candidate= (1+1) + (6-5) = 2 + 1 = 3? \n        then move i to 2: lsum=3, then move j to 4: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate= (2+1) + (6-4) = 3 + 2 = 5? \n        then move i to 3: lsum=3+2=5 -> then we have i=3, j=4: 5 vs 3 -> then move j to 3: but then j=3 and i=3 -> break.\n\n    The candidate 5 is the maximum.\n\n    But if we set best to the last candidate (5) that's the maximum? \n\n    However, what if we have:\n\n        [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n        We get:\n            i=0, j=5: 1==1 -> candidate=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=2, then move j to 4: rsum=2 -> candidate= (1+1) + (6-4) = 2+2=4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3, then move j to 3: rsum=3 -> candidate= (2+1) + (6-3) = 3+3=6 -> then move i to 3: lsum=4, then j=3: we break? \n\n        But note: when we move i to 3, we break the condition i<j? because j is 3 and i becomes 3 -> so we break.\n\n        So we set best to 6? which is correct.\n\n    But what if we have:\n\n        [1,1,1,3,1,1,1]\n\n        We get:\n            i0=0, j0=6: 1==1 -> candidate=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=2 -> then we have 2 vs 1 -> move j to 5: rsum=1+1=2 -> candidate= (1+1) + (7-5) = 2+2=4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3 -> then move j to 4: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate= (2+1) + (7-4) = 3+3=6 -> then move i to 3: lsum=3+3=6 -> then we have i=3, j=4: 6 vs 3 -> then move j to 3: but then j=3 and i=3 -> break.\n\n        So we set best=6? but wait: the entire array? but the middle candy (index3) is 3, which is not eaten by either? \n\n        Actually, the candidate 6 is computed as: \n            Alice: indices0,1,2 -> 1+1+1=3\n            Bob: indices4,5,6 -> 1+1+1=3\n            total candies: 3+3=6.\n\n        And the candy at index3 is skipped. That's allowed.\n\n    But note: the candidate we recorded at the last step was when i=2 and j=4? Then we moved i to 3? and then we broke? \n\n    Actually, in the else block we record the candidate and then we move i. Then we break? \n\n    How do we record the candidate at (i=2, j=4)? \n\n    The code in the else block: \n        best = ...   (using the current i and j) -> so at the moment of the else block, i=2 and j=4? \n\n    Then we set best = 2 + (n-1-4) + 2 = 2 + (6-4) + 2? wait n=7 -> 2 + (7-1-4) + 2 = 2+ (2) +2 = 6? \n\n    Then we do i += 1 -> i becomes 3, and then we add arr[3]=3 to lsum -> then we break the condition? because then we go to the next iteration: i=3, j=4 -> then we do the if conditions: lsum=6, rsum=3 -> we do the elif: rsum<lsum -> then we do the TODO block: which we are going to complete.\n\n    But note: we haven't completed the TODO block in program1.py.\n\n    So we must complete the TODO block: we need to handle the case when rsum < lsum.\n\n    We should do:\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    But note: j is currently at 4, we move j to 3? then we break the condition because i=3 and j=3 -> so we break the loop.\n\n    So we output best=6.\n\n    But what if we have a candidate that is larger? \n\n    The problem: we are not taking the maximum candidate over the entire run? We are setting best to the last candidate we found? \n\n    In the example [1,1,1,1,1,1] we set best to 2, then to 4, then to 6. So the last one is the maximum.\n\n    But in [1,1,1,3,1,1,1] we set best to 2, then 4, then 6. So 6 is the maximum.\n\n    But what if we have:\n\n        [1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1]\n\n        n=8\n        We might get:\n            i0=0, j0=7: 1==1 -> candidate=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=2 -> then move j to 6: rsum=2 -> candidate= (1+1) + (8-6) = 2+2=4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3 -> then move j to 5: rsum=3 -> candidate= (2+1) + (8-5) = 3+3=6 -> then move i to 3: lsum=3+2=5 -> then we have 5 vs 3 -> move j to 4: rsum=3+1=4 -> then 5 vs 4 -> move j to 3: but then j=3 and i=3 -> break.\n\n        So we set best=6? but is there a candidate 8? \n            Alice: [1,1,1,2] -> 5\n            Bob: [1,1,1,1] -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n            Alice: [1,1,1] -> 3\n            Bob: [1,1,1,1] -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n            Alice: [1,1,1,2,1] -> 6\n            Bob: [1,1,1] -> 3 -> not equal.\n\n        So 6 is the maximum.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm: we traverse and every time we get an equality we record the candidate (and we update best to be the maximum candidate we've seen so far). But the provided code does:\n\n        best = ...   (overwriting)\n\n    So we must change that to:\n\n        candidate = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n        if candidate > best:\n            best = candidate\n\n    Or we can do: best = max(best, candidate)\n\n    But note: the initial best is 0. And we want the maximum candidate.\n\n    So we should change the else block to:\n\n        candidate = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n        best = candidate if candidate > best else best   # or best = max(best, candidate)\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n\n    But wait: what if we have multiple equalities? We want the maximum candidate. So we take the max.\n\n    However, note: the total number of candies eaten is increasing? Not necessarily: because when we move the pointers, the total candies eaten in the candidate is (i+1) + (n-j). And as we move the pointers, i increases and j decreases, so the total might increase? But note: we are not always moving both. We move one at a time. \n\n    Actually, the total candies eaten in the candidate is (i+1) + (n-j). And as we move the pointers, i increases and j decreases, so the total increases? \n\n    But in the example [1,1,1,1,1,1] we had: \n        candidate1: i=0, j=5 -> total= (1) + (6-5)=1+1=2\n        candidate2: i=1, j=4 -> total= (2) + (6-4)=2+2=4\n        candidate3: i=2, j=3 -> total= (3) + (6-3)=3+3=6\n\n    So it increases. Therefore, the last candidate is the maximum. So we don't need to take the max? \n\n    But what if we have:\n\n        [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n        n=8\n        We might get:\n            i0=0, j0=7: 1==1 -> candidate=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=1+2=3 -> then move j to 6: rsum=1+1=2 -> then move j to 5: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate= (1+1) + (8-5)=2+3=5 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3+3=6 -> then move j to 4: rsum=3+2=5 -> then move j to 3: rsum=5+3=8 -> then we have 6 vs 8 -> then move i to 3: lsum=6+3=9 -> then i=3, j=3 -> break.\n\n        The candidate 5 is the maximum? but we also had candidate 2. And 5>2. But note: we recorded candidate 5 and then we moved? and then we broke. So we set best=5? \n\n        But is there a candidate 6? \n            Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n            Bob: [1,1,1] -> 3 -> not equal.\n\n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3\n            Bob: [1,1,1] -> 3 -> that's 2+3=5 candies -> which we recorded.\n\n        So 5 is the maximum.\n\n    Therefore, we do need to take the maximum over all candidates? because the next candidate might be smaller? \n\n    But in the above example, the candidates are increasing then decreasing? Actually, the total candies in the candidate is (i+1)+(n-j). And i is increasing and j is decreasing, so (i+1) is increasing and (n-j) is increasing? So the total is increasing? \n\n    Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers independently. \n\n    In the example above: \n        candidate1: i=0 -> (0+1)=1, j=7 -> n-j = 8-7=1 -> total=2.\n        candidate2: i=1 -> 2, j=5 -> 8-5=3 -> total=5.\n        Then we move i to 2: then we don't get an equality until we move j to 3? but then we break? \n\n    But note: when we move i to 2, we have lsum=6, then we move j to 4: rsum=5, then j to 3: rsum=8 -> then we have 6 vs 8 -> then we move i to 3: lsum=9 -> then break. So we don't get an equality at i=2 and j=3? \n\n    How do we get an equality at i=2 and j=3? \n        We would have to have lsum = 6 and rsum = 8 -> not equal.\n\n    So the total candies in the candidate is not necessarily increasing? \n\n    Actually, the total candies in the candidate is (i+1)+(n-j). And as we move the pointers, i increases and j decreases, so the total is increasing? \n\n    In the example: \n        candidate1: i=0, j=7 -> total=1+1=2.\n        candidate2: i=1, j=5 -> total=2+3=5.\n        Then if we had an equality at i=2, j=3: total=3+ (8-3)=3+5=8 -> which is more than 5.\n\n    But we didn't get an equality at i=2, j=3.\n\n    So the total candies in the candidate is increasing as we move the pointers? because we are moving the pointers inward? and the total candies eaten is the number of candies taken from the left (which is increasing as i increases) and from the right (which is increasing as j decreases). So the total is increasing? \n\n    Therefore, the last candidate we get is the maximum? \n\n    But note: we are not always moving both? we move one pointer at a time. And we break when i>=j. \n\n    However, the total candies in the candidate is (i+1)+(n-j). And i starts at 0 and increases, j starts at n-1 and decreases. So (i+1) is increasing and (n-j) is increasing? \n\n    Actually, (n-j) = (n-1 - j) + 1? but we are using n-j. And j is decreasing, so n-j is increasing. \n\n    Therefore, the total is increasing. So the last candidate we get is the maximum. \n\n    Therefore, we don't need to take the max? we can just set best to the last candidate? \n\n    But wait: what if we get a candidate and then we break? and then we don't get any more? then the last candidate is the maximum? \n\n    However, what if we get a candidate and then we move the pointers and then we get a candidate with a larger total? \n\n    So we want the maximum candidate we ever had? \n\n    But because the total is increasing, the last candidate we get is the maximum? \n\n    But note: we break when i>=j. And we get candidates only when i<j. And the total is increasing. So the last candidate is the maximum.\n\n    Therefore, we can set best to the last candidate? \n\n    But the problem: what if we get a candidate and then we move the pointers and then we break without getting another candidate? Then the last candidate we got is the maximum? \n\n    Yes, because the total is increasing. \n\n    However, consider: \n        [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n        n=8\n        i0=0, j0=7: 1==1 -> candidate=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=1+2=3 -> then we have 3 vs 1 -> move j to 6: rsum=1+1=2 -> then 3 vs 2 -> move j to 5: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate= (1+1) + (8-5)=2+3=5 -> then move i to 2: lsum=3+1=4 -> then move j to 4: rsum=3+1=4 -> candidate= (2+1) + (8-4)=3+4=7 -> then move i to 3: lsum=4+1=5 -> then move j to 3: rsum=4+1=5 -> candidate= (3+1) + (8-3)=4+5=9 -> but wait, j=3 and i=3 -> we break? \n\n        Actually, when we move i to 3: i=3, j=4 -> then we have lsum=5, rsum=4 -> then we move j to 3: rsum=4+1=5 -> then we have i=3, j=3 -> break? so we don't get the candidate at i=3, j=3? because i>=j.\n\n        How do we get the candidate? We must record when we have an equality and i<j. At the moment we have i=3 and j=4: we are in the state lsum=5, rsum=4 -> then we move j to 3: then we break the condition? because then we do j-=1 and then j becomes 3? then we add arr[3] to rsum? then we break the loop? \n\n        But note: the while condition is i<j. When we move j to 3, then i=3 and j=3 -> so we break the loop without entering the loop body again.\n\n        So we must record the candidate at the last step? \n\n        Actually, in the state i=2, j=4: we had an equality? \n            lsum=4, rsum=4 -> then we record candidate= (2+1)+(8-4)=3+4=7 -> then we move i to 3: lsum=4+1=5 -> then we are in the loop: i=3, j=4 -> then we do the if: lsum=5, rsum=4 -> then we do the elif: rsum<lsum -> then we move j to 3: rsum=4+arr[3]=4+1=5 -> then we break the loop? \n\n        But then we don't get to record the candidate at i=3, j=3? because we break the loop condition? \n\n        However, note: when we move j to 3, we break the condition? so we don't check the equality? \n\n        How can we record the candidate at i=3, j=3? We cannot because i>=j and they are not allowed to eat the same candy? \n\n        Actually, the candy at index3 is in the middle? and we are not allowed to eat the same candy. So we cannot have both Alice and Bob eat the same candy. \n\n        Therefore, the candidate at i=3, j=3 is not valid? because they would both be eating the candy at index3? \n\n        So we only record when i<j.\n\n        Therefore, the candidate 7 is the maximum.\n\n    But wait: the example: \n        Alice: [1,2,1] (indices0,1,2) -> 4\n        Bob: [1,1,1,1] (indices3,4,5,6,7) -> but wait, Bob eats from the right: he must eat contiguous from the right? so he can only eat [1,1,1,1] from the right? that's indices4,5,6,7? but that's 4 candies? and the sum is 4? \n        Then total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n        But what if we try:\n            Alice: [1,2,1,1] (indices0,1,2,3) -> 5\n            Bob: [1,1,1] (indices5,6,7) -> 3 -> not equal.\n\n            Alice: [1,2] (indices0,1) -> 3\n            Bob: [1,1,1,1] (indices4,5,6,7) -> 4 -> not equal.\n\n        So 7 is the maximum.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm: \n        We start with i=0, j=n-1, lsum=arr[0], rsum=arr[n-1], best=0.\n        While i<j:\n            if lsum < rsum:\n                i += 1\n                if i < j:   # but note: we are in the loop so i<j, but after incrementing i might become j? \n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                else:\n                    break\n            elif rsum < lsum:\n                j -= 1\n                if j > i:   # similarly\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    break\n            else:   # equal\n                candidate = i+1 + n - j   # which is (i+1) + (n - j)\n                best = candidate   # because the total is increasing, we can set best to candidate (and the last candidate is the maximum) but note: we might have multiple and the total is increasing? so the last candidate is the maximum? \n                # But note: we are going to move the pointers and then we might get a larger candidate? \n                # Actually, we are going to move the left pointer and then the total candies in the next candidate (if we get one) will be larger? \n                # So we don't break, we move one pointer to try to get a larger candidate.\n                i += 1\n                if i < j:\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        Then print(best)\n\n    But wait: in the else block, we set best = candidate, but we don't compare with the previous best? and we are relying on the fact that the total is increasing? \n\n    However, note: the total candies in the candidate is (i+1)+(n-j). And we are about to move i to i+1, so the next candidate (if we get one) will have at least (i+2)+(n-j) which is more? \n\n    But we might not get an equality again? \n\n    But we want the maximum candidate. And the total is increasing, so the last candidate we get is the maximum. \n\n    Therefore, we can set best = candidate in the else block without taking the max? and then we move the pointer? \n\n    But note: the candidate we just recorded might be the last one? then we break? and we set best to that candidate? \n\n    However, the problem: what if we get an equality and then we move the pointer and then we break? then we set best to the last candidate? which is the maximum? \n\n    But what if we get an equality and then we move the pointer and then we get another equality? then we set best to the new candidate? which is larger? \n\n    So we are always setting best to the last candidate we get? and because the total is increasing, the last candidate is the maximum? \n\n    Therefore, we can do that.\n\n    But note: the initial code sets best=0. And if we never get an equality, best remains 0? which is correct.\n\n    However, the problem: the fourth test case: \n        [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> we expect 7.\n\n        We get an equality at i=2, j=4: \n            candidate = (2+1) + (8-4) = 3+4=7 -> set best=7.\n            then we move i to 3: lsum=30+5=35 -> then we break? because then we have i=3, j=4: 35 vs 30 -> then we do the elif: rsum<lsum -> then we do j-=1 -> j becomes 3 -> then we break the loop (i=3, j=3).\n\n        So we output 7.\n\n    So the code for program1.py:\n\n        We need to complete the elif block for when rsum < lsum:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And in the else block, we set best = i + (n-1-j) + 2   [which is the same as (i+1)+(n-j)] and then we move the left pointer:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n        But note: after we do j-=1, we might break the condition i<j? so we should check? \n\n        Actually, the provided code does not check. It does:\n\n            while i < j:\n                if ...:\n                    ...\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]   # but what if j becomes less than i? we are in the loop so i<j, but after j-=1, j might become i? then we break next time? \n\n        But the next time we check the condition? \n\n        However, after we do j-=1, we do not break the loop immediately? we go to the next iteration? and the condition is checked at the start of the loop.\n\n        But what if j becomes i? then we break? \n\n        But note: we do j-=1, then we set rsum += arr[j]. But if j becomes i, then we are adding the candy at position j (which is the same as i) and then we break the loop? \n\n        But that's acceptable.\n\n    However, there is a bug: when we move the left pointer in the else block, we do i+=1 and then lsum += arr[i]. But what if i+1 is beyond j? \n\n        Example: i=2, j=3: then we are in the else block: we set best = ... then we do i+=1 -> i becomes 3, then we do lsum += arr[3] -> but j is 3, so we are at the same index? and then we break the loop? \n\n        But we are in the loop body: we do the else block and then we break the condition? but we are still in the loop body? then we finish the body and then the next iteration we check i<j -> 3<3 -> false -> break.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n    But what if i+1 equals j? then we do lsum += arr[i] (with i now = j) -> but then we break the loop? \n\n        Example: i=1, j=2: then we are in the else block: we set best = ... then i becomes 2 -> then we add arr[2] -> then we break the loop? \n\n        But note: the condition for the loop is i<j. Now i=2 and j=2 -> so next iteration we break.\n\n        But we are not accessing out of bounds? because j is 2 and we are accessing arr[2]? which is valid.\n\n    However, what if i+1 is beyond the array? \n\n        We start with i=0, j=n-1. Then we only move i to the right and j to the left. And we break when i>=j. So i will never exceed n-1? and j will never be negative? \n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n    But note: we must ensure that we don't move j when j is already at i? but the loop condition is i<j, so j is at least i+1. So j-1 is at least i.\n\n    So the code for program1.py:\n\n        We complete the TODO block with:\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And we change the else block to set best to the candidate? and then move the left pointer? \n\n        But note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\n    However, the initial code sets best=0. And if there is no equality, we output 0? which is correct.\n\n    But what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then we break? then we set best to that candidate? and then we output it? \n\n    But what if we have multiple test cases? the code has:\n\n        for s in inp:\n            ... \n            print(best)\n\n    So we are printing best for each test case.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        In the elif block: \n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n        And we leave the else block as is? \n\n        But note: the else block currently does:\n\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\n        But we argued that we should set best to the candidate and then move the left pointer. And because the total is increasing, the last candidate is the maximum? \n\n        However, the example [1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1] (n=8) had two candidates: 2 and 5 and 7? and we set best to 7 at the last candidate? \n\n        But in the else block, we set best to the candidate and then we move the pointer. And then we might get another candidate? and then set best to the new candidate? which is larger? \n\n        So we are overwriting best each time? and the last candidate is the maximum? \n\n        Therefore, we don't need to change the else block? \n\n        But wait: what if we get a candidate and then we move the pointer and then we break without getting another candidate? then we set best to that candidate? and that's the maximum? \n\n        And if we get multiple candidates, the last one is the maximum? \n\n        So we are good.\n\n    However, the fourth test case: \n        [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> we get one candidate at i=2, j=4: best=7, then we move i to 3 -> then we break? so we output 7.\n\n    But the example [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6): \n        candidate1: i=0, j=5: best=0+(6-1-5)+2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then move i to 1: lsum=1+1=2 -> then we have 2 vs 1? -> then move j to 4: rsum=1+1=2 -> candidate2: i=1, j=4: best=1+(6-1-4)+2=1+1+2=4 -> then move i to 2: lsum=2+1=3 -> then move j to 3: rsum=2+1=3 -> candidate3: i=2, j=3: best=2+(6-1-3)+2=2+2+2=6 -> then move i to 3: then break? so we output 6.\n\n    So the code is:\n\n        for s in inp:\n            n = int(s[0])\n            arr = [int(x) for x in s[1].split()]\n\n            i = 0\n            j = n-1\n            lsum = arr[i]\n            rsum = arr[j]\n\n            best = 0\n            while i < j:\n                if lsum < rsum:\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n                elif rsum < lsum:\n                    j -= 1\n                    rsum += arr[j]\n                else:\n                    best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n                    i += 1\n                    lsum += arr[i]\n\n            print(best)\n\n    But wait: what if we get an equality and then after moving i, we break the condition? \n\n        Example: i=2, j=3: then we set best=6, then we do i+=1 -> i becomes 3, then we break the loop? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at i=2, j=3 and then we move i to 3 and then we break? that's acceptable.\n\n    However, there is a potential bug: when we move i in the else block, we do:\n\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n\n        But what if i was j-1? then i+1 becomes j? then we break the loop? but we are still in the else block? and we do the addition? \n\n        Example: n=3, arr = [1,1,1]\n            i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> then we enter else: \n                best = 0 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then i becomes 1, then we add arr[1]=1 -> lsum=2.\n            Then we break the loop? because i=1, j=2 -> then next iteration: i<j -> true? \n            Then we check: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> then we do the elif: rsum<lsum -> then j becomes 1 -> then we break the loop? \n\n        But then we output 2? which is correct? because they eat two candies: Alice eats [1,?] -> actually, in the first equality: Alice ate [0] and Bob ate [2] -> total 2.\n\n        But then we moved Alice to [0,1] and Bob still at [2] -> then we break? \n\n        So we output 2.\n\n    But note: we could have eaten all three? \n        Alice: [0,1] -> 2\n        Bob: [2] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n        Alice: [0] -> 1\n        Bob: [1,2] -> 2 -> not equal.\n\n        So 2 is the maximum.\n\n    Therefore, the code for program1.py is complete with the TODO block filled as:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing O(n) per test case? and the sum of n is 200000, so overall O(200000). \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n    But wait: the input t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the number of test cases might be large? but the total n is bounded.\n\n    So we are safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    We are to complete the code for the lucky ticket problem.\n\n    The code:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are to output for each test case \"YES\" or \"NO\" if the ticket (a string of 6 digits) is lucky.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        s = c   # the string of 6 digits\n        if int(s[0])+int(s[1])+int(s[2]) == int(s[3])+int(s[4])+int(s[5]):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: the problem says we can output in any case, but the example outputs are in uppercase.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if sum(map(int, list(s[:3]))) == sum(map(int, list(s[3:]))):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But the problem: the string is 6 digits, so we can split it.\n\n    So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            if sum(int(x) for x in c[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in c[3:]):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: we can also do:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            s = c.strip()\n            if s and len(s)==6:\n                if int(s[0])+int(s[1])+int(s[2]) == int(s[3])+int(s[4])+int(s[5]):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n    But the problem says: each test case is one string of six digits.\n\n    So we can assume that.\n\n    Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: the problem says the first line is t, then t lines of six digits.\n\n    We are reading t test cases.\n\n    So we output the answers for each test case.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire for loop body? \n\n    But the for loop is already given? we only need to complete the body.\n\n    So we write:\n\n        if sum(int(c[0])+int(c[1])+int(c[2]) == int(c[3])+int(c[4])+int(c[5]): \n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But we can do it without creating a list.\n\n    However, we can also do:\n\n        if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:6])):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    This is efficient and clear.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: the string c has 6 characters, so c[3:] is the last three.\n\n    We can also do:\n\n        if sum(int(x) for x in c[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in c[3:]):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But the map version is concise.\n\n    We'll use the map version.\n\n    Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n    Note: we must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n    For program1.py, the missing code is the two lines for the elif block:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    But note: the existing code in the elif block is:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n    And we leave the rest.\n\n    For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop? \n\n    The for loop is:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    So we replace the TODO with the body? \n\n    But the TODO is at the end of the line. We need to write the body.\n\n    We can write:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for loop? \n\n    However, the entire for loop is given? with the list comprehension? \n\n    Actually, the code is:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    So we need to complete the body of the for loop? \n\n    We can write:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    And we replace the TODO with the if-else.\n\n    But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so for program2.py we output the block that goes inside the for loop.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: we must be careful with the indentation? \n\n    The existing code has the for loop with a comment. We replace the comment with the code, indented by 4 spaces.\n\n    So the code for program2.py is:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]:\n            if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the part that is missing? \n\n    For program1.py, the missing code is two lines (the body of the elif block). For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop (the if-else block).\n\n    Therefore, we output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n    But note: the indentation in program1.py: the elif block is indented by 4 spaces, and the two lines we add should be indented by 8 spaces (because inside the elif block). \n\n    And for program2.py, the for loop body should be indented by 4 spaces? but the existing for loop is already at the same level? \n\n    Actually, the existing program2.py code:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are replacing the TODO comment with the code, which should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n    But the for loop is at the top level? so the body should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n    So the code for program2.py we output should be:\n\n        if ...:\n            print(...)\n        else:\n            print(...)\n\n    But we must represent it as a string in JSON, so we need to escape the quotes and newlines.\n\n    Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n    But the initial for loop has the colon and then the comment. We are replacing the entire body? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: the code is given with a TODO. We are to fill the TODO.\n\n    For program1.py, we are filling the TODO in the elif block.\n\n    For program2.py, we are filling the TODO in the for loop.\n\n    Therefore, we output the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\n    For program1.py, we output two lines (with proper indentation):\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    For program2.py, we output the entire body of the for loop? \n\n    But note: the TODO is at the end of the for loop line. We are to write the body? \n\n    The body should be:\n\n        if ...: \n            ...\n        else:\n            ...\n\n    So we write:\n\n        if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But we must indent it by 4 spaces relative to the for loop? \n\n    Since the for loop is at the top level, we indent by 4 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But note: we are using the variable c from the for loop.\n\n    Now, we output the JSON.\n\n    We must escape the double quotes and newlines.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use triple quotes? but the problem says to output the missing code.\n\n    We'll write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n        \"program2\": \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n    But the indentation for program2: \n        The for loop is:\n\n            for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: \n\n        Then the body should be indented by 4 spaces. So the first line of the body should be 4 spaces.\n\n        But we are writing in the string: \"    if ...\", which is 4 spaces? \n\n        Then inside the if block, we need 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the body of the if should be indented by 8 spaces relative to the top level? but 4 relative to the for loop? \n\n        In Python, we use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        So:\n\n            for ...:\n                if ...:\n                    print(...)\n                else:\n                    print(...)\n\n        So the if is at 4 spaces, and the print is at 8.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"    if ...:\\n        print(...)\\n    else:\\n        print(...)\"\n\n    But note: the else and the if are at the same level (4 spaces). The print statements are at 8.\n\n    So the code for program2.py we output is:\n\n        \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n    But we can also write without the extra 4 spaces? because the TODO is at the end of the for loop line, and we are replacing the entire body? \n\n    The existing code has:\n\n        for c in [input() for i in range(int(input()))]: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are replacing the comment with the body? and the body must be indented? \n\n    Actually, the body of the for loop must be indented. So we write the body as:\n\n        if ...:\n            ...\n        else:\n            ...\n\n    and we indent the entire body by 4 spaces relative to the for loop? but the for loop is at the top level, so the body is 4 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the string we output for program2 is:\n\n        \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n    But note: the newline after the for loop? we are replacing the entire body? \n\n    Alternatively, we can write the body as a single string with the newlines and spaces.\n\n    We'll do that.\n\n    Now, we output the JSON.\n\n    Example:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n    But note: the program1 code: the two lines are indented by 8 spaces (because inside the elif block, which is inside the while loop, which is inside the function). The existing code has 8 spaces for the body of the if/elif/else.\n\n    So we write the two lines for program1 with 8 spaces of indentation? but we are only outputting the two lines? \n\n    The existing code in program1.py for the elif block:\n\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We replace the TODO with:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\n    So the two lines are at the same indentation level as the code in the if block? which is 8 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, we output the two lines without any extra indentation? but we must include the newline and the same level of indentation? \n\n    Actually, we output the two lines as:\n\n        \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n    The \"\\n        \" means a newline and then 8 spaces? \n\n    But the existing code in the if block is:\n\n        i += 1\n        lsum += arr[i]\n\n    So we do the same for the elif block.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n        j -= 1\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\n    and we represent it as a string: \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\"\n\n    For program2, we represent the body as:\n\n        \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n    The 4 spaces at the beginning of the string are for the for loop body.\n\n    Now, we write the JSON.\n\n    Note: the JSON must be valid.\n\n    We use double quotes for the keys and escape the double quotes inside the strings.\n\n    So:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"j -= 1\\n        rsum += arr[j]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    if sum(map(int, c[:3])) == sum(map(int, c[3:])):\\n        print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n    But note: the program2 string has double quotes, so we escape them: \\\"\n\n    We are done."
