    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight each has eaten to be equal. We are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (by both) such that the sum of weights Alice ate (from the left) equals the sum of weights Bob ate (from the right).\n\n Approach:\n We are guaranteed that the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n We are to output the maximum total candies (i.e., the count of candies eaten by Alice and Bob) such that the sum of Alice's candies equals the sum of Bob's candies.\n\n The provided code in program1.py does:\n   t = number of test cases\n   for each test case:\n        n = number of candies\n        a = list of n integers (weights)\n\n   Then it computes x = total sum of all candies divided by 2 (but note: they don't have to eat the entire set, and the entire set might not be partitionable equally)\n\n   Then it builds a dictionary `d`:\n        s = 0\n        for index, value in the list a (from left to right):\n            s += value\n            if s > x: break   (because the total sum of all candies is 2*x? Actually, note: x = total_sum//2, but total_sum might be odd. However, we are only concerned with sums that are at most x? Actually, we are building a dictionary for prefix sums that are <= x, because if the prefix sum exceeds x, then even if we try to match with a suffix, the total of both sides would exceed the entire array's total? But note: we are only matching the two sides. However, the condition is that the two sides must be equal, and we are building the prefix sums and then checking suffix sums.\n\n   The dictionary `d` maps a prefix sum to the number of candies (i.e., index+1) that form that prefix.\n\n   Then we do:\n        s = 0\n        r = 0   (this will be the answer for the test case)\n        Then we iterate over the array from the right (reversed), and for each candy we add to s (the suffix sum) and then check if s is in the dictionary d.\n\n   The idea: if we have a prefix sum s1 (with count c1) and a suffix sum s2 (with count c2) and s1 == s2, then we can have a total of c1 + c2 candies. We want the maximum such total.\n\n   However, note: the prefix and suffix must not overlap. The condition for non-overlap is that the prefix part must be entirely to the left of the suffix part. Since we are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right, we can break when the entire array is covered? Actually, we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x (which is half the total). But note: the suffix sum might also be built until it exceeds x? However, the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, so we can do:\n\n        For the suffix: we traverse until we have a suffix sum that is in the dictionary. But note: the dictionary only has prefix sums that are <= x. Also, if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we can break? Actually, we don't break because the suffix sum might be less than the prefix sum we have? But note: if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then the prefix sum that matches it would have to be at least that, but we only stored prefix sums up to x. So we can break when the suffix sum exceeds x? However, the problem does not do that. Instead, we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x. For the suffix, we don't break? But we can break similarly? Actually, the problem does not break the suffix loop. But note: the total of the entire array is fixed. If the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we cannot have a matching prefix (because the prefix would have to be the same, and we only stored prefix sums up to x). So we can break the suffix loop when s > x? But the problem does not do that. However, we can do that for efficiency? But the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, so even if we do a full scan for each test case, it's acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can do a full scan.\n\n   The missing code in program1.py is in the suffix loop. We have:\n\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n            s += i\n            if s in d:   # then we have a match\n                # then we can update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n                # but note: we must also check that the prefix and suffix do not overlap? Actually, the condition is that the prefix part must be entirely to the left of the suffix part. How do we check that? \n                # The prefix part uses the first d[s] candies (from left). The suffix part uses the last (idx+1) candies (from right). The condition is: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? But note: if they overlap, then we are counting some candies twice? Actually, the problem states that if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So we must have non-overlapping.\n\n                # However, the way we built the prefix and suffix: the prefix is from the left and the suffix from the right. The condition for non-overlap is: the prefix index (d[s]) must be <= the starting index of the suffix? The suffix of length (idx+1) starts at n - (idx+1). So we require: d[s] <= n - (idx+1) ?\n\n                # But note: the problem does not store the entire prefix beyond x? Actually, we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x, so we only have prefix sums that are <= x. Similarly, the suffix sum we are building might exceed x? But we break the prefix building, but not the suffix? Actually, we don't break the suffix loop. However, if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we can break? But the problem does not. We can break the suffix loop when s > x? Because if s > x, then we cannot have a matching prefix (since the prefix sums we stored are at most x). So we can break to save time.\n\n                # However, the problem does not break. But note: the total of the entire array is 2*x (if even) or 2*x+1 (if odd). So if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then the prefix sum that matches it would have to be the same, but we don't have any prefix sum greater than x? Actually, we broke the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeded x, so we don't have any prefix sum greater than x. Therefore, we can break the suffix loop when s > x? But note: what if the entire array is taken? Then the prefix and suffix would meet in the middle? Actually, if the entire array is taken, then the prefix and suffix would be the entire array? But that would require the entire array to be partitioned into two non-overlapping parts? Actually, they are non-overlapping: Alice takes from left, Bob from right. They can meet in the middle? But if the total number of candies is even, they might meet at the middle without overlapping? Actually, if the total candies is n, then Alice takes the first k and Bob takes the last j, and we require k+j <= n? Actually, they cannot take the same candy. So the condition is that the prefix part must be entirely to the left of the suffix part. That is: the last candy taken by Alice must be strictly to the left of the first candy taken by Bob? Actually, the candies are in a row. So if Alice takes [0, i-1] and Bob takes [j, n-1] (0-indexed), then we require i <= j. The number of candies taken by Alice is i, by Bob is n - j. The total candies taken is i + (n - j). And we require that the sets [0, i-1] and [j, n-1] are disjoint, which is true if i <= j.\n\n                # How do we relate the suffix index? \n                # We are iterating the suffix: \n                #   a[::-1] is the array reversed. So the first element of a[::-1] is a[n-1], then a[n-2], ... \n                #   So when we have taken idx+1 candies from the right, that means we have taken the last idx+1 candies: indices [n-1, n-1-idx] (if we take 1 candy: [n-1], 2: [n-1, n-2], ...). \n                #   The starting index of the suffix part is n-1-idx? Actually, the last candy taken by Bob is the one at index n-1, then n-2, ... so the leftmost candy Bob took is at index n-1-idx. \n                #   The condition for non-overlap: the prefix part ends at index i-1 (if we took i candies) and the suffix part starts at index n-1-idx. We require that i-1 < n-1-idx? That is: i <= n-1-idx? Or i <= n - (idx+1) ?\n\n                # Actually, the prefix part: we took the first i candies (indices 0 to i-1). The suffix part: we took the last (idx+1) candies (indices n-1-idx to n-1). They are disjoint if i-1 < n-1-idx, i.e., i <= n-1-idx? Actually, we require that the prefix part does not include any candy in the suffix part. The first candy not taken by Alice is at index i, and the first candy taken by Bob is at index n-1-idx. We require i <= n-1-idx? Actually, if i = n-1-idx, then the candy at index i is taken by Alice? But Bob also takes the candy at index n-1-idx? That would be the same candy. So we must have i <= n-1-idx - 1? Actually, we require that the two sets are disjoint. So the last index of the prefix (i-1) must be less than the first index of the suffix (n-1-idx). Therefore: i-1 < n-1-idx  => i < n - idx.\n\n                # But note: the dictionary d[s] gives the number of candies in the prefix (which is i). So we require: d[s] < n - (idx+1) ? Actually, the suffix part has idx+1 candies, so the first index of the suffix is n - (idx+1). Therefore, the condition is: the prefix part ends at index d[s]-1, and we require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). That is: d[s] <= n - (idx+1) - 1? Actually, we require that the prefix part does not include the suffix part's starting index. The condition is: d[s] (the count of prefix) must be <= n - (idx+1) (because the suffix part starts at index n - (idx+1), and the prefix part ends at index d[s]-1, so we require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1) => d[s] <= n - (idx+1)).\n\n                # However, note: the problem does not check for non-overlap? Why? Because the way we built the prefix and suffix: we break the prefix when the sum exceeds x (which is half the total). But note: if the entire array is taken, then the prefix and suffix would cover the entire array? Actually, that would require the entire array to be partitioned? But then the prefix and suffix would meet? For example, if n is even, then the prefix takes the first n/2 and the suffix takes the last n/2? Then the prefix ends at n/2-1 and the suffix starts at n/2? So they are adjacent? That is non-overlapping? Actually, they are disjoint. So the condition is: the prefix part ends at i-1 and the suffix part starts at j, and we require i-1 < j. In the entire array taken: if we take the entire array as two halves, then i = n/2, j = n/2 -> then the prefix part ends at n/2-1 and the suffix part starts at n/2 -> so disjoint.\n\n                # Therefore, the condition is: the prefix part (with count i) and the suffix part (with count j) must satisfy: i + j <= n? Actually, that is the condition for disjoint? But note: they are disjoint if the prefix part is [0, i-1] and the suffix part is [n-j, n-1]. Then we require i-1 < n-j? That is: i+j <= n? Actually, i+j <= n is equivalent to i-1 < n-j? \n                #   i-1 < n-j  => i+j < n+1 => i+j <= n? Actually, if i and j are integers, then i-1 < n-j  => i+j < n+1 => i+j <= n.\n\n                # But note: the problem does not check for non-overlap? Why? Because the way we built the prefix: we break when the prefix sum exceeds x (which is total_sum/2). And the suffix we are building: if the suffix sum is s and we have a prefix sum s, then the total of the two parts is 2*s. The entire array has total_sum. We require 2*s <= total_sum? Actually, we have x = total_sum//2, so if s is in the dictionary, then s <= x. And the suffix sum s is also <= x? Actually, we break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds x, but we don't break the suffix? However, if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we can break? But note: we are only checking for s in the dictionary (which only has keys <= x). So if the suffix sum becomes greater than x, then we won't find it in the dictionary? So we can break the suffix loop when s > x? That would be an optimization.\n\n                # However, the problem does not do that. But we can do:\n\n                #   if s > x: break   # because then we won't find a matching prefix (since we only stored prefix sums <= x)\n\n                # But note: the problem does not have that. The provided code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\".\n\n                # What we need to do: \n                #   if s is in the dictionary, then we have a candidate: total candies = d[s] (from prefix) + (idx+1) (from suffix). But we must check that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that is the condition for non-overlap? But note: the condition for non-overlap is d[s] <= n - (idx+1) (as argued above). However, if we have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the sets are disjoint? Actually, the prefix part has d[s] candies and the suffix part has (idx+1) candies, and if the total is <= n, then they are disjoint? But what if the entire array is taken? Then d[s] + (idx+1) = n? That is acceptable? Actually, that is the entire array. But note: the entire array must be partitioned? Then the condition is that the prefix part and suffix part together cover the entire array? But that would require that the prefix part and suffix part are adjacent? Actually, the entire array is partitioned if the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix part starts at n - (idx+1). Then we require d[s] = n - (idx+1)? Actually, no: the entire array is partitioned if the prefix part covers [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix part covers [n - (idx+1), n-1] and we require that d[s] = n - (idx+1) so that the next candy after the prefix is the first candy of the suffix? Actually, no: the entire array is partitioned if the two sets are disjoint and together they form the entire array. That requires d[s] + (idx+1) = n and the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix part starts at d[s]? Then they are adjacent. So that is acceptable.\n\n                # Therefore, the condition for non-overlap is automatically satisfied if the two sets of indices are disjoint? But note: we are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right. The only issue is if the prefix part and suffix part overlap? How can they overlap? They can only overlap if the prefix part extends into the suffix part? But we are building independently. However, the condition is that the prefix part must be entirely to the left of the suffix part. The suffix part starts at index n - (idx+1). The prefix part ends at index d[s]-1. We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  => d[s] <= n - (idx+1). So if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the sets are disjoint? Actually, that is the condition: the total number of candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1) and if that is <= n, then there are at least that many candies? But note: the entire array has n candies. So if we take d[s] from the left and (idx+1) from the right, and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the sets are disjoint? Actually, the sets are disjoint if the prefix part does not include any of the suffix part. The suffix part occupies the last (idx+1) positions. The prefix part occupies the first d[s] positions. The condition for disjointness is that the first d[s] positions and the last (idx+1) positions do not overlap. The overlap would occur if the last (idx+1) positions start at an index that is less than d[s]? Actually, the last (idx+1) positions are from index n - (idx+1) to n-1. The prefix part is from 0 to d[s]-1. They are disjoint if d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  => d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 <= n - (idx+1) - 1, which is strictly less than n - (idx+1). So they are disjoint.\n\n                # Therefore, we can simply check: if s is in the dictionary, then candidate = d[s] + (idx+1). And we want the maximum candidate that is at most n? Actually, we don't need to check <= n because d[s] is at most n (but we broke the prefix at x, which is half the total, so d[s] is at most the entire prefix? but the entire prefix is n, but we break when the prefix sum exceeds x, which is at most total_sum/2, so the prefix length might be less than n). Similarly, the suffix length is at most n. And d[s] + (idx+1) might be greater than n? But we have the condition that the sets must be disjoint. We require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the condition for disjointness is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? But note: if d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then the two sets must overlap? So we must avoid that.\n\n                # However, note: the dictionary d was built for the entire prefix? Actually, we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x. So d[s] is defined only for prefix sums <= x, and the suffix sum s is also <= x? But note: the entire array has total_sum = 2*x (if even) or 2*x+1 (if odd). So if we have a candidate s, then 2*s <= total_sum. The entire array has n candies. The candidate total candies is d[s] + (idx+1). We must have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the entire array has n candies, so we cannot take more than n candies. But note: the two sets are disjoint, so the total candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1) and that must be <= n. However, it is possible that d[s] + (idx+1) > n? For example, if the entire array is taken? Then d[s] + (idx+1) = n? So it's <= n. But if we have a candidate that is greater than n, that would be impossible. How can we get a candidate greater than n? Actually, we cannot because the prefix part is at most n and the suffix part is at most n, but together they cannot exceed n? Actually, they are disjoint, so the total is at most n. Therefore, we don't need to check for <= n? Actually, the condition for disjointness is automatically satisfied by the candidate? But note: we built the prefix and suffix independently. It is possible that the prefix part and suffix part overlap? For example, if we have a very small array? \n\n                # Example: n=1, then we break the prefix building? Actually, the prefix building: x = total_sum//2. total_sum = w0. Then x = w0//2. Then we start building prefix: s=w0, which is > w0//2? Actually, if w0>=1, then w0 > w0//2 (if w0>=1). So we break without storing the prefix? Then the dictionary d is empty. Then the suffix loop: we add the only candy: s=w0, then check if w0 in d? It's not. So we don't update. Then r=0. That is correct: they cannot both eat the same weight because if Alice eats the candy, Bob has nothing, and vice versa.\n\n                # Another example: n=2, [1,1]. Then total_sum=2, x=1. \n                #   Prefix: \n                #       first candy: s=1 -> store d[1]=1 (then we break because 1>1? Actually, we break when s > x? But 1==1, so we don't break? Then we continue? Actually, the condition is \"if s > x: break\". So we break? Actually, the code says: \n                #           for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                #               s += i\n                #               if s > x: break\n                #               d[s] = idx+1\n                #       So for the first candy: s=1, which is not > x (which is 1), so we set d[1]=1. Then next candy: s=2, which is >1 -> break.\n                #   Then suffix: \n                #       a[::-1] = [1,1]\n                #       idx=0: i=1 -> s=1 -> check: 1 in d -> candidate = d[1] + 1 = 1+1 = 2 -> update r=2.\n                #       Then next: idx=1: i=1 -> s=2 -> 2 not in d? (because we broke the prefix at 2, and we only stored prefix sum 1) -> so we break? Actually, we don't break the suffix loop? But we can break when s>1? We can add: if s > x: break. But the problem doesn't have that. However, we can add that for efficiency? But the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded.\n\n                #   But note: the candidate 2 is valid? The entire array is taken: Alice takes the first candy (weight 1) and Bob takes the last candy (weight 1). They are disjoint? The entire array is taken: the prefix part is [0] and the suffix part is [1] (if 0-indexed). Then the condition: d[s] (which is 1) + (idx+1)=1+1=2 <= n=2 -> valid.\n\n                #   So we update r = max(r, 2).\n\n                # Therefore, we can do:\n\n                #   if s in d:\n                #       candidate = d[s] + (idx+1)\n                #       if candidate <= n:   # actually, we know candidate<=n because the sets are disjoint? But we argued that the condition for disjointness is candidate<=n? Actually, the condition for disjointness is candidate<=n? And we know the entire array has n candies. So candidate cannot exceed n? Actually, the prefix part has d[s] candies and the suffix part has (idx+1) candies, and they are disjoint, so candidate = d[s] + (idx+1) must be <= n. Therefore, we don't need to check? But what if the prefix part and suffix part overlap? How can that happen? \n\n                #   Actually, the way we built the prefix and suffix: the prefix is from the left and the suffix from the right. The only way they can overlap is if the prefix part extends beyond the middle and the suffix part starts before the end? But we are building independently. However, the condition for disjointness is that the prefix part ends at index d[s]-1 and the suffix part starts at index n - (idx+1). We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  => d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 <= n - (idx+1) - 1, which is strictly less than n - (idx+1). So they are disjoint.\n\n                #   But note: if d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then the condition fails? How can that happen? \n                #       d[s] is the number of candies in the prefix (so d[s] <= n) and (idx+1) is the number of candies in the suffix (so <= n). But if d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then the two sets must overlap? Actually, the entire array has n candies. If we take d[s] from the left and (idx+1) from the right, and d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one candy is taken twice? So we must avoid that.\n\n                #   However, note: the condition for disjointness is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, the sets are disjoint if and only if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Because the entire array has n candies. So if the total candies taken is greater than n, then there must be an overlap? Therefore, we must check that candidate <= n? But note: the entire array has n candies, so we cannot take more than n candies. Therefore, we must only consider candidate <= n? Actually, the problem does not allow taking the same candy twice.\n\n                #   But in our candidate, we are counting the same candy twice? How? We are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right. The prefix part is the first d[s] candies. The suffix part is the last (idx+1) candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two sets are disjoint. We must ensure that the two sets are disjoint? How? We can check: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint? Actually, the entire array has n candies. The prefix part takes d[s] candies and the suffix part takes (idx+1) candies. The only way they can be disjoint is if the prefix part does not include any of the last (idx+1) candies. The last (idx+1) candies are the last (idx+1) in the array. The prefix part is the first d[s] candies. The condition is: the first d[s] candies and the last (idx+1) candies do not share any candy. The entire array is a contiguous row. The condition is: the last (idx+1) candies start at index n - (idx+1). The prefix part ends at index d[s]-1. We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  => d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 <= n - (idx+1) - 1, which is strictly less than n - (idx+1). So they are disjoint.\n\n                #   Therefore, if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint? Actually, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is equivalent to the disjointness condition? \n\n                #   But note: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the two sets are disjoint? Actually, the entire array has n candies. The prefix part takes d[s] candies from the left, and the suffix part takes (idx+1) candies from the right. The total number of candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1). If that is <= n, then there are n - (d[s]+(idx+1)) candies in the middle that are not taken. So the sets are disjoint? Yes.\n\n                #   However, what if the prefix part and suffix part are adjacent? Then d[s] + (idx+1) = n? Then the entire array is taken? Then the sets are disjoint? Actually, they are adjacent: the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix part starts at d[s] (because the suffix part starts at n - (idx+1) = n - (n - d[s]) = d[s]). So they are adjacent? Then disjoint? Yes.\n\n                #   Therefore, we can update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) without any further condition? But note: the condition for disjointness is automatically satisfied by the candidate? Actually, the candidate d[s] + (idx+1) is the total number of candies taken, and if that is <= n, then the sets are disjoint? But wait: what if the prefix part and suffix part overlap? Then the total number of distinct candies taken would be less than d[s] + (idx+1). But we are counting the same candy twice? Actually, we are not: the problem states that if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So we are only counting distinct candies? But the candidate d[s] + (idx+1) is the count of candies in the prefix plus the count in the suffix. If there is an overlap, then we are double-counting? But we are not: the problem does not allow that. So we must avoid any candidate that would cause overlap.\n\n                #   Therefore, we must check that the two sets are disjoint. How? We can check: if the prefix part ends at d[s]-1 < the suffix part starts at n - (idx+1). But we don't have the indices stored? We have the counts. The condition is: d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\n                #   Actually, the suffix part of (idx+1) candies starts at index n - (idx+1). The prefix part of d[s] candies ends at index d[s]-1. We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n  => d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then d[s]-1 <= n - (idx+1) - 1 < n - (idx+1). So the condition holds.\n\n                #   Therefore, if we have a candidate with d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then the sets are disjoint?

But wait: we argued that if the candidate is d[s] + (idx+1) and it is <= n, then the sets are disjoint? But note: the candidate might be <= n but the sets might still overlap? \n\n                #   Example: n=3, and we have a candidate: prefix part: 2 candies (so d[s]=2) and suffix part: 2 candies (so idx+1=2). Then candidate=4>3 -> we skip. But what if we have candidate=3? Then d[s]=2, idx+1=1. Then the prefix part: indices [0,1] and the suffix part: the last 1 candy: index [2]. Then disjoint? Yes. Condition: 2+1=3<=3 -> holds.\n\n                #   Another candidate: d[s]=1, idx+1=2: then the prefix part: [0] and the suffix part: [1,2]. Then disjoint? Yes.

But note: the entire array is [0,1,2]. The suffix part of 1 candy: the last candy is at index 2. So the sets are disjoint? Yes.\n\n                #   But what if we have a candidate: d[s]=2, idx+1=2? Then 2+2=4>3 -> we skip.\n\n                #   Therefore, we must check that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is necessary and sufficient for disjointness? \n\n                #   However, note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary because the entire array has n candies. And it is sufficient? Because if we take d[s] from the left and (idx+1) from the right, and the total is <= n, then the two sets must be disjoint? Why? Because the entire array is contiguous. The left part starts at 0 and goes to d[s]-1. The right part starts at n-1 and goes left for (idx+1) candies. The right part starts at n-1 and goes to n - (idx+1). The condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is equivalent to d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the last index of the left part is d[s]-1 <= n - (idx+1) - 1, which is strictly less than n - (idx+1). Therefore, the two intervals [0, d[s]-1] and [n - (idx+1), n-1] are disjoint.\n\n                #   Therefore, we can update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) without an explicit check for the indices? Actually, we have the condition that the candidate total candies = d[s] + (idx+1) must be <= n? But note: the entire array has n candies, so we cannot take more than n candies. And the problem does not allow taking the same candy twice. Therefore, we must have candidate <= n. But we are iterating and the candidate might be > n? How? \n\n                #   Example: n=3, [1,1,1]. Then total_sum=3, x=1 (because 3//2=1). \n                #       Prefix: \n                #           first candy: s=1 -> store d[1]=1.\n                #           second candy: s=2 -> break? because 2>1? -> break.\n                #       Suffix:\n                #           first candy from right: s=1 -> check: 1 in d -> candidate = 1+1=2 <=3 -> update r=2.\n                #           second candy: s=2 -> 2 not in d -> skip.\n                #           third candy: s=3 -> not in d -> skip.\n                #       Then we output 2.\n\n                #   But what if we have a candidate that is 3? That would require the entire array? Then the prefix part would be the entire array? But we broke the prefix at the second candy? So we don't have a prefix sum for 3? And the suffix part for 3 would be the entire array? But we are building the suffix from the right: we start with the last candy (1) then the next (1) then the next (1). Then s=3, which is not in d. So we don't get candidate 3.\n\n                #   How to get candidate 3? We would need the prefix sum to be 1.5? But weights are integers. So the entire array cannot be partitioned equally? The total is 3, so we cannot have two sets of 1.5? So the maximum candidate is 2.\n\n                #   Therefore, we can update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) without checking the <= n? Actually, the candidate is always <= n? Why? Because the prefix part has at most n candies and the suffix part has at most n candies, but the entire array has n candies. And the two sets are disjoint? Actually, we are building the prefix and suffix independently, but the condition for disjointness is that the total candies taken is at most n? And we are only considering candidate = d[s] + (idx+1) which is the total number of candies taken? And we know that the entire array has n candies, so candidate cannot exceed n? Actually, the entire array has n candies, so the maximum distinct candies we can take is n. Therefore, candidate = d[s] + (idx+1) is at most n? \n\n                #   But note: we are building the prefix and suffix independently. The prefix part is a contiguous segment at the left, and the suffix part is a contiguous segment at the right. The two segments might overlap? How? They can only overlap if the prefix part extends into the suffix part? But the condition for disjointness is that the prefix part ends before the suffix part starts. We argued that if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint. But what if d[s] + (idx+1) > n? Then they must overlap? And we should not consider that candidate? \n\n                #   Therefore, we must check that d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n\n                #   However, note: the entire array has n candies. The prefix part has d[s] candies and the suffix part has (idx+1) candies. The total distinct candies taken is d[s] + (idx+1) only if they are disjoint. If they overlap, then the total distinct candies taken is less than d[s] + (idx+1). But the problem does not allow taking the same candy twice. So we cannot have a candidate that counts the same candy twice. Therefore, we must ensure the two sets are disjoint. The condition is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? \n\n                #   Therefore, we do:\n\n                #       if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                #           r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n                #   But note: we can break the suffix loop when s > x? Because then we won't find any more matches? \n\n                #   We can add: \n                #       if s > x: \n                #           break   # because the suffix sum is already > x, and we only stored prefix sums <= x, so no more matches.\n\n                #   This is an optimization.\n\n                #   However, the problem does not have that. But we can add it to avoid unnecessary iterations? The constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, but worst-case one test case can be 200000, and we break the suffix loop early? \n\n                #   But note: the suffix sum might start small and then become large? And we break when it exceeds x? \n\n                #   So the complete code for the suffix loop:\n\n                #       s = 0\n                #       r = 0\n                #       for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                #           s += i\n                #           if s > x: \n                #               break\n                #           if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                #               r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n                #   But wait: what if the suffix sum is not greater than x, but we have a candidate that is greater than n? Then we skip? But we already break the prefix building at x, and the suffix sum is <= x, so d[s] is defined and we check the candidate condition.\n\n                #   However, note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary.\n\n                #   But the problem's provided code does not have the break for s>x? And the TODO is only one line? Actually, the TODO is in the if block: \"if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n                #   So we are only allowed to fill in the TODO part? \n\n                #   The provided code:\n\n                #       s, r = 0, 0\n                #       for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                #           s += i\n                #           if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n                #   We are to fill in the block for the if statement.\n\n                #   We can do:\n\n                #       if s in d:\n                #           if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                #               r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n                #   But note: we also want to break the suffix loop when s > x? But that is not in the if block? We cannot change the loop? The TODO is only inside the if block.\n\n                #   Therefore, we cannot add the break for s>x? \n\n                #   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is only in the TODO part.\n\n                #   However, we can add an extra condition to break? But the TODO is only inside the if block. We cannot break the loop from inside the if block? \n\n                #   Alternatively, we can note that if s > x, then we break? But we are not allowed to change the loop? \n\n                #   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" \n\n                #   We are allowed to output the entire missing block? \n\n                #   The TODO is: \n                #       if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n                #   We can do:\n\n                #       if s in d:\n                #           total_candies = d[s] + idx + 1\n                #           if total_candies <= n:\n                #               r = max(r, total_candies)\n\n                #   But note: we also want to break the loop when s > x? But we cannot do that in the if block? \n\n                #   However, the problem does not break the suffix loop. But the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the worst-case for one test case is 200000, so the suffix loop will run at most 200000 iterations? And the total over test cases is 200000, so worst-case we do 200000 iterations per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so there is only one test case? Then we do 200000 iterations. That is acceptable in Python? 200000 iterations is acceptable.\n\n                #   Therefore, we don't need to break for s>x? \n\n                #   But note: the suffix sum might become greater than x, and then we won't find any more matches? But we are still iterating? We can break early? But the problem does not require it.\n\n                #   So we'll do:\n\n                #       if s in d:\n                #           total_candies = d[s] + idx + 1\n                #           if total_candies <= n:\n                #               if total_candies > r:\n                #                   r = total_candies\n\n                #   Or simply: r = max(r, total_candies)\n\n                #   But note: we are iterating from the right, and we might find a candidate with a small suffix sum first? But we want the maximum total candies? So we take the max.\n\n                #   However, it is possible that we find a candidate with a small total first and then a larger one? So we do max.\n\n                #   But note: the suffix sum is increasing as we add more candies? And the prefix sum we stored is fixed? So if we find a candidate with a small suffix part (small idx+1) and then a larger one, then the total candies might be larger? Actually, the suffix part is built from the right: we start with the last candy, then the last two, etc. So the number of candies in the suffix (idx+1) is increasing. But the suffix sum is also increasing. And we are matching with a fixed prefix sum? Actually, we are matching the same s? But s is increasing? So if we have two different suffix sums that are both s, then the one with fewer candies? But we want the maximum total candies? Actually, we want the maximum total candies (prefix count + suffix count). For a fixed s, we want the smallest prefix count? Actually, no: the dictionary d stores the prefix count for a given prefix sum. But note: we built the prefix from left to right, and we stored the first occurrence of a prefix sum? Actually, we store the last occurrence? \n\n                #   How do we build the dictionary?\n                #       for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                #           s += i\n                #           if s > x: break\n                #           d[s] = idx+1\n                #       This stores the prefix sum s at the last candy that forms that sum? Actually, it stores the cumulative sum at each step. And if the same prefix sum appears again? But the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Because all weights are positive. So each prefix sum is unique? \n\n                #   Therefore, for a given s, there is at most one prefix count.\n\n                #   And for the suffix: we are iterating from the right, and we are building the suffix sum. The same suffix sum s might appear again? But the suffix sums are also strictly increasing? Because we are adding positive numbers. So each suffix sum is unique? \n\n                #   Therefore, for a given s, we have one candidate: d[s] + (idx+1). \n\n                #   But note: we might have the same s appearing in the suffix at different positions? Actually, no: because the suffix sum is strictly increasing. \n\n                #   Therefore, we can simply update r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) if the candidate is <= n.\n\n                #   However, it is possible that we have multiple matches for the same s? But the prefix sum s is stored only once? And the suffix sum s is encountered only once? \n\n                #   Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n                #       if s in d:\n                #           candidate = d[s] + (idx+1)\n                #           if candidate <= n:\n                #               r = max(r, candidate)\n\n                #   But note: the problem does not break the suffix loop when s>x? We are not allowed to change that? \n\n                #   However, we can add an extra condition to break? But we are inside the if block. We cannot break the loop from inside the if block? \n\n                #   Alternatively, we can note that if s > x, then we break? But we are not allowed to change the loop? \n\n                #   Since the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, we don't worry.\n\n                #   But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so the worst-case total iterations (over all test cases) is 200000? Actually, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we are safe.\n\n                #   Therefore, we output for program1.py: \n                #       candidate = d[s] + idx + 1\n                #       if candidate <= n:\n                #           r = max(r, candidate)\n\n                #   But note: the variable `idx` in the suffix loop: \n                #       for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]): \n                #   The first element has idx=0, then 1, ... \n                #   The number of candies in the suffix is idx+1.\n\n                #   So we can write: \n                #       candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n                #       if candies_count <= n:\n                #           r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n                #   However, note: the entire array might be partitioned? Then candies_count = n? That is acceptable.\n\n                #   But what if the entire array is partitioned? Then the prefix part and suffix part together cover the entire array? And they are disjoint? Then it's valid.\n\n                #   Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                #       candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n                #       if candies_count <= n:\n                #           r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n                #   But note: we must be cautious: the condition for disjointness is candies_count <= n? And we argued that it is equivalent to disjointness? \n\n                #   So we do that.\n\n For program2.py:\n   The problem is straightforward: given a rating, output the division.\n\n   The code:\n\n        n=int(input())\n        while n:\n            num=int(input())\n            if num>=1900: print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif num>=1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif num>=1400: # TODO: Your code here\n            else: print(\"Division 4\")\n            n-=1\n\n   The TODO is in the elif block for num>=1400.\n\n   According to the problem:\n        Division 1: rating >= 1900\n        Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> so we have already checked num>=1600 and we know num<1900? Actually, the condition is: \n            if num>=1900: ... \n            elif num>=1600: ...   # so 1600<=num<1900\n            elif num>=1400: ...   # so 1400<=num<1600\n            else: ...             # num<1400\n\n   So for the TODO, we should print \"Division 3\".\n\n   Therefore, the missing code is: \n        print(\"Division 3\")\n\n   But note: the problem says: \n        For Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n\n   And we are in the condition: num>=1400 and we know that it is not >=1600 (because of the elif), so it is in [1400, 1599] -> Division 3.\n\n   So we output: \n        print(\"Division 3\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output a JSON with two keys.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\\n            if candies_count <= n:\\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\",\n            \"program2\": \"            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code? \n\n   In program1.py, the TODO is inside the for loop and inside the if block. The current indentation level is 8 spaces (from the for loop and the if). We are to fill in the block with 12 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n        for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n            s += i\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So the TODO is at the same indentation as the body of the for loop? Then the if block is at 8 spaces. Then the body of the if should be indented by 12 spaces.\n\n   We write:\n\n        if s in d:\n            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n            if candies_count <= n:\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n   But note: the variable r is defined as 0 at the beginning.\n\n   However, the problem might have multiple matches? And we want the maximum.\n\n   But note: the suffix sum is increasing? And the prefix sum we stored is fixed? And the candidate total candies might be increasing as we add more to the suffix? Actually, the suffix count (idx+1) is increasing. But the candidate total candies = d[s] + (idx+1) is increasing? But d[s] is fixed for a given s. So as we add more candies to the suffix, the count increases. But we are matching the same s? How? The suffix sum s is increasing? So we cannot have the same s twice? \n\n   Therefore, we can break after the first match for a given s? But we don't know: we might have a larger candidate later? Actually, the suffix sum is increasing, so we will not get the same s again? \n\n   Therefore, we don't need to break.\n\n   So the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n   But note: we must be cautious: the condition for non-overlap (candies_count<=n) is necessary.\n\n   Let's test with the example: n=2, [1,1] \n        prefix: \n            a = [1,1]\n            x = (1+1)//2 = 1\n            d: \n                index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                index1: s=2 -> break -> d has {1:1}\n        suffix: \n            a[::-1] = [1,1]\n            idx0: s=1 -> in d: candies_count = 1+0+1 = 2 -> 2<=2 -> r = max(0,2)=2.\n            idx1: s=2 -> not in d -> skip.\n        output: 2 -> correct.\n\n   Example: n=3, [1,2,1] \n        total_sum=4, x=2.\n        prefix:\n            index0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n            index1: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break.\n            so d = {1:1}\n        suffix:\n            a[::-1] = [1,2,1]\n            idx0: s=1 -> in d: candies_count = 1+0+1=2 -> 2<=3 -> r=2.\n            idx1: s=1+2=3 -> not in d -> skip.\n            idx2: s=1+2+1=4 -> not in d -> skip.\n        output: 2.\n\n        But is there a better solution? \n            Alice: [1] (weight=1), Bob: [1] (weight=1) -> total candies=2.\n            Or Alice: [1,2] (weight=3) and Bob: [1,2]? But Bob eats from the right: the last two: [2,1] -> weight=3? Then they are equal? Then total candies=4? But wait: the entire array? \n            But note: Alice eats from the left: [1,2] -> indices0 and 1.\n            Bob eats from the right: the last two: indices1 and 2? But then candy at index1 is eaten by both? That is not allowed.\n\n        How about Alice: [1] (left) and Bob: [1] (right) -> total=2.\n\n        How about Alice: [1,2] (left) and Bob: [1] (right) -> then Alice=3, Bob=1 -> not equal.\n\n        How about Alice: [1] (left) and Bob: [1,2] (right) -> but Bob eats from the right: the last two: [2,1] -> weight=3? Then Alice=1, Bob=3 -> not equal.\n\n        How about Alice: [1,2,1] (entire left) and Bob: nothing? -> not equal.\n\n        How about Alice: nothing and Bob: entire? -> not equal.\n\n        How about Alice: [1,2] (left) and Bob: [1] (right) -> but Bob eats from the right: the last candy is 1?

Actually, Bob eats from the right: the last candy is 1 (at index3) and then the next is 3 (at index2)? But we want contiguous from the right? Actually, Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right? The problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). So Bob must eat the last k candies? \n\n                    Therefore, Bob can only eat the last candy? or the last two? or the last three? \n                    If Bob eats the last candy: weight=1 -> not 3.\n                    If Bob eats the last two: [1,3] -> weight=1+3=4 -> not 3.\n                    If Bob eats the last three: [3,1,?] -> but the last three: [3,1] and then the next? Actually, the last three: the candies at indices 1,2,3? But that is not contiguous from the right? The last three: indices 1,2,3? But the array is [1,2,3,1] -> the last three: [2,3,1]? weight=2+3+1=6.\n\n                    How about Bob eats the last one? then weight=1.\n                    How about Bob eats the last two? then [3,1] -> weight=4.\n                    How about Bob eats the last three? then [2,3,1] -> weight=6.\n\n                    So Bob cannot get a sum of 3 from the right? \n\n                How about Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1] (the last candy: 1) -> not equal.\n\n                How about Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [1] (the last candy: 1) -> total=2.\n\n                How about Alice: [2,3] (5) and Bob: [3,1] (4) -> not equal.\n\n                How about Alice: [1,2,3] (6) and Bob: [1] (1) -> not equal.\n\n                How about Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [3,1] (4) -> not equal.\n\n                How about Alice: [1,2,3,1] (7) and Bob: nothing -> not equal.\n\n                So the answer is 2.\n\n            Therefore, our code outputs 2.\n\n        But what if we have: n=4, [1,1,1,1] \n            total_sum=4, x=2.\n            prefix:\n                index0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                index1: s=2 -> d[2]=2 -> then next?\n                index2: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break.\n                d = {1:1, 2:2}\n            suffix:\n                a[::-1]=[1,1,1,1]\n                idx0: s=1 -> in d: candidate=1+0+1=2 -> r=2.\n                idx1: s=2 -> in d: candidate=2+1+1=4 -> 4<=4 -> r=4.\n                idx2: s=3 -> not in d -> skip.\n                idx3: s=4 -> not in d -> skip.\n            output=4.\n\n            Correct: Alice takes the first two (1+1=2) and Bob takes the last two (1+1=2) -> total=4.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n            if candies_count <= n:\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n        We write it as a string with the same indentation.\n\n        For program2.py: \n            We output: \n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But note: the indentation: the TODO is at the same level as the previous print statements? \n\n        The code:\n\n            if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n            else:print(\"Division 4\")\n\n        We need to replace the TODO line with:\n\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But note: the previous lines have no space? Actually, they are at the same indentation? \n\n        The code we are to output for program2.py is: \n            \"            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But the existing line has \"            elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\", so we replace the entire line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the completion for the block? \n\n        The TODO is in the condition, and we are to output the code for that branch.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But note: the existing line has the condition and the comment. We are replacing that line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the block? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            elif num>=1400: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can replace that line with:\n\n            elif num>=1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But wait, the next line is \"else: ...\", so we cannot break the structure? \n\n        Actually, the code after the TODO is:\n\n            else: print(\"Division 4\")\n\n        So if we replace the TODO line with:\n\n            elif num>=1400: \n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        Then the else would be at the same level? \n\n        But the original code has:\n\n            elif num>=1400: # TODO: Your code here\n            else: print(\"Division 4\")\n\n        We can do:\n\n            elif num>=1400: \n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But then the else would be at the same level as the elif? \n\n        Actually, the current code has the else at the same indentation as the if and elif. So we can write:\n\n            elif num>=1400: \n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we are to output the code that goes in the TODO part? \n\n        The TODO is only the body of the elif? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We can interpret: the block for the elif is missing. So we output:\n\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But with the same indentation as the other print statements? \n\n        The other print statements are at the same level? Actually, the code:\n\n            if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n            ...\n\n        They are all on the same line. But the TODO is on a line by itself? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But then we are changing the line? The problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the body of the elif is missing. The other branches have the print on the same line. But we can also put the print on the same line? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But then the next line is \"else: ...\", so we must not break the structure.\n\n        However, the problem's code for the other branches are on the same line. So we can do:\n\n            elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But the TODO is in the middle of the line? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n            n=int(input())\n            while n:\n                num=int(input())\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n                else:print(\"Division 4\")\n                n-=1\n\n        We are to replace the line with the TODO. We can replace the entire line with:\n\n                elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But then the else: ... is still there? \n\n        Actually, the next line is \"else: ...\", so we cannot remove it? \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the body of the elif as a separate line? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We can output:\n\n            \"            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        and then the next line (the else) remains? \n\n        But the current line has the condition and the TODO. We are replacing the entire line? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\", and the TODO is a comment. We are to fill in the block? \n\n        The intended structure is:\n\n            if ...: ...\n            elif ...: ...\n            elif ...: \n                ...   # we fill this\n            else: ...\n\n        But the provided code has the TODO as a comment in the condition line. We can write:\n\n            elif num>=1400: \n                print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But then the else: ... must be dedented? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write the entire block for the elif? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output only the body of the elif? \n\n        How about:\n\n            \"    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But the other branches are on the same line? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            We output for program2: \" print(\\\"Division 3\\\") \" and then the next line (the else) remains? \n\n        But the current line is:\n\n                elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can replace that line with:\n\n                elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        Then the else: ... will be the next line? \n\n        But the else: ... is at the same level? \n\n        The code becomes:\n\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n                else:print(\"Division 4\")\n\n        That is valid.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py: \n            \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But wait, the original line has 12 spaces? (because it is inside the while and the input). \n\n        The code we are replacing is:\n\n            \"            elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        We replace it with:\n\n            \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the missing line? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are replacing one line with one line.\n\n        Alternatively, if we are only to output the body, then we output:\n\n            \" print(\\\"Division 3\\\") \"\n\n        and then the next line (the else) remains? But that would break the structure? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing at the TODO. \n\n        Since the TODO is in the condition line, and the condition line is already there, we only need to output the body? But the body is missing. \n\n        How about we output:\n\n            \"print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        and then the next line (the else) remains? But then the condition line has no body? \n\n        Actually, the condition line has a colon and then a comment. We can remove the comment and put the print? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that should be in the body? \n\n        The body should be indented? \n\n        The condition is at 12 spaces, then the body should be 16 spaces? \n\n        But the other conditions have the body on the same line? \n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py: \n            \" print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But then we would have:\n\n                elif num>=1400: \n                    print(\"Division 3\")\n\n        But the problem's code does not have the body on a new line? \n\n        Actually, the problem's code for the other conditions have the body on the same line. \n\n        So we must put the body on the same line? \n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py: \n            \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But note: we are replacing the entire line.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might expect only the body? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We'll follow the structure of the other branches: they have the condition and the print on the same line. \n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py: \n            \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But then the next line (the else) is still there? \n\n        The code becomes:\n\n            n=int(input())\n            while n:\n                num=int(input())\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n                else:print(\"Division 4\")\n                n-=1\n\n        That is valid.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output a JSON.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\\n            if candies_count <= n:\\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\",\n                \"program2\": \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n            }\n\n        But note: in program1, the code we output is a block of three lines? \n\n        We must be careful with the newlines and indentation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire block for program1 as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n        The current code for program1 at the TODO is:\n\n            if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n            if candies_count <= n:\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n        But the indentation: the if is at 8 spaces (from the for loop), then the body of the if should be 12 spaces? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\\n            if candies_count <= n:\\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\"\n\n        This has:\n            Line1: 12 spaces (the current indentation) + \"candies_count = ...\"\n            Line2: 12 spaces + \"if ...\"\n            Line3: 16 spaces + \"r = ...\"\n\n        But the for loop body is at 8 spaces, and the if is at 8 spaces? Actually, the code:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s in d: \n                    ...   # we are here: at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the for loop is at 4 spaces (because the while t: or for test case loop? but the provided code for program1.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = [*map(int, input().split())]\n                x = sum(a) // 2\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x: break\n                    d[s] = idx + 1\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                    s += i\n                    if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n        The TODO is inside two loops: the outer for test cases, and then the inner for the suffix. The inner for loop is at 8 spaces. The body of the for loop is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the line \"s += i\" is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Then the if s in d: is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Then the TODO block should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        But the code we output for program1 is:\n\n            candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n            if candies_count <= n:\n                r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n        We must indent each line by 4 more spaces? \n\n        Actually, the current if s in d: is at 12 spaces, and the body of the if should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"                candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\\n                if candies_count <= n:\\n                    r = max(r, candies_count)\"\n\n        But wait, the entire block is inside the if s in d: which is at 12 spaces. So the body of the if should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n                candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\n                if candies_count <= n:\n                    r = max(r, candies_count)\n\n        We output that as a string with newlines.\n\n        For program2, we output the entire line that replaces the TODO line.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"                candies_count = d[s] + idx + 1\\n                if candies_count <= n:\\n                    r = max(r, candies_count)\",\n                \"program2\": \"            elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 line: the existing line that we are replacing is at 12 spaces? \n\n        The code:\n\n            while n:\n                ...   # 4 spaces\n                ...   # 8 spaces for the input and conditions\n\n        Actually, the code for program2:\n\n            n=int(input())\n            while n:\n                num=int(input())\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600:print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n                else:print(\"Division 4\")\n                n-=1\n\n        The conditions are at 8 spaces? \n\n        But the line we are replacing is:\n\n                elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        which is at 8 spaces? \n\n        But we output \"            elif ...\", which is 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing line has 8 spaces? \n\n        We must output the same indentation? \n\n        The existing line: \n            \"                elif num>=1400:# TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        How many spaces? The entire block is indented by 4 (from the while n:). Then the condition lines are indented by 4 more? So 8 spaces? \n\n        Therefore, we output for program2: \n            \"                elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But wait, the existing line has 16 characters of indentation? (8 spaces? Actually, 4 for the while, then 4 for the inner block? so 8 spaces). \n\n        We output 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, we output the same as the existing line but with the body? \n\n        So:\n\n            \"                elif num>=1400: print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\"\n\n        But note: the existing line has 16 spaces?
