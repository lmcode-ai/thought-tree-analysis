The template has: if num>=1900: print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif num>=1600: # TODO: Your code here\n    elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n    else: print(\"Division 4\") We note that the conditions for division 2 are: 1600 <= rating <= 1899. But note that the condition for division 1 is already taken (>=1900). So for the next condition (>=1600) we must check that it is also below 1900? Actually, the condition above (>=1900) has already been handled, so by the time we get to the condition `num>=1600`, we know that `num` is less than 1900. Therefore, we can simply print \"Division 2\" for the condition `num>=1600`. But wait: the problem states: Division 1: >=1900\n  Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 (inclusive)\n  Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive)\n  Division 4: <=1399 So the condition for division 2 is exactly when 1600<=num<=1899. However, because we have already checked for >=1900, then the condition `num>=1600` will only be true for 1600<=num<=1899. Similarly, the next condition `num>=1400` will be for 1400<=num<=1599 (because if it were 1600 or above, it would have been caught by the previous condition).",

So no spaces. So we can use strip. But note: the problem says \"the length of s is n\", so if we strip, we remove the newline and any trailing spaces? But the problem says the string only contains the characters. So we can use strip. But to be safe: we can use s = s.strip(). However, the problem says the total length of all s is <= 10^5, so even if we do strip (which is O(n)), it's acceptable. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for p in parts:\n                        if p == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n            But note: the condition: \n                if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n            This is equivalent to: \n                if the part has length 1 -> invalid. or if the part does not contain 'R' -> invalid? or if the part does not contain 'B' -> invalid. But note: if the part has length 1, then it cannot contain both? So we break as soon as we see a part of length 1. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                if len(p) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                elif 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    valid = False\n\n            But we break at the first invalid part.

But the problem says to output the code as it would appear. We use 4 spaces per indent. Therefore, the code for program2.py in the JSON is:\n\n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            But note: the inner for loop body: \n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '': \n                        continue\n                    if ...: \n                        ... So we need to indent the inner for loop body by 4 more spaces? Therefore, the entire block:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '':\n                        continue\n                    if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print('YES' if valid else 'NO') Now, in the string representation, we must represent the indentation:\n\n                Line1: 4 spaces + \"s = s.strip()\"\n                Line2: 4 spaces + \"parts = s.split('W')\"\n                Line3: 4 spaces + \"valid = True\"\n                Line4: 4 spaces + \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line5: 8 spaces + \"if p == '':\"\n                Line6: 12 spaces + \"continue\"\n                Line7: 8 spaces + \"if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\"\n                Line8: 12 spaces + \"valid = False\"\n                Line9: 12 spaces + \"break\"\n                Line10: 4 spaces + \"print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            But wait: the continue and the break are inside the if, so they should be indented by 12 spaces? However, we can write:\n\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '':\n                        continue\n                    if ...:\n                        ... So the continue is at the same level as the condition? Actually, the code:\n\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '': \n                        continue\n                    if ...: \n                        ... So the second if is not inside the first if. Therefore, the inner block:\n\n                Line1: 4 spaces for the outer for loop body: \"s = ...\"\n                Line2: 4 spaces: \"parts = ...\"\n                Line3: 4 spaces: \"valid = True\"\n                Line4: 4 spaces: \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line5: 8 spaces: \"if p == '':\"\n                Line6: 12 spaces: \"continue\"\n                Line7: 8 spaces: \"if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\"\n                Line8: 12 spaces: \"valid = False\"\n                Line9: 12 spaces: \"break\"\n                Line10: 4 spaces: \"print(...)\"\n\n            But note: the break is inside the if condition? Therefore, we write the string as:\n\n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            This uses:\n                - 4 spaces for the outer body (aligned with the for loop)\n                - 8 spaces for the inner for loop body (one level of 4 more)\n                - 12 spaces for the continue and the break? But we don't need to write the continue and break with 12 spaces? Actually, in the string we are writing, we are using:\n\n                \"    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        ...\"\n\n            This means:\n                Line1: 4 spaces + \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line2: 8 spaces + \"if p == '':\"\n                Line3: 12 spaces + \"continue\"\n                Line4: 8 spaces + \"if ...:\"\n\n            But the continue is at 12 spaces? That's correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe have a template that reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads an integer `num` and prints the division based on the rating.\nThe template has:\n    if num>=1900: print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif num>=1600: # TODO: Your code here\n    elif num>=1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n    else: print(\"Division 4\")\n\nWe note that the conditions for division 2 are: 1600 <= rating <= 1899.\nBut note that the condition for division 1 is already taken (>=1900). So for the next condition (>=1600) we must check that it is also below 1900? Actually, the condition above (>=1900) has already been handled, so by the time we get to the condition `num>=1600`, we know that `num` is less than 1900. Therefore, we can simply print \"Division 2\" for the condition `num>=1600`.\n\nBut wait: the problem states:\n  Division 1: >=1900\n  Division 2: between 1600 and 1899 (inclusive)\n  Division 3: between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive)\n  Division 4: <=1399\n\nSo the condition for division 2 is exactly when 1600<=num<=1899. However, because we have already checked for >=1900, then the condition `num>=1600` will only be true for 1600<=num<=1899. Similarly, the next condition `num>=1400` will be for 1400<=num<=1599 (because if it were 1600 or above, it would have been caught by the previous condition). And then the rest (below 1400) go to division 4.\n\nTherefore, the missing line for program1.py is simply:\n    elif num>=1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n\nBut note: the problem also includes negative ratings. However, the conditions still hold because if the rating is negative, it will be less than 1400 and hence fall into the else clause (Division 4). So the code is correct.\n\nFor program2.py:\nWe are given t test cases. The input reading is set up as:\n    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\nThis means we are taking every second line starting from index 2 (so the first line of the test cases: the n, and then the next line: the string s). But note: the input structure is:\n    First line: t\n    Then for each test case:\n        first line: n\n        second line: s (the string of length n)\n\nSo [*open(0)] is a list of all lines. Then [2::2] means we start at index 2 (so skip the first two lines? Actually: the first two lines are the first t and then the first n. But note: the first two lines of the entire input are:\n    t\n    then the first test case: n1 and then s1.\n\nSo the list of lines is:\n    index0: t (as a string)\n    index1: n1 (as a string)\n    index2: s1 (as a string)\n    index3: n2\n    index4: s2\n    ...\n\nTherefore, [2::2] would be: starting at index2 (which is the first s1) and then every two lines: so s1, s2, s3, ... \n\nBut wait: the first test case has two lines: the first line after t is n1 and then the next is s1. Then the next test case: n2 and s2. So the lines we are iterating over are the s strings (the second line of each test case). However, we also need the n? But note: the string s has length n, so we can get n from len(s) but note: the string s might have a newline? Actually, the input is read with open(0) and then we are taking the lines. The string s in the list will include the newline? We should strip it.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. So we can process each string.\n\nThe problem: given a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B'), we need to determine if it is possible to form the pattern by stamping (as described).\n\nKey observations:\n1. The stamp always covers two adjacent cells and colors them as either RB or BR.\n2. The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell, and each application flips the color of the two cells (but note: the stamping operation is such that if you stamp the same pair again, it will change the colors: for example, if you have RB and you stamp again (with the same orientation) then it becomes WB? Actually, wait: the stamping operation is defined as recoloring both cells. But note the operations:\n\n   - Initially: WW -> becomes RB or BR.\n   - If we stamp again the same two cells, then:\n        If they are RB: \n            If we use the same orientation (which would be RB) then: \n                R becomes ? and B becomes ? \n            But note: the stamp always sets the two cells to one red and one blue, but in a fixed pattern. Actually, the stamp doesn't care about the current color? It sets the two cells to the two colors. So if you stamp a pair that is currently RB with the stamp in the RB orientation, then it becomes RB again? Actually, no: because the stamp operation is defined as \"recolors both cells\". So if you stamp a pair that is currently RB with the same orientation, then it becomes RB (so no change). But if you stamp with the opposite orientation (BR) then it becomes BR? \n\n   However, note that the stamp can be rotated: so we can choose either BR or RB. Therefore, stamping the same pair multiple times is equivalent to toggling between the two patterns? Actually, consider:\n\n        Operation 1: WW -> RB (using RB orientation)\n        Operation 2: same pair: if we use BR orientation, then RB becomes BR? \n        But wait: the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we use the BR orientation on a pair that is currently RB, then we set them to BR. Similarly, if we use the RB orientation on BR, we set them to RB.\n\n        So two operations on the same pair: \n            WW -> RB -> BR -> RB -> ... \n        So it alternates? \n\n   But note: we can also choose the orientation arbitrarily each time. So for a pair, we can set it to either RB or BR arbitrarily? Actually, no: because the stamp has two fixed patterns. However, we can choose which pattern to use each time. So:\n\n        Operation 1: we choose to set the pair to RB.\n        Operation 2: we choose to set the same pair to BR.\n\n        So we can change the pair arbitrarily between RB and BR? \n\n   However, what if we do an odd number of operations? Then we can get either pattern? Actually, no: because the first operation sets it to one of the two, then the second operation sets it to the other, and the third sets it to the first, etc. So:\n\n        If we do an odd number of operations, we get the pattern we chose in the last operation? \n        But note: we can choose the pattern arbitrarily at each step. So if we want to set the pair to RB, we can do one operation (if currently white) or if it is already set to BR and we want RB, we can do one more operation (so two operations total) to set it to RB? \n\n   Actually, we can set the pair to any of the two patterns by using the appropriate number of operations (if we start from white). But note: we can also leave it white by never stamping? \n\n   However, the problem states that the stamp must cover two adjacent cells and we cannot partially stamp. Also, we can stamp multiple times on the same cell. \n\n   But note: the entire picture must be formed. The key is that the stamping operations can be done arbitrarily many times and in any order. \n\n   Important: the problem does not require the sequence of operations, only whether it is possible.\n\n   Insight: \n   - The operation always changes two adjacent cells. Therefore, a single white cell cannot be changed by itself? \n   - Also, note that the operation sets two adjacent cells to one red and one blue. Therefore, if we have a segment that is entirely white, we can leave it white by not stamping. But if we want to color a segment, we must stamp at least once on every pair of adjacent cells that we wish to color? \n\n   However, note that we can stamp overlapping. \n\n   Alternate approach: known from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4), problem C) is to note:\n\n   - The entire string must be partitioned into contiguous non-white segments. In each contiguous non-white segment (with no white in between), the following must hold:\n        - The segment must have at least two characters? Actually, no: but note the stamp covers two adjacent cells. Therefore, we cannot have a single non-white cell? \n\n   Why? Because to create a single non-white cell, we would have to stamp a pair that includes that cell and one adjacent. But then the adjacent cell would also become non-white. So if we have a segment of length 1 (non-white) that is isolated (surrounded by white or at the boundary), then we cannot create it? \n\n   Therefore, we must have that every contiguous non-white segment has length at least 2? \n\n   But wait: what if we have two adjacent non-white cells? Then we can create them by stamping that pair. However, what if we have a segment of length 1? Then it's impossible.\n\n   However, consider: \n        Example: \"R\" -> impossible? \n        Example: \"W\" -> possible (by not stamping).\n\n   But note: the problem says the entire row is initially white. So if we have a single non-white cell, how can we get it? We would have to stamp a pair that includes that cell and one neighbor. But then the neighbor would also become non-white. So we cannot have a single non-white cell.\n\n   Therefore, we can break the string by 'W' and then check each contiguous segment of non-white (which must be composed of 'R' and 'B'):\n\n        Condition 1: the segment must have length at least 2? Actually, no: because if the segment has length 1, then it's impossible. But wait: what if we stamp multiple times? \n\n        Example: to get \"RB\" in two adjacent cells: we stamp once. \n        Example: to get \"R\" in one cell: we cannot.\n\n        However, what if we have a segment of length 1 at the boundary? \n            Example: n=1: then the string is either \"W\" (which is possible) or \"R\" or \"B\" (which are impossible). \n\n        Therefore, we must check: \n            - If the entire string is white, then it's possible (by doing nothing).\n            - Else, we break the string by 'W' and for each contiguous non-white segment:\n                * If the segment has length 1 -> impossible.\n                * But also: note that the stamping operation always produces one red and one blue. However, we can have a segment that is all red? Actually, no: because each stamp produces one red and one blue. But note: we can stamp multiple times and overlapping. \n\n        However, consider: \n            We can have a segment of three: \n                Example: \"RRB\" -> is that possible?\n            How? \n                Step1: stamp the first two: WWW -> R B W -> R B W\n                Step2: stamp the last two: R B W -> R B R? -> but we want R R B? \n\n            Alternatively: \n                Step1: stamp the middle and last: WWW -> W B R\n                Step2: stamp the first two: W B R -> R B R -> but we want RRB.\n\n            How about:\n                Step1: stamp the first two: WWW -> RB W\n                Step2: stamp the second and third: RB W -> R BR -> but that gives R and then BR -> so the second cell becomes B then R? \n\n            Actually, the second cell is stamped twice: \n                First stamp: sets (cell1, cell2) to (R, B)\n                Second stamp: sets (cell2, cell3) to (B, R) -> but wait, we can choose the orientation arbitrarily. So we can set (cell2, cell3) to (R, B) or (B, R). \n\n            If we set (cell2, cell3) to (R, B): \n                Then we have: R (from first stamp) then the second stamp sets cell2 to R and cell3 to B. But then cell2 was originally B and now becomes R? \n\n            The operation sets both cells at the same time. So after step1: [R, B, W]\n            Step2: stamping the second and third: we can choose to set them to RB -> then we get [R, R, B]? \n                How? \n                    We set the second and third to RB: so the second becomes R and the third becomes B? \n                But then the second cell was B and now becomes R? \n\n            So the operation overwrites. Therefore, we can set the second and third arbitrarily to either RB or BR. \n\n            Therefore, we can get \"RRB\": \n                Step1: stamp (1,2) as RB -> [R, B, W]\n                Step2: stamp (2,3) as RB -> [R, R, B] -> because the second cell becomes R (overwriting the B) and the third becomes B.\n\n            But note: the problem says that the stamp must completely fit. So we can stamp arbitrarily? \n\n            However, we see that we can have multiple reds? \n\n        But note: the stamp always produces one red and one blue. However, when we stamp overlapping, a cell that is stamped multiple times can change color arbitrarily? \n\n        Actually, the color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it? And we can choose the orientation arbitrarily for each stamp. \n\n        Therefore, the entire coloring is arbitrary? \n\n        However, there is a constraint: the entire coloring must be consistent with the requirement that each stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to one red and one blue. \n\n        Alternate known solution for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces problem \"Stamp Coloring\"): \n            - We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments that are separated by white. \n            - In each contiguous non-white segment, we must have at least one red and at least one blue? \n\n        Why? \n            Because each stamp introduces one red and one blue. If we have a segment that is entirely red, then how? \n                Example: \"RR\" -> is that possible?\n                How to get \"RR\": \n                    We can stamp the first pair as RB, then stamp the same pair again but with the opposite orientation (BR) to get BR? Then stamp again? \n                    But note: \n                        Step1: stamp (1,2) as RB -> RB\n                        Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR -> then we set the first to B and the second to R -> BR? \n                        Step3: stamp (1,2) as RB -> RB? \n                    We cannot get two reds? \n\n            Actually, we can only get two reds if we use two different stamps that cover the two reds? But note: \n                Example: three cells: \n                    We can get the first two as RB and then the second and third as BR: \n                        Then we have: \n                            cell1: R\n                            cell2: B (from first stamp) and then R (from second stamp) -> so becomes R? \n                            cell3: B? \n                        So we get R, R, B? \n\n            How about two adjacent reds? \n                We need to have two adjacent reds. But each stamp that covers two adjacent cells must set one to red and the other to blue. Therefore, two adjacent cells cannot both be red? \n\n            However, wait: we can stamp multiple times. Consider two adjacent cells:\n                Operation1: stamp (1,2) as RB -> [R, B]\n                Operation2: stamp (1,2) as BR -> [B, R]\n                Operation3: stamp (1,2) as RB -> [R, B] ... \n\n            We never get two reds? \n\n            Therefore, it is impossible to have two adjacent reds? \n\n        But wait: what if we use overlapping stamps that cover three cells? \n            Example: three cells: \n                Operation1: stamp (1,2) as RB: [R, B, W]\n                Operation2: stamp (2,3) as BR: [R, R, B] -> because the second cell is set to R (by the second stamp) and the third to B? \n\n            Now we have two adjacent reds: at positions 1 and 2? \n                Position1: R (from first stamp, and not changed by the second stamp)\n                Position2: first stamp set it to B, then the second stamp set it to R? \n\n            So we have R at position1 and R at position2: adjacent reds.\n\n            But note: the second stamp sets the pair (2,3) to BR: so cell2 becomes B and cell3 becomes R? \n                Actually, no: the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we use the BR orientation on (2,3), then we set cell2 to B and cell3 to R? \n                But wait: the example in the problem statement: \n                    \"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture BRBBW ...\"\n\n            How did they get BRBBW? \n                Step1: WWWWW -> WW RB W -> so positions 3 and 4 become R and B? (but they wrote: WW RB W -> then next step: BR followed by ...)\n\n            Actually, the example: \n                Step1: WWWWW -> WW RB W (so they stamped the third and fourth? then we have: positions: 0:W,1:W,2:R,3:B,4:W) \n                Step2: then they stamped the first and second: so they set them to BR? -> then we have: B, R, R, B, W -> but they wrote: BR followed by RB? \n\n            The example says: \n                Step1: WWWWW -> WW RB W (so positions 2 and 3 become R and B? but then the next step: they stamp the first two: so they set positions0 and1 to BR? -> then we have: B, R, R, B, W -> which is BRRBW? \n\n            But the target is BRBBW. \n\n            Then step3: they stamp positions 1 and 2: which are currently R and R? -> but wait, that's two reds? \n\n            How can they stamp two reds? The stamp must set two adjacent cells to one red and one blue. So if they stamp positions1 and2 (which are R and R) with the stamp, then they become? \n                They become either RB or BR. So they become either R and B or B and R. \n\n            In the example, they become R and B? \n                Then we have: \n                    position0: B\n                    position1: becomes R? (if they use RB orientation: then position1 becomes R and position2 becomes B) -> then we have: B, R, B, B, W -> which is BRBBW.\n\n            So they did: \n                Step1: positions2 and3: set to RB -> so [W, W, R, B, W]\n                Step2: positions0 and1: set to BR -> [B, R, R, B, W]\n                Step3: positions1 and2: set to RB -> [B, R (from step2, then step3 sets position1 to R? and position2 to B) -> but wait, step3 sets position1 and2: \n                    position1: originally R -> now set to R (if we use RB: then the first of the pair becomes R and the second becomes B) -> so we set position1 to R and position2 to B? \n                    Then we have: [B, R, B, B, W] -> which is BRBBW.\n\n            Therefore, we can have two adjacent reds? \n\n        But note: the two adjacent reds were temporary? And then we changed them. \n\n        However, the problem is: given the final picture, is it possible? The final picture does not have two adjacent reds? In the example, the final picture is BRBBW: which has no two adjacent reds. \n\n        Therefore, the constraint might be: in the final picture, we cannot have two adjacent reds? Actually, no: because we can have two adjacent reds if we then change one of them? But the final picture is fixed. \n\n        So what is the invariant? \n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) C) is:\n\n            - The entire string must be split by 'W' into segments.\n            - For each segment (without any 'W'), we must have:\n                * The segment length must be at least 1? Actually, we can have an empty segment (if there are consecutive W's) -> skip.\n                * The segment must have at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n\n            Why? \n                Because each stamp operation introduces one red and one blue. And if we have a contiguous segment that is non-white, then the entire segment must have been formed by one or more stamp operations. And each stamp operation introduces one red and one blue. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? \n\n            But what if the segment has only one color? \n                Example: \"RR\" -> is that possible? \n                We saw: \n                    We can get \"RR\" in a segment of two? \n                    How? \n                        We can stamp the pair (1,2) as RB -> then we have R and B.\n                        Then we stamp the same pair again as BR -> then we have B and R.\n                        Then we stamp the same pair again as RB -> then we have R and B. \n                    We cannot get two R's? \n\n                However, consider overlapping on three cells to get two R's? \n                    We did an example above that got \"RRB\" (which has two R's and one B). But note: that segment has both R and B. \n\n            Therefore, the invariant is: each contiguous non-white segment must contain at least one red and at least one blue. \n\n            Also, we must have that the segment length is at least 2? Actually, if the segment has only one cell, then we cannot have both colors? So we must have at least two cells? \n\n            But wait: what if the segment has one cell? Then it must be either R or B. But we cannot have a segment of one non-white cell? Because we cannot stamp a single cell without stamping an adjacent one. \n\n            Therefore, the conditions are:\n                Condition 1: every contiguous non-white segment must have length at least 2? -> Actually, no: because we can have a segment of length 1 if we never stamp? But wait: if we never stamp, then the cell is white. So if we have a non-white segment of length 1, then we must have stamped that cell with an adjacent cell? But then the adjacent cell would also be non-white. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n            So the conditions are:\n                - The entire string is split by 'W' into contiguous non-white segments.\n                - For each segment:\n                    * The length must be at least 1? Actually, we skip empty segments.\n                    * The segment must have at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. \n                    * And the segment must have length>=2? Actually, if the segment has length 1, then we cannot have both colors? So we require the segment to have at least two cells? \n\n            However, note: if the segment has length 1, then we cannot have both colors? And we cannot have a segment of one non-white cell? So we must require that the segment has at least two cells. \n\n            But also: if the segment has two cells and both are the same color? \n                Example: \"RR\" -> is that possible? \n                We argued that we cannot get two reds? \n\n            How to get \"RR\"? \n                We need to have two adjacent reds. \n                Consider: \n                    We can stamp the pair (1,2) as RB -> then we have R and B.\n                    Then we stamp the same pair as RB again -> then we have R and B again? \n                    Or if we stamp as BR: then we get B and R. \n                We never get two reds? \n\n            Therefore, we cannot have a segment of two reds? \n\n            But wait: what if we use overlapping stamps? \n                Example: three cells: \n                    We want the first two to be RR and the third white? \n                    How? \n                        Step1: stamp (1,2) as RB -> [R, B, W]\n                        Step2: stamp (1,2) as BR -> [B, R, W] -> not RR.\n                        Step3: stamp (1,2) as RB -> [R, B, W] -> same as step1.\n\n                We cannot get RR? \n\n            Therefore, we cannot have two adjacent reds? \n\n            But note: the example above for three cells: we got \"RRB\" for the entire three cells. But that had a blue at the end. \n\n            So the invariant: in the entire contiguous non-white segment, the colors must be such that it is possible to assign the stamps? \n\n            Actually, the known solution for the problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n                def solve():\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n                    # Split by W\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(part) == 1:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n                        # Check if the part has at least one R and one B?\n                        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            return\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n            However, note: what if the segment is \"RBRB\" (which has both colors) -> then it's valid.\n\n            But what if the segment is \"RRBB\"? \n                It has both colors -> valid.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm for program2.py:\n\n                t = first line\n                Then for each test case:\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n\n                    # Split s by 'W'\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(part) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        # If the part has only one type of color (either only 'R' or only 'B')\n                        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                    Then output \"YES\" if valid, else \"NO\".\n\n            However, note: what if the segment is \"RRR\"? \n                Then it has no 'B' -> invalid.\n\n            What if the segment is \"BBB\"? \n                Then it has no 'R' -> invalid.\n\n            What if the segment is \"R\"? -> invalid (length 1).\n\n            What if the segment is \"RB\"? -> valid.\n\n            What if the segment is \"BR\"? -> valid.\n\n            What if the segment is \"RBR\"? -> valid (has both R and B).\n\n            But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so splitting and iterating is efficient.\n\n            However, note: the example test cases:\n\n                Example 1: \"BRBBW\" -> \n                    Split by 'W': we get ['BRBB', ''] -> the second part is empty -> skip.\n                    The first part: \"BRBB\": \n                        length>=2 -> yes.\n                        contains 'R'? -> yes (one R) and 'B'? -> yes -> valid.\n\n                Example 2: the second, third, fourth test cases: \n                    The note says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is 'NO'.\"\n\n                    What are these test cases? \n                    The problem note doesn't specify, but we can assume:\n\n                    Example: n=1, s=\"R\" -> then we split: ['R'] -> part has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                    Similarly, n=1, s=\"B\" -> invalid.\n\n                    Also, n=1, s=\"W\" -> then parts = ['',''] -> no non-empty part -> valid? \n                        But note: the entire string is white -> valid.\n\n                Example 3: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> valid.\n\n                Example 4: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> valid.\n\n                Example 5: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> invalid? because it has no blue? -> so invalid.\n\n                Example 6: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> valid.\n\n                Example 7: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> invalid.\n\n                Example 8: n=0? -> not possible (n>=1).\n\n            But wait: the example in the note:\n\n                The fifth test case: \"BRB\" (from the example: n=3, s=\"BRB\")? \n                    Actually, the example says: \n                        For the fifth test case: WWW -> W RB -> then BRB? \n                    How? \n                        Step1: stamp the last two: WWW -> W and then stamp the last two: so we get W and then RB? -> \"WRB\" -> but that's not \"BRB\". \n                    Then they say: \n                        Step2: then stamp the first two: which are W and R? -> but wait, the first two are W and R: \n                        We can stamp the first two: which are W and R? -> but the stamp sets two adjacent cells. So we set the first two to BR? -> then we have: B, R, B -> \"BRB\".\n\n                    So the string is \"BRB\". \n                    Split by 'W': we get \"BRB\" (no W) -> one part: \"BRB\"\n                    length>=2 -> yes (3>=2)\n                    contains 'B' and 'R' -> yes -> valid.\n\n            The sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> \n                How: \n                    Step1: stamp the last two: WWW -> W and then stamp the last two as RB -> then we have W, R, B? -> \"WRB\"\n                    Step2: stamp the first two: which are W and R -> set to RB? -> then we have R, B, B -> \"RBB\"\n                Then the string is \"RBB\". \n                Split: no W -> one part \"RBB\"\n                contains 'R' and 'B' -> valid.\n\n            The seventh test case: \"WWW\" -> valid.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()   # because the line from open(0) has a newline?\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for part in parts:\n                        if part == '':\n                            continue\n                        n_part = len(part)\n                        if n_part == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                    # Then output the answer for this test case\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n            However, note: the input has t test cases, and we are iterating over the s strings (the second line of each test case). \n\n            But note: the first line of the test case (the integer n) is not used? because we get the string s and we can get the length from the string? \n\n            But the problem says: the string s has length n. So we don't need n? \n\n            However, the input has the integer n on the previous line. But we are skipping that line by taking [2::2]. \n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n            But note: what if the string s has a newline? We do s.strip() to remove the newline.\n\n            However, the problem says: the string s of length n. So if we strip, we remove the newline? and then the length of s.strip() is n? \n\n            But the input: the second line is the string of length n, and then a newline. So s.strip() will give a string of length n.\n\n            But what if the string has spaces? The problem says the string only contains 'W','R','B'. \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n\n            But note: the problem says the string s only contains 'W','R','B'. So no spaces.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                s = s.rstrip('\\n')\n\n            But strip() is safe.\n\n            However, what if the string has trailing spaces? The problem says the string s of length n and only contains 'W','R','B'. So no spaces. So we can use strip.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"the length of s is n\", so if we strip, we remove the newline and any trailing spaces? But the problem says the string only contains the characters. So we can use strip.\n\n            But to be safe: we can use s = s.strip().\n\n            However, the problem says the total length of all s is <= 10^5, so even if we do strip (which is O(n)), it's acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for p in parts:\n                        if p == '': \n                            continue\n                        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n            But note: the condition: \n                if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n            This is equivalent to: \n                if the part has length 1 -> invalid.\n                or if the part does not contain 'R' -> invalid? \n                or if the part does not contain 'B' -> invalid.\n\n            But note: if the part has length 1, then it cannot contain both? So we break as soon as we see a part of length 1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                if len(p) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                elif 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    valid = False\n\n            But we break at the first invalid part.\n\n            However, we can break early.\n\n            But note: we must check all parts? Actually, if one part is invalid, then the entire test case is invalid. So we can break.\n\n            Therefore, the code above is acceptable.\n\n            Let's test with the examples:\n\n                Example: s = \"R\" -> \n                    parts = ['R'] -> \n                    p='R': len(p)==1 -> valid=False -> break -> output \"NO\"\n\n                Example: s = \"RR\" -> \n                    parts = ['RR'] -> \n                    p='RR': len>=2 -> then check: 'R' in 'RR' -> yes, but 'B' not in 'RR' -> so condition: ('R' not in p) is False, but ('B' not in p) is True -> so condition becomes: True -> valid=False -> output \"NO\"\n\n                Example: s = \"RB\" -> \n                    parts = ['RB'] -> \n                    len>=2 -> then check: 'R' in 'RB' -> True, 'B' in 'RB' -> True -> so condition: ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p) -> False -> so we don't set valid to False -> then after the loop, valid remains True -> output \"YES\"\n\n                Example: s = \"RBR\" -> \n                    parts = ['RBR'] -> \n                    has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                Example: s = \"W\" -> \n                    parts = ['',''] -> both empty -> skip -> valid remains True -> output \"YES\"\n\n                Example: s = \"RW\" -> \n                    parts = ['R', ''] -> \n                    first part: 'R' -> length=1 -> invalid -> output \"NO\"\n\n                Example: s = \"WB\" -> \n                    parts = ['','B'] -> \n                    part 'B': length=1 -> invalid -> output \"NO\"\n\n                Example: s = \"RWWB\" -> \n                    parts = ['R','','B'] -> \n                    first part: 'R' -> invalid -> output \"NO\"\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, note: what if the segment is \"RRRBBB\" (without any W in between)? \n                Then the entire string is one part: \"RRRBBB\" -> has both R and B -> valid.\n\n            But what if the segment is \"RRR\" (without W) -> invalid.\n\n            Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the input has t test cases, and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n            Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n            But note: the input reading: \n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            This skips the first two lines? Actually, the first two lines of the entire input are:\n                line0: t\n                line1: n1 (for the first test case)\n                line2: s1 (for the first test case)\n                line3: n2 (for the second test case)\n                line4: s2 (for the second test case)\n\n            So [2::2] gives: line2, line4, line6, ... -> which are the s strings.\n\n            But what if there is only one test case? Then [2::2] will be [line2] -> which is the string of the first test case.\n\n            Therefore, it's correct.\n\n            However, note: the first line of the entire input is t. Then the next t*2 lines are the test cases. So the total number of lines is 1 + t*2. Then [2::2] takes every second line starting at index2, which are the strings.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    valid = True\n                    for p in parts:\n                        if p == '':\n                            continue\n                        if len(p) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n            But note: we must be cautious: the condition \"if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p\" is equivalent to \"if the part does not contain at least one R or does not contain at least one B\", which is what we want.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write: \n                if not ('R' in p and 'B' in p): \n                    valid = False\n\n            But the above condition is equivalent to: \n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p: \n\n            So it's the same.\n\n            Therefore, we output the above.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 10^4. But the sum of the lengths of the strings is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n            But note: the splitting by 'W' might create many parts? However, the total length of the string is the n for that test case, and the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the total work is O(10^5).\n\n            Therefore, we are good.\n\n            Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n            For program1.py: the missing line is: \n                elif num>=1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n\n            For program2.py: the missing block is the entire for loop body.\n\n            But note: the template for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            So we must complete the body of the for loop.\n\n            Therefore, the JSON:\n\n                {\n                    \"program1\": \"    elif num>=1600: print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\",\n                    \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n                }\n\n            However, note: the condition in program2.py: \n                if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n\n            This is equivalent to the two conditions we discussed: if the part has length 1, or if it doesn't have R, or if it doesn't have B.\n\n            But note: the condition is evaluated as: \n                if (len(p)==1) or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)\n\n            So if any of these is true, we break and set valid to False.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write it as two separate ifs? But the above is efficient.\n\n            However, we can also write:\n\n                if len(p) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in p or 'B' not in p:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            But the above condition is the same.\n\n            We choose the more compact form.\n\n            But note: the condition \"if len(p)==1\" is independent, and if true, we break. Similarly, if the part has both colors, we skip. Otherwise, we break.\n\n            The condition \"if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)\" is equivalent to: \n                if the part is invalid.\n\n            So we break.\n\n            Therefore, we output the above.\n\n            However, note: the condition \"('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)\" is true if at least one of the colors is missing. And if the part has length 1, then it must be missing at least one color? But we break as soon as we see length 1. So the condition is safe.\n\n            We output the code as a string with newlines as \\n.\n\n            But note: the program1.py code must be indented properly. The existing code has:\n\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are replacing the TODO line with: \n                elif num>=1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n\n            And note: the next line is already present: \n                elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n\n            So the entire block for program1.py is:\n\n                if num>=1900:print(\"Division 1\")\n                elif num>=1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n                elif num>=1400:print(\"Division 3\")\n                else:print(\"Division 4\")\n\n            But the existing code has the next condition and the else.\n\n            Therefore, we output only the one line for program1.py.\n\n            For program2.py, we output the entire block that goes inside the for loop.\n\n            But note: the for loop in program2.py is:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n            So we must indent the block by 4 spaces? The existing code in the template has no indentation? Actually, the template has:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            So we need to write the code with the same indentation level as the for loop? \n\n            The for loop is at the top level? Then the body should be indented.\n\n            In the JSON, we represent the string for program2.py as:\n\n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ...\"\n\n            The first line has 4 spaces? Actually, the entire block should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop? \n\n            But the for loop is at the top level, so the body should be indented by 4 spaces. Therefore, each line of the body should start with 4 spaces? \n\n            However, the template does not show any indentation? But in Python, we must indent.\n\n            Therefore, we assume the entire block for the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces. So:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    parts = s.split('W')\n                    ...\n\n            So in the JSON, we write the block with each line starting with 4 spaces? \n\n            But note: the template has the for loop at the beginning of the line. So we write:\n\n                \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    ...\"\n\n            This will add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n            Actually, the first line: \"    s = s.strip()\" -> that's 4 spaces at the beginning. Then the next line: \"    parts = ...\" -> also 4 spaces.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem says to output the code as it would appear.\n\n            We use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py in the JSON is:\n\n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            But note: the inner for loop body: \n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '': \n                        continue\n                    if ...: \n                        ...\n\n            So we need to indent the inner for loop body by 4 more spaces? \n\n            Therefore, the entire block:\n\n                s = s.strip()\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '':\n                        continue\n                    if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n            Now, in the string representation, we must represent the indentation:\n\n                Line1: 4 spaces + \"s = s.strip()\"\n                Line2: 4 spaces + \"parts = s.split('W')\"\n                Line3: 4 spaces + \"valid = True\"\n                Line4: 4 spaces + \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line5: 8 spaces + \"if p == '':\"\n                Line6: 12 spaces + \"continue\"\n                Line7: 8 spaces + \"if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\"\n                Line8: 12 spaces + \"valid = False\"\n                Line9: 12 spaces + \"break\"\n                Line10: 4 spaces + \"print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            But wait: the continue and the break are inside the if, so they should be indented by 12 spaces? \n\n            However, we can write:\n\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '':\n                        continue\n                    if ...:\n                        ...\n\n            So the continue is at the same level as the condition? \n\n            Actually, the code:\n\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p == '': \n                        continue\n                    if ...: \n                        ...\n\n            So the second if is not inside the first if. \n\n            Therefore, the inner block:\n\n                Line1: 4 spaces for the outer for loop body: \"s = ...\"\n                Line2: 4 spaces: \"parts = ...\"\n                Line3: 4 spaces: \"valid = True\"\n                Line4: 4 spaces: \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line5: 8 spaces: \"if p == '':\"\n                Line6: 12 spaces: \"continue\"\n                Line7: 8 spaces: \"if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\"\n                Line8: 12 spaces: \"valid = False\"\n                Line9: 12 spaces: \"break\"\n                Line10: 4 spaces: \"print(...)\"\n\n            But note: the break is inside the if condition? \n\n            Therefore, we write the string as:\n\n                \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n            This uses:\n                - 4 spaces for the outer body (aligned with the for loop)\n                - 8 spaces for the inner for loop body (one level of 4 more)\n                - 12 spaces for the continue and the break? But we don't need to write the continue and break with 12 spaces? \n\n            Actually, in the string we are writing, we are using:\n\n                \"    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        ...\"\n\n            This means:\n                Line1: 4 spaces + \"for p in parts:\"\n                Line2: 8 spaces + \"if p == '':\"\n                Line3: 12 spaces + \"continue\"\n                Line4: 8 spaces + \"if ...:\"\n\n            But the continue is at 12 spaces? That's correct.\n\n            However, we can write the condition in one line? \n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                for p in parts:\n                    if p:   # skip empty\n                        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n            But we skip empty parts. \n\n            We'll stick to the clear version.\n\n            Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n                {\n                    \"program1\": \"    elif num>=1600: print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\",\n                    \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    parts = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for p in parts:\\n        if p == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p):\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n                }\n\n            But note: the condition in program2.py: \n                if len(p)==1 or ('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)\n\n            This condition: if the part has length 1, then we break. Also, if the part does not contain 'R' OR does not contain 'B', then we break.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            However, we can also write:\n\n                if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n\n            But that is the same.\n\n            We output the above.\n\n            But note: the condition \"('R' not in p) or ('B' not in p)\" is equivalent to \"not ('R' in p and 'B' in p)\".\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                if len(p)==1 or not ('R' in p and 'B' in p):\n\n            But the original condition is clear.\n\n            We'll output the condition as written.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is as above."
