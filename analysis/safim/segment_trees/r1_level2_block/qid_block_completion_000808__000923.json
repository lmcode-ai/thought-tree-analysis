Similarly, h = (m-1) - r? because initially r=m-1, then we set h=1? then when we add one, r becomes m-2, h becomes 2? so h = (m-1) - r? Therefore, the total candies = g + h = (e+1) + ((m-1)-r) = e+1 + m-1 - r = e + m - r. And the condition in the while loop: h+g <= m -> e+m-r <= m -> e<=r? But note: initially e=0, r=m-1 -> e<=r? true. Then we add to the left: e becomes 1, then we check 1<=m-1? true. Then we add to the right: r becomes m-2, then we check 1<=m-2? true. But when e becomes r? then e<=r? true. Then we add to the left: e becomes e+1, then e = r+1? then e<=r? false -> then we break? So the while condition h+g<=m is equivalent to e<=r? Actually, h+g = e+1 + (m-1 - r) = e + m - r, and we require e+m-r<=m -> e<=r. So the while condition is e<=r. Then the known solution uses l<=r? which is the same as e<=r? Therefore, we can do: In the TODO block:\n                index = h + g   # which is the current total\n                # Then we break the tie by moving the left? if e < r:   # because we are going to take e+1, and we require that e+1<=r? -> but if e<r, then e+1<=r? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break And then after the while loop, we check if lowest==highest? if yes, then update index = h+g   # but we already broke the tie?",

Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> cell1 becomes 'B' (from the first stamp) -> then we stamp as BR: so cell1 becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: the left cell becomes 'B')? -> cell1='B', cell2='R'\n                     -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step3: stamp2 and3 as RB: -> cell2='R' becomes 'R' (from step2) -> then we stamp as RB: cell2='R', cell3='B' -> \"R B R B\"\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> \"B R W W\"\n            Step3: stamp1 and2 as RB: -> cell1='R' becomes 'R' (from step2) -> stamped as RB: cell1='R' becomes 'R' (if we use RB: then cell1 becomes 'R', cell2 becomes 'B') -> \"B R B W\"\n            Step4: stamp2 and3 as BR: -> \"B R B R\"\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> \"R B (stamped as BR: cell1 becomes 'B'? -> no, the stamp BR means: left cell becomes 'B', right cell becomes 'R') -> cell1='B' becomes 'B'? or overwritten to 'B'? \n                     -> cell1='B' (unchanged) and cell2='R' -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step3: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> cell0='R' becomes 'B', cell1='B' becomes 'R' -> \"B R R W\"\n            Step4: stamp2 and3 as RB: -> \"B R R B\"\n\n            Now we have \"BRRB\", not \"RRBB\". Step1: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> \"B R W W\"\n            Step2: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step3: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> \"R B becomes R then B? -> cell1='B' becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: becomes 'B' for the left cell) -> cell1='B', cell2='R' -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step4: stamp1 and2 as RB: -> cell1='B' becomes 'R', cell2='R' becomes 'B' -> \"R R B W\"\n            Step5: stamp2 and3 as BR: -> cell2='B' becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: becomes 'B' for the left cell) -> cell2='B', cell3='R' -> \"R R B R\"\n\n            not \"RRBB\".",

They eat from opposite ends and cannot skip candies. We are to do this for multiple test cases.\n\n Approach for program1.py:\n We can use two pointers: one starting at the left (for Alice) and one at the right (for Bob). We maintain two sums: left_sum and right_sum.\n We traverse from the ends towards the center. We try to balance the two sums:\n   - If left_sum < right_sum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the candy to Alice.\n   - If right_sum < left_sum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the candy to Bob.\n   - If they are equal, we record the current total candies eaten (which is the sum of the count on the left and the count on the right) and then we try to extend by moving either pointer (but we can only record when they are equal again?).\n\n However, note: we are to maximize the total number of candies. So we want to record the maximum total candies when the two sums are equal.\n\n But note: the problem says that the total weight must be the same. We are not required to have contiguous segments that are non-overlapping? Actually, they are non-overlapping because Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right.\n\n Steps for program1.py:\n   Initialize:\n     left_index = 0, right_index = n-1\n     left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0\n     count = 0 (this will be the total candies eaten: left_count + right_count)\n     max_count = 0 (to record the maximum count when left_sum == right_sum)\n\n   We traverse while left_index <= right_index:\n     If left_sum <= right_sum: \n         then we add w[left_index] to left_sum and increment left_index and left_count.\n     Else (left_sum > right_sum):\n         then we add w[right_index] to right_sum and decrement right_index and increment right_count.\n\n     But note: we want to check when they are equal. So after updating, if left_sum == right_sum, then we update max_count = left_count + right_count.\n\n   However, note: we might have to continue even after they become equal? Because we might get a larger total by continuing? But if we continue, we break the current balance? Actually, we can break the current balance and then later get a new balance? So we must not stop when we get an equality.\n\n   Example: [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1] \n        Initially: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal, but then we add one from left: left_sum=1, then add one from right: right_sum=1 -> equal -> total=2.\n        Then we can add 2 on left: left_sum=3, then add 2 on right: right_sum=3 -> total=4.\n        Then we add 3 on left: left_sum=6, then add 3 on right: right_sum=6 -> total=6.\n\n   So we must continue until the pointers cross.\n\n   But note: we cannot have overlapping. So we stop when the pointers cross? Actually, we stop when we have taken all candies? But we don't have to take all. We can stop when we have taken as many as possible? The algorithm above will naturally stop when left_index > right_index.\n\n   However, what if we have [1,1,1]? \n        left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> max_count=0? Then we add left: left_sum=1, left_index=1 -> then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> then we add right: right_sum=1, right_index=1 -> now left_index=1, right_index=1 -> we have one candy in the middle. Then we can't take it because we cannot take the same candy. So we break. Then we have left_sum==right_sum -> max_count=2.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n     left_index = 0\n     right_index = n-1\n     left_sum = 0\n     right_sum = 0\n     max_count = 0\n\n     while left_index <= right_index:\n         if left_sum <= right_sum:\n             left_sum += w[left_index]\n             left_index += 1\n         else:\n             right_sum += w[right_index]\n             right_index -= 1\n\n         if left_sum == right_sum:\n             max_count = (left_index) + (n - 1 - right_index)   # because left_index is the next index, so the count of left is left_index, and the count of right is (n - right_index - 1) but note: we have added one from the right and then decremented right_index, so the count on the right is (n - 1 - right_index) because we started at n-1 and now we are at right_index (which is the next available from right) -> actually the number of candies eaten from the right is (n - 1 - right_index) because we started at n-1 and we have moved to right_index (so we have eaten from right_index+1 to n-1 -> that's (n-1 - (right_index+1) + 1) = n-1-right_index? Actually, we have eaten: initially we have right_index = n-1, then we add one and then set right_index = n-2 -> so the count is 1. So the count from the right is (n - 1 - right_index) because we start at n-1 and we have moved to right_index (so the number of candies is (n-1 - right_index)). But note: we can also compute as: \n             left_count = left_index   (because we started at 0 and now we are at left_index, meaning we have taken [0, left_index-1] -> that's left_index candies)\n             right_count = n - 1 - right_index   (because we started at n-1 and now we are at right_index, meaning we have taken [right_index+1, n-1] -> that's (n-1 - (right_index+1) + 1) = n-1-right_index)\n\n         So total = left_index + (n - 1 - right_index)\n\n     Then we output max_count for the test case.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the total number of test cases t, and then for each test case we output the answer.\n\n   But the provided code in program1.py has a while loop that uses h and g? and an index? and also uses e and r? Let me see:\n\n     The provided code:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        for i in range(n):\n            h = 1\n            g = 1\n            counter = 0\n            m = int(input())\n            lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            index =0\n            e= 0\n            r =m-1\n            highest = lst[m-1]   # actually this is the right end? and we are going to use it as the right sum?\n            lowest = lst[0]       # and this as the left sum?\n\n        Then a while loop: while h+g <= m:\n            if lowest < highest:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            elif highest < lowest:\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n            elif highest == lowest:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then print(index)\n\n   This code seems to have some issues. For example, initially:\n        h = 1 (which might represent the count of candies eaten by Bob? or Alice?) and g=1 (the other one). \n        e=0, so the left pointer is at 0, and r=m-1, the right pointer at m-1.\n        lowest = lst[0] -> the first candy, highest = lst[m-1] -> the last candy.\n\n   Then the condition: if lowest < highest: then we add the next candy to the left (so e+1) and update e and g (which is increasing the count? g is the count for the left? but then why g? and h for the right?).\n\n   Actually, the initial setup: \n        Alice has eaten the first candy? -> so left_sum = lst[0] and Bob has eaten the last candy? -> right_sum = lst[m-1]. Then the counts: h=1 (for Bob) and g=1 (for Alice). Then total candies so far: 2.\n\n   Then the while condition: h+g <= m -> meaning we haven't eaten all candies.\n\n   Then if lowest < highest: we add the next candy to the left: so e was 0, then we take e+1 -> index 1, so we add lst[1] to lowest. Then we update e to 1, and g becomes 2 (so Alice has eaten 2 candies). Then total candies = h+g = 1+2 = 3.\n\n   Similarly, if highest < lowest, we add the next candy to the right: r-1 -> so we take lst[r-1] and add to highest, then r becomes r-1, and h becomes h+1.\n\n   When they are equal, we have to do something? The problem says we want to record the total candies when they are equal. So we should record the current total (h+g) and then we can continue? Because we might get a larger total later.\n\n   So in the TODO part, we should do:\n        index = h + g   # because h is the count for Bob, g for Alice? but wait: initially h=1 (Bob) and g=1 (Alice). Then when we add one more to Alice, g becomes 2. Then if they become equal, we set index = h+g = 3? But then we can continue? \n\n   However, note: after we set index = h+g, we must then move one step? But the problem is: we cannot just stop because we might get a larger total. So we should record the current total and then continue? How?\n\n   The provided code does not have a mechanism to update the maximum. It only has one variable \"index\" that we are going to print. So we should set index = max(index, h+g) when they are equal? But note: we are in a while loop and we are going to continue. Also, we must then move one step? But which step? \n\n   Actually, after they become equal, we can try to add one more candy to either side? But then the sums become unequal. However, we can break the current balance and then later get a new balance? So we should do:\n\n        if highest == lowest:\n            # record the current total candies: h+g\n            index = h + g   # but we want the maximum, so we set index to the maximum we have seen? \n            # But note: we are going to continue. So we should set index = h+g and then move one step? But which step? \n            # Actually, we can move either one? But the problem: we have to break the tie? \n\n   However, if we are at a state of equality, we can choose to add a candy to the left or to the right? But the problem does not require that we have to stop. We can continue and then later get a larger total when they become equal again.\n\n   But note: if we are at equality, and we add a candy to the left, then the left_sum becomes larger, so then we will have to add to the right? and vice versa. But we don't know which one to add? Actually, we can do:\n\n        We can try to add to both? But the algorithm must be deterministic.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break the tie arbitrarily? Actually, we can do: when they are equal, we add a candy to the left? Then we break the tie and continue. But note: we might miss the opportunity to add to the right and get a larger total? \n\n   However, observe: if we are at an equality, we can also choose to not do anything? But the while condition requires that we continue until h+g<=m. We are going to continue until we have eaten all? But we don't have to. We can stop? \n\n   Actually, the problem: we are allowed to stop at any time. So the maximum total candies we can get is the maximum value of (h+g) for which at some point the two sums are equal.\n\n   Therefore, we should record the current total (h+g) when we have equality, and then we can break the tie arbitrarily? because we are going to continue and then if we get another equality we will record again? \n\n   But note: if we break the tie arbitrarily, we might get stuck? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do: when they are equal, we record the total and then we add a candy to the left? and then continue? \n\n   However, what if we have: [1,1,1,1] \n        Initially: \n            left_sum = 1, right_sum = 1 -> equal -> record total=2.\n            Then we add to the left: left_sum=2, then we have to add to the right: right_sum=2 -> then we get total=4 -> record again.\n\n        So we get two records: 2 and 4. We want the maximum, which is 4.\n\n   So in the TODO part, we should do:\n\n        index = h + g   # record the current total as a candidate for the maximum\n        # Then we break the tie by adding to the left? \n        # But note: we are in the condition of equality. We can break the tie by adding to the left? \n        # However, the code structure: we are in the 'elif highest==lowest' block. We must update the state to get out of the equality? \n\n        We can do: \n            # We add the next candy to the left? but we must check if we can? (if e+1 <= r? because we are going to add the next left candy, which is at e+1, but if e+1 > r, then we break? but the while condition is h+g<=m, so we are still within bounds? because h+g is the total eaten, and we are going to add one more so h+g+1 <= m? but we must check if e+1 <= r? Actually, we are at a state where we have not taken the entire row? \n\n        However, note: we are in the while loop condition h+g<=m, meaning we can add at least one more? But we have two pointers: e and r. The next candy for the left is at e+1, and for the right at r-1. We must check that e+1 <= r? Actually, if e+1 <= r, then we can add to the left? \n\n        But what if we are at the center? For example, [1,1,1]: \n            Initially: \n                e=0, r=2 -> h=1, g=1 -> total=2, and we are in the equality block? \n                Then we set index=2.\n                Then we try to add to the left: e+1=1, which is <= r (which is 2) -> so we do:\n                    lowest += lst[1] -> becomes 1+1=2\n                    e=1\n                    g=2 -> now total=3, and then we break the loop? because h+g=3 and m=3 -> we can still run the loop? \n                Then we check: lowest=2, highest=1 -> so we then add to the right: \n                    highest += lst[1] -> but wait, r is 2, so we take r-1=1 -> lst[1]=1 -> highest=1+1=2.\n                    then r=1, h=2 -> total=4? but that exceeds m? because h+g=2+2=4 and m=3 -> the while condition fails? \n\n        Actually, the while condition is h+g<=m -> 4<=3 fails -> we break.\n\n        Then we have to check again after the last update? But note: after we break the loop, we don't check the last state? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do: when we are in the equality block, we record and then we break the tie by adding to the left? and then we break the tie by adding to the right? Actually, we can only do one? \n\n        How about: we break the tie by adding to the left? Then we update the state and then the next iteration will take care of the rest? \n\n        So in the TODO:\n\n            index = h + g   # record the current total as candidate\n            # Then we break the tie by adding to the left? \n            # But we must check if we can? (if there is at least one candy between e and r? i.e., if e+1 < r? because we are going to take e+1 and then we still have the candy at r? \n            # Actually, we are going to add one candy to the left. But note: we are in the while loop condition h+g<=m, so we can add at least one more? but we must check that e+1 <= r? \n\n            # However, if we are at the last candy? for example, if e+1 == r? then we can add the left candy? but then the next candy for the right would be at r-1, which is the same as e? -> then we have overlapping? \n\n            # Actually, we are not allowed to take the same candy. So we must have at least one candy between? \n\n            # But note: the condition of the while loop: h+g<=m -> meaning we have at least one candy left? Actually, the total candies eaten so far is h+g, and we have m - (h+g) candies left. We are going to add one more? so we require that there is at least one candy? \n\n            # However, we are going to add one candy to the left: we require that e+1 <= r? because the next candy for the left is at e+1, and we must have e+1 <= r? (because the candies from e+1 to r are available). But if e+1 == r, then we can take that candy? and then the next candy for the right would be at r-1, which is e? -> but then we have taken the same candy? \n\n            # Actually, we are taking the candy at e+1 for the left, and then the candy at r remains for the right? and then we can take the right candy at r? but that candy is still available? \n\n            # However, the candy at e+1 is taken by Alice, and the candy at r is still for Bob? then we can take the candy at r for Bob? but then we have taken the candy at e+1 and the candy at r? and if e+1 == r, then we are taking the same candy? \n\n            # Therefore, we must ensure that we do not take the same candy. So we can only add to the left if e+1 < r? \n\n            # But note: the while condition: h+g<=m -> we have at least one candy left? but that candy might be the same for both? Actually, the available candies are from e+1 to r. So if e+1 <= r, then we have at least one candy? \n\n            # However, if e+1 == r, then we have one candy left. We can only take it by one of them? but we are going to take it for the left? then we break the tie? and then the next iteration: we will have h+g = h+g+1, and then we break the while condition? because h+g might become > m? no, because we are adding one so h+g becomes the total we have eaten, and m is the total candies. So if we started with h+g = k, then after adding one we have k+1, and if k+1<=m then we are good. But if we have one candy left, then k+1 = m+? actually, k = h+g, and we are adding one so k+1, and we break the while condition when k+1 > m? \n\n            # Actually, the while condition is h+g<=m. We are going to add one, so we set g = g+1 (if we add to the left) and then h+g becomes k+1. Then we break the loop if k+1>m? but k+1<=m is the condition to stay in the loop. \n\n            # So if we have one candy left (so k = m-1) then k+1 = m -> we can do it. Then we update: \n                lowest = lowest + lst[e+1] \n                e = e+1\n                g = g+1\n            Then we break the tie? and then the next iteration: we have h+g = m, which is <=m -> we stay. Then we check: now lowest > highest? then we add to the right? but we have no candy on the right? because e+1 might be beyond r? \n\n            Actually, after we take the last candy (at e+1, which is r) then we set e = r. Then the next candy for the right would be at r-1? but r-1 is now e-1? and we have e = r, so r-1 = e-1. But we have already taken the candy at e? \n\n            So we must not take the same candy. Therefore, we should only add to the left if e+1 <= r? but if e+1==r, then we are taking the last candy. Then after that, we have e = r, and then the next candy for the right would be at r-1 = e-1, which is already taken? \n\n            Actually, we have two pointers: e is the last index taken by Alice? and r is the last index taken by Bob? Initially, Alice has taken [0, e] and Bob has taken [r, m-1]. So the available candies are from e+1 to r-1. \n\n            Therefore, we can only add to the left if e+1 <= r-1? meaning there is at least one candy between? \n\n            But wait: in the initial state, we have taken the first candy (e=0) and the last candy (r=m-1). Then the next candy for the left is at index 1, and for the right at index m-2. So we require that 1 <= m-2? which is true if m>=3.\n\n            However, in the code, when we add to the left, we do:\n                e = e+1 -> then we take the candy at e+1? Actually, the code does: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1   -> so e becomes e+1, meaning we are now at the new index? \n                Then the next available for the left is e+1? which is the next one.\n\n            Similarly, for the right: \n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n\n            So the available segment is [e+1, r-1]? \n\n            Therefore, when we are in the equality block, we can break the tie by adding to the left only if there is at least one candy available for the left? i.e., if e+1 <= r-1? but that would leave at least one candy for the right? \n\n            Actually, we can break the tie arbitrarily? but we must update at least one side? \n\n            However, we can also break the tie by adding to the left? and then the next iteration will take care of the rest? \n\n            But what if we break the tie by adding to the left and then the next iteration we break the tie by adding to the right? and then we get a new equality? \n\n            So in the TODO:\n\n                if e+1 < r:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r? (so we can take one from the left and then one from the right? but we are only going to take one now) \n                    # We break the tie by adding to the left? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    # Then we break the loop? because we cannot add any more? \n                    break\n\n            But wait: what if we break the tie by adding to the left and then the next iteration we might have to add to the right? and then we get a new equality? \n\n            However, if we break the tie by adding to the left, then we break the equality? and then the next iteration we are in the condition of lowest>highest? and then we add to the right? \n\n            But what if after adding to the left, we have e+1 == r? meaning we just took the last candy? then we break the loop? \n\n            Actually, we can do: \n\n                if e+1 < r: \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            But then we break the loop and we don't get to check the last state? \n\n            Alternatively, we can break the tie by adding to the left and then let the next iteration run? \n\n            However, if we break the tie by adding to the left and then we have e+1 == r? then the next iteration: \n                condition: h+g = (h) + (g+1) = h+g+1 -> which is <= m? \n                Then we check: if lowest < highest? or >? \n                Then we might add to the right? but the next candy for the right is at r-1? which is e? (because e is now the last taken on the left, and r is the last taken on the right, and we have e+1==r? then r-1 = e? -> but the candy at e is already taken? \n\n            So we must not do that. \n\n            Therefore, we must break the tie by adding to the left only if there is at least one candy available for the left? meaning e+1 <= r-1? because after we take the left candy, the next candy for the right must be available? \n\n            Actually, we are only taking one candy at a time. So after we take the left candy, the available segment becomes [e+1, r-1]? and we require that for the next step we have at least one candy? but we are going to do the next step in the while loop? \n\n            Alternatively, we can break the tie by adding to the left and then break the tie by adding to the right? in the same block? but that would be two steps? \n\n            But note: the while loop condition: we are only doing one step per iteration.\n\n            How about: we break the tie by adding one candy to the left and then break the loop? Then we miss the opportunity to get a larger total? \n\n            Actually, we can do: when we are in the equality block, we record the total and then we break the tie arbitrarily? and then continue the loop? but we must update the state so that we break the tie? \n\n            The original solution for this problem is known: we use two pointers and when the sums are equal we record and then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n\n            Known solution:\n\n                t = int(input().strip())\n                for _ in range(t):\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    l = 0\n                    r = n-1\n                    left_sum = 0\n                    right_sum = 0\n                    ans = 0\n                    while l <= r:\n                        if left_sum < right_sum:\n                            left_sum += a[l]\n                            l += 1\n                        elif left_sum > right_sum:\n                            right_sum += a[r]\n                            r -= 1\n                        else:\n                            # When they are equal, we record the total candies eaten: l + (n-1-r)\n                            ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                            # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                            left_sum += a[l]\n                            l += 1\n                    # Also, we must check after the loop? \n                    if left_sum == right_sum:\n                        ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                    # But note: we want the maximum ans? and we update ans every time we have equality? \n\n                However, in the above, we update ans only when we are in the equality block? and then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? and then we continue? \n\n                But what if we break the tie and then we get another equality? we will update ans again? \n\n                Actually, we update ans every time we have equality? and then we break the tie arbitrarily? \n\n                So we can do in the TODO:\n\n                    index = h + g   # record the current total\n                    # Then we break the tie by adding to the left? \n                    # But we must check if we can?

(so that e+1<=r) -> then we can take the next left candy? \n\n            But note: the available segment for the left is [e+1, r]? but we are going to take e+1? and then the next available for the left becomes e+2? and for the right remains [e+1, r]? but we have taken e+1? so the next available for the right is [e+2, r]? \n\n            Actually, the available segment is [e+1, r-1]? because we have taken [0, e] and [r, m-1]. \n\n            So if e+1 <= r-1, then we have at least one candy in the middle? \n\n            But if we break the tie by taking one candy on the left, then the available segment becomes [e+1, r-1]? which is non-empty only if e+1 <= r-1? \n\n            However, we are only taking one candy? so we require that e+1 <= r? (to take the left candy) and then after that, the available segment becomes [e+1, r-1]? which might be empty? \n\n            So we don't require that there is more than one candy? we only require that there is at least one candy to take for the left? \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                if e+1 <= r:   # meaning there is at least one candy to take on the left? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            But note: if e+1==r, then we are taking the candy at r? but wait: the candy at r is the last candy? and it is available? \n\n            However, the candy at r is available? but we are taking it for the left? then Bob cannot take it? \n\n            But the available segment for Bob is from the right? and the candy at r is the next available for Bob? but we are taking it for Alice? \n\n            That is allowed? because they are independent: Alice takes from the left, Bob from the right. But the candy at r is the next available for the right? but we are taking it from the left? \n\n            Actually, the candy at r is the last candy, and it is available for Bob? but if we take it for Alice, then Bob cannot take it? \n\n            So we must not take a candy that is the last one for Bob? \n\n            But note: the available segment is contiguous: from e+1 to r. The candy at e+1 is the next for Alice, and the candy at r is the next for Bob. They are distinct? \n\n            Therefore, we can take the candy at e+1 for Alice as long as e+1 <= r? meaning we are not taking a candy that is beyond the available segment? \n\n            However, if e+1==r, then we are taking the candy at r for Alice? and then Bob has no candy? because the next candy for Bob would be at r, but it is taken? \n\n            So we should not take the candy at r for Alice? \n\n            How do we know which candies are available? The available candies are from e+1 to r. Alice can only take from the left: so she can take the candy at e+1, then e+2, ... up to r? but Bob can only take from the right: so he can take the candy at r, then r-1, ... down to e+1? \n\n            But if we take the candy at e+1 for Alice, then the candy at e+1 is gone, and the available segment becomes [e+2, r]. Bob can still take the candy at r? \n\n            However, if e+1==r, then after taking the candy at e+1 (which is r) for Alice, the available segment becomes [e+2, r] -> which is empty? \n\n            So we can take it? \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                if e+1 <= r:   # there is at least one candy available? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            But then after taking, if e+1==r+1? and the next available for the left is e+1 which is beyond r? \n\n            Actually, after taking, e becomes e+1, and the next available for the left is e+1? which must be <= r? but if e+1 (the new e) is now r, then the next available for the left is r+1? which is beyond r? -> so we cannot take again? \n\n            So we break the tie and then the next iteration will not be in the equality block? \n\n            Therefore, we can do in the TODO:\n\n                index = h + g\n                if e+1 <= r:\n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            But note: what if we break the tie by moving the left and then the next iteration we are not in the equality block? and then we continue normally? \n\n            This should be fine.\n\n   However, the known solution also checks after the while loop? \n\n        Known solution:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                l = 0\n                r = n-1\n                left_sum = 0\n                right_sum = 0\n                ans = 0\n                while l <= r:\n                    if left_sum < right_sum:\n                        left_sum += a[l]\n                        l += 1\n                    elif left_sum > right_sum:\n                        right_sum += a[r]\n                        r -= 1\n                    else:\n                        ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                        left_sum += a[l]\n                        l += 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    ans = l + (n-1-r)\n                print(ans)\n\n        So they also check after the while loop? \n\n        Why? because if the while loop breaks with l>r, but then left_sum might be equal to right_sum? \n\n        For example: [1,1] \n            Initially: l=0, r=1, left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> enter the else block: \n                ans = 0 + (n-1-1) = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? -> that's not right.\n\n        Actually, in the known solution, they start with left_sum=0, right_sum=0, and then they enter the else block? \n            Then they set ans = 0 + (n-1-1) = 0? \n            Then they do: left_sum += a[0] -> 1, l=1.\n            Then the while condition: l<=r -> 1<=1 -> true.\n            Then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> so they do: \n                left_sum < right_sum? no, 1>0 -> then they do: right_sum += a[1] -> 1, r=0.\n            Then l=1, r=0 -> break.\n            Then they check: if left_sum==right_sum? 1==1 -> true, then set ans = l + (n-1-r) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2.\n\n        So they output 2.\n\n        Therefore, we should also check after the while loop? \n\n        But in the provided code, we have a while loop: while h+g<=m: ... \n\n        How do we relate? \n            h: count for Bob? \n            g: count for Alice? \n            total candies eaten = h+g.\n\n            The while condition: h+g<=m -> we break when h+g>m? \n\n        But note: we are also using e and r to track the next available? \n\n        Actually, the known solution uses l and r as pointers, and the total candies eaten by Alice is l (because she has taken [0, l-1]), and by Bob is (n-1 - r) (because he has taken [r+1, n-1]). \n\n        In our provided code, we have:\n            g: count for Alice? -> which is the number of candies eaten by Alice? \n            h: count for Bob? -> which is the number of candies eaten by Bob? \n\n        And we have e: the last index taken by Alice? -> so the count g = e - 0 + 1? but initially e=0, and we set g=1? then when we add one, e becomes 1, g becomes 2? so g = e+1? \n\n        Similarly, h = (m-1) - r? because initially r=m-1, then we set h=1? then when we add one, r becomes m-2, h becomes 2? so h = (m-1) - r? \n\n        Therefore, the total candies = g + h = (e+1) + ((m-1)-r) = e+1 + m-1 - r = e + m - r.\n\n        And the condition in the while loop: h+g <= m -> e+m-r <= m -> e<=r? \n\n        But note: initially e=0, r=m-1 -> e<=r? true. Then we add to the left: e becomes 1, then we check 1<=m-1? true. Then we add to the right: r becomes m-2, then we check 1<=m-2? true. \n\n        But when e becomes r? then e<=r? true. Then we add to the left: e becomes e+1, then e = r+1? then e<=r? false -> then we break? \n\n        So the while condition h+g<=m is equivalent to e<=r? \n\n        Actually, h+g = e+1 + (m-1 - r) = e + m - r, and we require e+m-r<=m -> e<=r.\n\n        So the while condition is e<=r.\n\n        Then the known solution uses l<=r? which is the same as e<=r? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            In the TODO block:\n                index = h + g   # which is the current total\n                # Then we break the tie by moving the left? \n                if e < r:   # because we are going to take e+1, and we require that e+1<=r? -> but if e<r, then e+1<=r? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            And then after the while loop, we check if lowest==highest? \n                if yes, then update index = h+g   # but we already broke the tie? \n\n            Actually, in the known solution, they break the tie in the equality block and then after the loop they check again? \n\n            How about we do:\n\n                In the while loop, when we break the tie, we break the equality? so after that, we are not in the equality state? \n\n            But then after the while loop, we might have an equality? \n\n            Example: [1,1] \n                Initially: \n                    e=0, r=1, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1 -> enter equality block.\n                    index = 1+1 = 2? \n                    Then we break the tie: e<r? 0<1 -> true, so we do:\n                         lowest += lst[1] -> 1+1=2\n                         e=1, g=2\n                    Then the while condition: e<=r? 1<=1 -> true.\n                    Then we check: lowest=2, highest=1 -> so we do the else if: highest<lowest -> then we add to the right: \n                         highest += lst[0] -> but wait, r is 1, so we take r-1=0 -> lst[0]=1 -> highest=1+1=2.\n                         r=0, h=2.\n                    Then the while condition: e<=r? 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n                    Then we have to check: if lowest==highest? then update index = g+h = 2+2=4? which is too much.\n\n            What went wrong? \n\n            We are not using the known solution's approach. The known solution uses two pointers and updates independently. \n\n            Let me refactor the provided code to match the known solution? \n\n            But the problem says: we must fill in the missing lines? \n\n            Alternatively, we can change the while condition to while e<=r? and then inside:\n\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    lowest += lst[e]   # but wait, initially we have already taken the first candy? \n\n            Actually, the provided code starts with lowest = lst[0] and highest = lst[m-1], and then we are at e=0 and r=m-1. Then the next candy for the left is at e+1? \n\n            The known solution starts with left_sum=0, right_sum=0, and then in the first iteration, they are equal, so they add the left candy? \n\n            How can we reconcile? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                We start with e=-1, r=m, g=0, h=0, lowest=0, highest=0.\n                Then the next candy for the left is at e+1=0, and for the right at r-1=m-1.\n\n            But the provided code already set e=0, r=m-1, and set lowest=lst[0], highest=lst[m-1], and g=1, h=1.\n\n            So we have already taken the first and last candy? \n\n            Therefore, we are one step ahead? \n\n            Then the known solution would start with l=0, r=n-1, left_sum=0, right_sum=0, and then in the first iteration, they are equal, so they add a[l] and then l becomes 1? \n\n            But we have already added the first candy? \n\n            So we are not aligned.\n\n            Given the time, I propose to rewrite the while loop to match the known solution? \n\n            But the problem says: we must fill in the missing lines? and the provided code has a while loop that uses h and g? \n\n            Alternatively, we can change the provided code to use the known solution? \n\n            But the TODO is only in the equality block? \n\n            How about we do:\n\n                In the TODO block:\n\n                    index = h + g   # record the current total\n\n                    # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                    # But we must check if there is a next candy? \n                    if e+1 < r:   # we require at least one candy in the middle? \n                        # We move the left pointer: \n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n            And then after the while loop, we do nothing? \n\n            But then we might miss the final state? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do as the known solution: after the while loop, if lowest==highest, then update index = h+g.\n\n            But note: in the while loop, we break when h+g>m? which is e<=r fails? \n\n            So after the while loop, we can do:\n\n                if lowest == highest:\n                    index = h+g   # but we might have already recorded a larger value? \n\n            But we want the maximum. So we should do:\n\n                if lowest == highest:\n                    if h+g > index:   # but index might not be defined? \n                        index = h+g\n\n            But we have recorded index in the while loop? and we want the maximum index? \n\n            Therefore, we should maintain a variable max_index that records the maximum total candies when we have equality? \n\n            So we change:\n\n                max_index = 0   # initialize before the while loop\n\n                then in the equality block: \n                    if h+g > max_index:\n                        max_index = h+g\n\n                then after the while loop, if lowest==highest and h+g > max_index:\n                    max_index = h+g\n\n                then at the end, print(max_index)\n\n            But note: it is possible that we never have equality? then max_index remains 0? and we output 0.\n\n            This matches the problem: if they cannot eat the same total weight, then 0.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                Before the while loop: \n                    max_index = 0\n\n                In the equality block:\n                    if h+g > max_index:\n                        max_index = h+g\n                    if e+1 < r:   # we require at least one candy in the middle? \n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n                After the while loop:\n                    if lowest == highest:\n                        if h+g > max_index:\n                            max_index = h+g\n                    index = max_index\n\n            But note: the while loop might break because of the condition h+g<=m? which is e<=r? and then we do the after-check.\n\n            However, the provided code prints \"index\", so we set index = max_index at the end.\n\n            But what if we break in the equality block? then we break the while loop and then we do the after-check? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                after the while loop (which breaks because either the condition fails or we break in the equality block), we do the after-check.\n\n            But if we break in the equality block, then we break out of the while loop, and then we do the after-check.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                max_index = 0\n                while ...:\n                    ...\n                    elif highest == lowest:\n                        if h+g > max_index:\n                            max_index = h+g\n                        if e+1 < r:   # note: we require that after taking one candy, there is still at least one candy in the middle? \n                            e += 1\n                            lowest += lst[e]\n                            g += 1\n                        else:\n                            break   # break the while loop\n\n                if highest == lowest:\n                    if h+g > max_index:\n                        max_index = h+g\n                index = max_index\n\n            But note: in the equality block, we break the tie by taking one candy on the left? and then we might have equality again in the next iteration? \n\n            However, after we take the left candy, we break the equality? so we won't be in the equality block in the next iteration? \n\n            Therefore, we can do this.\n\n            But note: the condition in the equality block for breaking: if e+1 < r? \n                This means: if there is at least two candies left? because we are going to take one (at e+1) and then there should be at least one more (at least e+2 or r-1) for the next step? \n\n            Why do we require two? because after we take one, the next iteration might try to take one on the right? and we require that the right has at least one? \n\n            But note: after we take the left candy, the available segment becomes [e+1, r-1]? and we require that for the next iteration, we have at least one candy? but the while condition is e<=r? which becomes e+1<=r-1? -> no, the while condition is on the current e and r? \n\n            Actually, after we take the left candy, we update e to e+1, and then the next available for the left is e+1, and for the right is r-1. The while condition is then: e<=r? -> which is e+1<=r? -> true if there is at least one candy? \n\n            But we require that there is at least one candy for the next step? not necessarily two. \n\n            So we should change to: if e < r:   # because we are going to take e+1, and we require e+1<=r? -> which is always true if e<r? \n\n            But note: if e+1==r, then after taking, the available segment becomes empty? but that is allowed? because the while condition next time: e+1<=r? -> becomes (e+1)<=r? -> (e+1)<= (r) -> but after taking, e becomes e+1, and r remains the same? then e<=r? -> true. Then in the next iteration, we might try to take a candy? but there is none? \n\n            Actually, after taking, we have e = e+1, and the next available for the left is e+1, which is e+1 > r? -> so we won't take it? and similarly for the right, the next available is r-1, which is e-1? which is taken? \n\n            So in the next iteration, we will be in the condition of the while loop (e<=r) -> true, but then we try to add to the left? but we have no candy for the left? \n\n            How do we avoid that? \n\n            In the if-else conditions, we only add to the left if there is a candy? but the code in the if-else conditions does not check bounds? \n\n            The provided code in the if-else conditions:\n\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    lowest += lst[e+1]   # if e+1 is beyond r? then we get an index error? \n\n            So we must ensure that in the if-else conditions, we only do the addition if there is a candy available? \n\n            But the while condition ensures that there is at least one candy? because h+g<=m means there is at least one candy left? but we are not using that to prevent index error? \n\n            Actually, the while condition is e<=r, and then in the left branch, we do e+1, which might be <=r? \n\n            In the left branch: \n                if lowest < highest:\n                    # then we add the next left candy: which is at e+1? \n                    # but we require that e+1<=r? \n                    # because the available segment is [e+1, r] for the left? \n                    # and e<=r, so e+1 might be > r? if e==r, then e+1>r? \n\n            Therefore, we should not use e+1 unconditionally. \n\n            Given the complexity, and the known solution, I propose to refactor the provided code to the known solution? \n\n            But the problem says: we must fill in the missing lines? and the missing lines are only in the TODO block? \n\n            Therefore, we will do in the TODO block:\n\n                index = h + g   # but we want the maximum, so we should use a separate variable to record the maximum? \n\n            However, the provided code prints \"index\" at the end. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                In the TODO block:\n\n                    # We record the current total if it is the maximum so far.\n                    if h+g > index:\n                        index = h+g\n\n                    # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                    if e < r:   # so that e+1<=r? \n                        lowest += lst[e+1]\n                        e += 1\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n            And then after the while loop, we don't do anything? \n\n            But then we might miss the final state? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do as the known solution and check after the while loop? \n\n            But the known solution uses a different initialization. \n\n            Given the constraints, and that the sum of n over test cases is <=200000, we can change the approach. \n\n            But the TODO is only in the equality block. \n\n            Therefore, I will output for program1.py:\n\n                max_index = 0   # we have to initialize this before the while loop? but the provided code doesn't have that. \n\n            But the provided code has:\n\n                index = 0\n\n            So we can use index as the maximum? \n\n            We change: before the while loop, we set index=0.\n\n            In the equality block:\n\n                if h+g > index:\n                    index = h+g\n                if e < r:   # meaning e+1<=r? \n                    lowest += lst[e+1]\n                    e += 1\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            And then after the while loop, we check:\n\n                if lowest == highest:\n                    if h+g > index:\n                        index = h+g\n\n            But the provided code does not have that after the while loop. \n\n            We must add that after the while loop? \n\n            But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines, and the missing lines are only in the TODO block. \n\n            Therefore, we cannot add after the while loop? \n\n            How about we do the after-check in the TODO block? \n\n            Alternatively, we can try to do the after-check in the equality block after breaking? \n\n            This is messy.\n\n        Given the complexity, and that the known solution is short, I will provide the known solution for program1.py? \n\n        But the problem says: we must not output the entire program, only the missing code.\n\n        Therefore, I will output for program1.py the following for the TODO block:\n\n            index = h + g  # record the current total as a candidate\n            # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer if possible.\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And hope that the test cases pass? \n\n        But the known solution also checks after the loop. \n\n        Since the provided code does not have an after-check, and the while loop condition is on h+g<=m (which is equivalent to e<=r), then after the while loop, we have e>r, and then we print index.\n\n        In the known solution, they do an after-check. \n\n        How can we incorporate the after-check in the while loop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the while loop condition to while e <= r: and then remove the condition on h+g? \n\n        But the provided while loop condition is while h+g<=m: which is while e<=r.\n\n        So they are the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can do the after-check after the while loop, but the provided code doesn't have it. \n\n        Given the instructions, we only fill in the TODO block. \n\n        So we output for program1.py in the TODO block:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And hope that the known solution's after-check is not needed because we break in the equality block when we can't move? \n\n        But in the [1,1] example, we would break in the equality block after recording index=2 and then breaking the tie and then in the next iteration we would have e=1, r=1, and then we would do the left branch? and then add to the left? but e+1=2>1? -> index error? \n\n        To avoid index error, in the left branch, we should only add if e+1<=r? \n\n        But the provided code in the left branch does:\n\n            if lowest < highest:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]   # if e+1 > r, then we get an index error.\n\n        So we must change the provided code in the left and right branches to check bounds? \n\n        But we are not allowed to change those? \n\n        Given the constraints, the while condition ensures e<=r, and in the left branch, we are about to add lst[e+1] only if e+1<=r? but the while condition doesn ensure that? \n\n        The while condition is e<=r, and then in the left branch, we do e+1, which might be > r? if e==r, then e+1>r. \n\n        Therefore, we should not be in the left branch if e==r? because then we would have no candy for the left? \n\n        But the condition for the left branch is lowest < highest, and we might have to add to the left even if there is no candy? \n\n        This indicates a flaw in the provided code. \n\n        Given the time, I will output for program1.py in the TODO block the following:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        and hope that the test cases are not including [1,1]? \n\n        But note: the known solution for [1,1] uses the after-check. \n\n        Therefore, we must add the after-check. \n\n        Since we are only allowed to fill in the TODO block, we cannot. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do the after-check in the equality block after we break? \n\n        But if we break, we break the while loop, and then we can do the after-check? \n\n        So in the TODO block, we can do:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                # break the loop, but then we have to check after the loop? \n                # We can't do after the loop because we are in the while loop.\n                # So we set a flag? \n                break\n\n        and then after the while loop, we do:\n\n            if lowest == highest:\n                if h+g > index:\n                    index = h+g\n\n        But again, we cannot add after the while loop. \n\n        This is a dead end. \n\n        I will output the known solution for the entire program1.py? \n\n        But the problem says: only the missing code. \n\n        Therefore, I will output for program1.py the following for the TODO block:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        and hope that the test cases pass.\n\n        If not, we might need to change the initial approach. \n\n        Let's try with [1,1] in the provided code with our TODO:\n\n            n = 2, lst = [1,1]\n            e=0, r=1, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1.\n            while 1+1<=2 -> true.\n            In the equality block: \n                index = 0 initially, then we set index = max(0,2)=2.\n                e<r? 0<1 -> true.\n                lowest += lst[1] -> 1+1=2.\n                e=1, g=2.\n            Then while condition: g+h = 2+1=3<=2? false -> break.\n            Then we print index=2.\n\n        So it works for [1,1]? \n\n        Then with [1,1,1]:\n            e=0, r=2, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1.\n            while 2<=3 -> true.\n            equality: index=0 -> set index=2.\n            e<r: 0<2 -> true.\n            lowest += lst[1] -> 1+1=2, e=1, g=2.\n            Then while: 2+1=3<=3 -> true.\n            Then compare: lowest=2, highest=1 -> so we go to the right branch.\n                highest < lowest: true.\n                highest += lst[1] -> wait, r=2, so we do lst[r-1]=lst[1]=1 -> highest=1+1=2.\n                r=1, h=2.\n            Then while: g+h=2+2=4<=3 -> false -> break.\n            Then we print index=2.\n\n        But the known solution for [1,1,1] is 0? because they cannot have the same total weight? \n            Alice: can eat [1] -> weight=1, or [1,1] -> weight=2, or [1,1,1] -> weight=3.\n            Bob: can eat [1] -> weight=1, or [1,1] -> weight=2, or [1,1,1] -> weight=3.\n            They want to be fair: \n                if Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> total=2.\n                if Alice eats [1,1] and Bob eats [1,1] -> then Alice's weight=2, Bob's weight=2 -> total=4.\n                if Alice eats [1,1,1] and Bob eats nothing? -> not allowed because Bob must eat from the right? and they cannot eat the same candy.\n\n            But note: Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right. \n                If Alice eats the first two: [1,1] (weight=2), and Bob eats the last two: [1,1] (weight=2) -> but the middle candy is not eaten? and they are not allowed to eat it because it is in the middle? \n\n            The problem: Alice can eat any number from the left (contiguous from the left) and Bob any number from the right (contiguous from the right), and they cannot eat the same candy. \n\n            In [1,1,1]: \n                Alice eats the first two: [1,1] -> weight=2.\n                Bob eats the last one: [1] -> weight=1. -> not equal.\n                Alice eats the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n                Bob eats the last two: [1,1] -> weight=2. -> not equal.\n                Alice eats the first one: [1] -> weight=1.\n                Bob eats the last one: [1] -> weight=1. -> equal, total=2.\n                Alice eats the first three: [1,1,1] -> weight=3.\n                Bob eats nothing -> not allowed? but the problem says they can eat any number, including zero? \n\n            The problem: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\", so including zero? \n            But then the total number of candies eaten might be zero? and that is fair? but the problem says \"they want to be fair\", and zero equals zero. \n\n            However, the note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2.\"\n\n            So they must eat at least one candy? \n\n            Therefore, in [1,1,1], the answer is 2.\n\n            So our TODO works for [1,1,1]? \n\n            But in our simulation, we got index=2, and then we break the while loop and output 2.\n\n            So it is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py in the TODO block:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But note: the variable 'index' might not have been set to a candidate? and we are using it as the maximum. \n\n        We initialized index=0, and then in the equality block, we set index = max(index, h+g). \n\n        This is correct.\n\n        So for program1.py, the completion is:\n\n            if h+g > index:\n                index = h+g\n            if e < r:\n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n We are to determine if a string s (of 'W', 'R', 'B') can be formed by stamping with a stamp that always stamps two adjacent cells as either \"BR\" or \"RB\", and we can stamp anywhere multiple times.\n\n Approach for program2.py:\n\n   We note that the stamping operation always changes two adjacent cells from white to either BR or RB. Also, we can stamp on already stamped cells, which may change the color? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". \n\n   This means that if a cell is stamped multiple times, its color might change. \n\n   But note the example: \n        \"WWWWW\" -> stamp on positions 2 and 3 (0-indexed) with RB: becomes \"WW RB W\" -> \"WWRBW\"\n        then stamp on positions 1 and 2 with BR: becomes \"W BR R BW\" -> \"WBRBW\" -> but wait, the cell at position 2 was R and becomes B? \n\n   How does the stamp work when reapplied? \n        The stamp sets the two cells to either BR or RB, regardless of what was there.\n\n   Therefore, the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it.\n\n   Also, we can stamp on any two adjacent cells that are completely within the array.\n\n   Observations:\n\n   - A white cell 'W' can only be left white if it is never stamped.\n\n   - The stamping operation requires two adjacent cells. Therefore, a single cell cannot be stamped alone.\n\n   - Also, note that the entire array might be stamped in any order.\n\n   Insight:\n\n   - We can think in reverse: what are the necessary conditions on the final string?\n\n   Conditions:\n\n   1. If the string has length 1, then it must be 'W'. Because we cannot stamp a single cell.\n\n   2. The stamping operation always affects two cells. Therefore, if there is at least one non-white cell, then there must be at least two non-white cells? Not exactly: because we can stamp on the same cell multiple times. But note: each stamp covers two adjacent cells. So if there is one non-white cell, then there must be an adjacent non-white cell that was stamped at the same time? \n\n   3. Also, note that the entire array might not be contiguous non-white. We can have white in between.\n\n   Another approach: we can split the string by 'W' and then check each contiguous segment of non-white.\n\n   Why? because the stamping on one segment does not affect another segment (since they are separated by white).\n\n   For a contiguous segment of non-white cells of length L:\n\n        - If L is 1, then it is impossible -> because we cannot have a single non-white cell.\n\n        - If L>=2, then we need to check if it is possible.\n\n   But is every contiguous segment of non-white cells of length>=2 possible? \n\n   Let's see:\n\n        For L=2: \n            \"RR\" -> impossible? because the stamp must be either \"BR\" or \"RB\", so it cannot be \"RR\".\n            \"BB\" -> similarly impossible.\n            \"RB\" or \"BR\" -> possible.\n\n        For L=3:\n            \"RRR\" -> impossible? \n            How to make \"RRR\": \n                We must have at least one stamp that covers two cells and leaves two R's. But the stamp leaves one R and one B. \n                If we stamp the first two as RB, then we have \"R B W\", then we stamp the last two? but then we get \"R B R\" -> \"RBR\", not \"RRR\".\n\n            Alternatively, stamp the last two as BR: then we have \"W B R\", then stamp the first two as RB: then we have \"R B R\", not \"RRR\".\n\n            So \"RRR\" is impossible.\n\n            \"RBR\": \n                We can do: \n                    stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W\"\n                    then stamp the last two as BR: -> \"R B R\" -> \"RBR\" -> works.\n\n            \"RBB\":\n                stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W\"\n                then stamp the last two as RB: -> \"R B R\" -> not RBB.\n\n                Alternatively, stamp the last two as BR: -> then we have \"R B B\" -> works.\n\n            So \"RBB\" is possible.\n\n        What is the pattern?\n\n        We note that the stamping operation is reversible in terms of the counts of R and B modulo 2? \n\n        Insight from known problems: \n            In the final segment, the number of R and B must not be both zero, and we must be able to form the segment by a sequence of stamps.\n\n        Another insight: \n            In any contiguous segment of non-white cells, the following must hold:\n                - It is impossible to have a segment of length 1.\n                - In a segment, if we have all the same color, then it is impossible.\n\n        But wait: can we have a segment of length>=2 with all the same color? \n            We saw that for length=2, \"RR\" is impossible.\n            For length=3, \"RRR\" is impossible.\n            For length=4, \"RRRR\": \n                We can try: \n                    stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n                    then stamp the last two as RB: -> \"R B W R B\" -> not RRRR.\n\n                Alternatively, stamp the middle two as RB: -> \"W R B W\", then we have two segments.\n\n                It seems impossible.\n\n        Therefore, a necessary condition: in any contiguous non-white segment, there must be at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'.\n\n        Is that sufficient? \n\n        For length=2: then we must have one R and one B -> then it is either \"RB\" or \"BR\", which are exactly the stamps.\n\n        For length=3: \n            We must have at least one R and one B. \n            Possibilities: \n                \"RRB\": \n                    We can do: \n                        stamp the last two as BR: -> then we have \"W W B R\" -> but then we have two segments? \n                    Alternatively, stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W\" -> then stamp the last two as BR: -> \"R B B R\" -> not RRB.\n\n                How about:\n                    stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W\"\n                    then stamp the second and third as BR: -> \"R B R\" -> not RRB.\n\n                Alternatively, start with the last two: \n                    stamp the last two as BR: -> \"W B R\"\n                    then stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B R\" -> not RRB.\n\n                How to make \"RRB\":\n                    We can do:\n                        stamp the first two as RR? -> not allowed.\n                        or stamp the first two as RB: -> \"R B W\", then we want to change the B to R? \n                        then stamp the second cell twice? \n                            first: stamp cell1 and cell2: but cell2 is currently B, and we stamp with say BR: then cell1 becomes B, cell2 becomes R -> then we have \"B R W\", then stamp cell0 and cell1: with RB: -> cell0 becomes R, cell1 becomes B -> \"R B W\" -> back.\n\n                It might be impossible.\n\n        Let me try \"RBR\" again: we did it.\n\n        What is the difference between \"RRB\" and \"RBR\"?\n\n        In \"RBR\", we have alternating colors. In \"RRB\", we have two R's and then a B.\n\n        How about we try to make \"RRB\" by stamping in the middle first:\n\n            Start: \"WWW\"\n            Stamp on the first two: \"R B W\"\n            Now we have \"RBW\". We want \"RRB\". \n            Stamp on the second and third: with what? \n                If we use BR: then cell2 becomes R, cell3 becomes B? -> \"R R B\" -> \"RRB\". \n\n            So: \n                step1: stamp positions0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W\"\n                step2: stamp positions1 and2 as BR: -> \"R\" (from the first stamp) and then for the second stamp: \n                    cell1: originally B, becomes B then becomes R? \n                    cell2: originally W, becomes B? \n                -> \"R\" (from cell0), then cell1 becomes R (because the second stamp is BR: the first cell of the stamp is B and the second is R? but wait, the stamp is applied on positions1 and2: \n                    the stamp BR means: the left cell becomes B and the right cell becomes R? \n                    but then cell1 becomes B? \n                -> \"R\", then cell1 becomes B, cell2 becomes R -> \"RBR\".\n\n            How to get cell1 to become R? \n\n            The stamp can be applied as either BR or RB. \n                If we apply as BR: then the left cell becomes B and the right cell becomes R.\n                If we apply as RB: then the left cell becomes R and the right cell becomes B.\n\n            So for the second stamp on positions1 and2, if we want cell1 to become R, we use RB: \n                then cell1 becomes R, cell2 becomes B -> then we have \"R\" (cell0), \"R\" (cell1), \"B\" (cell2) -> \"RRB\".\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is not just that there is at least one R and one B, but also that the segment has at least two letters and is not monochromatic.\n\n        But wait, in a segment of length>=2, if it is not monochromatic, then it is possible? \n\n        We can use a greedy approach: \n            We can start from the left and fix the colors one by one.\n\n        However, there is a known solution: \n            - Split the string by 'W'\n            - For each segment, if the segment length is 1, then return \"NO\".\n            - Also, if the segment is not empty and (it is all 'R' or all 'B'), then return \"NO\".\n            - Otherwise, return \"YES\".\n\n        But note: what about empty segments? skip.\n\n        However, consider: \n            \"RW\" -> \n                split: ['', 'R'] -> the first segment is empty, the second is ['R'] -> then we return \"NO\" for the second segment.\n\n            \"WRW\" -> \n                split: ['','R',''] -> the segment 'R' -> length=1 -> \"NO\".\n\n            \"RR\" -> \n                split: ['RR'] -> length=2, but it is all 'R' -> \"NO\".\n\n            \"RB\" -> \n                split: ['RB'] -> not all R and not all B -> \"YES\".\n\n        But what about \"R\" in a segment of length1 -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        What about \"RRB\": \n            not all R and not all B -> \"YES\".\n\n        What about \"RBR\": \n            not all R and not all B -> \"YES\".\n\n        What about \"RRBB\": \n            not all R and not all B -> \"YES\".\n\n        But is \"RRBB\" possible? \n            We can do:\n                Step1: stamp the middle two as RB: \n                    \"W W W W\" -> stamp positions1 and2 as RB: -> \"W R B W\"\n                Step2: stamp the first two as BR: \n                    positions0 and1: -> \"B R B W\" -> not RRBB.\n                Step2: alternatively, stamp positions0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B B W\"\n                Step3: stamp positions2 and3 as BR: -> \"R B B R\" -> not RRBB.\n\n            How about:\n                Step1: stamp positions0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n                Step2: stamp positions1 and2 as BR: -> \"R B becomes R then B? \n                    when we stamp positions1 and2 as BR: \n                        cell1 becomes B, cell2 becomes R -> \"R B R W\"\n                Step3: stamp positions2 and3 as RB: -> \"R B R becomes R then B? -> cell2 becomes R (from step2) then becomes R (from step3) -> no, in step3 we set cell2 to R and cell3 to B? -> \"R B R B\"\n\n            How to get two R's together? \n\n            We can do:\n                We want positions0 and1 to be 'RR'. \n                How? \n                    Stamp positions0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B ...\"\n                    then stamp positions0 and1 again as RB: -> then cell0 becomes R, cell1 becomes B -> still not RR.\n\n                Stamp positions0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B ...\"\n                then stamp positions0 and1 as BR: -> then cell0 becomes B, cell1 becomes R -> \"B R ...\"\n\n                Then we have not RR.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n                positions0 and1: first with RB: \"R B\"\n                then positions0 and1 with RB again: \"R B\" -> still the same.\n\n            It seems we cannot change cell0 and1 to \"RR\".\n\n            Therefore, \"RRBB\" might be impossible? \n\n            But wait, we can do:\n\n                positions0 and1: stamp with RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n                positions1 and2: stamp with BR: -> \"R (then at1: B becomes B then becomes R? -> no, the second stamp on positions1 and2: \n                    if we use BR: then cell1 becomes B, cell2 becomes R -> \"R B R W\"\n                positions2 and3: stamp with BR: -> \"R B R becomes R, then cell2 becomes B, cell3 becomes R -> \"R B B R\"\n\n                -> \"RBBR\", not \"RRBB\".\n\n            How about:\n\n                positions0 and1: stamp with RB: \"R B W W\"\n                positions0 and1 again with BR: -> cell0 becomes B, cell1 becomes R -> \"B R W W\"\n                positions1 and2: stamp with RB: -> cell1 becomes R, cell2 becomes B -> \"B R B W\"\n                positions2 and3: stamp with BR: -> cell2 becomes B, cell3 becomes R -> \"B R B R\"\n\n            still not.\n\n            It might be impossible.\n\n        What is the pattern then? \n\n        Known solution from Codeforces problems: \n            - We can do: \n                for each test case:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == \"\"? \n                    else:\n                        if 'R' not in s and 'B' not in s: # then it's all W -> skip? \n                        else:\n                            # split by W\n                            parts = s.split('W')\n                            for part in parts:\n                                if part == \"\":\n                                    continue\n                                if len(part) == 1:\n                                    print(\"NO\")\n                                    break\n                                if part.count('R')==0 or part.count('B')==0:\n                                    print(\"NO\")\n                                    break\n                            else:\n                                print(\"YES\")\n\n            But the example \"RRBB\" is not monochromatic? but it is not possible.\n\n        Let me try known solution on \"RRBB\": \n            split by 'W' -> ['RRBB'] \n            len=4, not 1 -> skip the first condition.\n            part.count('R') = 2, part.count('B')=2 -> both >0 -> then it would return \"YES\", but we saw it is not possible.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is not sufficient.\n\n        Another known solution: \n            We can use dynamic programming or greedy? \n\n        Insight: \n            The stamping operation is very similar to the dominos. And we can use the following:\n\n            - The operation is reversible in the sense that the final pattern must be such that the number of R and B in the entire string is not independent, but also the positions.\n\n        Another approach: \n            We can remove any stamping that is at the end? \n\n        Known solution from a similar problem (from past contests) is to check that there are no isolated letters? \n\n        Specifically, in a contiguous non-white segment, it must be that there is no isolated R or B. \n\n        What is an isolated R? \n            An R that has only B's or boundaries on both sides? \n\n        But in \"RBR\", there is no isolated R: \n            R at0: has a B at1.\n            B at1: has R at0 and R at2.\n            R at2: has B at1.\n\n        In \"RRB\": \n            R at0: has R at1 -> not isolated.\n            R at1: has R at0 and B at2 -> not isolated.\n            B at2: has R at1 -> not isolated.\n\n        In \"RRBB\": \n            R0: has R1.\n            R1: has R0 and B2.\n            B2: has R1 and B3.\n            B3: has B2.\n\n        So no isolated letter.\n\n        But we couldn't find a way to stamp \"RRBB\".\n\n        How about we try to make \"RR\":\n\n            We cannot, because the only stamps are BR and RB.\n\n        So the condition might be that the segment has at least two letters and is not monochromatic, and also has at least one change in color? \n\n        But \"RRB\" has a change (from R to B) and we were able to make it.\n\n        What is the difference between \"RRB\" and \"RRBB\"? \n\n        In \"RRB\", the change happens at the last two. In \"RRBB\", the change happens in the middle.\n\n        Another try for \"RRBB\":\n\n            We want to have positions0 and1 as 'RR'. How can we have two R's adjacent? \n                The only way to have two R's adjacent is if the last stamp that covered them was a stamp that set the left cell to R and the right cell to B or R? \n                But the stamp sets them to either BR or RB. \n\n            Therefore, it is impossible to have two R's adjacent? \n\n            But wait: if we stamp the same pair twice: \n                first: stamp as RB: -> R and B.\n                then stamp again as RB: -> R and B. \n                or as BR: -> B and R.\n\n            So we cannot get RR.\n\n            Similarly, we cannot get BB.\n\n            Therefore, the necessary condition is that in the final pattern, there should be no two adjacent R's and no two adjacent B's? \n\n            But then \"RBR\" is valid (alternating) and we can make it.\n\n            And \"RRB\" has two adjacent R's -> then it should be impossible? but we were able to make it.\n\n            How did we make \"RRB\"? \n                We did:\n                    Start: \"WWW\"\n                    Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W\"\n                    Step2: stamp1 and2 as RB: -> then cell1 becomes R, cell2 becomes B -> \"R R B\"\n\n            So we have two R's at0 and1.\n\n            How? because the second stamp changed cell1 from B to R.\n\n            Therefore, it is possible to have two R's adjacent.\n\n        After rethinking, the known solution that is accepted in Codeforces for this problem is:\n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                if n==1:\n                    if s[0]=='W':\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                # split by W\n                parts = s.split('W')\n                for part in parts:\n                    if part == '':\n                        continue\n                    if len(part)==1:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        But we saw that \"RRBB\" would be accepted by this, but we couldn't make it.\n\n        However, note: in \"RRBB\", 'R' is in the part and 'B' is in the part, and length>=2, so it would return \"YES\", but we think it's not possible.\n\n        Let me try to make \"RRBB\" again, but more carefully:\n\n            We have 4 cells: [0,1,2,3]\n\n            We want: \"RRBB\"\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> cell0='R', cell1='B'\n            Step2: stamp0 and1 again as BR: -> cell0='B', cell1='R'\n            Step3: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> cell0='R', cell1='B'  ... we are looping.\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> cell1 becomes 'B' (from the first stamp) -> then we stamp as BR: so cell1 becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: the left cell becomes 'B')? -> cell1='B', cell2='R'\n                     -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step3: stamp2 and3 as RB: -> cell2='R' becomes 'R' (from step2) -> then we stamp as RB: cell2='R', cell3='B' -> \"R B R B\"\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> \"B R W W\"\n            Step3: stamp1 and2 as RB: -> cell1='R' becomes 'R' (from step2) -> stamped as RB: cell1='R' becomes 'R' (if we use RB: then cell1 becomes 'R', cell2 becomes 'B') -> \"B R B W\"\n            Step4: stamp2 and3 as BR: -> \"B R B R\"\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step2: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> \"R B (stamped as BR: cell1 becomes 'B'? -> no, the stamp BR means: left cell becomes 'B', right cell becomes 'R') -> cell1='B' becomes 'B'? or overwritten to 'B'? \n                     -> cell1='B' (unchanged) and cell2='R' -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step3: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> cell0='R' becomes 'B', cell1='B' becomes 'R' -> \"B R R W\"\n            Step4: stamp2 and3 as RB: -> \"B R R B\"\n\n            Now we have \"BRRB\", not \"RRBB\".\n\n            Step1: stamp0 and1 as BR: -> \"B R W W\"\n            Step2: stamp0 and1 as RB: -> \"R B W W\"\n            Step3: stamp1 and2 as BR: -> \"R B becomes R then B? -> cell1='B' becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: becomes 'B' for the left cell) -> cell1='B', cell2='R' -> \"R B R W\"\n            Step4: stamp1 and2 as RB: -> cell1='B' becomes 'R', cell2='R' becomes 'B' -> \"R R B W\"\n            Step5: stamp2 and3 as BR: -> cell2='B' becomes 'B' (from the stamp BR: becomes 'B' for the left cell) -> cell2='B', cell3='R' -> \"R R B R\"\n\n            not \"RRBB\".\n\n        After several tries, I cannot make \"RRBB\". \n\n        Therefore, the known solution might be: \n            - The segment must have at least one R and one B, and also"
