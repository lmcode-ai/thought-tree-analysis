Hmm, the problem statement says that they can use portals which they leave in each cell they visit. The key here is to find the optimal path where they can use the portals to minimize the total energy. The code provided has some conditions. The first condition checks if m > n, then it outputs 2n + m -2. The else if part is where the TODO is, and the else part uses 2m + n -2. Wait, but what's the condition for the else if to print 0? Looking at the note in the code, the else if is supposed to print 0. When would the answer be zero? Oh right, maybe when the grid is 1x1.",

So the condition here should check if n ==1 and m ==1. Because in that case, they don't need to move at all. Let me think again. Wait, the problem says Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). If the grid is 1x1, then n=1 and m=1. So both their start and end points are the same. So the total energy is 0. So that's the case when the output is 0. So the else if condition should be (n ==1 && m ==1). But let me check other possibilities. What if one of them is 1 but not both? Like if n=1 and m=5. Then Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,5), which is moving right 4 steps. Megan's path is from (1,1) (since n=1) to (1,5), same as Stanley. Wait, Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1). So both start at same point. But their destinations are same as well.

So the total energy would be the sum of their individual paths. Wait, but in that case, maybe the code's formula would apply. Let me see. Wait the code's first condition is if m >n. Let's see when n=1 and m=5. Then m is 5 which is greater than n=1, so the first condition would trigger, and output 2*5 +1-2 = 10 +1-2=9. But in reality, Stanley's path is 4 steps (from (1,1) to (1,5)), and Megan's path is same 4 steps. So total is 8. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables. Wait in the code, the variables are named m and n, but in the problem statement, the input is n and m. Wait the code's code says: In the code, the input is scanf(\"%d %d\",&m,&n); So the first input is stored in m (rows), and the second in n (columns). Wait the problem says the input is two integers n and m. So the code might have swapped the variables. Because in the problem, the first input is n (rows), m (columns). But in the code, the variables are declared as int m,n; and then scanf reads into m and n. So the first input is stored in m (the code's variable m is the problem's n), and the second is the code's n which is the problem's m. So that's important. So in the code, the variables m and n are the problem's n and m respectively. So when the code has if(m>n), that's comparing the problem's n (rows) to problem's m (columns). So in the case where problem's n=1 and m=5 (so code's m=1, n=5), then m (problem's n) is 1, which is less than code's n (problem's m=5). So the first condition (if m>n) would be 1>5? No, so it would go to else. Then else part would print 2*m + code's n -2. Wait code's variables: m is problem's n, n is problem's m. So in that case, 2*1 +5 -2 = 2+5-2=5. But the actual required energy would be Stanley's path (4 steps) and Megan's path (4 steps) totaling 8. So that's conflicting. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought is wrong. Wait perhaps I need to re-express the formulas. Let me think again.",

So problem's n is 7, m is5. So code's variables m=7, n=5. Since m (7) >n (5), the first condition applies. The formula would be 2*5 +7-2 = 10+5=15? Wait 2*5 is 10, plus 7-2 is 5, total 15. Which matches the sample's answer of 15. So that works. Another test case: when n=1 and m=1 (code's m=1, n=1). Then the else if condition (n==1 && m==1) would trigger, outputting 0. That's correct. Another case: when problem's n=1 and m=5 (code's m=1, n=5). Since m (problem's n=1) is less than code's n (5), so the else part is triggered.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program that calculates the minimum total energy for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations using portals. Hmm, the problem statement says that they can use portals which they leave in each cell they visit. The key here is to find the optimal path where they can use the portals to minimize the total energy.\n\nThe code provided has some conditions. The first condition checks if m > n, then it outputs 2n + m -2. The else if part is where the TODO is, and the else part uses 2m + n -2. Wait, but what's the condition for the else if to print 0?\n\nLooking at the note in the code, the else if is supposed to print 0. When would the answer be zero? Oh right, maybe when the grid is 1x1. Because if n and m are both 1, then both start and end points are the same. So Stanley and Megan are already at their destinations, so no energy needed. So the condition here should check if n ==1 and m ==1. Because in that case, they don't need to move at all. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). If the grid is 1x1, then n=1 and m=1. So both their start and end points are the same. So the total energy is 0. So that's the case when the output is 0. So the else if condition should be (n ==1 && m ==1). \n\nBut let me check other possibilities. What if one of them is 1 but not both? Like if n=1 and m=5. Then Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,5), which is moving right 4 steps. Megan's path is from (1,1) (since n=1) to (1,5), same as Stanley. Wait, Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1). So both start at same point. But their destinations are same as well. So in that case, maybe the answer would be 0? Wait no, because Megan's destination is (1, m) which is same as Stanley's. So if n=1 and m=5, then both start and end at the same points. Wait, Megan's start is (n,1) which is (1,1), and her destination is (1, m) which is (1,5). So she has to move from (1,1) to (1,5). So the total energy would be the sum of their individual paths. Wait, but in that case, maybe the code's formula would apply. Let me see.\n\nWait the code's first condition is if m >n. Let's see when n=1 and m=5. Then m is 5 which is greater than n=1, so the first condition would trigger, and output 2*5 +1-2 = 10 +1-2=9. But in reality, Stanley's path is 4 steps (from (1,1) to (1,5)), and Megan's path is same 4 steps. So total is 8. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables. Wait in the code, the variables are named m and n, but in the problem statement, the input is n and m. Wait the code's code says:\n\nIn the code, the input is scanf(\"%d %d\",&m,&n); So the first input is stored in m (rows), and the second in n (columns). Wait the problem says the input is two integers n and m. So the code might have swapped the variables. Because in the problem, the first input is n (rows), m (columns). But in the code, the variables are declared as int m,n; and then scanf reads into m and n. So the first input is stored in m (the code's variable m is the problem's n), and the second is the code's n which is the problem's m. So that's important. So in the code, the variables m and n are the problem's n and m respectively. So when the code has if(m>n), that's comparing the problem's n (rows) to problem's m (columns). \n\nSo in the case where problem's n=1 and m=5 (so code's m=1, n=5), then m (problem's n) is 1, which is less than code's n (problem's m=5). So the first condition (if m>n) would be 1>5? No, so it would go to else. Then else part would print 2*m + code's n -2. Wait code's variables: m is problem's n, n is problem's m. So in that case, 2*1 +5 -2 = 2+5-2=5. But the actual required energy would be Stanley's path (4 steps) and Megan's path (4 steps) totaling 8. So that's conflicting. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought is wrong. \n\nWait perhaps I need to re-express the formulas. Let me think again. The code's current approach is that when m (problem's n) is greater than n (problem's m), then the formula is 2n + m -2. Else, when m <=n, then it's 2m +n-2. Except when both are 1, then 0. \n\nWait let's see the sample input given in the note. The first test case's example: the note says Megan moves to (7,3), which implies that the grid is 7 rows and 5 columns (since the lower-right is (7,5)). So problem's n is 7, m is5. So code's variables m=7, n=5. Since m (7) >n (5), the first condition applies. The formula would be 2*5 +7-2 = 10+5=15? Wait 2*5 is 10, plus 7-2 is 5, total 15. Which matches the sample's answer of 15. So that works. \n\nAnother test case: when n=1 and m=1 (code's m=1, n=1). Then the else if condition (n==1 && m==1) would trigger, outputting 0. That's correct. \n\nAnother case: when problem's n=1 and m=5 (code's m=1, n=5). Since m (problem's n=1) is less than code's n (5), so the else part is triggered. The formula would be 2*m + code's n -2 \u2192 2*1 +5-2 \u2192 2+3=5. But the actual required energy would be Stanley's path (4 steps) and Megan's path (4 steps) \u2192 total 8. So that's a problem. Wait why the discrepancy?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's solution approach. Let me think about the problem again. The minimal total energy. The key is that they can use portals. So perhaps the optimal path involves using portals to minimize the total steps. \n\nThe problem says that whenever a person is in a cell with a portal, they can teleport to any other portal cell with 1 energy. Since Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits, the portals are all the cells along her path. Similarly, Stanley leaves portals in his path. But since they can choose their paths and timing, perhaps the optimal is to have their paths cross so that they can use each other's portals. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy can be calculated as the sum of their individual minimal paths without considering portals, but that's probably not the case. The portals allow them to teleport, so the minimal total would be less. \n\nWait the problem's note example uses portals to reduce the steps. So the formula in the code must have found a way to compute the minimal total based on some pattern. Let me think of the formula given in the code. \n\nLooking at the code's formula when m (problem's n) > n (problem's m):\n\nThe formula is 2*n + m -2. So substituting variables, if problem's n is rows, m columns. So when rows > columns, the formula is 2*columns + rows -2. \n\nWait let's see for the case when problem's n=1 (rows=1), m=5 (columns=5). Then since rows (1) < columns (5), so the else part is taken. The formula would be 2*1 +5 -2 \u2192 2+5-2=5. But the actual minimal energy? Let's think:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,5). Since it's a single row, he can just move right 4 steps (cost 4). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1) and needs to go to (1,5). So same path, 4 steps. Total 8. But according to the code's formula, it's 5. So that's conflicting. So either the code is wrong, or my understanding is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me recheck the problem's description. \n\nProblem says:\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (n,m). Megan's from (n,1) to (1,m). \n\nIn the case where n=1 (rows), m=5 (columns). So Stanley's start and end are (1,1) to (1,5). So he needs to move 4 steps right. Megan's start is (1,1) (since n=1) and her end is (1,5). So same as Stanley. So both have to move 4 steps. So total is 8. But according to the code's formula when m (problem's n=1) is less than code's n (problem's m=5), the formula gives 2*1 +5-2 =5. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem requires us to complete the code as given. Wait the user is asking to complete the code, so maybe the code's approach is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is correct and I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. \n\nWait maybe the minimal total energy is not the sum of their individual paths, but there's a way to use portals to reduce the total. \n\nIn the case where n=1 and m=5. Let's see:\n\nStanley and Megan both need to go from (1,1) to (1,5). \n\nThey can choose their paths. Since Megan leaves portals in every cell she visits. Suppose Megan takes a path that allows Stanley to use her portals. \n\nFor example, Megan could go directly to (1,5), leaving portals along the way. Then Stanley can use those portals. \n\nWait, but Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). So she leaves portals in all cells along her path. Suppose she takes the direct path, moving right each step. So the portals are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). \n\nStanley can start at (1,1). He can use the portal at (1,1) to teleport to any other portal. For instance, he can teleport directly to (1,5) using 1 energy. So his total cost would be 1. \n\nMegan's cost is 4 (moving each step). So total is 4+1=5, which matches the code's formula. Oh right! Because Stanley can use Megan's portals. \n\nAh, that's the key. So the code's formula is correct. \n\nSo in this case, Megan's path is 4 steps. Stanley uses the portal at (1,1) to teleport to (1,5) with 1 step. So total is 4+1=5. Which is exactly what the code's formula gives. \n\nSo the code's approach is correct. \n\nSo the missing condition in the else if is when both n and m are 1. Because in that case, they don't need to move. \n\nSo the code's else if condition should check if (m ==1 && n ==1). Because when both are 1, the answer is 0. \n\nWait in code variables, m is problem's n, and n is problem's m. So when problem's n and m are both 1, then code's m and n are both 1. So the condition is (m ==1 && n ==1). \n\nSo the code's else if block is:\n\nelse if (m == 1 && n ==1) then print 0. \n\nSo the code's current else if is:\n\nelse if(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\nSo the missing code is (m ==1 && n ==1). \n\nWait but let me check another case. Suppose n=1 and m=2 (problem's n=1 rows, m=2 columns). Then code's variables m=1, n=2. Since m (1) <= n (2), so else part is taken. The formula is 2*1 +2-2 \u2192 2+0=2. \n\nLet's see: Megan's path from (1,1) to (1,2). She can move right once (cost 1). Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) using the portal (cost 1). So total is 1+1=2. Which matches. \n\nAnother case: n=3, m=3 (problem's n=3 rows, m=3 columns). So code's m=3, n=3. Since m equals n, so the else part is taken. The formula is 2*3 +3-2 \u21926+1=7. \n\nWhat's the minimal total? Let's see:\n\nThey can plan their paths so that they meet somewhere. For example, Megan could go to the center, and Stanley uses that portal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is when they both take paths that allow using portals. \n\nAlternatively, the formula gives 7. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the minimal total is 7. Let me think of their paths. \n\nSuppose Megan takes a path that allows Stanley to teleport. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from the minimal path when they can use portals optimally. \n\nThe formula seems to be that when the grid is square (m =n), then 2*m + m-2 \u2192 3m-2? Wait no, 2*m +n-2 where m and n are equal. So 2m +m-2 = 3m-2. For m=3, that's 7. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is correct. \n\nSo the only case when the answer is 0 is when both m and n (code's variables) are 1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the else if condition is (m ==1 && n ==1). \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nelse if (m == 1 && n ==1)\n\nThen the printf(\"0\\n\"); \n\nSo the code's else if block is filled with that condition. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"m == 1 && n == 1\"."
