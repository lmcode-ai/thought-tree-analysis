The problem is about finding the number of substrings of a given binary string S that are \"paranoid\". A paranoid string T of length m can be reduced to a single character by performing m-1 operations. The operations are replacing \"01\" with \"1\" or \"10\" with \"0\". Hmm, so the key is to determine for each possible substring whether it's paranoid. The code provided starts with ans = n*(n+1)/2, which is the total number of possible substrings (since each substring is determined by its start and end).",

Wait, the code's loop is going through each i from 0 to n-2 (since it's while i < n-1). For each i, if some condition is true, it subtracts (i+1) from ans. Wait, the code says ans = ans - i -1. Wait, the line is ans=ans - i -1. Wait, maybe the code is trying to subtract the number of invalid substrings starting at some position? Alternatively, perhaps the condition is checking for runs of the same character, or something else. Let me think about what makes a substring not paranoid. Let me think about the process of reducing the string. Each operation reduces the length by 1. So for a string of length m, after m-1 operations, it becomes length 1. The operations can be done in any order. What's the condition for a string to be paranoid? Let's see examples. The third sample note says that the substring \"101\" is paranoid. Let's see: the entire string is 101. Let's see possible steps. Maybe first replace the \"10\" (positions 2-3) with 0, resulting in \"10\", then replace that with 0.",

Wait, let's see \"001\" has transitions between 0 and 1 (one transition). The transitions count is 1 (odd). \"010\" has two transitions (even). Hmm, but \"010\" can be reduced. Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Perhaps I should think of the problem differently.

Hmm, perhaps the number of runs must be odd or even? Wait, in the case of \"0101\" (4 runs), it can be reduced. Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Alternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the code provided. The code starts with ans = n*(n+1)/2, which is the total number of substrings. Then, it loops through each i from 0 to n-2, and if some condition is met, subtracts (i+1) from ans. The code's logic is to subtract the number of invalid substrings. The condition in the loop is probably checking for runs of the same character. The code's loop is: while(i < n-1) { \n\n   if (condition) { \n\n      ans -= i+1; \n\n   } \n\n   i +=1; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the loop is written as a while loop, incrementing i by 1 each time. The condition is probably checking for a pair of consecutive same characters. Because the invalid substrings are those that have two consecutive same characters, but that's not the case. Wait, let's think of the example where the string is \"000\". The total substrings are 6. The valid substrings are the single characters (3), so the answer is 3. The code's initial ans is 6. The loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since n is 3). At i=0: check if s[0] == s[1]. Yes (both 0). So subtract 0+1 =1 \u2192 ans becomes 5. At i=1: check s[1] and s[2] (both 0). Subtract 1+1=2 \u2192 ans becomes 3. At i=2: the loop condition is i < n-1 \u2192 2 < 2 \u2192 false. So loop ends. The final ans is 3, which is correct. So the condition is checking whether s[i] == s[i+1].",

But how does the subtraction work? Let me think of the example \"000\". The invalid substrings are those with length >=2. The total invalid substrings are 3 (the two 0s) + 1 (the three 0s) \u2192 total 3. The code subtracts 1 (for i=0) and 2 (for i=1) \u2192 total 3, which matches. Another example: \"001\". The invalid substrings are the first two 0s (substring [0,1]). The code subtracts 1 (for i=0) \u2192 total subtracted 1. The total invalid substrings are 1 (the substring \"00\"). The code's approach is correct here. Another example: \"010\". The consecutive pairs are 0-1 (different), 1-0 (different). So no subtraction. Thus, the answer is 6 (3*4/2 = 6). But according to earlier analysis, the entire string \"010\" is valid. Yes, so the code would return 6, which is correct. Another example: \"0011\". The consecutive pairs are 0-0 (same), 0-1 (different), 1-1 (same). The code would process i=0 (subtract 1), i=1 (no), i=2 (subtract 3). Total subtracted is 1+3 =4. Initial ans is 4*5/2 =10. Final ans is 10-4=6. The valid substrings are: \n\nAll single characters (4) \u2192 valid. Length 2: \"00\" (invalid), \"01\" (valid), \"11\" (invalid). Length 3: \"001\" (valid?), \"011\" (valid?), \"0011\" (invalid?). Wait, let's see: \n\nThe substring \"00\" is invalid. \"01\" is valid. \"11\" is invalid. Length 3 substrings: \n\n\"001\" \u2192 can be reduced. \"011\" \u2192 can it be reduced? \"011\" \u2192 first two are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace to 1 \u2192 \"11\" \u2192 can't reduce further. So no. Wait, so \"011\" can't be reduced. Hmm, so the substring \"011\" is invalid. The entire string \"0011\" can't be reduced. So the valid substrings are: Length 1:4 \n\nLength 2: \"01\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 3: \"001\" \u2192 can it be reduced? Yes. \"001\" \u2192 replace the first two 0s? No, they are same. Wait, the substring \"001\" is 0,0,1. The first two are 0 and 0 \u2192 can't do anything. Wait, so the substring \"001\" can't be reduced. Wait, this is conflicting with earlier analysis. Wait, the substring \"001\" has two 0s followed by a 1. The possible operations: \n\nThe first two are 0 and 0 \u2192 can't.",

So \"011\" can't be reduced. So the valid substrings of length 3 are \"001\" (valid) and \"011\" (invalid). So total valid substrings: \n\nLength 1:4 \n\nLength 2: \"01\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 3: \"001\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 4: \"0011\" \u2192 invalid. Total valid: 4+1+1 =6 \u2192 which matches the code's result of 6. So the code's approach works. Thus, the condition is that a substring is invalid if it contains a run of two or more identical characters. Wait, but how does the code's subtraction of (i+1) for each pair of consecutive same characters account for this? The idea is that for each position i where s[i] == s[i+1], the number of invalid substrings ending at i+1 is (i+1). For example, in the case of \"000\": \n\nAt i=0 (the first pair of 0s), the invalid substrings are the substrings ending at position 1 (i+1=1) with length 2 (the first two 0s), and also longer substrings that include this pair. Wait, perhaps the number of invalid substrings caused by a pair at position i is (i+1).",

Wait, perhaps the number of invalid substrings is the sum over all i where s[i] == s[i+1] of (i+1). Let me see for the example \"000\": \n\nThe pairs are at i=0 and i=1. Sum is 1 (for i=0) + 2 (for i=1) = 3. \n\nWhich matches the number of invalid substrings (the substrings of length 2 and 3). The invalid substrings are: [0,1], [1,2], [0,2]. \n\nTotal 3. Another example: \"001\". The pair is at i=0. Sum is 1. The invalid substrings are [0,1]. Which is correct. Another example: \"0011\". The pairs are at i=0 and i=2. Sum is 1 (i=0) + 3 (i=2) \u2192 total 4. The invalid substrings are: [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [2,3], [1,2], [2,3], [0,3]. Wait, no.

Wait, what's the code's calculation for \"0011\": \n\nThe pairs are at i=0 (0 and 0) and i=2 (1 and 1). The sum is 1 (i=0) + 3 (i=2) \u2192 total 4. But the actual number of invalid substrings is 5. So the code's approach is incorrect? Wait, what's the correct answer for \"0011\"? The valid substrings are those that can be reduced to a single character. The invalid substrings are those that cannot. The valid substrings are: \n\nAll single characters (4). Length 2: \"01\" (valid). Length 3: \"001\" (valid?), \"011\" (invalid?), \"0011\" (invalid). Wait, let's reevaluate each substring: \n\nSubstrings of length 2: \n\n\"00\" \u2192 can't be reduced \u2192 invalid. \"01\" \u2192 can be reduced \u2192 valid. \"11\" \u2192 can't be reduced \u2192 invalid.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the number of substrings of a given binary string S that are \"paranoid\". A paranoid string T of length m can be reduced to a single character by performing m-1 operations. The operations are replacing \"01\" with \"1\" or \"10\" with \"0\". \n\nHmm, so the key is to determine for each possible substring whether it's paranoid. The code provided starts with ans = n*(n+1)/2, which is the total number of possible substrings (since each substring is determined by its start and end). Then, it subtracts some values when certain conditions are met in the loop. So the idea is to subtract the number of non-paranoid substrings from the total.\n\nWait, the code's loop is going through each i from 0 to n-2 (since it's while i < n-1). For each i, if some condition is true, it subtracts (i+1) from ans. Wait, the code says ans = ans - i -1. Wait, the line is ans=ans - i -1. Wait, maybe the code is trying to subtract the number of invalid substrings starting at some position?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is checking for runs of the same character, or something else. Let me think about what makes a substring not paranoid.\n\nLet me think about the process of reducing the string. Each operation reduces the length by 1. So for a string of length m, after m-1 operations, it becomes length 1. The operations can be done in any order. \n\nWhat's the condition for a string to be paranoid? Let's see examples. \n\nThe third sample note says that the substring \"101\" is paranoid. Let's see: the entire string is 101. Let's see possible steps. Maybe first replace the \"10\" (positions 2-3) with 0, resulting in \"10\", then replace that with 0. Alternatively, first replace the \"01\" (positions 1-2) with 1, resulting in \"11\", but then you can't do anything else. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the operations.\n\nWait, the operations are on any substring that is exactly \"01\" or \"10\". So in \"101\", the first two characters are \"10\", so replacing that with 0 gives \"01\", then replace that with 1. So that works. Alternatively, the last two characters \"01\" can be replaced first, leading to \"11\", but then you can't do anything. Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, in that case, the process would not be able to reduce to a single character. Wait, but the note says that the entire string in the third sample (which is \"101\") is paranoid. Wait, the note says that the substring [S_1S_2S_3] (the entire string) is not paranoid? Wait, the note says: \"all substrings except [S2S3] and the entire string are paranoid\". Wait, the third sample's note says that the entire string is not paranoid. So in that case, the example must have a string like \"010\" or something else?\n\nWait, the third sample's note says that the entire string (the third sample's S is \"010\" perhaps?), but the problem says that the entire string can't be reduced. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the third sample's note says that the entire string is not paranoid. So for \"010\", let's see:\n\nThe string is 0 1 0. Let's see possible steps. Let's see:\n\nFirst, possible operations:\n\nLooking for \"01\" or \"10\".\n\nThe first two characters are \"01\", so replace with 1. The string becomes \"10\". Then replace that with 0. So that works. So the entire string can be reduced. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the note. Wait the note says \"the entire string\" is not paranoid. So perhaps the example given in the third sample is different. Maybe the third sample's S is \"000\"? Then the substring [2-3] is \"00\", which can't be reduced. So that's the non-paranoid substring. The entire string can be reduced? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the paranoid string must have an odd number of transitions between 0 and 1? Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the paranoid string must have an even number of transitions? Let me think of the process. Let's think of the process as merging adjacent 0 and 1 pairs. Each operation reduces the length by 1, so after m-1 steps, you get to 1. The key is that the process must be possible regardless of the order of operations. Wait, but the problem allows any order of operations. So the string must be such that no matter how you perform the operations, you can eventually reach a single character. Or perhaps there exists some sequence of operations that can do so.\n\nWait, the problem says \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the operations m-1 times in any order\". Wait, no, the problem says \"in any order\". Wait, no, the problem says \"in any order\" \u2014 no, the problem says \"in any order\" \u2014 wait, the problem says \"performing the following two kinds of operations m-1 times in any order\". Wait, no, the wording is: \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the following two kinds of operations m-1 times in any order\". Wait, no, the wording is ambiguous. Wait, the problem says \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the following two kinds of operations m-1 times in any order\". Wait, perhaps it's that the operations can be done in any order, but the total number of operations must be exactly m-1. So the process must be possible regardless of the order chosen? Or that there exists some order of operations that allows it?\n\nAh, the wording is ambiguous here. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the following two kinds of operations m-1 times in any order\". Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. The key is that the operations can be done in any order, but the total steps must be m-1. Wait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that there exists a sequence of m-1 operations (each being either replacing a 01 with 1 or 10 with 0) that reduces the string to length 1. Because otherwise, if it had to work for any order, that would be very restrictive.\n\nThe example given in the first note: S is of length 1, so it's paranoid. The second sample says all substrings are paranoid. Let's see for a string like \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", etc. Let's see for \"00\": the length is 2. To reduce to 1, you need one operation. But the only possible substring is \"00\", which can't be reduced because there's no 01 or 10. So that would not be paranoid. But according to the second sample's note, all substrings are paranoid. Wait, the second sample must be when the string is of length 1? Or perhaps the second sample's S is \"0\" or \"1\", but then the substrings are just themselves. Hmm, maybe the second sample's S is \"01\", so all substrings (the two single characters and the whole string) are paranoid. The whole string can be reduced by replacing 01 with 1, so that's okay. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the string must have an alternating pattern of 0 and 1, but with some conditions. Let me think of the process. Let's think of the string as a sequence of 0s and 1s. Each operation reduces the string by merging adjacent 0 and 1 pairs. The process can be thought of as repeatedly removing adjacent 0 and 1 pairs, but in any order. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paranoid string must have the property that the number of transitions between 0 and 1 is even? Or something like that. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the example given in the third note: the substring S2S3 is \"01\" (assuming the original string is \"101\"). Wait, the note says that the substring [S2S3] (which would be \"01\") is not paranoid? But \"01\" can be reduced in one step to \"1\", so it should be paranoid. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me read the note again.\n\nThe third sample's note says: \"all substrings of S are paranoid except [S_2S_3], because we can't perform any operations on it, and [S_1S_2S_3] (the entire string)\". Wait, so the substring S2S3 is \"01\", but the note says that you can't perform any operations on it. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the actual string in the third sample is different. Let me think again. Maybe the third sample's S is \"010\". Then the substring S2S3 is \"10\", which can be replaced with 0. So that's okay. Hmm, perhaps the example is \"000\". Then the substring S2S3 is \"00\", which can't be reduced. So that's a non-paranoid substring. The entire string \"000\" can't be reduced either, so that's also non-paranoid. \n\nSo the problem is to find all substrings that can be reduced to a single character through some sequence of operations. \n\nLet me think of the necessary and sufficient condition for a substring to be paranoid. \n\nSuppose the substring has length m. To reduce it to 1 character, you need m-1 operations. Each operation reduces the length by 1. \n\nThe key is that the string must be able to be reduced step by step. Let me think of the process as follows: each operation removes a pair of adjacent 0 and 1. The order in which you do this might matter, but the problem requires that there exists some way to do it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must have an even number of transitions between 0 and 1? Or maybe the number of transitions must be exactly 1 less than the length? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paranoid string must have the property that all the 0s and 1s alternate, except for possibly a single pair? Wait, maybe the key is that the string must have an odd number of transitions between 0 and 1. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the string is \"010\". The transitions are between 0 and 1, then 1 and 0. So two transitions. Let's see if it can be reduced. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0. \n\nPossible first step: replace the first two (01) with 1 \u2192 \"10\", then replace that with 0. So that works. So the entire string is paranoid. But according to the note in the third sample, the entire string is not paranoid. Wait, maybe the third sample's example is different. Let me think again. \n\nWait the note says that in the third sample, the entire string is not paranoid. So perhaps the third sample's string is \"0101\", which has three transitions. Let's see:\n\n0 1 0 1. Let's see:\n\nPossible steps: replace the first 01 \u2192 1, resulting in 1 0 1. Then replace the first two (10 \u2192 0), resulting in 0 1. Then replace that to 0. So that works. Hmm, so maybe the note's example is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the string must have an odd length? Or even?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paranoid string must have the first and last characters the same. Let me see:\n\nTake the example of \"010\". The first and last are 0 and 0. So same. It can be reduced. \n\nAnother example: \"01\" can be reduced. \"10\" can be reduced. \"0\" is okay. \n\nWhat about \"001\"? Let's see:\n\nThe string is 0 0 1. The possible steps: first, the last two (01) can be replaced with 1 \u2192 0 1 \u2192 then replaced to 1. So yes, paranoid. \n\nAnother example: \"000\". The entire string can't be reduced. So it's not paranoid. \n\nSo the problem is to find all substrings that are not all 0s or all 1s? No, because \"001\" is okay. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the substring must have at least one 0 and one 1, but that's not sufficient. Because \"000\" has only 0s, so it's not paranoid, but \"001\" has both and is okay. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after m-1 operations, you end up with a single character. Let me think of the process as merging adjacent 0 and 1 pairs. Each operation removes a 0 and 1 pair. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of transitions between 0 and 1 must be odd. Let me see:\n\nThe number of transitions is the number of times the character changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. For example, \"010\" has two transitions (0\u21921, then 1\u21920). \n\nWait, transitions count between consecutive characters. So for a string of length m, there are m-1 possible transitions. \n\nSuppose the number of transitions is t. Then, each operation reduces the number of transitions by 1 or 2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the number of transitions must be such that after m-1 steps, you end up with one character. \n\nWait, let's think of the process as follows: each operation reduces the length by 1, so after m-1 steps, you have 1 character. \n\nBut how does the number of transitions affect this? \n\nLet me think of the transitions. Let's consider the transitions between 0 and 1. \n\nSuppose the string is \"0101\". The transitions are 0\u21921, 1\u21920, 0\u21921. So three transitions. \n\nEach operation can remove a pair of adjacent 0 and 1. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we process the first \"01\" \u2192 becomes \"001\". Then the transitions are between 0 and 0 (no), then 0 and 1. So transitions reduced by 1. \n\nAlternatively, processing the middle \"10\" first: \"0101\" \u2192 \"001\" (if replacing the 10 in the middle?), but maybe I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of transitions must be odd. Let me see:\n\nTake \"01\" \u2192 transitions 1 (odd). It can be reduced. \n\n\"010\" \u2192 transitions 2 (even). Wait, but earlier example shows that it can be reduced. Hmm, so that idea is wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe the key is that the first and last characters must be the same. Let's see:\n\nIn \"010\", first and last are 0, so same. It can be reduced. \n\nIn \"01\", first and last are different. It can be reduced. \n\nIn \"001\", first is 0, last is 1 \u2192 different. It can be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that's not the condition. \n\nAnother idea: the string must have an odd length? No, \"01\" is length 2 (even) and is okay. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the string can be reduced to a single character regardless of the order of operations. Wait, but the problem says \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the operations in any order\". Wait, the wording says \"in any order\", which would mean that no matter the order of operations, you can reach the single character. That would be a very strict condition. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"we can obtain a string of length 1 by performing the following two kinds of operations m-1 times in any order\". \n\nWait, perhaps the wording is ambiguous. Maybe it means that there exists an order of operations (not any order) that allows you to reach the single character. Because otherwise, the problem would be very hard. \n\nAssuming that it's the existence of some sequence of operations, then the problem is to find all substrings that can be reduced to a single character through some sequence of operations. \n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the process as follows: each operation removes a pair of adjacent 0 and 1. The order in which you do this can affect the result. \n\nWait, but the end result must be a single character. Let me think of the final character. \n\nSuppose the string starts with a 0 and ends with a 0. Then, perhaps the final character must be 0. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake \"010\". The first and last are 0. Let's see possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Replace the first \"01\" \u2192 \"0\" followed by \"0\" \u2192 \"00\". Then replace the \"00\" can't be done. Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, but \"00\" can't be reduced. So that path is invalid. \n\nWait, but there must be another path. \n\nAlternative path: replace the \"10\" in the middle (positions 2-3). So \"0\" followed by \"0\". Then the string is \"00\", which can't be reduced. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, but the note says that in the third sample, the substring \"010\" (the entire string) is not paranoid. So that's the case. \n\nWait, so in this case, the entire string \"010\" can't be reduced to a single character. Because whichever operation you choose first, you end up with a string that can't be reduced further. \n\nWait, let me try again. \n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0. \n\nFirst, replace the first two (01 \u2192 1). The string becomes \"10\". Then replace that with 0. So that works. \n\nAh, right! So the first step is replacing the first two, leading to \"10\", then replacing that gives 0. So that works. \n\nSo the entire string \"010\" is paranoid. But according to the note in the third sample, it's not. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the note. \n\nWait the note says: \"the entire string (the third sample) is not paranoid\". So perhaps the third sample's string is different. Let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose the string is \"0101\". Let's see:\n\nPossible steps: replace the first 01 \u2192 1, resulting in \"101\". Then replace the first two (10 \u2192 0), resulting in \"01\", then replace to 0. So that works. \n\nHmm, so maybe the third sample's example is \"000\". Let's see:\n\nThe entire string is \"000\". The only possible substrings are of length 1 (paranoid), 2 (non-paranoid), and 3 (non-paranoid). So the total valid substrings would be 3 (each single character). \n\nSo the problem is to find all substrings that can be reduced to a single character. \n\nNow, how to find such substrings efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the necessary and sufficient condition for a substring to be paranoid. \n\nSuppose the substring has length m. To be paranoid, it must be possible to reduce it to a single character. \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: each operation removes a pair of 0 and 1. The key is that the entire string can be \"collapsed\" down to one character. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the number of 0s and 1s must differ by exactly 1? \n\nWait, for example, \"01\" has one 0 and one 1 \u2192 difference 0. But it can be reduced. \n\nHmm, that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between the number of 0s and 1s must be 1? \n\nWait, \"010\" has two 0s and one 1 \u2192 difference 1. It can be reduced. \n\n\"001\" has two 0s and one 1 \u2192 difference 1. Can be reduced. \n\n\"000\" has three 0s and zero 1s \u2192 difference 3. Can't be reduced. \n\n\"01\" has equal counts \u2192 difference 0. Can be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that idea is not correct. \n\nAnother approach: Let's model the process as a sequence of operations. Each operation reduces the string by one character. The final character depends on the sequence of operations. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that there exists a way to reach a single character. So the question is whether the string can be reduced to a single character through some sequence of operations. \n\nLet me think of the parity of the number of transitions between 0 and 1. \n\nThe transitions are the points where the character changes. For example, \"010\" has two transitions (0\u21921 and 1\u21920). \n\nSuppose the number of transitions is t. \n\nEach operation can reduce the number of transitions by 1 or 2? \n\nWait, when you replace a \"01\" with \"1\", the transition between them is removed. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"0 1 0\". The transitions are between 0 and 1 (position 1-2), and 1 and 0 (position 2-3). \n\nReplacing the first \"01\" (positions 1-2) with \"1\" gives \"1 0\". The transitions between them is still there (1 and 0). So the number of transitions remains 1 (from 2 to 1). \n\nAlternatively, replacing the \"10\" (positions 2-3) with \"0\" gives \"0 0\", which has no transitions. So transitions go from 2 to 0. \n\nHmm, so the number of transitions can decrease by 1 or 2, depending on where you perform the operation. \n\nThe key is that the process must eventually reach a single character. \n\nLet me think of the final character. Suppose the string starts with a 0 and ends with a 0. Then, perhaps the final character must be 0. \n\nWait, let's see \"010\" \u2192 can be reduced to 0. \n\nAnother example: \"0101\" \u2192 starts with 0 and ends with 1. So the final character could be 0 or 1, depending on the path. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that it can be reduced to a single character, regardless of the path? Or just that there exists a path. \n\nAssuming that there exists a path, then the final character can be either 0 or 1, but the key is that the process can be completed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the number of transitions between 0 and 1 is odd. \n\nLet me see:\n\nTake \"01\" \u2192 transitions 1 (odd). Can be reduced. \n\n\"010\" \u2192 transitions 2 (even). But it can be reduced. So that idea is wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the entire process as merging adjacent 0 and 1 pairs. The final character depends on the parity of the number of transitions. \n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the first and last characters. \n\nSuppose the string starts with a 0 and ends with a 0. Then, the final character must be 0. \n\nSimilarly, if it starts with 0 and ends with 1, then the final character can be either, but the process must allow it. \n\nWait, let's think of the example \"010\". \n\nStarts with 0, ends with 0. The final character is 0. \n\nAnother example: \"01\" starts with 0 and ends with 1. The final character can be 1 (if you replace 01 with 1) or 0 (if you replace 10 with 0? Wait, but \"01\" can only be replaced with 1. \n\nWait, \"01\" can only be replaced with 1. So the final character is 1. \n\nAnother example: \"10\" can be replaced with 0. \n\nSo the final character is the first character if the number of transitions is even? Or something else. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the first and last characters must be the same. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\n\"010\" starts and ends with 0 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"01\" starts with 0 and ends with 1 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"001\" starts with 0 and ends with 1 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"000\" starts and ends with 0 \u2192 but can't be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that's not the condition. \n\nHmm, maybe the key is that the number of transitions between 0 and 1 must be odd. \n\nWait, \"01\" has 1 transition (odd) \u2192 okay. \n\n\"010\" has 2 transitions (even) \u2192 but can be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that's not it. \n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the process as follows. Each operation removes a pair of 0 and 1. The process can be viewed as repeatedly removing such pairs until only one character remains. \n\nThe key is that the entire string must have an equal number of 0s and 1s, or differ by one? \n\nWait, \"01\" has equal counts \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"010\" has two 0s and one 1 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"001\" has two 0s and one 1 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"000\" has three 0s \u2192 difference 3 \u2192 can't be reduced. \n\n\"0101\" has two 0s and two 1s \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 can be reduced. \n\nSo the difference between the counts of 0 and 1 must be exactly 1 or 0? \n\nWait, \"01\" has difference 0 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"010\" has difference 1 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"001\" has difference 1 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"0101\" has difference 0 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"000\" has difference 3 \u2192 not okay. \n\nSo the condition is that the absolute difference between the number of 0s and 1s is at most 1? \n\nWait, but \"0101\" has difference 0 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"0000\" has difference 4 \u2192 not okay. \n\nSo the condition is that the absolute difference between the number of 0s and 1s is exactly 1 or 0. \n\nWait, but \"01\" has difference 0 \u2192 okay. \n\n\"0\" has difference 1 (since it's one 0 and zero 1s \u2192 difference 1). \n\nWait, the problem says that a single character is paranoid. So yes, that's allowed. \n\nSo the condition is that the absolute difference between the number of 0s and 1s in the substring is at most 1. \n\nWait, but let's test this hypothesis. \n\nTake the substring \"001\" \u2192 counts are 2 0s and 1 1 \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"000\" \u2192 difference 3 \u2192 not allowed. \n\n\"010\" \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"0101\" \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"01\" \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"0\" \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 allowed. \n\n\"1\" \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 allowed. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about a substring like \"01010\" (three 0s and two 1s \u2192 difference 1). It should be allowed. \n\nYes, because you can reduce it step by step. \n\nAnother example: \"0110\". Counts are two 0s and two 1s \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 allowed. \n\nYes, can be reduced. \n\nSo the condition is that the absolute difference between the number of 0s and 1s in the substring is at most 1. \n\nWait, but what about a substring like \"0011\"? \n\nCounts are two 0s and two 1s \u2192 difference 0. \n\nCan it be reduced? Let's see:\n\nThe string is 0011. \n\nPossible steps: \n\nFirst, replace the \"01\" in positions 2-3 \u2192 becomes 0 1 1 \u2192 then replace the first two 0 and 1 (positions 1-2?) Wait, no, the first two are 0 and 0. \n\nWait, the string is \"0011\". \n\nPossible operations: \n\nLooking for \"01\" or \"10\". \n\nThe substring \"01\" is between positions 2 and 3 (0 and 1). \n\nReplacing that with 1 gives \"0 1 1\" \u2192 then the string is \"011\". \n\nNow, the first two characters are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace with 1 \u2192 \"11\". Then can't do anything. So that path doesn't work. \n\nHmm, so this is a problem. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another path. \n\nOriginal string: 0011. \n\nFirst, replace the \"10\" between positions 3 and 4? No, the third character is 1 and fourth is 1 \u2192 no. \n\nAlternatively, replace the first \"01\" (positions 2-3) \u2192 gives 0 1 1 \u2192 then replace the first two 0 and 0 \u2192 no. \n\nWait, no, the first two are 0 and 0 \u2192 can't do anything. \n\nHmm, so the string \"0011\" can't be reduced to a single character. \n\nBut according to the condition (difference 0), it should be allowed. \n\nSo my hypothesis is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here? \n\nThe string \"0011\" has two 0s and two 1s. \n\nLet me try another path. \n\nOriginal string: 0011. \n\nFirst, replace the \"01\" between positions 2 and 3 \u2192 gives 0 1 1 \u2192 then replace the first two 0 and 0 \u2192 can't. \n\nAlternatively, replace the \"10\" between positions 3 and 4? No, they are both 1. \n\nHmm, so no way to proceed. \n\nSo the string \"0011\" cannot be reduced to a single character, even though the difference between 0s and 1s is zero. \n\nSo my previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nLet me think of the example \"0011\". \n\nThe transitions between characters are: between 0 and 0 (no), 0 and 1 (yes), 1 and 1 (no). So there is one transition. \n\nHmm, so the number of transitions is 1. \n\nAnother example: \"0101\" has three transitions. \n\nHmm, perhaps the number of transitions must be odd? \n\nIn \"0011\", transitions are 1 (odd). But it can't be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that's not it. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the transitions must form a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must be such that it can be reduced to a single character by merging adjacent 0 and 1 pairs in some order. \n\nLet me think of the \"0011\" case again. \n\nThe string is 0 0 1 1. \n\nPossible operations: \n\nThe only possible operation is on the \"01\" between positions 2 and 3. \n\nReplacing that with 1 gives 0 1 1 \u2192 then the only possible operation is on the first two characters (0 and 1?), but they are 0 and 1? Wait, the first two are 0 and 0. \n\nWait, after replacing the middle \"01\" with 1, the string becomes \"0 1 1\". \n\nNow, the first two characters are 0 and 1 \u2192 can replace them with 1. \n\nSo the string becomes \"1 1\". Then no more operations. \n\nSo that path doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, after the first step to \"0 1 1\", the next step could be to replace the \"11\" \u2192 no, they are same. \n\nHmm, so that path doesn't work. \n\nAnother path: \n\nOriginal string: 0011. \n\nFirst, replace the \"01\" between positions 2 and 3 \u2192 gives 0 1 1 \u2192 then replace the first two (0 and 1) \u2192 gives 1 followed by 1 \u2192 \"11\". Can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, is there another way? \n\nWait, the first step could be to replace the \"01\" between positions 1 and 2? No, because they are both 0. \n\nHmm, so no. \n\nSo the string \"0011\" can't be reduced to a single character. \n\nSo the condition must be something else. \n\nHmm, perhaps the string must be such that the first and last characters are the same, and the number of transitions is odd? \n\nIn \"0011\", first and last are 0 and 1 \u2192 different. \n\nIn \"010\", first and last are same (0), transitions are 2 (even). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must have an odd number of transitions between 0 and 1. \n\nIn \"0011\", transitions are 1 (odd). But it can't be reduced. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Let's model the process as a stack. Each time you can merge adjacent 0 and 1 pairs. \n\nWait, but the order of merging can affect the result. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be reduced to a single character if and only if the first and last characters are the same. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn \"0011\", first is 0, last is 1 \u2192 different \u2192 can't be reduced. \n\nIn \"010\", first and last are same \u2192 can be reduced. \n\nIn \"01\", first and last are different \u2192 can be reduced. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the examples given in the problem. \n\nThe first sample: S is length 1 \u2192 all substrings (only one) are paranoid. \n\nSecond sample: all substrings are paranoid. So the string must be such that every substring meets the condition. \n\nSuppose the second sample's string is \"01\". Then all substrings are \"0\", \"1\", and \"01\". All are paranoid. \n\nAnother example: \"010\" \u2192 all substrings except maybe some? \n\nWait the third sample's note says that the substring S2S3 (which is \"10\") is paranoid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the substring is not composed of all 0s or all 1s, except when the length is 1. \n\nWait, but \"001\" has both 0 and 1 and is paranoid. \n\nBut \"000\" is all 0s and length 3 \u2192 not paranoid. \n\nSo the condition is that the substring is either of length 1, or has at least one 0 and one 1, and the number of transitions between 0 and 1 is odd? \n\nWait, let's see \"001\" has transitions between 0 and 1 (one transition). \n\nThe transitions count is 1 (odd). \n\n\"010\" has two transitions (even). \n\nHmm, but \"010\" can be reduced. \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should think of the problem differently. \n\nThe process of merging 01 or 10 pairs can be viewed as follows: \n\nEach operation reduces the string by one character. The final character depends on the sequence of operations. \n\nBut the key is that there exists a way to reduce it to a single character. \n\nLet me think of the entire string as a sequence of runs of 0s and 1s. \n\nFor example, the string \"001011\" can be broken into runs: 00, 1, 0, 11. \n\nThe number of runs is 4. \n\nThe number of transitions between 0 and 1 is 3 (between each pair of runs). \n\nNow, the key observation might be that the number of runs must be odd. \n\nBecause each operation can merge two adjacent runs of opposite types. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach operation reduces the number of runs by 1. \n\nWait, for example, merging a 0 and 1 pair (like in a run of 0 followed by a run of 1) would merge them into a single run of whichever character you replace them with. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of runs must be odd. \n\nLet me see:\n\nExample 1: \"0\" \u2192 1 run (odd) \u2192 paranoid. \n\nExample 2: \"01\" \u2192 two runs (even). But it can be reduced. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm, so that idea is wrong. \n\nAnother example: \"010\" has three runs (0,1,0 \u2192 three runs, odd). Can be reduced. \n\n\"0011\" has two runs (00 and 11 \u2192 two runs, even). Can't be reduced. \n\n\"0101\" has four runs (0,1,0,1 \u2192 even). Can it be reduced? \n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0 1. \n\nPossible steps: \n\nReplace first two (01 \u2192 1) \u2192 \"1 0 1\". \n\nThen replace first two (10 \u2192 0) \u2192 \"0 1\". \n\nThen replace to 0. \n\nSo yes, it can be reduced. But the number of runs was even (4). \n\nHmm, so that idea is also wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the number of runs must be odd or even? \n\nWait, in the case of \"0101\" (4 runs), it can be reduced. \n\nHmm, this is getting me nowhere. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the code provided. \n\nThe code starts with ans = n*(n+1)/2, which is the total number of substrings. Then, it loops through each i from 0 to n-2, and if some condition is met, subtracts (i+1) from ans. \n\nThe code's logic is to subtract the number of invalid substrings. \n\nThe condition in the loop is probably checking for runs of the same character. \n\nThe code's loop is: \n\nwhile(i < n-1) { \n\n   if (condition) { \n\n      ans -= i+1; \n\n   } \n\n   i +=1; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the loop is written as a while loop, incrementing i by 1 each time. \n\nThe condition is probably checking for a pair of consecutive same characters. \n\nBecause the invalid substrings are those that have two consecutive same characters, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, let's think of the example where the string is \"000\". \n\nThe total substrings are 6. The valid substrings are the single characters (3), so the answer is 3. \n\nThe code's initial ans is 6. \n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to 2 (since n is 3). \n\nAt i=0: check if s[0] == s[1]. Yes (both 0). So subtract 0+1 =1 \u2192 ans becomes 5. \n\nAt i=1: check s[1] and s[2] (both 0). Subtract 1+1=2 \u2192 ans becomes 3. \n\nAt i=2: the loop condition is i < n-1 \u2192 2 < 2 \u2192 false. So loop ends. \n\nThe final ans is 3, which is correct. \n\nSo the condition is checking whether s[i] == s[i+1]. \n\nWait, in this case, whenever two consecutive characters are the same, it subtracts (i+1). \n\nBut how does this relate to the problem's condition? \n\nLet me see what this code is doing. \n\nThe code's approach is to subtract the number of invalid substrings. \n\nThe condition is when s[i] == s[i+1]. \n\nThe code subtracts (i+1) each time this happens. \n\nWait, let's see for the example \"000\": \n\nThe pairs of consecutive same characters are at positions 0-1 and 1-2. \n\nFor each such pair, the code subtracts (i+1). \n\nAt i=0: subtract 1 \u2192 ans becomes 6-1=5. \n\nAt i=1: subtract 2 \u2192 5-2=3. \n\nThe total subtracted is 3, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \"01\". \n\nThe total substrings are 3. \n\nThe code's initial ans is 3. \n\nThe loop runs for i=0 (since n-1 is 1). \n\nCheck s[0] and s[1] are different \u2192 condition is false. So no subtraction. \n\nThus, the answer is 3, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \"001\". \n\nThe string is 0,0,1. \n\nThe consecutive pairs are 0-0 (same) and 0-1 (different). \n\nThe loop runs for i=0 and 1. \n\nAt i=0: subtract 1 \u2192 ans = 6-1=5. \n\nAt i=1: s[1] and s[2] are different \u2192 no subtraction. \n\nTotal ans is 5. \n\nThe valid substrings are all except the substrings of length 2 (the first two 0s) and the entire string? \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe substrings are: \n\nlength 1: all 3 \u2192 valid. \n\nlength 2: \"00\" (invalid), \"01\" (valid). \n\nlength 3: \"001\" \u2192 can it be reduced? \n\nYes. \n\nSo the valid substrings are 3 (length 1) + 1 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) \u2192 total 5. Which matches the code's result. \n\nSo the code's approach is correct. \n\nSo the condition is when two consecutive characters are the same. \n\nThe code subtracts (i+1) for each such occurrence. \n\nWait, but why does this work? \n\nThe idea is that any substring that contains a run of two identical characters (like \"00\" or \"11\") is invalid? \n\nNo, because in the example \"001\", the substring \"001\" is valid. \n\nAh, but the code's approach is to subtract the number of invalid substrings. \n\nThe code's logic is that whenever there are two consecutive same characters, the number of invalid substrings increases. \n\nThe key insight is that a substring is invalid (not paranoid) if it has a run of two or more identical characters. \n\nWait, but that's not true. For example, \"001\" has a run of two 0s, but the entire substring is valid. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nThe code's approach seems to work for the examples. Let me think of the logic. \n\nThe code starts with all substrings as valid. Then, for every position i where s[i] == s[i+1], it subtracts (i+1). \n\nThe total number of invalid substrings is the sum over all i where s[i] == s[i+1] of (i+1). \n\nWait, why? \n\nPerhaps the invalid substrings are those that have a run of two or more identical characters. \n\nBut how does the subtraction work? \n\nLet me think of the example \"000\". \n\nThe invalid substrings are those with length >=2. \n\nThe total invalid substrings are 3 (the two 0s) + 1 (the three 0s) \u2192 total 3. \n\nThe code subtracts 1 (for i=0) and 2 (for i=1) \u2192 total 3, which matches. \n\nAnother example: \"001\". \n\nThe invalid substrings are the first two 0s (substring [0,1]). \n\nThe code subtracts 1 (for i=0) \u2192 total subtracted 1. \n\nThe total invalid substrings are 1 (the substring \"00\"). \n\nThe code's approach is correct here. \n\nAnother example: \"010\". \n\nThe consecutive pairs are 0-1 (different), 1-0 (different). So no subtraction. \n\nThus, the answer is 6 (3*4/2 = 6). \n\nBut according to earlier analysis, the entire string \"010\" is valid. \n\nYes, so the code would return 6, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \"0011\". \n\nThe consecutive pairs are 0-0 (same), 0-1 (different), 1-1 (same). \n\nThe code would process i=0 (subtract 1), i=1 (no), i=2 (subtract 3). \n\nTotal subtracted is 1+3 =4. \n\nInitial ans is 4*5/2 =10. \n\nFinal ans is 10-4=6. \n\nThe valid substrings are: \n\nAll single characters (4) \u2192 valid. \n\nLength 2: \"00\" (invalid), \"01\" (valid), \"11\" (invalid). \n\nLength 3: \"001\" (valid?), \"011\" (valid?), \"0011\" (invalid?). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe substring \"00\" is invalid. \n\n\"01\" is valid. \n\n\"11\" is invalid. \n\nLength 3 substrings: \n\n\"001\" \u2192 can be reduced. \n\n\"011\" \u2192 can it be reduced? \n\n\"011\" \u2192 first two are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace to 1 \u2192 \"11\" \u2192 can't reduce further. So no. \n\nWait, so \"011\" can't be reduced. \n\nHmm, so the substring \"011\" is invalid. \n\nThe entire string \"0011\" can't be reduced. \n\nSo the valid substrings are: \n\nLength 1:4 \n\nLength 2: \"01\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 3: \"001\" \u2192 can it be reduced? \n\nYes. \n\n\"001\" \u2192 replace the first two 0s? No, they are same. \n\nWait, the substring \"001\" is 0,0,1. \n\nThe first two are 0 and 0 \u2192 can't do anything. \n\nWait, so the substring \"001\" can't be reduced. \n\nWait, this is conflicting with earlier analysis. \n\nWait, the substring \"001\" has two 0s followed by a 1. \n\nThe possible operations: \n\nThe first two are 0 and 0 \u2192 can't. \n\nThe last two are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace with 1 \u2192 resulting in \"01\", which can be replaced to 1. \n\nSo yes, it can be reduced. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n\"001\" \u2192 replace the last two (0 and 1) \u2192 \"01\" \u2192 then replace to 1. \n\nSo it is valid. \n\nSo the valid substrings of length 3 are \"001\" and \"011\" (the second one can't be reduced). \n\nWait, \"011\" is 0,1,1. \n\nPossible steps: \n\nThe first two are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace to 1 \u2192 \"11\" \u2192 can't reduce further. \n\nAlternatively, replace the last two (1 and 1 \u2192 no). \n\nSo \"011\" can't be reduced. \n\nSo the valid substrings of length 3 are \"001\" (valid) and \"011\" (invalid). \n\nSo total valid substrings: \n\nLength 1:4 \n\nLength 2: \"01\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 3: \"001\" \u2192 1 \n\nLength 4: \"0011\" \u2192 invalid. \n\nTotal valid: 4+1+1 =6 \u2192 which matches the code's result of 6. \n\nSo the code's approach works. \n\nThus, the condition is that a substring is invalid if it contains a run of two or more identical characters. \n\nWait, but how does the code's subtraction of (i+1) for each pair of consecutive same characters account for this? \n\nThe idea is that for each position i where s[i] == s[i+1], the number of invalid substrings ending at i+1 is (i+1). \n\nFor example, in the case of \"000\": \n\nAt i=0 (the first pair of 0s), the invalid substrings are the substrings ending at position 1 (i+1=1) with length 2 (the first two 0s), and also longer substrings that include this pair. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of invalid substrings caused by a pair at position i is (i+1). \n\nBecause the pair at position i (between i and i+1) contributes to all substrings that include this pair and start anywhere from 0 to i. \n\nFor example, the pair at i=0 in \"000\" contributes to substrings [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], but wait, no. \n\nWait, the pair at i=0 (positions 0 and 1) is part of the substring [0,1], which is invalid. \n\nAlso, the pair is part of the substring [0,2], which is also invalid. \n\nThe total number of substrings that include this pair and are invalid because of it is (i+1) = 1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is that each pair at position i contributes (i+1) invalid substrings. \n\nIn the case of \"000\": \n\nAt i=0, the pair contributes substrings [0,1], [0,2], [1,2]? \n\nNo, the pair at i=0 is between 0 and 1. \n\nThe substrings that include this pair and are invalid are those that have this pair as part of a run. \n\nAlternatively, the number of invalid substrings caused by a run of length k is k*(k+1)/2. \n\nBut the code's approach is to process each pair and subtract (i+1) for each occurrence. \n\nThis seems to be a standard approach for counting the number of substrings with at least two consecutive same characters. \n\nWait, the total number of substrings with at least one pair of consecutive same characters is equal to the sum over all runs of length l of l*(l+1)/2 minus overlaps. \n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is using inclusion-exclusion. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the formula that the number of valid substrings is total substrings minus the number of invalid substrings. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the number of invalid substrings as the sum for each i where s[i] == s[i+1] of (i+1). \n\nThis seems to be a known formula. \n\nFor example, the number of substrings with at least one pair of consecutive same characters can be computed by considering each such pair and counting the number of substrings that end at that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of invalid substrings is the sum over all i where s[i] == s[i+1] of (i+1). \n\nLet me see for the example \"000\": \n\nThe pairs are at i=0 and i=1. \n\nSum is 1 (for i=0) + 2 (for i=1) = 3. \n\nWhich matches the number of invalid substrings (the substrings of length 2 and 3). \n\nThe invalid substrings are: \n\n[0,1], [1,2], [0,2]. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nAnother example: \"001\". \n\nThe pair is at i=0. \n\nSum is 1. \n\nThe invalid substrings are [0,1]. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: \"0011\". \n\nThe pairs are at i=0 and i=2. \n\nSum is 1 (i=0) + 3 (i=2) \u2192 total 4. \n\nThe invalid substrings are: \n\n[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [2,3], [1,2], [2,3], [0,3]. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the invalid substrings are those that have at least one pair of consecutive same characters. \n\nIn \"0011\", the invalid substrings are: \n\nAll substrings of length 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"11\" \u2192 two invalid (00 and 11). \n\nLength 3: \"001\" (has 00 \u2192 invalid), \"011\" (has 11 \u2192 invalid). \n\nLength 4: \"0011\" (has both pairs \u2192 invalid). \n\nLength 1: all valid. \n\nTotal invalid: \n\n2 (length 2) + 2 (length 3) + 1 (length4) \u2192 total 5. \n\nBut according to the code's approach, the sum is 1+3=4. \n\nHmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait, what's the code's calculation for \"0011\": \n\nThe pairs are at i=0 (0 and 0) and i=2 (1 and 1). \n\nThe sum is 1 (i=0) + 3 (i=2) \u2192 total 4. \n\nBut the actual number of invalid substrings is 5. \n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect? \n\nWait, what's the correct answer for \"0011\"? \n\nThe valid substrings are those that can be reduced to a single character. \n\nThe invalid substrings are those that cannot. \n\nThe valid substrings are: \n\nAll single characters (4). \n\nLength 2: \"01\" (valid). \n\nLength 3: \"001\" (valid?), \"011\" (invalid?), \"0011\" (invalid). \n\nWait, let's reevaluate each substring: \n\nSubstrings of length 2: \n\n\"00\" \u2192 can't be reduced \u2192 invalid. \n\n\"01\" \u2192 can be reduced \u2192 valid. \n\n\"11\" \u2192 can't be reduced \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo two invalid. \n\nLength 3: \n\n\"001\" \u2192 can be reduced. \n\nSteps: replace the last two (0 and 1) \u2192 \"01\" \u2192 then to 1. \n\nSo valid. \n\n\"011\" \u2192 can't be reduced. \n\n\"0011\" \u2192 can't be reduced. \n\nLength 4: can't be reduced \u2192 invalid. \n\nLength 3 substrings: \"001\" is valid, \"011\" and \"0011\" (length 4) are invalid. \n\nSo valid substrings of length 3: 1. \n\nLength 4: invalid. \n\nTotal valid substrings: 4 (length 1) + 1 (length 2) + 1 (length3) \u2192 total 6. \n\nTotal substrings: 10. \n\nThus, invalid substrings are 10-6=4 \u2192 which matches the code's result. \n\nAh, so the code's approach is correct. \n\nThe invalid substrings are those that cannot be reduced. \n\nThe code's approach counts the number of invalid substrings as the sum of (i+1) for each pair of consecutive same characters. \n\nThus, the condition in the code is to check whether s[i] == s[i+1]. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is: \n\nif (s[i] == s[i+1]) \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nif(s[i] == s[i+1]) \n\nThen, the loop will subtract (i+1) whenever two consecutive characters are the same. \n\nThis will correctly compute the number of invalid substrings, and the answer is total substrings minus this sum. \n\nSo the missing code is simply checking if the current character is equal to the next one. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is: \n\ns[i] == s[i+1]"
