Suppose the first test case has n=2, with p_2=1. The l and r for node 1 and 2 are such that after the operation, a1=1 and a2=2. Suppose node 1's l is 1, r is something. Node 2's l is 2, r is something. In the code's DFS, starting at node 1. The children of node 1 is node 2. First, process node 2. Its children are none. So, in the DFS for node 2, the sum f is 0 (since no children). Then, if f < L (assuming L is 2?), then counter increases by 1, and HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to R (say 2).

Wait, in the code's current DFS function, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is set as follows: \n\nAfter summing the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree (f), if f < L, then we add an operation (counter +=1), and set HowMuchWeGetForFree to R. \n\nElse, set it to min(f, R).

So node1's sum is 3, which is less than L (5). So we add an operation here, counter becomes 2. Thus, the code's approach works. Therefore, the code's logic is correct. Wait, but in the code's current setup, the parent's children are stored in the children list. Wait, in the code, for each node, the children are stored in a list. The DFS function processes children first (post-order traversal). Thus, the code's approach is correct. Wait, but in the code, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is initialized as 0 for each node. Wait, the code's Node class has HowMuchWeGetForFree as a field, initialized to 0. Then, during the DFS, for each node, after processing children, the sum f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. Wait, but the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the contribution that can be passed up to its parent. Thus, the code's approach is correct. Hmm, but why does the code's approach work? Let me think through the variables again. The HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node v is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to its parent. The sum f is the sum of all children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. Wait, no, the sum f is the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. Wait, but each child's HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution that the child can pass up to the parent. Wait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node v is the total contribution that can be passed up to the parent.",

Thus, the a_v becomes f + (R - f) = R, which is within [L, R]. If f >= L, then the a_v is f, which is within [L, R] (since f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree, which are all within their constraints). Wait, but how do we ensure that the a_v is at least L? Ah, because when f < L, we add an operation, which brings the a_v to R (which is >= L). Wait, but R could be less than L? No, the problem states that l_v <= r_v. Thus, R is at least L. \n\nSo, when f < L, we set a_v to R (which is >= L and <= R). Thus, the a_v is within the required range. When f >= L, then a_v is f, which must be <= R. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that f <= R? Ah, in the code's else clause, when f >= L, then the HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to min(f, R). Thus, the a_v is min(f, R). Wait, but then the a_v would be min(f, R). Wait, but the a_v must be at least L. \n\nWait, in this case, f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. The children's HowMuchWeGetForFree are set such that their a_v is within their constraints. But the sum f could be greater than R. \n\nWait, for example, suppose a node has children whose HowMuchWeGetForFree sum to f = 10, but the node's R is 5. Then, the code would set HowMuchWeGetForFree to min(10,5) =5. Thus, the a_v is 5 (since no operation is added). But 5 is within [L, R]. Thus, the a_v is 5, which is okay.",

Thus, the missing code is \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\". So the correct line is:\n\nif (!skipWhiteSpaceMode) Therefore, the missing code is \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\".

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a number a_v that must be between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array c of non-negative integers along the path from root (1) to v. Each element in c is added to the corresponding node on that path. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to set all a_v within their [l_v, r_v] ranges.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the operations in a way that allows us to compute the minimal steps. Let's think about how each operation affects the nodes. Each operation on a path from root to v adds a non-decreasing sequence. So, the increments along the path must be non-decreasing. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the sum of all operations' contributions to each node must meet the constraints. The challenge is to find the minimal number of operations to achieve this.\n\nI remember that in some similar problems, a greedy approach is used where you process nodes in a certain order and track the required increments. Maybe here, since the tree is rooted, we can process nodes in a bottom-up manner, or perhaps top-down?\n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first test case, choosing v=2 with c=[1,2] gives a1=1 and a2=2. The constraints must have been l1 <=1 <= r1 and l2 <=2 <=r2. So the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe operation's effect is additive. Each operation contributes to the path from root to v. So, the total a_v is the sum of all c_i's from all operations that include v in their path. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of such operations so that for each node v, the sum of all c_i's along its path (from root to v) in all operations is between l_v and r_v.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a problem where each node's required value must be achieved through a series of non-decreasing increments. \n\nWait, maybe the key is to model the required increments in a way that each operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence. To minimize the number of operations, we need to maximize the \"coverage\" of each operation. \n\nAlternatively, think of each node's required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the increments from each operation. But since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, perhaps the variables can be represented in a way that allows us to model the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v, and the operations are such that each operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the path from the root to each node. The operations can be thought of as adding non-decreasing sequences along these paths. To reach the desired a_v for each node, the sum of all the c_i's along the path to v must be within [l_v, r_v]. \n\nWait, but each operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, for each operation, the c's along the path must be non-decreasing. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the differences between the required a_v and the constraints, but in a way that the increments can be represented as the sum of non-decreasing sequences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a greedy problem where we process nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root) and track the required increments. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's think of each node's required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the minimal number of operations would be determined by the \"gaps\" between nodes along the path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a system of constraints where each node's a_v must be within its [l_v, r_v], and each operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we can model this as a problem where each node's required value must be covered by the sum of some non-decreasing sequences. \n\nWait, maybe the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and find the minimal number of variables (operations) such that each variable's contribution along a path is non-decreasing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v, and the operations can be represented as adding non-decreasing sequences. The minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"jump\" in the required increments along the path from root to each node. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's sample. Let's think of the required a_v for each node. Let's process the nodes in post-order (children first, then parent). For each node, we can determine how much \"free\" contribution it can get from its children's operations, and then decide how much we need to add via an operation starting at this node. \n\nWait, maybe the solution is similar to the problem where you have to cover a path with non-decreasing steps, and the minimal number of steps is determined by the differences between the required values and the maximum possible from previous steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: For each node v, the minimal required a_v is l_v, and the maximum is r_v. Let's process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The contributions from the children's operations can be considered, but since the operations are non-decreasing, the parent's contribution must be at least as much as the child's. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a greedy approach where for each node, we track the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or higher. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the sample solution's code structure. The code currently has a DFS function that tries to compute some HowMuchWeGetForFree variable, but it's not working correctly. Let me look at the code provided.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads the tree structure and the l and r for each node. Then, it does a DFS starting from the root. In the DFS function, for each node, it sums the HowMuchWeGetForFree from children. Then, if this sum is less than the node's L, it increments the counter and sets HowMuchWeGetForFree to R. Otherwise, it sets it to min(f, R). \n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the first test case's solution uses one operation. Let's see what the code would do here. Suppose the first test case has n=2, with p_2=1. The l and r for node 1 and 2 are such that after the operation, a1=1 and a2=2. \n\nSuppose node 1's l is 1, r is something. Node 2's l is 2, r is something. \n\nIn the code's DFS, starting at node 1. The children of node 1 is node 2. \n\nFirst, process node 2. Its children are none. So, in the DFS for node 2, the sum f is 0 (since no children). Then, if f < L (assuming L is 2?), then counter increases by 1, and HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to R (say 2). \n\nThen, returning to node 1, the sum f is the HowMuchWeGetForFree of node 2 (which is 2). Then, if node 1's L is 1, then 2 >=1, so node1's HowMuchWeGetForFree is min(2, R). \n\nThe counter would be 1, which matches the sample. So maybe this approach is correct? But why does this work?\n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to its parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that each node can contribute up to its R, but if the sum from children is less than L, then we have to add an operation here. \n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to its parent without exceeding its own R. \n\nWait, let me think again. The HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the maximum possible value that can be \"passed up\" to the parent, such that the node's own a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nSuppose the node's children contribute a total of f. Then, the node's a_v is f plus whatever is added here. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or higher. \n\nHmm, maybe the approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nEach node v must have a_v >= l_v and <= r_v. \n\nThe HowMuchWeGetForFree for node v is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent (i.e., the minimal required contribution from the parent's side). \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when processing a node, the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree gives the total contribution from below. If that sum is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation here. The HowMuchWeGetForFree for this node is then the minimum between (sum + added contribution) and r_v. \n\nWait, but how does this translate into the code? \n\nLet me think of the code's variables. \n\nThe HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be \"given\" to the parent, such that the node's own a_v is within its constraints. \n\nSuppose the children's contributions sum to f. \n\nThe node's a_v is f plus whatever is added here. \n\nWait, but the added contribution here would be the c_i for this node in some operation. \n\nAlternatively, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given that the node's own a_v must be within [L, R]. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or above. \n\nAlternatively, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be passed up to the parent, considering the constraints. \n\nLet me think of the example again. \n\nIn the first sample, node 2's children are none. So f is 0. \n\nIf node 2's L is 2, then since f (0) < L (2), we need to add an operation here. The HowMuchWeGetForFree for node 2 would be R (assuming R is >= L). \n\nWait, but in the sample, the operation chosen was on node 2 with c = [1,2]. The a_v for node 2 is 2, which is exactly L. So perhaps the code's approach is to set the HowMuchWeGetForFree to R when we have to add an operation. \n\nWait, but in the code's logic, when f < L, then we add an operation (counter +=1), and set HowMuchWeGetForFree to R. \n\nWait, but in the first sample, node 2's R must be at least 2. So setting HowMuchWeGetForFree to R (say 2) would mean that the parent (node1) gets 2 from node2's contribution. \n\nThen, node1's f is 2. If node1's L is 1, then since 2 >=1, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for node1 is min(2, R). \n\nThus, the total counter is 1, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: the second sample. Let's see. \n\nSample 2: \n\nSuppose the tree has nodes 1, 2, 3. \n\np_2 is 1, p_3 is 2. \n\nThe first test case's second example (the second test case?) has two operations. \n\nThe code's approach would process node3 first. \n\nAssuming node3's L is 7 (since in the example, after two operations, a3 is 7). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach works. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nProcessing node3 first (since it's a leaf). \n\nSuppose node3's L is 7. \n\nThe children of node3 are none, so f is 0. \n\n0 <7 \u2192 so we add an operation here (counter increases by 1). \n\nHowMuchWeGetForFree for node3 is set to R (say 7). \n\nThen, moving to node2. \n\nThe children of node2 is node3. \n\nThe sum f is 7 (from node3's HowMuchWeGetForFree). \n\nSuppose node2's L is 3. \n\nThen, since f (7) >= L (3), so HowMuchWeGetForFree for node2 is min(7, R). \n\nSuppose node2's R is 3. Then, the HowMuchWeGetForFree would be 3. \n\nWait, but then node2's a_v would be 7 (from node3's contribution) plus whatever is added here. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variables. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HowMuchWeGetForFree represents the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or above. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given the constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be \"given\" to the parent, such that the node's own a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nLet me think of the node's a_v as the sum of the contributions from its children plus the contribution from this node's own operations. \n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, which is the minimum between (the sum from children plus the added contribution here) and R. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be passed up to the parent, considering the constraints. \n\nThe idea is that when processing a node, the children's contributions (their HowMuchWeGetForFree) sum to f. \n\nThe node's own a_v must be at least L. \n\nThe total contribution from below (children) is f. \n\nIf f < L, then we need to add an operation here. The added contribution here would be (L - f), but since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the added contribution here must be at least the contribution from the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be passed up, which is the minimum between (f + added contribution) and R. \n\nWait, the added contribution here (from the operation on this node) must be such that the total a_v is between L and R. \n\nSuppose we have to add an operation here. The minimal required is to add (L - f). But since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the added contribution here (the c_k for this node) must be at least the c_{k-1} (the contribution from the parent's side). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but maybe there's a mistake in how the parent's contributions are handled. \n\nWait, in the code's current DFS function, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is set as follows: \n\nAfter summing the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree (f), if f < L, then we add an operation (counter +=1), and set HowMuchWeGetForFree to R. \n\nElse, set it to min(f, R). \n\nWait, but why R? \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when we have to add an operation here, the maximum possible contribution to the parent is R. Because the operation's c array can be set such that the contribution to this node is R, but then the parent's contribution can be up to R as well. \n\nWait, but in the first sample, node2's R is at least 2. So setting HowMuchWeGetForFree to R (say 2) allows the parent (node1) to have that contribution. \n\nBut why is the HowMuchWeGetForFree set to R when we add an operation? \n\nMaybe the reasoning is that when we add an operation here, the maximum possible contribution to the parent is R. Because the operation's c array can be set to have the last element (this node) as R, and the previous elements (parent's contribution) can be as high as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given that the node's a_v is within its constraints. \n\nSo, when f (sum from children) is less than L, we have to add an operation here. The minimal required is to add (L - f). But since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to this node (c_k) must be at least the contribution to the parent (c_{k-1}), which is part of the path. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given that the node's a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nThe total a_v for this node is f (sum from children) plus the added contribution from this node's operation. \n\nWait, perhaps the added contribution here is (delta), and the HowMuchWeGetForFree is (f + delta). \n\nBut delta must be chosen such that:\n\nL \u2264 f + delta \u2264 R \n\nAlso, since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the delta (the contribution to this node) must be at least the contribution to the parent (which is part of the path). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but there's a mistake in how the parent's children are being processed. \n\nWait, looking at the code's setup:\n\nThe code reads the p array as pp = _r.II2(n-1). The II2 function returns an array of size n+1 (since it's for 2 to n). So pp[2] is p_2, pp[3] is p_3, etc. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif i>1, then the parent is pp[i], so the parent node is dic[pp[i]], and we add the current node to the parent's children. \n\nWait, but the index for pp is from 2 to n. So for i=2, pp[2] is p_2. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThe problem might be in the DFS function. \n\nWait, in the code's DFS function, for each node, it first processes all children, then sums their HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nThen, if the sum f is less than L, then we need to add an operation here. \n\nThe HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to R. \n\nWait, but why R? \n\nSuppose the node's L is 5, and f is 3. Then, the minimal required is to add 2. But the HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to R. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when you add an operation here, you can set the contribution to this node to R, so that the parent can get as much as possible. \n\nWait, but the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution that this node can pass up to its parent. \n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for node v is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent (i.e., the minimal required contribution from the parent's side). \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given that the node's a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nSo, when f (sum from children) is less than L, we have to add an operation here. The minimal required is to add (L - f). But since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to this node (c_k) must be at least the contribution to the parent (c_{k-1}), which is part of the path. \n\nWait, but the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution that this node can pass up to the parent. \n\nSuppose the node's a_v is f + delta, where delta is the added contribution from this node's operation. \n\nThe HowMuchWeGetForFree would be the contribution to the parent, which is the delta's contribution to the parent's node. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or above. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given that the node's a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nSo, the maximum possible contribution to the parent is the minimum between (the current sum plus the added contribution) and R. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, which is the minimum between (the sum plus the added contribution) and R. \n\nWait, when we add an operation here, the added contribution to this node can be as much as possible (up to R - f). \n\nBut the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution to the parent, which is the added contribution to the parent's node. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but there's a mistake in the way the parent's contribution is calculated. \n\nWait, in the code's current setup, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is set to R when an operation is added. \n\nBut in the first sample, node2's HowMuchWeGetForFree is R (say 2). \n\nThen, the parent (node1) gets that 2 as part of the sum from children. \n\nBut node1's L is 1, so the sum is 2 which is okay. \n\nThus, the code's approach works for that case. \n\nAnother test case: the second sample. \n\nSuppose node3's L is 7. \n\nProcessing node3 first. \n\nf is 0 (no children). \n\n0 <7 \u2192 add an operation (counter becomes 1). \n\nHowMuchWeGetForFree for node3 is R (say 7). \n\nThen, node2's children are node3. \n\nThe sum f is 7. \n\nSuppose node2's L is 3. \n\nSince 7 >=3, so HowMuchWeGetForFree for node2 is min(7, R). \n\nSuppose node2's R is 3. \n\nThen, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is 3. \n\nThen, node1's children is node2. \n\nThe sum f is 3. \n\nSuppose node1's L is 5. \n\nThen, 3 <5 \u2192 add an operation (counter becomes 2). \n\nHowMuchWeGetForFree for node1 is set to R (say 5). \n\nThus, the total counter is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nAh, so this approach works. \n\nWait, but in this case, node2's R is 3. So when the sum f (7) is greater than R (3), the HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to min(7, 3) \u2192 3. \n\nThus, the parent (node2's parent, node1) gets 3 from node2's contribution. \n\nSo node1's sum is 3, which is less than L (5). So we add an operation here, counter becomes 2. \n\nThus, the code's approach works. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the parent's children are stored in the children list. \n\nWait, in the code, for each node, the children are stored in a list. \n\nThe DFS function processes children first (post-order traversal). \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nWait, but in the code, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is initialized as 0 for each node. \n\nWait, the code's Node class has HowMuchWeGetForFree as a field, initialized to 0. \n\nThen, during the DFS, for each node, after processing children, the sum f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nWait, but the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node is the contribution that can be passed up to its parent. \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nHmm, but why does the code's approach work? Let me think through the variables again. \n\nThe HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node v is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to its parent. \n\nThe sum f is the sum of all children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nWait, no, the sum f is the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nWait, but each child's HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution that the child can pass up to the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node v is the total contribution that can be passed up to the parent. \n\nWait, but the children's contributions are summed, so the parent's contribution from this node is the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree plus any added contribution here. \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree for node v is the total contribution that can be passed up to the parent. \n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree for node v is the maximum possible value that can be contributed to the parent, given the constraints. \n\nThe sum f is the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nWait, but the children's contributions are part of the path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but there's a mistake in the way the parent's children are being added. \n\nWait, in the code, when building the tree, for i from 1 to n:\n\nif i>1, then the parent is pp[i], so the parent node is dic[pp[i]], and we add the current node to the parent's children. \n\nWait, the pp array is of size n-1, but the code uses pp[i], where i starts from 2. \n\nWait, the pp array is created with II2(n-1), which returns an array of size n+1 (since it's for indices 2 to n+1?), but perhaps the indices are correct. \n\nWait, the II2 function is defined as:\n\npublic static int[] II2(this StreamReader r, int n)\n\n{\n    int[] ret = new int[n + 2];\n    for (int i = 2; i < n + 2; i++)\n        ret[i] = r.I();\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\nWait, for n-1 elements, the loop runs from i=2 to i < (n-1)+2 \u2192 i < n+1. So the indices 2 to n are filled. \n\nThus, for the input p_2, p_3, ..., p_n (n-1 numbers), the array pp has pp[2] = p_2, pp[3] = p_3, ..., pp[n] = p_n. \n\nThus, when i is 2, pp[i] is p_2, which is correct. \n\nSo the tree is built correctly. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nWait, but why does the code's HowMuchWeGetForFree for a node when adding an operation set to R? \n\nBecause when you add an operation here, you can choose the c array such that the contribution to this node is R, and the contribution to the parent is as much as possible (but non-decreasing). \n\nWait, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the contribution that can be passed up to the parent. \n\nSuppose we add an operation here. The c array for this operation must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe contribution to this node (c_k) can be as large as possible (up to R - f). \n\nBut the contribution to the parent (c_{k-1}) must be <= c_k. \n\nThe maximum possible contribution to the parent is c_{k-1} = c_k (since it's non-decreasing). \n\nWait, but the HowMuchWeGetForFree for this node is the contribution to the parent, which is c_{k-1}. \n\nHmm, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the minimal required contribution that must be added at this node or above. \n\nAlternatively, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to the parent, given that the node's a_v is within [L, R]. \n\nWhen we add an operation here, the minimal required is to add (L - f). \n\nThe maximum possible contribution to the parent is (L - f) (since the c array must be non-decreasing, so the parent's contribution can be as much as possible, but the node's contribution must be at least that). \n\nWait, perhaps the HowMuchWeGetForFree should be the minimal between (L - f) and R - f? \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the problem is that the code's DFS is not processing the children in the correct order. \n\nWait, the code's DFS is a post-order traversal (process children first, then the node). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, the code's approach seems to work for the samples. \n\nBut why in the first case, when the node's L is 2, and the sum f is 0, adding an operation sets HowMuchWeGetForFree to R (2). \n\nThe contribution to the parent is 2, which is exactly the node's a_v. \n\nThus, the parent can use that. \n\nSo the code's approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the code provided is correct? \n\nWait, but the problem's constraints are that the a_v must be between l_v and r_v. \n\nThe code's approach ensures that the sum of the children's HowMuchWeGetForFree plus the added contribution (if any) is at least L and at most R. \n\nWait, when we add an operation, the HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to R. \n\nWait, the added contribution is (R - f). \n\nThus, the a_v becomes f + (R - f) = R, which is within [L, R]. \n\nIf f >= L, then the a_v is f, which is within [L, R] (since f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree, which are all within their constraints). \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that the a_v is at least L? \n\nAh, because when f < L, we add an operation, which brings the a_v to R (which is >= L). \n\nWait, but R could be less than L? No, the problem states that l_v <= r_v. \n\nThus, R is at least L. \n\nSo, when f < L, we set a_v to R (which is >= L and <= R). \n\nThus, the a_v is within the required range. \n\nWhen f >= L, then a_v is f, which must be <= R. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that f <= R? \n\nAh, in the code's else clause, when f >= L, then the HowMuchWeGetForFree is set to min(f, R). \n\nThus, the a_v is min(f, R). \n\nWait, but then the a_v would be min(f, R). \n\nWait, but the a_v must be at least L. \n\nWait, in this case, f is the sum of children's HowMuchWeGetForFree. \n\nThe children's HowMuchWeGetForFree are set such that their a_v is within their constraints. \n\nBut the sum f could be greater than R. \n\nWait, for example, suppose a node has children whose HowMuchWeGetForFree sum to f = 10, but the node's R is 5. \n\nThen, the code would set HowMuchWeGetForFree to min(10,5) =5. \n\nThus, the a_v is 5 (since no operation is added). \n\nBut 5 is within [L, R]. \n\nThus, the a_v is 5, which is okay. \n\nThus, the code ensures that a_v is between L and R. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nSo why is the user asking to complete the code? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the user provided code with a missing part in the ReaderExtensions class. \n\nThe code's ReaderExtensions has a method NextToken, and in the while loop, there's a line: \n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\nThe comment indicates that this line is missing. \n\nAh! So the problem is to fill in the missing code in the ReaderExtensions class. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nSo the missing part is in the NextToken method of the ReaderExtensions class. \n\nLooking at the code for NextToken:\n\nInside the while loop:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\n{\n    if (ch == '\\r' && (Environment.NewLine == \"\\r\\n\"))\n    {\n        sr.Read();\n    }\n\n    break;\n}\n\nThe condition here is supposed to decide whether to break out of the loop when a whitespace is encountered. \n\nThe code is trying to read tokens, skipping whitespace. \n\nThe variable skipWhiteSpaceMode is true when we are skipping whitespace. \n\nThe code is in the part where it reads characters until a non-whitespace is found (when skipWhiteSpaceMode is true). \n\nWait, the code's logic is: \n\nWe are in a loop reading characters. \n\nIf the current character is whitespace: \n\n- if skipWhiteSpaceMode is true, then we continue (since we are skipping whitespace). \n\nWait, no, the code's logic is: \n\nThe code is trying to read a token. \n\nThe loop reads characters until it finds a non-whitespace (when in skipWhiteSpaceMode), then reads all non-whitespace characters until whitespace is found again. \n\nWait, the code's logic is: \n\nThe loop is reading characters. \n\nThe variable skipWhiteSpaceMode is true initially. \n\nWhen a whitespace is read while in skipWhiteSpaceMode, it continues (since we are skipping whitespace). \n\nWhen a non-whitespace is found, we exit skipWhiteSpaceMode and start collecting characters. \n\nWhen a whitespace is found again (after collecting characters), we break. \n\nThe missing condition is probably checking whether we are in skipWhiteSpaceMode. \n\nWait, the code's current line is: \n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\nThe code inside the if is executed when the current character is whitespace. \n\nThe code inside the if block checks if the character is '\\r' and the newline is \"\\r\\n\", then reads another character (to skip the '\\n'). \n\nThen breaks. \n\nThe condition should be whether we are in skipWhiteSpaceMode. \n\nWait, the code is in the case where the current character is whitespace. \n\nThe code is in the part where we are reading a whitespace character. \n\nThe code is supposed to skip whitespace when in skipWhiteSpaceMode. \n\nBut when we are not in skipWhiteSpaceMode (i.e., we are collecting characters for the token), then encountering a whitespace means we should stop and break. \n\nThus, the condition should be: \n\nif (!skipWhiteSpaceMode) \n\nBecause when we are not in skipWhiteSpaceMode (i.e., we are collecting characters), then encountering a whitespace means we should break. \n\nWait, let me re-express the code's logic: \n\nThe loop is reading characters. \n\nInitially, skipWhiteSpaceMode is true. \n\nWe read characters until we find a non-whitespace (then skipWhiteSpaceMode becomes false). \n\nOnce we are in non-whitespace mode (skipWhiteSpaceMode is false), any whitespace encountered means we should stop and break. \n\nThus, the condition inside the if (for the whitespace case) is whether we are not in skipWhiteSpaceMode. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nif (!skipWhiteSpaceMode)\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nif (!skipWhiteSpaceMode)\n\nThen, the code inside the if block checks if the whitespace is a '\\r' and the newline is \"\\r\\n\", then skips the next character (if needed), and breaks. \n\nThus, the missing code is \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\".\n\nSo the correct line is:\n\nif (!skipWhiteSpaceMode)\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\".\n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the answer is to fill in the condition as \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\".\n\nSo the missing code is \"!skipWhiteSpaceMode\"."
