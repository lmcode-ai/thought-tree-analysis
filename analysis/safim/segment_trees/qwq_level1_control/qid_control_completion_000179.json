Similarly, to get to row2, i from row2, i-1: cost 1 (right). To get to row2, i from row1, i-1: cost 2 (right and down).

Wait, looking back at the code: Initially, for st (the first column with chips), if s1[st] is '*', then dp2[st] is set to 1? Wait, no:\n\nThe code says:\n\nif(s1[st] == '*') dp2[st] = 1;\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake. Because if s1[st] has a chip, then the initial dp1[st] should be 1 (since that's row1). Wait, looking at the code: if(s1[st] == '*') dp2[st] = 1;\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Because s1 is row1. So if s1[st] is '*', then the chip is in row1, so dp1[st] should be 1. Ah, that's a bug in the code. But the user's code might have that, but perhaps it's a typo. But since the problem is to complete the code, maybe I should focus on the missing condition first. Back to the main problem. The code for dp1[i] has an if condition. Let me think again. The code for dp1[i] is:\n\nif (condition) {\n    dp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] +2, dp2[i-1] +2 );\n} else {\n    dp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] +1, dp2[i-1] +2 );\n}\n\nThe else part uses +1 and +2, which aligns with the previous idea of moving from row1 (cost 1) or row2 (cost 2). The if condition must be when the cost is different. Suppose the condition is whether there is a chip in the current cell (row1, i). If there is a chip in row1, i (s1[i] == '*'), then perhaps moving into that cell would capture it, so the cost is adjusted. Wait, but how?",

Alternatively, the condition is whether there is a chip in the current cell (row1, i). If there is, then the cost for moving from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) is increased by 1 because you have to capture it. So the cost becomes 1+1=2. Hence, the condition is whether s1[i] is '*'. So the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). Thus, the code should be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') Then the if block uses +2 and +2. The else uses +1 and +2.

The code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 ) The normal case (without the condition) would be:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+1, dp1[i-1]+2 ) So the difference is that when s1[i] is '*', the first term (from row2) is increased by 1.",

Hence, the cost is the same. But the code increases the cost by 1. This suggests that the code is incorrect, but the problem requires completing it. Given the code's structure, the most logical condition is whether s1[i] is a '*' (there is a chip in row1, i). So the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). Thus, the code should be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') Then the if block uses +2 and +2. The else uses +1 and +2. This would explain the code's structure for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*'. So I think the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). Therefore, the answer is to fill in the condition as (s1[i] == '*'). So the code should be:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') Thus, the missing code is \"s1[i] == '*'\". So the line should be:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i = st + 1; i <= ed; i ++){\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i - 1] + 2, dp2[i - 1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i - 1] + 1, dp2[i - 1] + 2);\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp2[i] = min(dp2[i - 1] + 2, dp1[i - 1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp2[i] = min(dp2[i - 1] + 1, dp1[i - 1] + 2);\n}\n\nWait, but the code for dp2[i] already has a condition based on s1[i]. Wait, looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code for dp2[i] has:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') dp2[i] = min(...);\nelse dp2[i] = min(...);\n\nSo the condition for dp2[i] is whether s1[i] is a '*'. But the problem is that the current cell for dp2[i] is row2, i. The presence of a chip in row1, i (s1[i] == '*') might affect the cost for moving to row2, i. \n\nHence, the condition for dp2[i] is whether there is a chip in row1, i.",

But the code's condition for dp2[i] is based on s1[i], which is row1's cell. So the code's logic is that when there is a chip in row1, i, then moving to row2, i from row1 (i-1) would have a cost of 2 (down and right) plus possibly an extra step. But the code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\nmin( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe first term is moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) with cost 2 instead of 1. This suggests that the presence of a chip in row1, i adds an extra cost to moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i). But why? Perhaps because the chip in row1, i must be captured, so you have to move around it. But I'm not sure.",

Therefore, the missing code is \"s1[i] == '*'\". So the answer is to fill in the condition as (s1[i] == '*'). Thus, the missing code is:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i = st + 1; i <= ed; i ++){\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 2, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n    // similar for dp2[i]\n} Yes, this seems to be the correct condition.",

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current column has any chips. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current column has a chip in row1. The code for dp1[i] is for row1. So if there is a chip in row1, then the cost is higher. Wait, the code's if condition is missing, and the else part uses the standard transitions.

In that case, the presence of a chip in the current column (row1, i) can be used as part of the path. So, for dp1[i], the current cell has a chip (s1[i] == '*'), then you can choose to use that chip, so the previous steps must have cleared the previous columns, and the current chip is the one remaining. In that case, the cost would be the previous steps (up to i-1) plus 0 (since we're using the existing chip). Wait, but how does that fit into the transitions?",

But then the code's if condition would be whether there is a chip in the current cell. In that case, for dp1[i], if s1[i] is '*', then the cost would be increased by 1. So the transitions would be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') then:\n\ndp1[i] = min( (dp1[i-1] +1) +1, (dp2[i-1] +2) +1 ) = min( dp1[i-1]+2, dp2[i-1]+3 ) But that doesn't match the code's current structure. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code's existing parts. The code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\nmin( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe normal transitions (without the condition) would be:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+1, dp1[i-1]+2 ) So the difference is that when s1[i] is '*', the first term (from row2) is increased by 1. So the cost for moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) is now 2 instead of 1. Why would that be? Perhaps because there's a chip in row1, i, so moving to row2, i requires an extra step to avoid it? Or maybe the presence of a chip in row1, i means that you have to move around it, but that doesn't make sense.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in the code provided. The problem is about finding the minimum number of moves to leave exactly one chip on a 2xN board. The code given is in C++ and uses dynamic programming arrays dp1 and dp2. Let me think through the problem again to understand where the code might be incomplete.\n\nThe problem states that in each move, a chip can move to an adjacent cell (left, right, or up/down depending on the row). When moving to a cell with another chip, that chip is captured (disappears). The goal is to have exactly one chip left with the least moves.\n\nThe approach here seems to be using dynamic programming. The dp1[i] and dp2[i] probably represent the minimum moves required up to column i for the last chip to be in row 1 or row 2 respectively. \n\nLooking at the code, the initial part finds the first and last columns (st and ed) that have chips. Then, they initialize dp1 and dp2 for the starting column. The loop from st+1 to ed is where the DP transitions happen. The problem is in the condition for the first 'if' statement in the loop where dp1[i] is being set. The code says \"if(/* TODO: Your code here */)\" so I need to figure out what condition goes there.\n\nLet me look at the existing code's logic. For dp1[i], which is the case where the current column's last chip is in row 1. The code is trying to compute the minimum between two options: coming from the previous column's dp1 (row1) or dp2 (row2). The current cell's state (whether it has a chip or not) might affect the transition.\n\nWait, the code for dp1[i] has an 'if' condition that's missing. The else part is when that condition is false. Let me see the existing code's structure:\n\nif (condition) {\n    dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 2, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n} else {\n    dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n}\n\nHmm. The else part uses +1 and +2. The condition must be related to whether the current cell (s1[i]) has a chip. Let me think about the transitions.\n\nThe idea is that when moving to column i, the current cell's presence of a chip might influence the cost. Let's think of the transitions:\n\nFor dp1[i], the last chip is in row1, column i. To get there, the previous step could have been in row1 or row2 of column i-1.\n\nIf the current cell (s1[i]) has a chip, then perhaps moving a chip from the previous column's row1 or row2 to here would have some cost. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a chip here affects whether we can \"capture\" it or not.\n\nAlternatively, the DP might track the minimum steps required to have exactly one chip at column i in row1 or row2, considering all previous moves.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether s1[i] is a '*' (has a chip). Let me think:\n\nSuppose s1[i] is a '*'. Then, when moving to this position, maybe the cost is different. Let me see the existing code for dp2[i]. The code for dp2[i] (when s1[i] is '*') is:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') dp2[i] = min(dp2[i-1] + 2, dp1[i-1] + 2);\nelse ... \n\nWait, the code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses adding 2 to both options. But when it's not, it uses +1 for the dp2[i-1] path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition in the dp1's if statement is whether s1[i] is a '*'?\n\nWait, let's think of the transitions for dp1[i]. The current cell is in row1, column i. To get here, the previous could be from row1 (i-1) or row2 (i-1).\n\nIf the current cell (row1, i) has a chip, then perhaps moving a chip from the previous column's row1 would require moving it right (cost 1?), but since there's a chip here, maybe the cost is different. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a chip here allows us to capture it, so the cost is adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][row] represents the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns' chips have been captured. So, the transitions would depend on whether the current cell has a chip or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current cell (row1, i) has a chip. Let me think of the code for dp1[i]:\n\nThe code for dp1[i] has an if condition. The else part uses +1 and +2. The if part uses +2 and +2. \n\nSuppose the condition is whether s1[i] is a '*'. Let's see:\n\nIf s1[i] is a '*', then the current cell has a chip. So, when moving to this position, perhaps the cost is different. Let me think of the transitions:\n\nCase 1: The previous was in row1 (i-1). To move to row1, i, the chip can move right (cost 1). But since there's a chip here, moving there would capture it, so maybe the cost is 1, but the existing code in the else part uses +1. Wait, but in the else part (when s1[i] is not '*'), the code uses dp1[i-1] +1. So when s1[i] is a '*', the code would be in the if condition, which uses +2 for both options. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current cell (row1, i) has a chip. Let me think of the transitions:\n\nSuppose the current cell has a chip. Then, to end up with a chip here, you can either:\n\n- Bring a chip from the previous column's row1 (moving right, cost 1). But since there's a chip here, moving there would capture it, so the existing chip here is removed. Wait, but the problem says that when you move to a cell with another chip, that chip disappears. So if you move a chip into a cell with a chip, the destination's chip is captured (disappears), so the moving chip remains. So, in that case, moving into a cell with a chip would capture it, so the total number of chips reduces by one. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after all moves, there's exactly one chip left. So the DP is tracking the steps to have exactly one chip at column i, and the rest have been captured. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP[i][row] represents the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have been cleared. \n\nIn that case, the transitions would be:\n\nTo reach column i in row1, the previous could be in row1 or row2 of column i-1. \n\nThe cost would depend on moving the chip from the previous position to the current, and also whether the current cell has a chip that needs to be captured. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip in row at column i, considering all previous columns. \n\nLet me think of the transitions:\n\nSuppose we are at column i, and we want to have the last chip in row1 (dp1[i]). \n\nThe previous step could have been in row1 (i-1) or row2 (i-1). \n\nIf the previous was in row1 (i-1):\n\n- To move to row1, i, the chip moves right (cost 1). But if there was a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it. So the total steps would be dp1[i-1] (previous steps) + 1 (move). However, if there was a chip here, then moving into it would capture it, so the total chips would decrease by one. But since we need to end up with exactly one, perhaps the presence of a chip here affects whether we can do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have no chips. \n\nIn that case, the transitions would be:\n\nFor dp1[i], the current cell (row1, i) must have the chip. \n\nThe previous could be from row1 (i-1) or row2 (i-1). \n\nIf previous was row1 (i-1):\n\n- The chip moves right to row1, i. The cost is 1. But if there was a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it, so the existing chip there is removed. So the total steps would be dp1[i-1] + 1. However, if there was a chip here, then moving into it would capture it, so the previous steps must have accounted for that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a chip in the current cell (row1, i) means that we can choose to capture it by moving a chip there, which would count as a move but also eliminate that chip. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the existing code's structure again. \n\nThe code for dp2[i] (when s1[i] is '*') uses min between dp2[i-1] +2 and dp1[i-1]+2. \n\nWait, when s1[i] is a '*', then the code for dp2[i] (which is the case where the current chip is in row2, column i) would have to account for that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition in the if statement for dp1[i] is whether s1[i] is a '*' or not. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the condition is (s1[i] == '*'). \n\nThen, in the if block (when s1[i] is '*'), the code uses min between dp1[i-1] +2 and dp2[i-1]+2. \n\nElse, it uses min between dp1[i-1]+1 and dp2[i-1]+2. \n\nHmm, why would that be the case?\n\nLet me think of the case when s1[i] has a chip. \n\nIf the current cell (row1, i) has a chip, then to end up with the chip here, perhaps we can either:\n\n- Bring a chip from row1, i-1 to row1, i. The move is right (cost 1). But since there's a chip here, moving there would capture it. So the existing chip here is removed, so the total steps would be dp1[i-1] +1. But since the current cell has a chip, maybe we can also choose to not move that chip, but instead use the existing one. Wait, but the DP is tracking the steps to have exactly one chip here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a chip in the current cell allows us to have an option where we don't have to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have the last chip at column i in row, considering all previous columns. \n\nIn that case, if the current cell has a chip, then perhaps the cost can be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the transitions for dp1[i]:\n\nIf the current cell (row1, i) has a chip (s1[i] == '*'), then:\n\n- To get to this position, the previous could have been in row1 (i-1) or row2 (i-1). \n\nIf previous was in row1 (i-1):\n\n- Moving right to row1, i: cost 1. But since there's a chip here, moving there would capture it. So the existing chip here is removed, so the total steps would be dp1[i-1] +1. However, since the current cell has a chip, maybe we can also consider that the existing chip can be used. Wait, perhaps the existing chip can be part of the path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a chip in the current cell allows us to have an option where we don't have to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP is designed such that whenever there's a chip in the current cell, you can choose to \"use\" it, so the cost is adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current cell (row1, i) has a chip. Let me think of the code for dp2[i]. \n\nThe code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1] +2, dp1[i-1] +2 )\n\nWait, why adding 2 in both cases? \n\nSuppose the current cell is row2, i. To get there, the previous could be in row2 (i-1) or row1 (i-1). \n\nIf previous was in row2 (i-1), moving right to row2, i: cost 1. But since there's a chip in row1, i (s1[i] is '*'), but that's in a different row. So moving to row2, i would not affect that. Wait, but the current cell is row2, i. \n\nWait, the current cell for dp2[i] is row2, i. So if s1[i] is a '*', that's in row1, i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' (there's a chip in row1, i) requires moving from row1 to row2, which is a vertical move (cost 1?), but maybe the code is considering that moving from row1 to row2 would take 1 step, but since there's a chip in row1, i, moving there would capture it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is that whenever there's a chip in the current column's row (for dp1[i], row1), then the cost is higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition in the if statement for dp1[i] is whether s2[i] is a '*'? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current column (i) has a chip in row1. \n\nWait, looking at the code for dp1[i], the if condition is missing. The else part uses +1 and +2. The if part uses +2 and +2. \n\nSuppose the condition is whether s1[i] is a '*'. \n\nThen, when s1[i] is a '*', the code uses +2 for both options. \n\nWhy would that be?\n\nMaybe when there's a chip in row1, i, moving into that cell requires capturing it, so the cost is higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is calculated as follows:\n\nIf the current cell (row1, i) has a chip, then moving a chip from the previous column's row1 (i-1) to row1, i would require moving right (cost 1), but since there's a chip there, the move would capture it. So the total steps would be previous steps +1. However, since the current cell has a chip, maybe we can also consider that the existing chip can be part of the path, so the cost is 0? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP is designed such that whenever there's a chip in the current cell, you can choose to \"use\" it, so the cost is adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is that when the current cell has a chip, you have to account for the fact that you can capture it, so the cost is higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's DP is tracking the number of moves required to have exactly one chip at column i in row1 or row2, and the transitions are as follows:\n\nFor dp1[i], the current cell is row1, i. \n\nThe previous could be in row1 (i-1) or row2 (i-1). \n\nThe cost to move from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) is 1 (right move). \n\nThe cost to move from row2 (i-1) to row1 (i) is 2 (right and up/down? Wait, moving from row2 to row1 is up, but also moving right. So the move from row2, i-1 to row1, i would be two steps: right and up. So that's a cost of 2. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because moving from row2, i-1 to row1, i requires moving right (to i) and up (to row1), so two moves. \n\nAh! So the cost between rows is 2 steps. \n\nSo, the transitions are:\n\nTo get to row1, i from row1, i-1: cost 1 (right move).\n\nTo get to row1, i from row2, i-1: cost 2 (right and up).\n\nSimilarly, to get to row2, i from row2, i-1: cost 1 (right).\n\nTo get to row2, i from row1, i-1: cost 2 (right and down).\n\nTherefore, the transitions for dp1[i] (row1, i) would be:\n\ndp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] + 1, dp2[i-1] + 2 )\n\nSimilarly for dp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1] +1, dp1[i-1] +2 )\n\nBut then why is there an if condition in the code for dp1[i]?\n\nAh, perhaps the presence of a chip in the current cell (row1, i) allows us to have an alternative path where we can capture it, so the cost is different. \n\nWait, the problem says that when you move a chip into a cell with another chip, the destination's chip is captured (disappears). So, if there's a chip in row1, i, then moving a chip there would capture it, so the total number of chips reduces by one. \n\nBut the DP is tracking the steps to have exactly one chip at column i. So, perhaps when there's a chip in the current cell, you can choose to use that chip, so you don't have to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a chip in the current cell allows you to have an option where you don't have to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have been cleared. \n\nIn that case, if the current cell has a chip, then you can choose to use that chip, so you don't need to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nWait, but how does that affect the transitions?\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP[i][row] can be initialized with the presence of chips in the current column. \n\nAlternatively, the code's initial part (before the loop) sets dp1[st] and dp2[st] based on whether there's a chip in the starting column. \n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nInitially, for st (the first column with chips), if s1[st] is '*', then dp2[st] is set to 1? Wait, no:\n\nThe code says:\n\nif(s1[st] == '*') dp2[st] = 1;\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake. Because if s1[st] has a chip, then the initial dp1[st] should be 1 (since that's row1). \n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nif(s1[st] == '*') dp2[st] = 1;\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Because s1 is row1. So if s1[st] is '*', then the chip is in row1, so dp1[st] should be 1. \n\nAh, that's a bug in the code. But the user's code might have that, but perhaps it's a typo. But since the problem is to complete the code, maybe I should focus on the missing condition first. \n\nBack to the main problem. The code for dp1[i] has an if condition. Let me think again.\n\nThe code for dp1[i] is:\n\nif (condition) {\n    dp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] +2, dp2[i-1] +2 );\n} else {\n    dp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] +1, dp2[i-1] +2 );\n}\n\nThe else part uses +1 and +2, which aligns with the previous idea of moving from row1 (cost 1) or row2 (cost 2). \n\nThe if condition must be when the cost is different. \n\nSuppose the condition is whether there is a chip in the current cell (row1, i). \n\nIf there is a chip in row1, i (s1[i] == '*'), then perhaps moving into that cell would capture it, so the cost is adjusted. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe when there is a chip in the current cell, you can choose to not move a chip from the previous column, but instead use the existing one. \n\nWait, but the DP is tracking the steps to have exactly one chip at column i. So if there's a chip in the current cell, then perhaps you can choose to have that chip be the one remaining, so you don't need to move from the previous column. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the previous column's chip must have been moved away. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the current column i has a chip in row1. \n\nTo have the final chip at row1, i, you can either:\n\n- Bring a chip from the previous column (i-1) to row1, i, which would capture the existing chip here. So the total steps would be the previous steps plus the move cost (1 or 2), but since the existing chip is captured, that's okay. \n\nOr, you can choose to not move any chips from the previous column, but instead use the existing chip here. But how?\n\nWait, the previous column's chips must have been eliminated. So the previous steps must have already cleared columns before i. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of a chip in the current cell allows us to have an option where we don't have to move a chip from the previous column. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP[i][row] can be the minimum between:\n\n- The previous steps plus moving to this row, or \n\n- The current cell's chip (if present) plus some cost. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether there is a chip in the current column (either row). \n\nWait, the code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' (there's a chip in row1, i) uses:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1] +2, dp1[i-1] +2 )\n\nWhich would be the case if moving to row2, i from either row2 (cost 2?), but why?\n\nWait, moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) is cost 1. But if there's a chip in row1, i, then moving to row2, i would not affect that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that whenever there's a chip in the current column (either row), then the cost is increased by 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition in the if statement is whether the current column has a chip in row1. \n\nWait, let me think of the code for dp1[i]. The else part uses the standard transitions (cost 1 and 2). The if part adds 2 to both options. \n\nSo when the condition is true, the cost is higher. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is when there is a chip in the current cell (row1, i). \n\nBecause if there is a chip there, then moving into it would require capturing it, so the cost is higher. \n\nWait, but moving into it would capture it, so the existing chip is removed. So the cost is the same as moving there, but the existing chip is gone. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cost is the same, but the presence of the chip allows an alternative path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering that if there is a chip in the current cell, then you can choose to use that chip, so you don't have to move from the previous column. \n\nWait, but how would that work? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP is designed such that whenever there is a chip in the current cell, you can choose to start from there, so the cost is 0 for that path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current column has a chip in row1. \n\nSo, the code for dp1[i] is:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') then the cost is higher. \n\nWait, in the code's current structure, when s1[i] is a '*', the code uses +2 for both options. \n\nSo, for example, moving from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) would cost 1 normally, but with the condition, it becomes +2. \n\nWhy would that be?\n\nPerhaps because moving into a cell with a chip requires an extra move to capture it. \n\nWait, but moving into a cell with a chip would capture it, so the move is still just one step. \n\nHmm, maybe the code is wrong here, but the problem is to complete the missing condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current column has a chip in row2. \n\nWait, the code for dp1[i] is for row1. So maybe the condition is whether there is a chip in row2, i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current column has a chip in either row. \n\nWait, the code for dp1[i] is trying to decide between two different cost calculations. \n\nThe else part uses the standard cost (1 and 2). The if part uses 2 and 2. \n\nThe difference between the two is that in the if case, moving from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) costs 2 instead of 1. \n\nSo why would that be?\n\nMaybe when there is a chip in row1, i, moving there requires an extra step. \n\nWait, perhaps the presence of a chip in row1, i means that you have to move there and capture it, so the move is still one step, but the cost is the same. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of a small example. \n\nSuppose the current column i has a chip in row1. \n\nThe previous column's best option is to have a chip in row1 (i-1). \n\nMoving right to row1, i would take 1 step. But since there's a chip there, moving there would capture it. So the total steps would be previous steps +1. \n\nBut in the code's if condition (when s1[i] is '*'), the code uses +2. \n\nSo that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering that the existing chip in row1, i must be captured, so you have to move there, but also account for that chip's presence. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP is counting the number of chips remaining. \n\nWait, the problem requires that all chips except one are captured. So the DP[i][row] must account for the number of chips being reduced. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns have been cleared. \n\nIn that case, the presence of a chip in the current column (row1, i) can be used as part of the path. \n\nSo, for dp1[i], the current cell has a chip (s1[i] == '*'), then you can choose to use that chip, so the previous steps must have cleared the previous columns, and the current chip is the one remaining. \n\nIn that case, the cost would be the previous steps (up to i-1) plus 0 (since we're using the existing chip). \n\nWait, but how does that fit into the transitions?\n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][row] can be the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have no chips. \n\nSo, to get to column i in row1, the previous column (i-1) must have had exactly one chip, which is then moved to column i. \n\nThe presence of a chip in row1, i means that you can choose to capture it by moving the previous chip there, which would eliminate it. \n\nWait, but then the previous chip is moved to row1, i, which captures the existing chip, so the total chips remain one. \n\nSo the cost would be the previous steps plus the move cost. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether there is a chip in the current cell. \n\nIf there is a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it, so the cost is the same as moving there. \n\nBut why would the code's if condition add 2 instead of 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's DP is considering that when there is a chip in the current cell, you have to account for that chip's existence. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP[i][row] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have been cleared. \n\nIn that case, if the current column has a chip in row1, then you can choose to use that chip, so the previous steps must have cleared up to i-1, and then you can just leave that chip. \n\nSo the cost would be the steps to clear up to i-1, plus 0 (since you don't move anything). \n\nBut how does that fit into the transitions?\n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][row] can be the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have been cleared. \n\nSo, to get to row1, i, the previous column (i-1) must have had exactly one chip, which is then moved to row1, i. \n\nThe cost is the previous steps plus the move cost. \n\nAdditionally, if there is a chip in row1, i, then you can choose to not move the previous chip, but instead capture it by moving the previous chip to row1, i. \n\nWait, but that would require moving the previous chip there, which would capture the existing one. \n\nSo the presence of a chip in row1, i doesn't change the cost, because you have to move the previous chip there anyway. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me think of the code's existing part for dp2[i]. \n\nThe code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' (there's a chip in row1, i) uses:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1] +2, dp1[i-1] +2 )\n\nThe first term is moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) (cost 1?), but why adding 2?\n\nWait, moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) is a right move, cost 1. So why is it adding 2?\n\nAh, perhaps the code has a mistake here. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the cost calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps the cost for moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) is 1, but the presence of a chip in row1, i requires an extra step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is calculated as the number of moves required to move the previous chip to the current position, plus any additional steps needed to capture existing chips. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's DP is considering that whenever there is a chip in the current column (either row), you have to spend an extra move to capture it. \n\nSo, for example, if there is a chip in row1, i, then moving to row1, i would require capturing it, so the cost increases by 1. \n\nHence, the total cost would be the previous cost plus the move cost plus 1 (for capturing). \n\nBut then the code's if condition would be whether there is a chip in the current cell. \n\nIn that case, for dp1[i], if s1[i] is '*', then the cost would be increased by 1. \n\nSo the transitions would be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') then:\n\ndp1[i] = min( (dp1[i-1] +1) +1, (dp2[i-1] +2) +1 )\n\n= min( dp1[i-1]+2, dp2[i-1]+3 )\n\nBut that doesn't match the code's current structure. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code's existing parts. \n\nThe code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\nmin( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe normal transitions (without the condition) would be:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+1, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nSo the difference is that when s1[i] is '*', the first term (from row2) is increased by 1. \n\nSo the cost for moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) is now 2 instead of 1. \n\nWhy would that be?\n\nPerhaps because there's a chip in row1, i, so moving to row2, i requires an extra step to avoid it? Or maybe the presence of a chip in row1, i means that you have to move around it, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering that when there's a chip in row1, i, then moving to row2, i requires an extra step to capture it. \n\nWait, moving to row2, i from row2 (i-1) is a right move (cost 1). But if there's a chip in row1, i, that doesn't affect the move to row2, i. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition in the if statement for dp1[i] is whether there is a chip in row2, i. \n\nWait, the code for dp1[i] is for row1, so maybe the condition is whether there is a chip in row2, i. \n\nIf there is a chip in row2, i, then moving from row2 (i-1) to row1, i would require moving up and right, which is two steps, but also capturing the chip in row2, i. \n\nWait, but the chip in row2, i is in a different row. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current column has any chips. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is whether the current column has a chip in row1. \n\nThe code for dp1[i] is for row1. So if there is a chip in row1, then the cost is higher. \n\nWait, the code's if condition is missing, and the else part uses the standard transitions. \n\nThe if part uses +2 for both options. \n\nThe difference between the two is that in the if case, the cost from row1 (i-1) is increased by 1 (from 1 to 2), and the cost from row2 (i-1) is the same (2). \n\nSo the condition must be when the current cell (row1, i) has a chip. \n\nBecause then, moving there would capture it, so the cost is the same as moving there, but the existing chip is removed. \n\nBut why would the cost increase by 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the number of chips remaining. \n\nWait, the problem requires that all chips except one are captured. So each move that captures a chip reduces the count. \n\nThe DP[i][row] must track the steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all others eliminated. \n\nSo, the number of chips before moving to column i must be exactly one. \n\nWhen moving to row1, i from row1, i-1, the previous had one chip. Moving there would capture any existing chip in row1, i. \n\nSo if there was a chip there, then after the move, the count is still one (the moved chip remains, the existing is captured). \n\nSo the cost is just the move cost. \n\nHence, the presence of a chip in row1, i doesn't change the cost. \n\nSo why is the code's if condition adding 2?\n\nThis is really confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct approach to the problem and see what the DP should be doing. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum moves to have exactly one chip left. \n\nThe key observation is that the optimal path will have all chips merged into one, and the minimal steps would be the sum of the distances from each chip to the final position, minus the overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be found by considering all possible final positions and calculating the minimal steps required to gather all chips there. \n\nBut with the board being 2 rows and n columns, perhaps the optimal position is somewhere in the middle. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be computed by considering for each possible final position (each cell in the board), the sum of the distances from all chips to that cell, then subtract the maximum distance (since when two chips meet, one captures the other, so the overlapping steps are saved). \n\nWait, but the problem allows moving any chip any number of times, but each move can only move one chip. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of the distances from all chips to the final position, minus the maximum distance (since when two chips meet, one captures the other, so the overlapping steps are saved). \n\nWait, but this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps required is the sum of the distances of all chips to the final position minus the maximum distance. \n\nBecause when two chips are moving towards the same point, the one that arrives first can capture the others. \n\nSo the total steps would be the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nThis is similar to the problem where you have to gather all points to one point with minimal steps, where each step can move any point towards the target. \n\nIn that case, the minimal steps would be the total distance minus the maximum distance. \n\nSo for this problem, the minimal steps would be the minimum over all possible target positions of (sum of distances from all chips to target) minus the maximum distance. \n\nThis seems promising. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose there are two chips at positions (1,1) and (2,3). \n\nThe target is (1,2). \n\nThe distances are 1 (from (1,1) to (1,2)) and 2 (from (2,3) to (1,2)). \n\nSum is 3, max is 2. So total steps 3-2 =1. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe first chip moves to (1,2) in 1 step. The second chip moves to (1,2) in 2 steps. But when it arrives, the first chip is there, so it captures it. So total steps are 2 (the second chip's move). \n\nWait, but the first chip's move is 1 step, and the second's is 2 steps. The total steps would be 2 (since you can do them in parallel?), but the problem counts each move as a single step. \n\nWait, the problem says each move is moving one chip. So the total steps would be the sum of the individual steps required for each chip to reach the target, but when two chips are at the same position, one is captured. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nIn the example above, sum is 1+2=3, max is 2. 3-2=1. But the actual steps needed are 2 (the second chip's path). \n\nSo that formula doesn't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nIn the example, 3-2=1, but the actual steps needed are 2. So that's not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nWait, in the example, the first chip can move to the target in 1 step. The second chip takes 2 steps. But the first step of the second chip can be done in parallel with the first's move. \n\nBut the problem counts each move as a single step. So the total steps would be the maximum of the individual steps. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nBecause each move is a single step where you choose one chip to move. So to get all chips to the target, the total steps required is the maximum of the individual distances. \n\nBecause you can move the chips in parallel, but each step only moves one chip. \n\nWait, no. Because each move is one step where you move one chip. So to move two chips to the target, the total steps would be the sum of their individual distances. \n\nBut when they meet, one can capture the other. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nLet me think of the example again. \n\nTwo chips at (1,1) and (2,3). Target is (1,2). \n\nThe first chip needs 1 step to reach the target. \n\nThe second chip needs 2 steps (down to row1, then left twice). \n\nBut when the second chip reaches the target, the first is already there, so it captures it. \n\nSo the total steps needed are 2 steps. \n\nThe first step: move the first chip to (1,2). \n\nSecond step: move the second chip to (1,2). \n\nTotal steps: 2. \n\nWhich is the maximum of the two distances (2). \n\nAnother example: three chips at positions (1,1), (2,3), and (1,5). \n\nTarget is (1,3). \n\nDistances are 2, 2 (from (2,3) to (1,3) is 1 down and 0 right?), wait:\n\n(2,3) to (1,3): distance is 1 (up). \n\n(1,5) to (1,3): distance is 2 (left twice). \n\nSo the distances are 2 (from (1,1) to (1,3) is 2 steps right), 1 (from (2,3) to (1,3)), and 2 (from (1,5) to (1,3)). \n\nThe maximum distance is 2. \n\nThe total steps would be the maximum distance? \n\nBut the first chip takes 2 steps to reach the target. \n\nThe second takes 1 step. \n\nThe third takes 2 steps. \n\nBut the steps can be done in parallel. \n\nThe first chip's first step: move to (1,2). \n\nSecond step: move to (1,3). \n\nThe third chip's first step: move left to (1,4). \n\nSecond step: move to (1,3). \n\nThe second chip can be moved in the first step: move up to (1,3). \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nStep 1: move second chip to (1,3). \n\nStep 2: move first chip to (1,2). \n\nStep 3: move first to (1,3). \n\nStep 4: move third to (1,4). \n\nStep 5: move third to (1,3). \n\nTotal steps: 5. \n\nBut the maximum distance is 2. \n\nHmm, this doesn't align. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nIn the first example: 1+2 =3, minus 2 gives 1. But the actual steps needed are 2. \n\nSo that formula is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the position where the sum of the distances from all chips to that position minus the maximum distance among them is minimized. \n\nWait, in the first example, the sum is 3, max is 2. 3-2=1. But the actual steps needed are 2. \n\nSo that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nBut in the first example, that gives 1, but the actual steps are 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscalculating the example. \n\nIn the first example, the two chips are at (1,1) and (2,3). \n\nThe target is (1,2). \n\nThe first chip's distance is 1 (right). \n\nThe second's distance is 2 (down to row1, then left two steps). \n\nSum is 3. Max is 2. \n\n3-2 =1. \n\nBut the steps needed are 2. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nBut in this case, it's 1, but the actual steps are 2. \n\nSo that can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal steps is the sum of the distances of all chips to the target position, minus the maximum distance. \n\nBut in the first example, that gives 1, but the actual steps needed are 2. \n\nSo that's not correct. \n\nPerhaps I need to think differently. \n\nThe problem requires that after all moves, there is exactly one chip left. \n\nEach move can move any chip to an adjacent cell. \n\nWhen a chip moves into a cell with another chip, the destination chip is captured (disappears). \n\nSo the process is that each move reduces the number of chips by zero or one. \n\nThe goal is to reduce the number of chips to one with minimal moves. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum of the distances from all chips to the final position, minus the sum of the overlaps. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of the distances from all chips to the final position, minus the maximum distance. \n\nBecause the last chip to arrive will capture the others, so its distance is not needed. \n\nWait, in the first example, the two chips have distances 1 and 2. \n\nThe maximum is 2. \n\nSum is 3. \n\n3-2 =1. \n\nBut the steps needed are 2. \n\nHmm, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps is the sum of all distances minus the maximum distance. \n\nBut in the first example, that gives 1, but the actual steps are 2. \n\nSo that's not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal steps is the sum of the distances of all chips to the target position minus the maximum distance. \n\nBut in the first example, that gives 1, but the actual steps needed are 2. \n\nSo that's not working. \n\nPerhaps I should think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming as the original code is trying to do. \n\nThe code uses DP arrays dp1 and dp2, where dp1[i] is the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row1, and similarly for dp2[i]. \n\nThe transitions are based on moving from the previous column. \n\nThe initial code's loop for i from st+1 to ed:\n\nFor dp1[i], the code has an if condition missing. \n\nThe else part uses:\n\ndp1[i] = min( dp1[i-1] +1, dp2[i-1] +2 )\n\nThe if part uses:\n\nmin( dp1[i-1]+2, dp2[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe condition must be whether there is a chip in row1, i. \n\nBecause when there is a chip there, moving there would capture it, so the cost increases by 1. \n\nWait, the cost for moving from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) is normally 1. \n\nIf there is a chip there, then moving there would capture it, so the cost is still 1, but the existing chip is removed. \n\nSo why would the cost increase? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of a chip in row1, i means that you have to move there and capture it, so the cost is the same, but the code is considering that the existing chip must be accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, the code's DP is counting the number of chips remaining. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP[i][row] represents the minimum steps to have exactly one chip at column i in row, and all previous columns (before i) have been cleared. \n\nIn that case, the presence of a chip in row1, i means that you can choose to use that chip, so you don't have to move from the previous column. \n\nSo the cost would be the previous steps plus 0. \n\nBut how does that fit into the transitions? \n\nAlternatively, the presence of a chip in row1, i allows you to have an option where you don't move from the previous column. \n\nSo the cost would be the previous steps (up to i-1) plus 0. \n\nBut then the transitions would be:\n\ndp1[i] = min( previous options, (steps to clear up to i-1) + 0 )\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether there is a chip in the current cell (row1, i). \n\nIf there is, then the cost for moving from row1 (i-1) to row1 (i) is increased by 1 because you have to capture it. \n\nSo the cost becomes 1+1=2. \n\nHence, the condition is whether s1[i] is '*'. \n\nSo the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') \n\nThen the if block uses +2 and +2. \n\nThe else uses +1 and +2. \n\nThis would mean that when there is a chip in row1, i, the cost for moving from row1 (i-1) is increased by 1. \n\nThis would make sense because moving there captures the existing chip, so the move is still one step, but the existing chip is removed. \n\nBut why the cost increases by 1? \n\nPerhaps the code is counting the number of chips remaining. \n\nWait, the DP[i][row] must ensure that after moving to column i, there is exactly one chip. \n\nIf there was a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it, so the total chips remain one. \n\nThe cost is the previous steps plus the move cost. \n\nSo the presence of the chip doesn't change the cost. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct condition that would make the code work. \n\nThe code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe normal case (without the condition) would be:\n\ndp2[i] = min( dp2[i-1]+1, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nSo the difference is that when s1[i] is '*', the first term (from row2) is increased by 1. \n\nThis suggests that the condition for dp2[i] is whether there is a chip in row1, i. \n\nSo the code for dp2[i] is adding an extra cost when there is a chip in row1, i. \n\nThis implies that the condition for dp1[i] is whether there is a chip in row2, i. \n\nWait, but the code for dp1[i] is for row1. \n\nAlternatively, the condition for dp1[i] is whether there is a chip in row2, i. \n\nIf there is a chip in row2, i, then moving from row2 (i-1) to row1 (i) would require moving up and right, which is two steps, but also capturing the chip in row2, i. \n\nBut the cost for that path would be 2 (the move cost) plus any additional cost. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition for dp1[i] is whether there is a chip in row1, i. \n\nThe code for dp1[i] is:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') then the cost from row1 (i-1) is increased by 1. \n\nSo the cost becomes 2 instead of 1. \n\nThis would mean that the presence of a chip in row1, i adds an extra cost. \n\nPerhaps this is because the existing chip must be captured, so the move is still one step, but the existing chip is removed, so the total steps are the same. \n\nBut why the code increases the cost? \n\nAlternatively, the code is counting the number of chips remaining. \n\nIf there is a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it, so the previous chip must have been the only one. \n\nHence, the cost is the same. \n\nBut the code increases the cost by 1. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect, but the problem requires completing it. \n\nGiven the code's structure, the most logical condition is whether s1[i] is a '*' (there is a chip in row1, i). \n\nSo the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nif (s1[i] == '*') \n\nThen the if block uses +2 and +2. \n\nThe else uses +1 and +2. \n\nThis would explain the code's structure for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*'. \n\nSo I think the missing condition is (s1[i] == '*'). \n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in the condition as (s1[i] == '*'). \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') \n\nThus, the missing code is \"s1[i] == '*'\".\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i = st + 1; i <= ed; i ++){\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i - 1] + 2, dp2[i - 1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i - 1] + 1, dp2[i - 1] + 2);\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp2[i] = min(dp2[i - 1] + 2, dp1[i - 1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp2[i] = min(dp2[i - 1] + 1, dp1[i - 1] + 2);\n}\n\nWait, but the code for dp2[i] already has a condition based on s1[i]. \n\nWait, looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code for dp2[i] has:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*') dp2[i] = min(...);\nelse dp2[i] = min(...);\n\nSo the condition for dp2[i] is whether s1[i] is a '*'. \n\nBut the problem is that the current cell for dp2[i] is row2, i. \n\nThe presence of a chip in row1, i (s1[i] == '*') might affect the cost for moving to row2, i. \n\nHence, the condition for dp2[i] is whether there is a chip in row1, i. \n\nThis makes sense because moving to row2, i from row1 (i-1) would require moving down and right, which is two steps, but if there is a chip in row1, i, then moving there would capture it. \n\nBut the code's condition for dp2[i] is based on s1[i], which is row1's cell. \n\nSo the code's logic is that when there is a chip in row1, i, then moving to row2, i from row1 (i-1) would have a cost of 2 (down and right) plus possibly an extra step. \n\nBut the code for dp2[i] when s1[i] is '*' uses:\n\nmin( dp2[i-1]+2, dp1[i-1]+2 )\n\nThe first term is moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i) with cost 2 instead of 1. \n\nThis suggests that the presence of a chip in row1, i adds an extra cost to moving from row2 (i-1) to row2 (i). \n\nBut why? \n\nPerhaps because the chip in row1, i must be captured, so you have to move around it. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nHowever, given the code's structure and the problem's constraints, the most logical missing condition is whether s1[i] is a '*'. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"s1[i] == '*'\".\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the condition as (s1[i] == '*').\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif(s1[i] == '*')\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i = st + 1; i <= ed; i ++){\n    if(s1[i] == '*') \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 2, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n    else \n        dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp2[i-1] + 2);\n    // similar for dp2[i]\n}\n\nYes, this seems to be the correct condition."
