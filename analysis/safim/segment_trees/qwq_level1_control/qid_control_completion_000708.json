The current code's third condition is else if( ... ) and then it outputs division 3. So what condition would trigger that? The existing code structure is:\n\nif (x >=1900) \u2192 div1\n\nelse if (x >=1600) \u2192 div2\n\nelse if ( ... ) \u2192 div3\n\nelse \u2192 div4. So after the first two conditions, if we are in the else if for division3, the x must be less than 1600. So the condition for division3 is 1400 \u2264 x \u22641599. So the condition here should be x >=1400. Because if x is less than 1600 but >=1400, then it's division3. Then the else (division4) would be for x <1400, which matches the problem's division4 condition (rating \u22641399). So the third condition should be 1400 <=x. Because if x is 1400, it's division3, and if it's 1399, then it goes to else (division4). Therefore, the missing code in the else if is (1400 <=x). So the line would be else if(x >=1400) or 1400 <=x. Either way is fine. Let me check the code's existing style. The first conditions use 1900<=x, so maybe follow that style. So \"1400 <=x\". So the third condition is else if(1400 <= x) then division3. Then the else is division4. That should cover all cases. Testing some examples:\n\nFor example, the note says that 1399 is division4. Let's see:\n\nx=1399: \n\n1900? no.\n\n1600? 1399 <1600 \u2192 no.\n\n1400 <=x? 1399 is less than 1400 \u2192 no. So goes to else, division4. Correct.\n\n1400: 1400 <=x \u2192 yes. So division3. Correct.\n\n1599: same, yes, division3.\n\n1600: that's division2. So yes, the code works. What about x=1300? It would go to else if(1400 <=x is no, so else division4. Which matches the note. So the code should be filled with \"1400 <=x\".",
