The 'ins' array is the out-degree of the original node. The code's dijkstra function is trying to compute d[u], which is the minimal days required to reach n from u. The edge weight here is ins[ver[i]], which is the out-degree of the original node (the 'y' in the original edge). Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can ensure they meet after at most d days. The key here is understanding how the messages work each day. Each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly selects a reachable city (based on the remaining roads) and moves there. The goal is to find the smallest d where they can guarantee meeting at city n within d days, no matter what choices Keshi makes when moving.\n\nHmm, the approach probably involves some graph traversal where we model the optimal strategy for AmShZ. Since AmShZ can choose which roads to block and when to tell Keshi to move, the problem might be transformed into finding the shortest path in some way, but with some constraints.\n\nWait, the problem requires the minimal d such that no matter how Keshi chooses his moves (when told to move), they will reach n within d days. So we need a strategy that works regardless of Keshi's choices. That suggests that the path must be forced in a way that even the worst-case choices lead to n in d days.\n\nLet me think of the problem in reverse. Since AmShZ can block roads, maybe we can model this as a shortest path problem where each step can either block a road or move. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as finding the minimal number of steps where each \"step\" can be a day where either a road is blocked or Keshi moves. The key is that AmShZ can choose the order of blocking roads and moving such that the path is forced.\n\nWait, the problem says that each day starts with AmShZ sending a message. So each day is either a block or a move. The days are sequential. The strategy must choose each day's action (block or move) such that after d days, Keshi is guaranteed to be at n.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n in some transformed graph. Or maybe it's related to the number of edges on the shortest path, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when Keshi moves, he can choose any outgoing edge (that's not blocked yet). So to force him to reach n asap, AmShZ must block all other paths except the one leading directly to n. But how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to a game where AmShZ wants to minimize the days, and Keshi (when moving) might take the worst possible path. So we need to find the minimal d such that, regardless of Keshi's choices when moving, the path can be forced within d days.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm. Since the problem requires the minimal days, perhaps we can model the state as the current city and the set of blocked roads, but that's probably too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a shortest path problem where each node's distance is the minimal number of days required to reach n from that node. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we model the problem in reverse: starting from n, and trying to find the minimal steps required to reach 1. Because AmShZ can choose to block roads, perhaps the distance from a node u to n is the minimal number of days required, considering that each move can take one day (if AmShZ chooses to move) and blocking roads can be done on other days.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to model the problem as the maximum number of edges on any path from 1 to n. Because each time you have to block all other edges except one, so the number of days would be the number of edges on the path plus the number of blocks needed. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as needing to be either used or blocked. Since when moving, Keshi can choose any available edge, so to force him along a certain path, AmShZ must block all other edges. So for a path of length k, you need to block all edges not on the path. The number of days would be the number of edges on the path (since each move takes a day) plus the number of blocked edges (each block takes a day). But that might not be optimal.\n\nWait, but each day can be either a block or a move. So for a path of length k, you need to have k moves (each taking a day) and the number of blocked edges (each taking a day). The total days would be k + (total edges not on the path). But that's probably too much. Because maybe you can interleave blocking and moving.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum, over all paths from 1 to n, of the number of edges in the path. Because in the worst case, Keshi might take the longest possible path, but AmShZ can block other edges to force him along a shorter path. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be equivalent to finding the minimal number of days such that there exists a path from 1 to n where each step along the path can be enforced by blocking other edges. The minimal d would then be the length of the path plus the number of edges not on the path that need to be blocked. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a shortest path where each node's distance is the minimal number of days required to reach n from that node. Let me think of the state as the current city and the set of available roads. But that's too big.\n\nWait, the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choices when moving, the process must end in d days. So the strategy must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes (when moving), he will reach n within d days. So the strategy must block all possible alternative paths except one, and the path must be of minimal length.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path from 1 to n. Because if there's a path of length k, then AmShZ can block all other edges not on this path, and then tell Keshi to move k times. But how many days would that take?\n\nWait, each day can be either a block or a move. So to block m edges, you need m days. But that's not feasible if m is large. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the concept of \"dial\" where each edge has a cost, and we need to find the minimal days. Let me think of the problem in terms of Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nLooking at the code provided, it's using Dijkstra's algorithm. The code has a dijkstra function that initializes d array to infinity, then sets d[s] to 0, and uses a priority queue. The add function adds edges in reverse (since it's adding y to x's adjacency list, perhaps because the code is processing in reverse? Like from n to 1?)\n\nWait, in the code, the main function reads m edges, and for each edge (x,y), it adds an edge y -> x in the adjacency list. So the adjacency list is built for the reverse graph. Because the add function is called as add(y, x). So the code is building the reverse graph, where edges are reversed. Then, in the dijkstra function, it's processing from n (since the main calls dijkstra(n)), and the distance d[1] is printed. So perhaps the code is trying to compute the shortest path from n to 1 in the reverse graph, which would correspond to the original graph's path from 1 to n.\n\nHmm, but what's the meaning of the 'ins' array? The code initializes ins[x]++ for each edge (x,y). So ins[x] is the in-degree of x in the original graph? Or the number of incoming edges to x? Wait, no. Let me see: for each original edge (v_i, u_i), which is a directed edge from v_i to u_i. The code adds an edge y = u_i to x = v_i's adjacency list. So in the reverse graph, the edge is from u_i to v_i. So the adjacency list for the reverse graph is built correctly. The ins array is initialized as for each original edge (v_i, u_i), ins[v_i] is incremented. Because in the loop, for each edge (x,y) (original v and u?), the code does ins[x]++. Wait, the input is read as x and y, which are v_i and u_i. So for each original edge v_i -> u_i, the code adds an edge from u_i to v_i in the reverse graph. And ins[x] is incremented, where x is v_i. So ins[v_i] is the number of outgoing edges from v_i in the original graph? Or the in-degree?\n\nWait, ins[x] is being incremented for each edge (v_i, u_i) where x is v_i. So ins[v_i] counts the number of edges starting at v_i. So ins[x] is the out-degree of x in the original graph.\n\nIn the dijkstra function, for each edge in the adjacency list (which is the reverse graph's edges), the code has a loop over the edges from x (current node) to y (the ver[i] in the adjacency list). Wait, the adjacency list for x in the reverse graph contains edges pointing to y, which in the original graph were edges from y to x. So the code is processing the reverse graph.\n\nThe code's dijkstra function is trying to compute something. The line \"z=ins[ver[i]]\" \u2014 ver[i] is the y in the adjacency list, which is the original edge's v_i. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe code's add function is called with add(y, x), where the original edge is v_i to u_i. So in the code's variables, x is v_i, y is u_i. So the add(y, x) adds an edge from u_i to v_i in the adjacency list. So the adjacency list for the reverse graph is built correctly. The ver array holds the destination nodes of the reverse edges. So for each node x in the reverse graph, the edges in its adjacency list are the nodes that can reach x in the original graph.\n\nNow, in the dijkstra function, for each edge from x to y (in the reverse graph), which corresponds to an original edge from y to x. The code has a line \"z = ins[ver[i]]\". Wait, ver[i] is the destination of the reverse edge, which is y (the original edge's start node). So ins[ver[i]] is the out-degree of y in the original graph. Hmm, not sure.\n\nThe code's current setup is trying to compute d[1], which is the distance from n (since the dijkstra is called with n as the source) to 1 in the reverse graph. But what's the edge weight here?\n\nLooking at the code's dijkstra function, the edge's weight is 'z', which is set to ins[ver[i]]. The 'ins' array is the out-degree of the original node (since ins[x] counts the number of edges starting at x in the original graph). So for each edge in the reverse graph (from x to y in reverse, which is original y to x), the weight is the out-degree of y (the original start node of the edge).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a shortest path where each edge's weight is the out-degree of the original node. But I'm not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that for each node, the minimal number of days required to reach n is the maximum between the current distance and (distance of next node plus 1 or something). Because when moving, Keshi can choose any outgoing edge, so to ensure that regardless of his choice, the path must be forced.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: For each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u is equal to the maximum over all possible edges from u of (1 + the minimal days required from the next node). Because when you choose to move, Keshi can pick any outgoing edge, so you have to account for the worst case (the maximum of the next nodes' days plus 1). However, AmShZ can block edges, so perhaps the minimal days is the minimal over all subsets of edges (blocked edges) such that the remaining edges form a path where the path's length plus the number of blocked edges is minimized. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block an edge (thereby removing it from the graph) or let Keshi move. The goal is to reach n in as few days as possible, regardless of Keshi's choices when moving. The minimal d is the minimal number of days required such that there exists a strategy (sequence of blocks and moves) that ensures Keshi reaches n in d days no matter his choices.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the minimal days required for a node u is the minimal number of days such that either:\n\n- There is an edge from u to n, so AmShZ can choose to move (taking 1 day) and Keshi will reach n.\n\n- Or, for all edges from u, the minimal days required for each next node plus 1 (for the move day) plus the number of edges blocked (each taking a day) must be considered. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming where for each node u, the value d[u] is the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. The recurrence would be:\n\nd[u] = 1 + max_{v in neighbors of u} d[v]\n\nBecause when you choose to move, Keshi can choose any neighbor v, so you have to take the maximum of all possible d[v], then add 1 day for the move. However, AmShZ can block edges before moving. Wait, but blocking edges can be done on other days. So perhaps the blocking can be used to reduce the number of options Keshi has, thereby reducing the maximum.\n\nAh, right! The key is that AmShZ can choose which edges to block. So for node u, AmShZ can decide to block all edges except one, so that when Keshi moves, he has to take that path. Therefore, the minimal days would be the minimal over all possible edges (u -> v) of (number of blocks needed to remove other edges + 1 (for the move) + d[v]). But the number of blocks needed would be the number of edges from u minus 1 (since you can leave one edge unblocked). However, each block takes a day. So the total days would be (number of edges from u - 1) + 1 + d[v]. But this might not be optimal because you can interleave blocking and moving.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal days for node u is the minimal over all edges (u -> v) of (d[v] + 1 + (out_degree(u) - 1)), but that would be if you block all other edges first, then move. But that's probably not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal days can be computed as follows: For each node u, the minimal days is 1 (for the move) plus the maximum of the days required for each outgoing edge's destination. Because if you don't block any edges, then Keshi could choose the worst path. But by blocking edges, you can reduce the options. So the optimal strategy is to block all edges except the one with the minimal d[v], so that Keshi is forced to take that path. Thus, the minimal days would be 1 (the move day) plus the minimal d[v] among all outgoing edges. But then why the blocking?\n\nWait, perhaps the blocking can be done on previous days. So the idea is that for each node u, the minimal days required is the minimal over all edges (u -> v) of (d[v] + 1 + (number of edges blocked before choosing this edge)). But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a shortest path problem where each edge has a weight of 1 (for the move) plus the number of edges you have to block to eliminate other options. But this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, let's think of it in terms of the reverse graph. The code provided is using Dijkstra's algorithm on the reverse graph. The 'ins' array is the out-degree of the original node. The code's dijkstra function is trying to compute d[u], which is the minimal days required to reach n from u. The edge weight here is ins[ver[i]], which is the out-degree of the original node (the 'y' in the original edge). \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: For each node u, the minimal days required to reach n is the maximum between the current value and (d[v] + 1), where v is a predecessor in the reverse graph. Because in the reverse graph, edges point from n towards 1. So the distance from n to u in this setup would represent the minimal days required. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current setup might be trying to compute the maximum number of edges in any path from u to n. Because if you have to take the longest path, then the days required would be the length of that path. But why would that be the case?\n\nWait, the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choices when moving, the process must end in d days. So the worst-case scenario is when Keshi takes the longest possible path. Therefore, the minimal d must be the length of the longest path from 1 to n. But that can't be right because the problem allows AmShZ to block edges to shorten the path.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can block all other edges not on the shortest path, so that Keshi has no choice but to take that path. The number of days would be the number of edges in the path (each move takes a day) plus the number of edges blocked (each block takes a day). But that would be path_length + (total_edges - path_length). Which is total_edges, which is not optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal days is the number of edges in the shortest path. Because AmShZ can block all other edges, but the blocking can be done on the same days as moving. For example, each day can be a move, and the blocking is done on the same day as a move? No, because each day is either a block or a move.\n\nWait, each day is either a block or a move. So to block an edge, you have to spend a day on that. So if the shortest path has k edges, then you need to block all edges not on the path. Suppose there are m edges not on the path. Then the total days would be k (for the moves) plus m (for the blocks). But that's way too big. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the minimal days is the maximum, over all nodes, of the number of outgoing edges. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: Each time you are at a node u, you can choose to block an edge (taking a day) or move (taking a day). To ensure that Keshi reaches n asap, the strategy must choose to block edges that are not on the optimal path. The minimal days would be the number of edges on the path plus the number of edges that need to be blocked along the way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to the problem where each node's contribution to the path is 1 plus the maximum of its children. Because when you move, Keshi can choose any outgoing edge, so you have to account for the worst case. But blocking edges can reduce the options. So the minimal days for node u is 1 (for the move) plus the maximum of the days required for each outgoing edge. But since you can block edges, you can choose to block all edges except the one with the minimal days. Thus, the minimal days would be 1 + (minimal days among the outgoing edges). But then why the blocking?\n\nWait, if you can block edges, then you can choose to block all edges except the one leading to the minimal days. So the days would be 1 (the move) plus the minimal days of the chosen edge's destination. But how does blocking factor into this?\n\nAh, perhaps the blocking can be done in parallel. For example, you can block edges on days when you are not moving. So the total days would be the number of edges in the path plus the number of edges you need to block along the way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a game where each node u has a certain number of choices (edges), and the minimal days required is the maximum over all possible paths from u to n, but with the ability to block edges. The minimal days would be the minimal over all possible strategies (blocking sequences) of the maximum path length in the remaining graph.\n\nHmm, this is getting too abstract. Let me look back at the code provided. The code is using Dijkstra's algorithm on the reverse graph, with edge weights being the out-degree of the original node. The distance array is initialized to infinity, and the code is trying to compute d[1], which is the distance from n to 1 in this setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: For each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n is equal to the out-degree of u plus the minimal days of the next node. Because each time you have to block all other edges except one, which takes (out_degree - 1) days, then move (1 day), so total (out_degree) days plus the next node's days. But that would be the case if you have to block all other edges first before moving. But maybe you can interleave blocking and moving.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal days for node u is 1 (for the move) plus the maximum of the days required for each outgoing edge. Because if you don't block any edges, then Keshi could choose the worst path. To prevent that, you have to block all edges except the one with the minimal days. So the days would be 1 (the move) plus the minimal days of the next node. But then why the out-degree?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is correct. Let me think again. The code's dijkstra function is using the out-degree of the original node (the 'y' in the original edge, which is the predecessor in the reverse graph). The edge weight is ins[ver[i]], which is the out-degree of y. \n\nWait, in the code's dijkstra function, for each edge from x to y in the reverse graph (which corresponds to an original edge from y to x), the code is considering the weight as ins[ver[i]] which is ins[y], the out-degree of y in the original graph. \n\nThe code's dijkstra is trying to find the shortest path from n to 1 in this weighted graph. The distance d[u] would then be the sum of the weights along the path. \n\nWhat does this represent? Let's see. Suppose the path in the reverse graph is n \u2192 a \u2192 b \u2192 ... \u2192 1. Each edge in this path corresponds to an original edge from a to n, b to a, etc. The weight of each edge in the reverse path is the out-degree of the original node (the 'y' in the original edge, which is the predecessor in the reverse path). \n\nHmm, perhaps the weight represents the number of edges that need to be blocked at that node. For example, when you are at node y (original), you have out-degree ins[y]. To force Keshi to take the path to x (the next node in the reverse path), you need to block all other edges except the one leading to x. That requires (ins[y] - 1) days of blocking. Then, you spend 1 day to move. So total days for this step would be (ins[y] - 1) + 1 = ins[y]. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So for each edge in the reverse path (which corresponds to an original edge from y to x), the cost is ins[y], which is the out-degree of y. This represents the number of days needed to handle that edge: you have to block all other edges from y except the one leading to x (taking ins[y] - 1 days), then move (1 day). So total ins[y] days for this step. \n\nTherefore, the total days required for the path is the sum of the out-degrees of all the nodes along the path (except the last node?), but in the reverse direction. \n\nWait, the path in the reverse graph is from n to 1. Each step in the reverse path corresponds to an original edge from y to x. The cost for that edge is ins[y], the out-degree of y. So the total cost of the path is the sum of ins[y] for each node y along the path (except the starting node n? Or including all nodes except the end?).\n\nWait, the path in the reverse graph is n \u2192 a \u2192 b \u2192 ... \u2192 1. Each edge in this path is from a to n's predecessor, etc. Wait, perhaps each edge in the reverse path corresponds to an original edge from the next node to the current node. So for each edge in the reverse path (from x to y in the reverse graph), the original edge is y \u2192 x. The cost is ins[y], which is the out-degree of y in the original graph. \n\nSo the total cost for the path is the sum of ins[y] for each node y along the path except the last node (since the last node is 1, and there's no further step). \n\nWait, the path starts at n and ends at 1. Each edge in the path is from the current node to the next node in the reverse path. For each such edge, the cost is ins[y], where y is the original node (the 'y' in the original edge y \u2192 x). \n\nTherefore, the total cost is the sum of ins[y] for each node y along the path except the last node (since the last node is 1, and there's no outgoing edge after that). \n\nWait, but the last node in the path is 1. So the edges in the path are from n to a, a to b, ..., up to the node before 1. So the sum would include all nodes except 1. \n\nThe minimal such sum over all possible paths from n to 1 in the reverse graph would give the minimal days required. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is to compute the shortest path from n to 1 in the reverse graph, where each edge's weight is the out-degree of the original node (the 'y' in the original edge y \u2192 x). The distance d[1] would then be the minimal total days required. \n\nThis makes sense. So the code is almost correct, but there's a missing condition in the Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nLooking at the code's Dijkstra function:\n\nIn the loop over the edges from x (current node in reverse graph), for each edge to y (the next node in reverse graph), which corresponds to an original edge y \u2192 x. \n\nThe code has a comment: // TODO: Your code here. The condition for relaxing the edge is missing. \n\nThe condition should be: if d[y] > d[x] + z (where z is the weight, which is ins[y]). \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n    d[y] = d[x] + z, q.push(...);\n\nSo the missing condition is whether the new distance (d[x] + z) is better than the current d[y]. Since this is a Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, the condition should be if (d[y] > d[x] + z). \n\nWait, but in the code, the priority queue is a max-heap (since it's a priority_queue<pii> which by default is max-heap, and the stored value is -d[y], so the smallest distance is popped first). Wait, the code uses a priority queue of pairs, stored as (distance, node). But in the code, the distance is stored as negative, so the priority queue is a max-heap, but the smallest distance is considered first. \n\nWait, the code's dijkstra function initializes d[s] = 0, then pushes (0, s). The priority queue is a max-heap, so the top element has the largest priority. But since the distance is stored as negative, the element with the smallest distance (most negative) is at the top. \n\nWait, the code uses q.push(mp(-d[y], y)), so the priority is -d[y]. The priority queue is a max-heap, so the element with the smallest distance (most negative) is popped first. That's correct for Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nSo the condition for relaxing the edge is if the new distance (d[x] + z) is less than the current d[y]. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif (d[y] > d[x] + z) \n\nSo the code should check if the new distance is better than the current one. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nif (d[y] > d[x] + z)\n\nSo the line would be:\n\nif (d[y] > d[x] + z) \n\nThen, the code proceeds to update d[y] and push to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply that condition. \n\nLet me check the code again. The code's dijkstra function has:\n\nfor each edge from x (current node in reverse graph) to y (next node in reverse graph):\n\nz = ins[ver[i]] (which is ins[y], since ver[i] is the destination in the reverse edge, which is y in the original edge y \u2192 x).\n\nThen, the code checks if d[y] can be updated. \n\nYes, so the missing condition is exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (d[y] > d[x] + z)\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (d[y] > d[x] + z) \n\nThat's the missing line."
