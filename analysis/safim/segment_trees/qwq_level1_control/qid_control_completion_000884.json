Wait, perhaps the problem allows two same colors as long as they are not adjacent. Wait, but the example's final string has two B's adjacent. Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for the correct conditions again. The key is that every non-W cell must be part of a pair that was stamped. Each pair must be set to R and B or B and R. \n\nThus, the colors of adjacent non-W must alternate. Therefore, the condition is that in the target string, any two adjacent non-W must be different. Additionally, every run of non-W must have at least one R and one B. So the two conditions are: \n\n1. No two adjacent non-W are the same. 2. Every run of non-W has at least one R and one B. \n\nThe first condition ensures that the colors alternate. The second ensures that the run isn't all R or all B. \n\nThus, the code must check both conditions. The current code's variables r and b track condition 2.",

How could that happen? Suppose the last stamp was applied on positions 2-3, setting them to B and B? No, because each stamp must set them to R and B or B and R. Ah! So that's impossible. Therefore, the example must have a different final string. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the example.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the correct condition for the TODO part in the code. Let's see what the problem is asking. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B, and can be applied multiple times. \n\nHmm, the code provided is a starting point, but the TODO is in the loop where each character is processed. Let's think about the logic here. The current code tracks whether we've seen R or B so far (using variables r and b, which are 0 or 1). But maybe that's not sufficient. \n\nWait, the problem allows stamping any two neighboring cells any number of times. Each stamp affects exactly two adjacent cells, flipping them to R and B in some order. But since each stamp can be applied multiple times, overlapping, the key is to find a pattern that can be formed through these operations. \n\nLet me think of the constraints. The main thing is that any non-white cell must be part of a pair that was stamped. Also, since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the sequence of non-white cells must follow some pattern. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that between any two non-white cells, there can't be a situation where a single W is between them? Or maybe the non-white cells must form a certain kind of sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that every R and B must be part of a pair. Let me think of the conditions that would make the string impossible. \n\nFor example, if there's a single R or B not part of a pair? Like, if the string has an isolated R or B (not adjacent to another non-W?), then it's impossible. \n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied multiple times. So even if a cell is stamped multiple times, it can change colors. Hmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the sequence of non-W characters must alternate between R and B in some way. Because each stamp adds either RB or BR. So the non-W parts must form a sequence where each pair of consecutive non-W must be either R followed by B or B followed by R. But since overlapping stamps can affect this, maybe the entire string's non-W parts must form a pattern where no two same colors are adjacent except when separated by W? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down as follows: \n\nThe entire string must satisfy that any occurrence of a non-W character must be part of a pair (either R and B next to each other, but considering that overlapping stamps can create sequences). Wait, maybe the key is that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W characters are either R and B or B and R. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. \n\nWait, but when you stamp over existing cells, you can change their colors. For example, if you have a pair that was previously stamped as RB, then stamping again on the same pair would turn them into BR, or maybe another combination. Wait, no. Each stamp must set the two cells to R and B in some order. So each time you apply the stamp, you can choose the order (RB or BR). \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: the final string must be such that every non-W cell is part of at least one pair (with a neighbor) that is either R and B. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The order can be chosen each time. So, the final colors of each cell depend on the number of times they were stamped and the choices made each time. \n\nBut since each stamp on a pair flips both cells, maybe the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped matters. Wait, perhaps each cell's color is determined by the number of times it was under the stamp. Let me think: \n\nEach time a cell is stamped (as part of a pair), its color is set to either R or B, depending on the stamp's orientation. But since each stamp can be applied in either direction, maybe the color can be chosen each time. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the sequence of non-W must form a pattern where every two consecutive non-W must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. \n\nWait, for example, if the desired string is RBR, then that's possible. Let's see: \n\nStart with WWW. \n\nStamp positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 RBW. Then stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 RBR. So that works. \n\nBut if the desired string is RRR, that's impossible. Because each stamp can only create one R and one B in a pair. So having three R's in a row would require that each adjacent pair has an R and B, but that's not possible. \n\nAnother example: the string RBRB is okay. \n\nBut a string like RBB would be problematic. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the desired string is R B B. \n\nHow could that be formed? Let's see. \n\nSuppose first stamp at positions 0-1 as R B \u2192 RBW. Then stamp at 1-2 as B R \u2192 RBR. But that gives RBR, not RBB. Alternatively, maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 1-2 as B R \u2192 WB R. Then stamp at 0-1 as R B \u2192 R B R. Still not getting the two B's. \n\nHmm, so RBB would require that the second and third cells are both B. But each stamp on positions 1-2 would set them to either RB or BR. So to have two B's, perhaps it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that any two adjacent non-W must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but the problem allows overlapping stamps. So maybe the entire sequence of non-W must form an alternating pattern of R and B. \n\nWait, but the example given in the problem's first test case is B R B B W. Wait, the final string is B R B B W. Let me see that example. \n\nWait the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me check the steps:\n\nThe steps were:\n\nStart with WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in W W R B W. \n\nThen stamp at 0-1 as BR (so B R) \u2192 B R R B W. Wait, but the next step in the example's explanation is the second step leading to B R R B W? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the example's steps. \n\nWait the example's explanation says:\n\nThe first step is WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W (so positions 3-4?), then the next step is applying the stamp on 0-1 as BR (so B R) \u2192 so the first two are BR, then the third is R (from previous stamp?), then B and W. Wait, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me see how that is possible. \n\nThe third step in the example's explanation is applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (the R and B?), turning them into RB or BR. Wait, perhaps the third step is stamping positions 1-2 as RB, so the sequence becomes B (from first stamp), then R (from first stamp?), then after the third stamp, the 1-2 positions would be R and B. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. \n\nTherefore, the condition for the string to be possible is that: \n\n- All W's can be anywhere, but between any two non-W characters, there must not be a situation where two same colors are adjacent (except when separated by W). \n\nWait, but the non-W parts must form a sequence where each pair of consecutive non-W must be R and B or B and R. \n\nWait, but the W's can be in between. For example, if the string is R W B, that's okay because the R and B are separated by a W. But if it's R B, that's okay. \n\nWait, but the problem allows the stamps to be applied anywhere. So the non-W parts can be in any positions as long as their sequence (ignoring W's) alternates between R and B. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to check that in the entire string, any two consecutive non-W characters must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but how do we handle the W's in between? \n\nAlternatively, the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W are different. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. \n\nWait, but if there are two non-W separated by a W, like R W B, then they are not adjacent, so that's okay. \n\nSo the key is that in the entire string, any two consecutive non-W must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, but let's think of the example given in the problem's first test case: the final string is B R B B W. \n\nLooking at the non-W parts: B R B B. \n\nThe sequence here is B followed by R (okay), then R followed by B (okay), then B followed by B (problem). So that would violate the condition. But according to the problem's example, that is a valid case. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait the example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So according to that, two B's in a row are allowed. But according to the previous logic, that would be invalid. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, let me look at the example again. The example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait, how was that achieved? The steps were:\n\nFirst stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in WW RB W \u2192 so positions 3 and 4 are R and B. \n\nThen the second stamp is applied at 0-1, making BR \u2192 so first two are B R. \n\nThird step: stamp at positions 1-2 (the R and the next W?), but in the example's third step, they stamp on positions 1-2 (the R and the next cell which was W?), but after the second step, the third character was R (from the first stamp?), maybe I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nHmm, so how is that possible? Let me think of the steps again. \n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on positions 3-4 (RB) \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 then second stamp on 0-1 (BR) \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nWait the second step's result is B R R B W? Or perhaps the second stamp is applied on 0-1, turning them into BR. So the first two are B and R, then the third is R (from the first stamp?), then B and W. \n\nThen the third step is applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require turning them into either RB or BR. \n\nWait, the third step in the example's explanation is applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would turn them into either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but in the example's third step, the result is B R B B W. So after the third stamp, the third character becomes B. \n\nHmm, perhaps the third stamp was applied on positions 2-3 (the R and B?), turning them into BR or RB. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. But the key point is that the final string has two B's in a row, which according to my previous logic would be invalid, but the example says it's possible. \n\nSo my previous idea is wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to think of another approach. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The order can be chosen each time. \n\nThe final colors of each cell depend on the number of times they were stamped and the choices made. \n\nWait, but each time a cell is stamped (as part of a pair), its color is set to either R or B, depending on the stamp's orientation. So each stamp on a pair can overwrite the previous colors. \n\nTherefore, the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that affected it. \n\nWait, because each stamp overwrites the colors. So, for example, if a cell is part of multiple stamps, the last stamp's choice determines its color. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to whether the target string can be formed by a series of such stamps, where each stamp's choice (RB or BR) for a pair can be chosen such that the final colors match. \n\nHmm, so the key is that for every pair of adjacent cells in the target string, they must be either RB or BR, or at least one of them is W. \n\nWait, no. Because a pair of cells can be set by a stamp, but if they are not adjacent to any other non-W cells, maybe they can be set. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are: \n\n1. Any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. \n\nBecause if two adjacent non-W cells are the same (like RR or BB), then there's no way to have a stamp that set them to that. Because each stamp on those two cells would have to set them to RB or BR. \n\nWait, but if two adjacent cells are both R, then that's impossible. Because the last stamp that affected them must have set them to either RB or BR. So they can't both be R. \n\nAh! So that's the key. \n\nSo the condition is that in the target string, there are no two adjacent non-W cells that are the same. \n\nWait, but what about a single non-W cell? \n\nLike, if the string is R followed by W, then that's okay. Because the R could have been set by a stamp that included it and the next cell (W, but then the next cell would have been changed to B or R. Wait, but the next cell is W, which is white. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows the cells to be set to R or B even if they were previously white. \n\nWait, the initial state is all white. Each stamp changes two adjacent cells to either R and B or B and R. \n\nSo, for a single non-W cell (like R), it must have been part of a stamp that included it and its neighbor. But the neighbor must have been set to the opposite color. \n\nWait, but if there's a single R in the string, then that R must have been part of a pair with a B. But the B would have to be adjacent. \n\nWait, for example, if the target is R followed by W, then that's impossible. Because the R must have been set by a stamp on positions 0 and 1. The first cell (0) is R, so the second (1) must be B. But in the target, it's W. So that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, any single non-W cell must have a neighbor that is non-W and of the opposite color. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n- All non-W cells must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W are either R and B or B and R. \n\n- Additionally, any non-W cell must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nWait, but how do we handle the edges? \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must satisfy that between any two non-W cells, there are no two same colors in a row. \n\nSo the necessary conditions are: \n\n1. For every pair of adjacent cells in the target string, if both are non-W, then they must be R and B or B and R. \n\n2. Additionally, the entire sequence of non-W must form a valid chain where this holds. \n\nWait, but the first condition covers that. \n\nSo the first condition is that in the target string, there are no two adjacent non-W cells that are the same. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string must not have any isolated non-W cells (i.e., a non-W cell with both neighbors being W, except at the ends). Wait, but maybe that's allowed as long as the adjacent non-W are okay. \n\nWait, let's think of the example given in the problem's first test case: the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait, in that string, the third and fourth characters are B and B. So they are adjacent and same, which would violate the condition. But according to the problem's example, that is a valid case. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's example. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W. Here the final string is B R B B W. Wait, but the third and fourth characters are B and B. So according to the condition I thought of, this would be invalid. But the example says it is possible. \n\nSo my previous reasoning is wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows two same colors to be adjacent as long as they were set by different stamps. \n\nWait, let's look at the example's steps. \n\nThe third step in the example's explanation is applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (the R and B?), turning them into RB or BR. \n\nWait, let me retrace the steps: \n\nFirst step: stamp at positions 3-4 (0-based?), resulting in WW RB W \u2192 so positions 3 is R, 4 is B. \n\nSecond step: stamp at 0-1 \u2192 BR, so first two are B R. \n\nThird step: stamp at positions 1-2 (the R and the third cell, which was W?), but after the second step, the third cell (position 2) was W? \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me think of the example's steps again. \n\nThe example's first step: \n\nStart with WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based), the string becomes WW RB W \u2192 so positions 3 and 4 are R and B. \n\nSecond step: stamp on 0-1 \u2192 so positions 0 and 1 become BR (B and R). So the string is B R R B W. \n\nWait, but then the third step is stamping on positions 1-2 (R and R?), which can't be done because they are the same. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step is stamping on positions 2-3 (the R and B?), turning them into BR or RB. \n\nWait, let's see the third step's result: \n\nThe third step's result is B R B B W. \n\nSo after the second step, the string was B R R B W. \n\nThen, the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (the R and B?), which are currently R and B. \n\nIf you stamp them again, you can choose to set them to either RB or BR. \n\nIf you choose BR, then the R (position 2) becomes B, and the B (position 3) becomes R. \n\nWait, but that would make the third and fourth characters B and R. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied on positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require that they are set to RB or BR. But they are both R, so that's impossible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W is a mistake, but according to the problem's note, it's a valid case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial approach is wrong. \n\nLet me think of another way. \n\nEach stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that any non-W cell must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nWait, but how to model this. \n\nAnother idea: the entire string must be such that every non-W cell is part of a pair of adjacent non-W cells, except possibly at the ends. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final string can be formed if and only if: \n\n- All W's can be anywhere. \n\n- The non-W parts form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W are either R and B or B and R. \n\nWait, but the example contradicts this. \n\nWait, in the example's final string, there are two B's in a row. So that would violate this condition. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the example's final string is different. Let me recheck the problem's example. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W. Here the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait, the third step's result is B R B B W. \n\nWait, the third step's stamp is applied on positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require that they are set to RB or BR. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (the R and B?), which were R and B. \n\nIf you stamp them again, you can choose to set them to BR or RB. \n\nSuppose you choose BR: then the R (position 2) becomes B, and the B (position 3) becomes R. \n\nSo the string after that would be B R B R W. \n\nHmm, that's not the example's result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied on positions 0-1 (B and R), which are already B and R. \n\nStamping them again would allow changing them to RB or BR. \n\nIf you choose BR, then they become R and B. \n\nSo the first two would be R B, then the rest as before. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W is a mistake, but according to the problem's note, it's valid. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem differently. \n\nLet me think of the conditions that must be met for the answer to be \"YES\". \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one pair (with a neighbor) that is either R and B or B and R. \n\nWait, but how to ensure that. \n\nAlternatively, the entire string must not have any occurrence of two same non-W characters in a row. \n\nWait, but the example has two B's in a row, so that would be a problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is different. Let me recheck the problem's description. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W. Here the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait, the third step's result is B R B B W. \n\nWait, the third step's stamp is applied on positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require that they are set to RB or BR. \n\nWait, perhaps the second step's result is B R R B W. \n\nThen, the third step's stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (R and B). \n\nIf you choose to stamp them as BR, then the R (position 2) becomes B, and the B (position 3) becomes R. \n\nSo the string becomes B R B R W. \n\nHmm, that's not the example's result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (R and B) as RB. \n\nThen, the R (position 2) becomes R, and the B (position 3) becomes B. \n\nWait, but that would leave them as R and B, so the string would be B R R B W \u2192 after the third step, it's B R (position 2 is R, position 3 is B?), so no change. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: \n\nEach stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application changes two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe final colors are the result of all these operations. \n\nThe key is that any non-W cell must have been set by a stamp. \n\nWait, but W means the cell was never changed, or was changed back to white? \n\nNo, because each stamp changes the cells to either R or B. So a cell can only be white if it was never stamped. \n\nAh! That's an important point. \n\nBecause every time a cell is stamped (as part of a pair), it is set to either R or B. So, a cell can only be white if it was never stamped. \n\nTherefore, the white cells must be those that were never part of any stamp. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n\nThe target string must be such that all non-W cells are covered by some set of overlapping pairs (each pair is two adjacent cells), and for each such pair, the two cells are set to R and B in some order. \n\nAdditionally, the white cells must not be part of any such pair. \n\nWait, but the white cells can be part of a pair only if they were stamped, but then they would no longer be white. \n\nSo the white cells must not be part of any stamp's pair. \n\nTherefore, the non-W cells must form a set of intervals where each interval is covered by overlapping pairs, and each pair's two cells are R and B in some order. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the white cells must be such that between any two non-W cells, there must be at least one white cell. Or not? \n\nWait, no. Because two non-W cells can be adjacent, as long as they are part of a pair that was stamped. \n\nWait, but if two non-W cells are adjacent, then they must have been part of a stamp that set them to R and B. \n\nSo their colors must be different. \n\nAh! So the key condition is that any two adjacent non-W cells must be different (R and B or B and R). \n\nBut in the example's final string, there are two B's in a row. So that would violate this condition. \n\nBut the example says it's possible. \n\nHmm, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's final string. Let me recheck the problem's example. \n\nThe problem says the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. So they are adjacent and same. \n\nThis would violate the condition that adjacent non-W must be different. \n\nBut the example says it's possible. \n\nSo my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is different. Maybe it's B R B W W? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's final string is B R B B W, but the two B's are allowed because they are not adjacent in the way I thought. \n\nWait, maybe the two B's are part of different stamps. \n\nWait, let's think of the example's steps again. \n\nThe third step's result is B R B B W. \n\nThe third step's stamp is applied on positions 1-2 (the R and B?), which were R and B. \n\nWait, if you stamp them again, you can choose to set them to BR or RB. \n\nSuppose you choose BR, then the R (position 1) becomes B, and the B (position 2) becomes R. \n\nSo the string would be B B R B W. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (the B and W?), but then the W would become B or R. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem's constraints again. \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must have been part of at least one stamp. \n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to R and B in some order. \n\nTherefore, for any non-W cell, it must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nMoreover, the color of the cell is determined by the last stamp that affected it. \n\nSo, for the final string to be possible, the following must hold: \n\n- All non-W cells must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W are either R and B or B and R. \n\nWait, but the example contradicts this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows two same colors if they are separated by a W. \n\nWait, but the example has two B's adjacent. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the entire string must not have three consecutive non-W cells with the first and third being the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the non-W sequence must alternate between R and B. \n\nWait, let's think of the example's final string: B R B B W. \n\nThe non-W sequence is B R B B. \n\nThe first three are B R B (alternating), but then the fourth is B again. \n\nSo the last two are B and B. \n\nThis would violate the alternating condition. \n\nBut the example says it's possible. \n\nHmm, so I must be missing something. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the stamps can be applied in such a way that overlapping pairs can create the desired pattern. \n\nLet me think of the example's final string B R B B W. \n\nThe two B's at positions 2 and 3 (0-based) are adjacent. \n\nHow could that happen? \n\nSuppose the last stamp was applied on positions 2-3, setting them to B and B? No, because each stamp must set them to R and B or B and R. \n\nAh! So that's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the example must have a different final string. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the example. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW RB W \u2192 BR R B W \u2192 B R B B W.

All non-W cells must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W are either R and B or B and R. \n\n2. Additionally, the entire sequence of non-W must be such that it can be covered by overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R. \n\nWait, but the first condition implies the second. \n\nSo the first condition is sufficient. \n\nBut the example contradicts this. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's final string is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows two same colors if they are separated by a W. \n\nWait, but the example's final string has two B's adjacent. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the code provided and see what the current code is doing. \n\nThe current code has variables r and b, which are 0 or 1. \n\nThey track whether the current run has seen R or B. \n\nThe loop processes each character. \n\nFor each character: \n\n- if it's R, set r=1 \n\n- if it's B, set b=1 \n\n- if it's W: \n\n   then, if (some condition), set re to NO \n\n   then reset r and b to 0 \n\nAt the end, if r + b ==1, set re to NO. \n\nThe idea is probably that between W's, the non-W must form a valid sequence. \n\nThe current code's logic is that whenever a W is encountered, we check if the previous run of non-W has some invalid condition. \n\nThe TODO is the condition for when to set re to NO when a W is found. \n\nThe current code's variables r and b track whether there were any R or B in the current run of non-W. \n\nSo, for example, if the current run has both R and B, then it's okay. \n\nBut if the run has only R or only B, then it's invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the current run of non-W must have at least one R and one B. \n\nBecause otherwise, if the run has only R's or only B's, then it's impossible. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nFor example, a run of R's or B's can't be formed because each stamp must alternate between R and B. \n\nSo the condition for a W is: \n\nIf the current run of non-W has only R or only B (i.e., r and b are not both 1), then it's invalid. \n\nSo the condition for the TODO is: \n\nif (r == 1 && b == 0) || (r ==0 && b ==1) \n\nthen set re to NO. \n\nBecause that means the current run of non-W has only R or only B, which is impossible. \n\nSo the code's variables r and b track whether the current run has seen R and/or B. \n\nWhen a W is encountered, we check if the previous run had both R and B. \n\nIf not, then it's invalid. \n\nAdditionally, after processing all characters, we have to check if the last run (if it ended with non-W) has both R and B. \n\nThe code's final check is if (r + b ==1) \u2192 which means the last run has only one of them. \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\nThe conditions are: \n\n- Every run of non-W must contain at least one R and one B. \n\n- Additionally, the entire string must not have any two adjacent non-W of the same color. \n\nWait, but the first condition (every run has both R and B) would ensure that the run has at least two non-W, so they must alternate. \n\nWait, no. For example, a run of R B R has both R and B, but the first and third are R, which are adjacent via the B in between. \n\nHmm, but the first and third are not adjacent. \n\nWait, the first condition ensures that the run has at least one R and one B, but doesn't ensure that they alternate. \n\nFor example, a run like R R B would have both R and B, but the first two R's are adjacent and same, which is invalid. \n\nAh! So the first condition is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nSo the code's current approach is incomplete. \n\nHmm, so the code's current logic is not sufficient. \n\nThe correct conditions must be: \n\n1. Every run of non-W must have at least one R and one B. \n\n2. Within each run of non-W, every two adjacent characters must be different (R and B or B and R). \n\nSo the first condition is handled by the code's current logic (checking if r and b are both 1 when a W is encountered or at the end). \n\nThe second condition requires that within the run, no two adjacent are the same. \n\nSo how to track that. \n\nThe current code's variables r and b are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps we need to track the previous character in the run. \n\nLet me think of modifying the code. \n\nWe can track the previous character in the current run. \n\nFor each character in the string: \n\n- if it's W: \n\n   check the current run's validity (has both R and B, and no two same adjacent). \n\n   then reset the run. \n\n- else: \n\n   if it's the first character in the run, just record it. \n\n   else: \n\n      check that it's different from the previous character. \n\n      if not, then invalid. \n\nSo the code needs to track the previous character in the current run. \n\nSo modifying the code: \n\nInitialize variables: \n\nprev_char = 'W' \n\nhas_r = false \n\nhas_b = false \n\nThen, for each character c in the string: \n\nif c is W: \n\n   if the current run is non-empty: \n\n      if the run has only R or only B \u2192 invalid \n\n      also, check that the run's characters alternate (but how?) \n\n   reset variables. \n\nelse: \n\n   if the current run is empty: \n\n      start a new run. \n\n      set prev_char to c. \n\n      set has_r or has_b accordingly. \n\n   else: \n\n      if c == prev_char \u2192 invalid \n\n      else: \n\n          update prev_char to c \n\n          set has_r or has_b. \n\nAt the end of processing all characters, check the last run. \n\nThis way, we can ensure that within each run of non-W, no two adjacent are the same, and the run has both R and B. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to track the previous character in the current run. \n\nThe original code's variables r and b are used to track whether the current run has R and/or B. \n\nBut to also track the previous character, we need an additional variable. \n\nSo the code's current approach is missing the check for adjacent duplicates. \n\nTherefore, the correct condition for the TODO is: \n\nWhen encountering a W, we need to check whether the current run has both R and B, and also that the run is valid (no two same adjacent). \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be modified to track the previous character. \n\nLet me try to think of how to adjust the code. \n\nThe current code has variables r and b, which are 0 or 1. \n\nPerhaps we can also track the previous character. \n\nLet me see: \n\nInside the loop over each character: \n\nInitially, prev is 'W' (or some default). \n\nWhen processing a non-W character: \n\n   if it's the first in the current run (prev was W), then set prev to this character. \n\n   else: \n\n      if current character == prev \u2192 invalid. \n\n      else: \n\n          update prev to current character. \n\n   then set r and b accordingly. \n\nWhen a W is encountered: \n\n   if the current run is non-empty (prev is not W): \n\n      check if the run has both R and B (r and b are both 1). \n\n      if not \u2192 invalid. \n\n      also, check that the run's length is at least 1? \n\n      then reset r and b to 0, and prev to W. \n\nAt the end of processing all characters, check the last run (if any) has both R and B. \n\nSo the code needs to track the previous character in the current run. \n\nTherefore, the original code's variables are insufficient. \n\nThe current code's approach is missing the check for adjacent duplicates. \n\nHence, the correct condition for the TODO is: \n\nif the current run has only R or only B \u2192 which is when (r and b are not both 1). \n\nBut this is not sufficient. \n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct solution requires tracking the previous character in the current run. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to include this. \n\nBut the user's code is given, and the task is to fill in the TODO part. \n\nThe current code's variables are r and b, which are 0 or 1. \n\nThe TODO is in the W case. \n\nThe current code's logic is that when a W is encountered, if the current run has only R or only B, then it's invalid. \n\nBut this is not sufficient. \n\nHowever, perhaps the problem's constraints are such that the only invalid cases are when a run has only R or only B. \n\nWait, let's think of the example where the run is R R. \n\nThis would have r=1 and b=0 \u2192 so when the W is encountered, the code would set re to NO. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: a run of R B \u2192 r and b are both 1 \u2192 valid. \n\nA run of B R \u2192 also valid. \n\nA run of R B R \u2192 has both R and B \u2192 valid. \n\nA run of R B B \u2192 has both R and B, but the last two are B's \u2192 which would have been caught by the previous character check. \n\nBut the current code's approach doesn't track that. \n\nSo the current code's approach would incorrectly accept a run like R B B. \n\nBecause the run has both R and B, but the last two are B's. \n\nSo the code would say \"YES\" but it should be \"NO\". \n\nHence, the current code's approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct condition requires that within each run of non-W, no two adjacent are the same. \n\nThus, the code must track the previous character. \n\nBut since the user's code is given and the task is to fill in the TODO, perhaps the problem's actual conditions are different. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows two same colors as long as they are not adjacent. \n\nWait, but the example's final string has two B's adjacent. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct conditions again. \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must be part of a pair that was stamped. \n\nEach pair must be set to R and B or B and R. \n\nThus, the colors of adjacent non-W must alternate. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that in the target string, any two adjacent non-W must be different. \n\nAdditionally, every run of non-W must have at least one R and one B. \n\nSo the two conditions are: \n\n1. No two adjacent non-W are the same. \n\n2. Every run of non-W has at least one R and one B. \n\nThe first condition ensures that the colors alternate. \n\nThe second ensures that the run isn't all R or all B. \n\nThus, the code must check both conditions. \n\nThe current code's variables r and b track condition 2. \n\nTo check condition 1, we need to track the previous character in the current run. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified to track the previous character. \n\nBut since the user's code is given and the task is to fill in the TODO, perhaps the problem's actual conditions are that the runs must have both R and B. \n\nThe example's final string has a run of B R B B. \n\nThe run has both R and B, so condition 2 is satisfied. \n\nBut the first and third B's are separated by an R, so the adjacent pairs are B-R, R-B, B-B. \n\nThe last pair B-B violates condition 1. \n\nThus, the example's final string should be invalid, but the problem says it's valid. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nPerhaps the example's final string is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows two same colors if they are separated by a W. \n\nWait, but the example's final string has two B's adjacent. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and see what the code's TODO should be. \n\nThe current code's variables r and b track whether the current run has seen R or B. \n\nWhen a W is encountered, the code checks if the current run has both R and B. \n\nIf not, then it's invalid. \n\nThe final check is whether the last run (if any) has both R and B. \n\nThis handles condition 2. \n\nBut the first condition (no two adjacent same) is not checked. \n\nHowever, perhaps the problem's actual conditions are only condition 2. \n\nIn that case, the example's final string would be valid because the run has both R and B. \n\nBut the two B's would violate condition 1, but if the problem doesn't require that, then the code's approach is correct. \n\nBut why would the example be valid with two B's adjacent? \n\nPerhaps the problem allows two same colors as long as they are not adjacent in the final string. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows two same colors if they are part of overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, the two B's could be set by different stamps. \n\nBut each stamp must set them to R and B or B and R. \n\nThus, two B's adjacent is impossible. \n\nSo the example must have a different final string. \n\nPerhaps the example's final string is B R B W W. \n\nThen the two B's are not adjacent. \n\nIn that case, the code's approach would work. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct condition for the TODO is whether the current run has both R and B. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is correct, and the example's final string must have a run with both R and B. \n\nIn the example's final string B R B B W, the run has B, R, B, B. \n\nThe run has both R and B, so condition 2 is satisfied. \n\nBut the adjacent B and B would violate condition 1. \n\nBut the code's approach doesn't check that. \n\nThus, the code would incorrectly accept such a case. \n\nBut the problem's example says it's valid. \n\nThis suggests that the problem's conditions are different. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows two same colors as long as they are not adjacent in the final string. \n\nWait, but the example's final string has them adjacent. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the entire string must not have three consecutive non-W of the same color. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows any non-W sequence as long as it can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, the two B's could be set by different stamps. \n\nBut how? \n\nSuppose the two B's are part of different pairs. \n\nFor example, the first B is part of a pair with the previous cell, and the second B is part of a pair with the next cell. \n\nBut the two B's are adjacent. \n\nThus, their pair must have been set to B and B, which is impossible. \n\nThus, the example must be incorrect. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and fill in the TODO as follows: \n\nThe condition is whether the current run has only R or only B. \n\nThus, the code's TODO should be: \n\nif (r == 1 && b == 0) || (r ==0 && b ==1) \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nif ( (r && !b) || (!r && b) ) re = \"NO\"; \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\n(r && !b) || (!r && b) \n\nSo the condition is whether the current run has only R or only B. \n\nThis would handle the case where a run has only one type. \n\nThe example's final string has a run with both R and B, so it would be accepted. \n\nEven though the two B's are adjacent, the code would not catch that. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, it's valid. \n\nPerhaps the problem's actual conditions are only that the run has both R and B. \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\n(r && !b) || (!r && b) \n\nSo the TODO condition is whether the current run has only R or only B. \n\nThus, the code should be filled with that condition. \n\nSo the answer is to fill the TODO with (r && !b) || (!r && b). \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\n(r && !b) || (!r && b)"
