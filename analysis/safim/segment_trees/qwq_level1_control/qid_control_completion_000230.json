Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the selected subset is even. The initial case (all invited) has m edges (odd). To make it even, we need to change the parity. The minimal cost would be the minimal among: Either:\n\n- Remove one edge (so subtract 1, making it even). To remove an edge, you can exclude one of the two nodes in that edge. The cost is the a_i of that node. So for each edge (u, v), the cost is min(a_u, a_v). The minimal of all these min(a_u, a_v) over all edges would be a candidate. OR\n\n- Add an edge (but that's not possible since all are already invited). So that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there are other ways to flip the parity by excluding some nodes. For example, excluding a node that is part of an odd number of edges.",

The number of edges removed would be all edges connected to u or v. The total edges removed is (degree(u) + degree(v) - 1) (since the edge between them is counted twice in the sum). So the change in edges is (degree(u) + degree(v) -1). The parity of this change is (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2. We need this to be odd (so that the total edges becomes even). So, (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2 must be 1. Which implies (degree(u) + degree(v)) mod 2 is 0. So, degree(u) and degree(v) must have the same parity. Hmm, so for this to be a valid option, the degrees of u and v must be of the same parity. Then, the cost would be a_u + a_v, and the change in edges is odd. So, the minimal cost would be the minimum between:\n\n- The minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree (since excluding one such node flips the parity).",

Wait, but how do we know which of these options is better? So, the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal a_i (from the first option) and the minimal (a_u + a_v) from the second option. Additionally, there might be other options, like excluding three nodes, but that would likely be more expensive. Therefore, the minimal cost is the minimum of all these possibilities. Now, looking back at the code:\n\nThe code is looping over all edges. For each edge (u, v):\n\n- The first if condition (TODO) is probably checking if the degree of u is odd. Then, it takes a_u as a candidate for c.\n\n- The second if checks if the degree of v is odd, then takes a_v.\n\n- The third condition checks if (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) is odd. Wait, (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2 is equal to (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) %2. Let me see:\n\nSuppose (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) is odd. Then, the parity is 1. So, the change in edges would be odd. So, excluding both nodes would flip the parity. So, the cost is a_u + a_v. So, the code is considering this as a possible candidate. Wait, but the condition (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) &1 is equivalent to ( (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) %2 ==1 ). So, the code is checking if that is true, then the cost is a_u + a_v. Wait, but the third condition's condition is (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) is odd. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the condition is true, then the code takes the sum of a_u and a_v as a candidate.",

Another test case: when m is odd, the code loops through all edges and finds the minimal among the candidates. So, the missing code is indeed checking if the first node's degree is odd.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value when inviting club members such that the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some logic, but the TODO part is where I need to fill in. Let me think about the approach here.\n\nThe problem requires that the total number of cakes (friend pairs invited) must be even. The unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all members not invited. So, the goal is to choose a subset of members to invite such that the number of friend pairs in the subset is even, and the sum of a_i for non-invited is minimized.\n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize that, we want to invite as many as possible, except those with high a_i. But the constraint complicates things.\n\nThe key here is that the number of friend pairs must be even. Let me think of this as a graph problem where friends are edges. The problem is similar to selecting a subset of vertices such that the number of edges within the subset is even, and the sum of a_i for non-selected is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, since the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for non-invited, the total unhappiness is equal to the sum of all a_i minus the sum of a_i for those invited. Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for each member not invited. So, the total unhappiness is sum_{i not invited} a_i. To minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible, except those with high a_i. But the constraint is on the number of edges (friend pairs) among the invited.\n\nHmm, so the problem is to choose a subset S of the members such that the number of edges in the induced subgraph S is even, and the sum of a_i for members not in S is as small as possible. Which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of (a_i) for those in S, since the total is fixed. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nTotal unhappiness is sum_{i not in S} a_i. To minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for those in S. Because the total sum of all a_i is fixed. So, the problem is equivalent to finding a subset S with even number of edges, such that the sum of a_i for S is as large as possible. Then subtract that from the total to get the minimal unhappiness.\n\nSo the problem reduces to maximizing the sum of a_i for S, with the constraint that the number of edges in S is even.\n\nNow, how do we model this? It's a bit tricky. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nOne possible approach is to model this as a graph and use some kind of dynamic programming or greedy approach. But given the constraints (n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5), we need an O(m) or O(n) solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into considering the parity of the number of edges. Let me think of the problem in terms of parity.\n\nSuppose that the number of edges in S must be even. Let's consider the minimal cost to adjust the parity. \n\nWait, here's an idea: the minimal cost required to make the parity even. Let me think of the case when the current number of edges is odd. Then, we need to flip the parity somehow. To do that, perhaps we can remove one edge, or add one edge. But how does that translate into the selection of members?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as follows: the optimal solution is either the maximum possible sum with even edges, or the maximum possible sum with odd edges, whichever gives a better result. But since the problem requires even edges, we have to choose between those two.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the parity of the number of edges is determined by the selection of certain nodes. Let me think of the problem in terms of the edges. Each edge contributes 1 to the count if both endpoints are in S. The total is the sum over all edges of (indicator whether both are in S). The parity is the sum mod 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to find a way to adjust the parity by flipping the inclusion of certain nodes. For example, if the current number of edges is odd, we can flip the inclusion of a node that is part of an odd number of edges, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by some similar problems. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe optimal solution without considering the parity constraint would be to include all members except those with a_i being the highest. But the parity constraint complicates this. So, perhaps the minimal adjustment needed is to find a way to flip the parity by either excluding some nodes or including some nodes, such that the total unhappiness increases by the minimal possible amount.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's first compute the best possible solution without considering the parity. Let's call this value S0. Then, if the number of edges in that solution is even, then that's our answer. If it's odd, then we need to find a way to adjust it to make the parity even, which would require changing the selection of some nodes such that the parity flips, and the unhappiness increases by the minimal possible amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find a pair of nodes whose inclusion/exclusion can flip the parity with minimal cost. But how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code given. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads n and m, then the a array. Then it reads m edges, storing them in pp. Then, for each edge, it increments the count cc for each node in the edge. So, cc[x] is the number of friends that x has. Wait, no, actually, for each edge (x,y), it increments cc[x] and cc[y]. So, cc[x] is the degree of node x in the friend graph. \n\nThen, the code checks if m is even. If so, it outputs 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because in the first sample input, when all are invited, the number of edges is m, so if m is even, then the parity is even, so the unhappiness is zero (since all are invited, so sum of a_i not invited is zero). But the code's first condition is if m is even, output 0. But that's only true if all are invited. But maybe the code is wrong here. Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but the problem requires us to fix it.\n\nWait, the code's logic here is: if m is even, then the answer is 0. But that's not correct. For example, suppose m is even, but the optimal solution is to not invite everyone. For instance, if some a_i are negative? Wait, no, the problem states that a_i are non-negative. Wait, the input says 0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1e4. So, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by inviting as many as possible. So, if m is even, then inviting everyone would give the minimal possible unhappiness (since all a_i not invited are zero except those not invited). Wait, but if m is even, then the number of edges (all edges) is m, which is even. So, in that case, the best possible is to invite everyone, so the unhappiness is zero. So the code's first condition is correct. So when m is even, the answer is zero. But that's only if inviting everyone is allowed. Wait, but maybe there are cases where even if m is even, but some a_i are high, so it's better not to invite some. But the minimal unhappiness would still be achieved by inviting everyone, since a_i are non-negative. Because if you don't invite someone, you add their a_i to the unhappiness. So the minimal is achieved when you invite everyone, which gives zero. So the code's first condition is correct.\n\nBut when m is odd, then the number of edges (if all are invited) is m, which is odd. So that's invalid. So we need to adjust the selection so that the number of edges is even. The code then enters the else block.\n\nIn the else block, the code loops over all edges and does some checks. The TODO is in the first if condition inside the loop. Let me see what the code is trying to do here.\n\nThe code initializes c to 1e9, which is a large number. Then, for each edge in the edges, it checks some condition, and if so, updates c with the a value of the first node in the edge. Then, it also checks if the count (cc) of the second node is odd, and similarly takes its a value. Then, there's another condition involving the sum of the counts of the two nodes minus 1, and if that is odd, then it takes the sum of their a's. Finally, the minimal c is printed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity. Let me think: when m is odd, the current number of edges (if all are invited) is m, which is odd. So we need to make it even. To do that, we can either remove one edge (so the total becomes m-1, even) or add an edge (but that's not possible since all are already invited). Wait, but edges are fixed. So the only way to change the parity is to exclude at least one pair of friends. Alternatively, perhaps by excluding one or more nodes, thereby reducing the number of edges by an odd number.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost would be to find a way to flip the parity with minimal cost. The minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among certain nodes, or pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach here is to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe optimal solution without parity constraint is to invite everyone, which gives total edges m (odd). To make it even, we need to reduce the number of edges by 1 (mod 2). So, the total edges must be even. So, the difference between the current edges (m) and the desired edges must be odd. So, we can either decrease the edges by 1, 3, etc. The minimal cost would be the minimal way to do that.\n\nTo decrease the edges by an odd number, we can do the following:\n\nOption 1: Remove one edge. To remove an edge, we can exclude at least one of the two nodes in that edge. The cost would be the a_i of the node(s) we exclude. For example, if we exclude one node in an edge, then that edge is no longer counted. So, for each edge (u, v), the cost to remove this edge is min(a_u, a_v). But since we need to remove an odd number of edges, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal a_i among all nodes in edges, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal a_i among all nodes in edges, because by excluding that node, you remove all edges connected to it. But that might remove multiple edges, which could change the parity by an even or odd number.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the code's approach. The code is looping over all edges and for each edge, it's checking some conditions and then taking the a of one of the nodes, or their sum. The variable c is the minimal value found. Then, the answer is c. Wait, but in the else block, the code is trying to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. So, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal among all possible options that can flip the parity.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost to make the parity even. Let me see the code's logic:\n\nInside the else block (when m is odd), the code loops over each edge. For each edge (x,y):\n\n- The first if condition is missing (the TODO). The code then checks if cc[x] is odd? Or something else?\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif( /* TODO */ ) then take arr[pp[x][0]].\n\nThen, it checks if cc[pp[x][1]] is odd, then take arr[pp[x][1]].\n\nThen, there's another condition involving (cc[x] + cc[y] -1) being odd, then take the sum of their a's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first condition is checking if the count of the first node is odd. Let me see:\n\nThe code's variables:\n\ncc[x] is the degree of the node (number of friends). \n\nWait, the code's cc array is initialized as 0 for all x from 1 to n. Then, for each edge (pp[x][0], pp[x][1]), it increments cc[pp[x][0]] and cc[pp[x][1]]. So, yes, cc[x] is the degree of node x.\n\nSo, for each edge (u, v), the code is considering:\n\nif (cc[u] is odd?), then take a_u.\n\nWait, the code's first if statement is missing. The second if is checking if cc[v] is odd. Then, the third condition is (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) is odd, which would be equivalent to (cc[u] + cc[v]) mod 2 is 0, since (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) mod 2 is ( (cc[u]+cc[v]) mod 2 -1 mod 2 ), but maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the selected subset is even. The initial case (all invited) has m edges (odd). To make it even, we need to change the parity. The minimal cost would be the minimal among:\n\nEither:\n\n- Remove one edge (so subtract 1, making it even). To remove an edge, you can exclude one of the two nodes in that edge. The cost is the a_i of that node. So for each edge (u, v), the cost is min(a_u, a_v). The minimal of all these min(a_u, a_v) over all edges would be a candidate.\n\nOR\n\n- Add an edge (but that's not possible since all are already invited). So that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other ways to flip the parity by excluding some nodes. For example, excluding a node that is part of an odd number of edges. Wait, but excluding a node removes all edges connected to it. So the total edges removed would be equal to the degree of the node. So, if the degree is odd, then removing that node would subtract an odd number of edges, flipping the parity. The cost would be a_i. So, the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree would be another candidate.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a node u with an odd degree. If we exclude u, then all edges connected to u are removed. The number of edges removed is equal to the degree of u (which is odd). So the total edges would decrease by an odd number, so the parity flips. So, the cost is a_u. So, the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree is a candidate.\n\nAlternatively, if there is no such node with odd degree, then we have to do something else. Wait, but in a graph, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So, if m is odd (the total edges is m, which is odd), then the sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. So the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So, there must be at least two nodes with odd degrees. So, in that case, excluding one of them would flip the parity, and the cost is a_i. So the minimal a_i among those nodes would be a candidate.\n\nAlternatively, another option is to exclude two nodes whose combined effect flips the parity. For example, excluding two nodes whose degrees are even, but their combined edge removals flip the parity. Hmm, but that's more complicated.\n\nSo, the minimal cost would be the minimum between:\n\n1. The minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree (since excluding such a node flips the parity).\n\n2. The minimal a_u + a_v for any edge (u, v), since excluding both nodes would remove all edges connected to them, but that might not be optimal. Wait, no, excluding both nodes would remove all edges connected to either, but perhaps the total edges removed is (degree(u) + degree(v) - 2*number of edges between them). Since they are friends, there is one edge between them. So, the total edges removed would be (degree(u) + degree(v) - 1). The parity of that is (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2. Since the original parity is odd, we need the total edges after exclusion to be even. So, the change in edges must be odd. So, the total edges removed must be odd. So, (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2 must be 1 (so that the total edges after exclusion is m - (edges removed) which must be even). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal a_u + a_v (for any edge (u, v)), since excluding both nodes would remove an odd number of edges (if their combined edges minus the edge between them is odd). \n\nWait, let me think of the case where we exclude both u and v. The number of edges removed would be all edges connected to u or v. The total edges removed is (degree(u) + degree(v) - 1) (since the edge between them is counted twice in the sum). So the change in edges is (degree(u) + degree(v) -1). The parity of this change is (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2. We need this to be odd (so that the total edges becomes even). So, (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2 must be 1. Which implies (degree(u) + degree(v)) mod 2 is 0. So, degree(u) and degree(v) must have the same parity. \n\nHmm, so for this to be a valid option, the degrees of u and v must be of the same parity. Then, the cost would be a_u + a_v, and the change in edges is odd. \n\nSo, the minimal cost would be the minimum between:\n\n- The minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree (since excluding one such node flips the parity).\n\n- The minimal (a_u + a_v) for edges (u, v) where degree(u) and degree(v) have the same parity (so that excluding both flips the parity).\n\nWait, but how do we know which of these options is better?\n\nSo, the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal a_i (from the first option) and the minimal (a_u + a_v) from the second option.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other options, like excluding three nodes, but that would likely be more expensive.\n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is the minimum of all these possibilities.\n\nNow, looking back at the code:\n\nThe code is looping over all edges. For each edge (u, v):\n\n- The first if condition (TODO) is probably checking if the degree of u is odd. Then, it takes a_u as a candidate for c.\n\n- The second if checks if the degree of v is odd, then takes a_v.\n\n- The third condition checks if (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) is odd. Wait, (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) mod 2 is equal to (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) %2. Let me see:\n\nSuppose (degree(u) + degree(v) -1) is odd. Then, the parity is 1. So, the change in edges would be odd. So, excluding both nodes would flip the parity. So, the cost is a_u + a_v. So, the code is considering this as a possible candidate.\n\nWait, but the condition (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) &1 is equivalent to ( (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) %2 ==1 ). So, the code is checking if that is true, then the cost is a_u + a_v. \n\nWait, but the third condition's condition is (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) is odd. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the condition is true, then the code takes the sum of a_u and a_v as a candidate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the code is trying to find the minimal among:\n\n- a_u for any edge where u has odd degree.\n\n- a_v for any edge where v has odd degree.\n\n- a_u + a_v for any edge where (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) is odd (i.e., (cc[u] + cc[v]) is even).\n\nWait, but why are they considering edges where the degree of u is odd? Because excluding u would flip the parity. So, for any node with odd degree, excluding it would flip the parity. So, the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree is the minimal a among those nodes. But the code is looping over edges and for each edge, checking if u has odd degree, then considering a_u. But this way, it might not capture all nodes with odd degree, only those that are part of edges. But every node with odd degree must be part of at least one edge (since degree is the number of edges connected to it). So, all nodes with odd degree are part of at least one edge, so the code's approach of checking for each edge's endpoints' degrees would cover all such nodes. \n\nWait, but for a node with odd degree, it's part of at least one edge. So, in the loop over all edges, whenever that node is part of an edge, the code will check its degree. So, for each such node, there will be at least one edge in the loop where the node is one of the endpoints, and thus the code will check if its degree is odd, and then take its a_i as a candidate. \n\nTherefore, the code is effectively considering all nodes with odd degree, because for each such node, there is at least one edge in the list where it is an endpoint, so the code will check its degree and include its a_i in the possible candidates. \n\nSo, the code's approach is to collect all possible candidates:\n\n- For each edge, if u has odd degree, then a_u is a candidate.\n\n- Similarly for v.\n\n- Also, for each edge, if (cc[u] + cc[v] -1) is odd (i.e., (cc[u] + cc[v]) is even), then a_u + a_v is a candidate.\n\nThen, the minimal among all these candidates is the minimal cost needed to flip the parity from odd to even. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct, except for the first condition's missing part. \n\nLooking at the first if statement:\n\nThe code has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\nc = min(c, arr[pp[x][0]]);\n\nThe first condition is probably checking if the degree of pp[x][0] is odd. Because then, excluding that node would flip the parity. So the condition should be (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1). \n\nWait, the second if statement is:\n\nif( cc[pp[x][1]] & 1 )\n\nSo the first condition should be checking if the degree of the first node (pp[x][0]) is odd. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1). \n\nSo, the first if condition is:\n\nif( (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1) )\n\nThen, the code takes arr[pp[x][0]] as a candidate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the code is considering all possible candidates from nodes with odd degrees (via edges) and pairs of nodes where their degrees sum to even (so that excluding both flips the parity). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif( (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1) )\n\nSo, the first if condition is checking if the degree of the first node in the edge is odd. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nif( (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1) )\n\nSo, the code should be filled in with that condition. \n\nLet me check the sample inputs to see if this makes sense. \n\nTake the second sample input from the problem description:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. Wait, no, the second test case in the note is probably the second example given. Let me see the note:\n\nIn the second test case, the possible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (even). The minimal unhappiness is 2 (since a_2 and a_3 are 2 and 0? Or maybe the a array is different. Let me see the note's example:\n\nIn the second test case's options, inviting 2 and 3 gives 0 cakes (so even). The unhappiness is 3 (since a_1 is 3, a_2 is 0, a_3 is 2? Or maybe the a array is [3,0,2], so the unhappiness when not inviting 1 is 3. Wait, the note says the minimal is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. So the unhappiness is a_1 (3) plus a_3? Wait, no, if you invite 2 and 3, then the unhappiness is a_1 (since 1 is not invited). So the unhappiness is 3. But the note says the minimal is 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the a array wrong. \n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness 2. So perhaps a_3 is 2, and a_2 is 0, and a_1 is 3. So when you don't invite 1, you add 3 to the unhappiness, but if you don't invite 3, you add 2. Wait, maybe the a array is [3,5,3], and the friends are none (since m=0). Then, inviting 2 and 3 would have unhappiness a_1 =3. But the note says the minimal is 2. Hmm, perhaps the example is different. \n\nBut regardless, the code's logic should handle it. \n\nAnother test case: when m is odd, the code loops through all edges and finds the minimal among the candidates. \n\nSo, the missing code is indeed checking if the first node's degree is odd. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nif( (cc[pp[x][0]] & 1) )\n\nSo, the first if condition is checking if the degree of the first node in the edge is odd. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\n(cc[pp[x][0]] & 1)"
