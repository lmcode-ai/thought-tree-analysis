The task is to find any value in the array that appears at least three times. If none exist, output -1. Looking at the code provided, there's a function called solve() which is supposed to handle each test case. Let me go through the code step by step to see where the missing parts are. First, the code initializes some arrays: arr and brr. The solve function starts by setting brr[n] = -1. Wait, but n here might be the test case index? Hmm, maybe the variables are a bit confusing.

Hmm, perhaps the code's author forgot to initialize the array, but the problem requires us to fill in the TODO. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the condition. Wait, let's think of the test case where the first test case has len=3 and elements [2,2,2]. The code would read len=3, then read the elements. Suppose the array was initialized to zero before. Then after reading, arr[2] is 3. Then the loop from 1 to 3:\n\nfor i=1: arr[1] is 0 \u2192 no. \n\ni=2: arr[2] is 3 \u2192 set brr[n] =2. Then set arr[2] to 0. i=3: arr[3] is 0 \u2192 no.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's brr array is supposed to store the answer for each test case. The code's solve function ends with cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\nBut since n is being decremented, the first test case's answer is stored in brr[original n], which is beyond the array's size.

Wait, the code's solve function ends with cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\nSo during the first call, n is 5 (original value), so it outputs brr[5], which was just set. Then, after the first call, n is decremented to 4. The second call uses n=4, so stores the answer in brr[4], and outputs it. So the outputs are in the correct order. Because the first test case's output is printed first, then the second, etc. So the indexing is okay. Therefore, the main issue is the array initialization. The code's solve function must initialize the array to zero before counting. The code currently does not do that. The code's current approach is to increment arr[e], but without initializing to zero first. Therefore, the code is missing the initialization loop. The code's solve function should have:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    brr[n] = -1; \n\n    int len; \n\n    cin >> len; \n\n    // Initialize the array \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    int e; \n\n    for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n\n        cin >> e; \n\n        arr[e]++; \n\n    }\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] >=3) {\n\n            brr[n] =i; \n\n        }\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the initialization loop. But the user's problem says to output only the missing code. The code given does not have this loop. Therefore, the missing code includes adding this loop. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. The problem says to output the missing code as plain text, not as markdown code.",

Wait, but after the first test case, the code's loop after processing sets arr[i] =0 for i from 1 to len.

For e=4 and 5, arr[4] and arr[5] were zero (since they were not modified in previous test cases). So the code's approach is correct. Ah!

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code so that it solves the problem correctly. Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. The task is to find any value in the array that appears at least three times. If none exist, output -1. \n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a function called solve() which is supposed to handle each test case. Let me go through the code step by step to see where the missing parts are.\n\nFirst, the code initializes some arrays: arr and brr. The solve function starts by setting brr[n] = -1. Wait, but n here might be the test case index? Hmm, maybe the variables are a bit confusing. Let me check the main function. The main reads n (the number of test cases) and then loops n times, calling solve each time. So in the solve function, the first line sets brr[n] = -1. But n here is the original number of test cases, not the current test case's length. That might be a problem. Wait, maybe the variables are mixed up. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the code's main function, after reading n (the number of test cases), it sets m = n, then loops while n--. So inside solve, the first parameter is probably not correct. Because when the first test case is processed, n would have been decremented already. Hmm, maybe the code has some variable naming issues. But perhaps the code's structure is a bit off, but I need to work with what's given.\n\nLooking at the solve function:\n\nThe first line is brr[n] = -1. But n here is the original input variable (number of test cases), which is being decremented in the loop. That might not be the right approach. Wait, perhaps the code is using 'n' in the solve function incorrectly. Because in the solve function, the first thing done is to read len (the array length) from input. So maybe the code's variables are mixed up. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe solve function starts by setting brr[n] = -1. Then it reads len (the array length for this test case). Then loops over len elements, reading each e and incrementing arr[e]. Then loops from i=1 to len, checking some condition, and if so, sets brr[n] = i. Then resets arr[i] to 0. Finally, outputs brr[n].\n\nWait, the array arr is probably being used as a frequency counter. But since there are multiple test cases, we need to reset the counts between test cases. However, in the current code, after processing each test case, they set arr[i] =0 for i from 1 to len. But that's not sufficient because the next test case's array might have a larger length. So maybe the code's approach is flawed here. Alternatively, perhaps the arr array is supposed to track frequencies, but since the elements can be up to n (the array length for each test case), which can be up to 2e5, the array size is okay (since it's 200005). \n\nThe problem is that in each test case, the code is supposed to count the frequency of each element in the current array. The code is using arr[e]++, but e can be up to len (since the input a_i is up to n, which is len here). So arr needs to be big enough. The array arr is declared as size 200005, which should be sufficient since len is up to 2e5.\n\nBut the problem is that between test cases, the frequency counts might not be reset properly. Because in the current code, after processing each element, they loop from i=1 to len and set arr[i] =0. Wait, no. The code after the for loop that reads the elements, there's a loop from i=1 to len:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n    if( ... ) brr[n] =i;\n    arr[i] =0;\n}\n\nWait, so after counting, they are resetting the counts for i up to len. But if the next test case has a larger len, then elements beyond the previous len might still have counts from before. That's a problem. So the code's approach here is incorrect. Because the frequency array isn't being properly reset between test cases. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is supposed to reset the entire frequency array before each test case. But the current code only resets up to the current len. That's a bug. Because if a previous test case had a longer array, then the next test case's elements beyond its own len might have leftover counts. \n\nSo maybe the code's approach is wrong here. But given that the problem requires us to complete the code, perhaps the code's structure is intended to be fixed in some way. Let me think about the TODO part first.\n\nThe TODO is in the condition of the if statement. The code is looping through i from 1 to len, and for each i, if the condition is true, then set brr[n] to i and break? Or maybe just set it and continue? The code as written would set brr[n] to the last i where the condition is true. But the problem requires to output any such value. So perhaps the first occurrence where the count is >=3 can be stored, and then break. \n\nWait, the code's current structure is:\n\nfor each i from 1 to len:\n\n   if (condition) then set brr[n] =i \n\n   then set arr[i] =0 \n\nSo the condition is probably checking if arr[i] >=3. Because arr[i] holds the count of how many times i appeared in the array. \n\nSo the missing code in the if condition should be (arr[i] >=3). \n\nBut then, the code would loop through all i from 1 to len, and whenever the count is >=3, it would set brr[n] to i. So the final value of brr[n] would be the last such i. But the problem allows any such value, so perhaps the first occurrence is better. However, the code's current approach would overwrite the value each time, so the final value would be the last i with count >=3. \n\nBut the problem says \"print any value\", so either way is acceptable. However, the code's current approach may not work because the loop is overwriting the value each time. So the final brr[n] would be the last i (up to len) that has count >=3. But that's okay as long as at least one exists. \n\nWait, but the code initializes brr[n] to -1. So if any i meets the condition, then brr[n] will be set to that i. But if multiple i's meet the condition, the last one will be stored. So the code would output the last such i. But the problem allows any, so that's okay. \n\nSo the condition is arr[i] >=3. \n\nBut let me check the code again. The code first reads len, then reads the elements into e, and increments arr[e]. So arr[e] is the count for each element. \n\nWait, the elements are stored in arr[e], but the indices of arr are from 0 to 2e5. But the elements can be up to len (since a_i <=n, which is len here). So the code is okay. \n\nBut after counting, the code loops from i=1 to len, and for each i, checks if arr[i] >=3. If so, set brr[n] to i. Then, after that, it resets arr[i] to 0. \n\nWait, but the code is resetting arr[i] to 0 for each i in 1..len. So after processing this test case, the next test case's elements may have their counts properly reset. Because for the next test case, when it loops up to its own len, it will reset those indices. However, if the next test case has a smaller len, then elements beyond that len may still have counts from previous test cases. \n\nThis is a problem. For example, suppose the first test case has len=5, and the next has len=3. The first test case's loop will reset up to 5, but the next test case's loop will only reset up to 3. So elements 4 and 5's counts from the first test case are still in arr. So when the second test case processes elements, if any of those elements are 4 or 5, their counts would be added to the previous values. \n\nThis is a critical bug. The code's approach of resetting only up to the current len is incorrect. The frequency array must be reset entirely between test cases. \n\nHmm, but given that the code is given, perhaps the way to fix this is to reset the entire array before each test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use a different approach. Let me think of the code structure again. \n\nThe code's solve function is called for each test case. The code uses a global array arr. To prevent interference between test cases, the arr must be reset each time. \n\nThe current code's approach is to loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0 after processing. But that's not enough. \n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to reset the entire array to 0 before processing each test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, in the solve function, before reading the elements, we can loop through all possible indices (up to the maximum possible len, which is 2e5) and set arr to 0. But that would be O(2e5) per test case, which with 1e4 test cases would be 2e9 operations, which is way too slow. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the current code's approach is not efficient enough. \n\nWait, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5. So perhaps the code can, for each test case, after processing, reset the array up to the current len. Because the next test case's elements can't have values larger than their own len. So for example, if the next test case has len=3, then all elements are <=3, so their counts are in arr[1..3], which were reset in the previous test case's loop. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the first test case has len=5. After processing, the code loops from 1 to 5 and sets arr[i] =0. So after that, the next test case, even if it has elements up to 5, their counts would start at 0. \n\nWait, no. Because the next test case's elements can be up to their own len. Suppose the next test case has len=10. Then, when processing that test case, the code will read elements up to 10, and after counting, it will loop from 1 to 10 and set arr[i] =0. \n\nSo the problem is that for a test case with len=3, the next test case with len=5 would have their elements up to 5, but the first 3 elements' counts were reset in the previous test case, but 4 and 5 were not. \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nTest case 1: len=3. After processing, the code loops i from 1 to 3, and sets arr[i] =0. So after that, arr[1], 2, 3 are 0. \n\nTest case 2: len=5. When processing, the elements can be up to 5. The code reads them, increments arr[e], then after that, loops from 1 to 5 and sets arr[i] =0. \n\nSo in this case, the counts for 4 and 5 would be properly handled. \n\nWait, because in the second test case, when you process elements, the arr for 4 and 5 would have been 0 (since in the first test case, they weren't touched, but in the second test case's loop after processing, they are set to 0. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose in test case 2, the elements include 4 and 5. The code increments arr[4] and arr[5]. Then, after processing, the code loops from 1 to 5 (since len is 5 here), and for each i from 1 to 5, it sets arr[i] =0. So after that, those counts are reset. \n\nSo the problem is only when a previous test case had a smaller len than the current one. Because in that case, the previous test case's loop didn't reset the higher indices. But the current test case's loop will reset up to its own len. \n\nWait, for example, test case 1 has len=3. It resets up to 3. Test case 2 has len=5. The elements can be up to 5. The code for test case 2 will process the elements, and after that, loop from 1 to 5 and set arr[i] =0. So even if in test case 1, arr[4] and 5 were not touched (they were 0 initially?), but in test case 2, their counts are properly handled. \n\nWait, the initial state of the arr array is not known. Since it's a global array, it might have garbage values. So that's a problem. \n\nAh, right! The code's arr is a global array, but it's not initialized. So initially, the elements could have any values. So the first test case's code would read elements, and when it increments arr[e], it's adding to whatever was there before. \n\nSo the code is incorrect because it doesn't initialize the array to zero before each test case. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is flawed. \n\nHmm, but given that the problem requires us to complete the code, perhaps the code is intended to be fixed in a way that the TODO is the only missing part, and the other issues are handled somehow. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use the array correctly. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's solve function:\n\n- Reads len (the array length for this test case).\n\n- Then reads the elements, and for each e, increments arr[e].\n\n- Then loops from i=1 to len:\n\n   if (arr[i] >=3) then set brr[n] =i \n\n   then set arr[i] =0 \n\nWait, but the code is looping from 1 to len, and for each i in that range, it checks the count of i (since arr[i] is the count of how many times i appeared in the array). \n\nWait, the elements in the array can be any number up to len. So the counts for each possible value (from 1 to len) are stored in arr[i]. \n\nWait, but the elements can be 0? No, the input says a_i is between 1 and n (which is len here). So the elements are 1-based. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct in that the counts for each possible value (from 1 to len) are stored in arr[i]. \n\nBut the problem is that the array arr is not initialized to zero before each test case. So the first time, when you read elements, you are adding to whatever was in arr[e]. \n\nTherefore, the code must reset the arr array to zero before processing each test case. \n\nBut how can that be done efficiently? \n\nThe code's current approach is to loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0 after processing. But that only resets up to len. However, the problem is that before processing the elements, the arr must be zero for all possible values that could be in the current array. \n\nWait, the current code's loop after processing the elements is:\n\nfor (i from 1 to len) {\n\n   if (condition) set brr[n] =i \n\n   arr[i] =0 \n\n}\n\nSo this loop is doing two things: checking the counts and resetting the array. \n\nBut before processing the elements, the arr array might have leftover counts from previous test cases. So the counts for the current test case are being added to those previous counts. \n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the correct approach would be to reset the entire array to zero before processing each test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the elements can be up to len (the current array's length), perhaps before processing the elements, we can loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0. \n\nWait, but that would be O(len) per test case, which is acceptable since the sum of len over all test cases is 2e5. \n\nSo modifying the code to first loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0 before reading the elements. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    brr[n] = -1; \n\n    int len; \n\n    cin >> len; \n\n    // reset the array for current len \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    // then read elements and count \n\n    int e; \n\n    for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n\n        cin >> e; \n\n        arr[e]++; \n\n    }\n\n    // then check for any i in 1..len with arr[i] >=3 \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] >=3) {\n\n            brr[n] =i; \n\n            // break? \n\n        }\n\n        // but the code currently has arr[i] =0 here \n\n    }\n\n    // but the code's current loop also resets arr[i] to 0 \n\n    // so perhaps the code's current loop is doing that \n\n    // but the problem is that the code's current loop is doing both checking and resetting \n\n    // so the code's current loop is:\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] >=3) brr[n] =i; \n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    // so the code's approach is to loop through all i from 1 to len, check if count is >=3, and set the answer, then reset the count. \n\n    // but the problem is that the answer is overwritten each time. \n\n    // so the final value of brr[n] will be the last i (up to len) where the count was >=3. \n\n    // but if there are multiple such i's, the last one is stored. \n\n    // but the problem allows any, so that's okay. \n\n    // but the code's initial problem is that the array wasn't reset before counting. \n\n    // so to fix that, we need to add a loop to reset the array before counting. \n\n    // so the code's solve function should be modified to first reset the array. \n\n    // but in the current code, the solve function does not have that. \n\nSo the code as given is missing the initialization of the array to zero before counting. \n\nTherefore, the code's solve function is incorrect. \n\nBut the problem says that we have to complete the code by filling in the missing lines. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the user's problem says: \"You will be given code with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\"\n\nSo perhaps the code's TODO is the only missing part, and the other issues are not part of the problem. \n\nWait, the TODO is in the if condition. The code's current structure is that the loop over i from 1 to len is checking some condition. The missing code is the condition. \n\nSo the condition should be (arr[i] >=3). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"arr[i] >=3\". \n\nBut then, the code's other issues (like not resetting the array) would cause it to fail. \n\nHmm, but perhaps the code is intended to have the array reset properly. Let me look again. \n\nThe code's solve function:\n\nAfter reading the elements and incrementing arr[e], the code loops from i=1 to len, and for each i, it checks the condition, then sets arr[i] =0. \n\nAh! So the code is resetting the array after processing each test case. \n\nWait, the code's loop after counting is:\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n    if (condition) brr[n] =i;\n\n    arr[i] =0;\n\n}\n\nSo this loop is doing two things: checking the counts and resetting the array. \n\nTherefore, the array is being reset properly for the next test case. \n\nBecause after processing all elements, the code loops through all possible i (from 1 to len) and sets arr[i] to 0. \n\nTherefore, the only problem is that the initial counts (before processing the current test case) might have leftover values. \n\nWait, but before processing the elements, the code doesn't reset the array. So the arr[i] could have values from previous test cases. \n\nWait, but the code's loop after processing the elements does set arr[i] to 0. \n\nWait, let's see the flow for two test cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\n- The code reads len (say 3). \n\n- Then reads elements, and for each e, increments arr[e]. \n\n- Then loops from 1 to 3:\n\n   for each i in 1-3:\n\n      check if arr[i] >=3 (the condition). \n\n      then set arr[i] to 0. \n\nSo after this loop, arr[1..3] are 0 again. \n\nTest case 2:\n\n- The code reads len (say 5). \n\n- Then reads elements, and for each e, increments arr[e]. \n\nBut arr[e] was 0 before (since after test case 1, the previous loop set them to 0). \n\nWait, no. Because in test case 1, after processing, the code's loop set arr[1..3] to 0. \n\nIn test case 2, when reading elements up to 5, the elements can be up to 5. \n\nWhen processing the elements, for e=4 or 5, arr[e] (which is arr[4] or 5) may have been unitialized (since in previous test cases, they were not touched). \n\nAh, here's the problem. \n\nThe code's initial array is not initialized to zero. So for elements beyond the previous test case's len, their counts could have garbage values. \n\nFor example, in test case 2, if an element is 4, then arr[4] could have some random value, and adding 1 to it would be incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code must initialize the entire array to zero before processing each test case. \n\nBut how can that be done? \n\nThe code's current approach only resets up to the current len. \n\nSo the correct approach would be to, before reading the elements, loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0. \n\nWait, but the code's current code does not do that. \n\nSo the code is missing that part. \n\nTherefore, the code's solve function is missing an initialization loop. \n\nBut the problem says that the user must fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code given has a TODO in the if condition. \n\nBut perhaps the code also has other missing parts. \n\nWait, the code's solve function starts with:\n\nbrr[n] = -1; \n\nint len; \n\ncin >> len; \n\nThen reads the elements. \n\nBut the code's arr is not initialized to zero before the elements are read. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, but the problem says to complete the code by filling in the missing lines. \n\nThe user's problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks. \n\nSo perhaps the missing part is not only the condition but also the initialization of the array. \n\nBut the code's current structure may have that part missing. \n\nLooking at the code's solve function:\n\nThe code after reading len is:\n\nfor(int i=0;i<len;i++){\n\n    cin>>e;\n\n    arr[e]++;\n\n}\n\nBut before that, there's no initialization of arr. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing an initialization of the array to zero for all possible elements in the current test case. \n\nThe correct way would be to loop from 1 to len and set arr[i] =0 before reading the elements. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nint len; \n\ncin >> len; \n\nfor (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n    arr[i] =0; \n\n}\n\nThen read the elements. \n\nTherefore, the missing code includes adding this loop. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nThe code given has a TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo perhaps the missing code is both the condition and the initialization loop. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the code given has the loop after processing the elements that sets arr[i] =0. \n\nSo the code's current approach is that after processing, the array is reset. \n\nBut before processing, the array is not initialized. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing an initialization loop before reading the elements. \n\nSo the code's solve function should have:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    brr[n] = -1; \n\n    int len; \n\n    cin >> len; \n\n    // Initialize the array to 0 for all possible elements in this test case \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    int e; \n\n    for(int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n\n        cin >> e; \n\n        arr[e]++; \n\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the code \n\n}\n\nTherefore, the missing code includes adding this loop. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code as given does not have this loop. \n\nSo the code is missing this loop. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code's solve function has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo the missing code is both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's current structure is okay except for the condition. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nSuppose the code's array is not initialized, but after processing the elements, the code loops through 1 to len and sets arr[i] =0. \n\nBut before processing the elements, the array's values could be anything. \n\nSo when you read the elements and do arr[e]++, you are adding to whatever was there before. \n\nTherefore, the counts are incorrect. \n\nHence, the code is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code must have an initialization loop before reading the elements. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code as given does not have this loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code includes adding this loop. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code's solve function has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo the missing code is both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's author forgot to initialize the array, but the problem requires us to fill in the TODO. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the condition. \n\nWait, let's think of the test case where the first test case has len=3 and elements [2,2,2]. \n\nThe code would read len=3, then read the elements. \n\nSuppose the array was initialized to zero before. \n\nThen after reading, arr[2] is 3. \n\nThen the loop from 1 to 3:\n\nfor i=1: arr[1] is 0 \u2192 no. \n\ni=2: arr[2] is 3 \u2192 set brr[n] =2. \n\nThen set arr[2] to 0. \n\ni=3: arr[3] is 0 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the final brr[n] is 2, which is correct. \n\nBut if the array wasn't initialized, then arr[2] could have been some value before, leading to incorrect counts. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing the initialization loop. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's code's solve function has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nThe user's code's solve function also lacks the initialization loop. \n\nSo the missing code includes both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem says to output the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's code's TODO is only the condition. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's author intended that the array is initialized to zero before each test case. \n\nWait, looking at the code's main function:\n\nThe main function reads n (number of test cases) and sets m =n. \n\nThen loops while (n--), calling solve each time. \n\nThe solve function's first line is brr[n] =-1. \n\nWait, but in the solve function, the first line uses the variable n, which is the original number of test cases. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nBecause in the main function, after the first test case, n is decremented. \n\nSo when solve is called the first time, the value of n is the original value minus 0 (since the loop is while(n--)), so the first call to solve has n as the original value, then n is decremented. \n\nWait, the loop is while (n--), which is equivalent to:\n\nwhile (n) {\n\n   solve();\n\n   n--;\n\n}\n\nWait no, the expression n-- is evaluated as follows: the value of n is used in the condition, then it is decremented. \n\nWait, the loop is while (n--). \n\nThe loop condition is evaluated as follows: \n\nThe value of n is checked. If it is non-zero, the loop body is executed. Then n is decremented. \n\nSo for example, if the initial n is 3:\n\nFirst iteration: check n (3) \u2192 true. execute solve(). then n becomes 2. \n\nSecond iteration: check n (2) \u2192 true. execute solve(). n becomes 1. \n\nThird iteration: check n (1) \u2192 true. execute solve(). n becomes 0. \n\nFourth iteration: check n (0) \u2192 false. loop ends. \n\nSo total of 3 iterations. \n\nBut in the solve function, the first line is brr[n] =-1. \n\nInitially, n is 3. \n\nFirst call to solve: n is 3 (before decrementing). So brr[3] =-1. \n\nThen after solve returns, n is decremented to 2. \n\nSecond call: n is 2 \u2192 brr[2] =-1. \n\nThird call: n is 1 \u2192 brr[1] =-1. \n\nSo the brr array is indexed by the original n value, which is incorrect. \n\nBecause the test cases are numbered from 0 to t-1, but the code is using the current value of n (which is decreasing) as the index. \n\nThis is a critical error. \n\nThe code's solve function is using the variable n (the original number of test cases) as an index into the brr array. \n\nThis is wrong. \n\nThe code's variables are mixed up. \n\nThe code's main function has:\n\nsigned main() {\n\n    cin >> n; m = n;\n\n    while (n--) {\n\n        solve();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the variable n is the number of test cases. \n\nIn the solve function, the first line is brr[n] =-1. \n\nBut during the first call to solve, n is the original value (say 5), then after the call, n is decremented. \n\nSo the first test case's result is stored in brr[5], the second in brr[4], etc. \n\nThis is incorrect because the brr array's indices should correspond to the test case number. \n\nThis is a major bug. \n\nTherefore, the code has multiple errors. \n\nBut the user's problem says to complete the code by filling in the missing lines. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code's TODO is the condition in the if statement. \n\nThe other errors (like the variable n being used incorrectly as an index, and the array not being initialized) are also present but perhaps the user expects us to focus on the TODO. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's author made a mistake in variable names. \n\nMaybe the code's solve function should use a local variable for the test case index. \n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the problem expects us to focus on the TODO part. \n\nAssuming that the code's other issues are not part of the problem and that the only missing part is the condition in the if statement, then the answer is \"arr[i] >=3\". \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's brr array is supposed to store the answer for each test case. \n\nThe code's solve function ends with cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\nBut since n is being decremented, the first test case's answer is stored in brr[original n], which is beyond the array's size. \n\nWait, the brr array is declared as size 200005. \n\nIf the original n is up to 1e4, then brr[n] would be out of bounds. \n\nThis is another critical error. \n\nThe code's brr array is of size 200005, but if the number of test cases is up to 1e4, then the indices would be okay (since 1e4 is less than 2e5). \n\nWait, 2e5 is 200000, so 1e4 is 10000, which is within the array's size. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nBut the index is using the original n value, which is the number of test cases. \n\nFor example, if there are 5 test cases, the first test case's answer is stored in brr[5], the second in brr[4], etc. \n\nThen, when the solve function is called for the first time, the first test case's answer is stored in brr[5], but when the code outputs it, it's correct because the first call's output is immediately after processing. \n\nWait, the code's solve function ends with cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\nSo during the first call, n is 5 (original value), so it outputs brr[5], which was just set. \n\nThen, after the first call, n is decremented to 4. \n\nThe second call uses n=4, so stores the answer in brr[4], and outputs it. \n\nSo the outputs are in the correct order. \n\nBecause the first test case's output is printed first, then the second, etc. \n\nSo the indexing is okay. \n\nTherefore, the main issue is the array initialization. \n\nThe code's solve function must initialize the array to zero before counting. \n\nThe code currently does not do that. \n\nThe code's current approach is to increment arr[e], but without initializing to zero first. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing the initialization loop. \n\nThe code's solve function should have:\n\nvoid solve() {\n\n    brr[n] = -1; \n\n    int len; \n\n    cin >> len; \n\n    // Initialize the array \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    int e; \n\n    for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n\n        cin >> e; \n\n        arr[e]++; \n\n    }\n\n    for (int i=1; i<=len; i++) {\n\n        if (arr[i] >=3) {\n\n            brr[n] =i; \n\n        }\n\n        arr[i] =0; \n\n    }\n\n    cout << brr[n] << '\\n'; \n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the initialization loop. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code given does not have this loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code includes adding this loop. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem says to output the missing code as plain text, not as markdown code. \n\nThe user's code's solve function has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo the missing code is both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's author forgot to initialize the array, but the problem requires us to fill in the condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's array is supposed to be initialized to zero before each test case. \n\nBut the code's current structure has the loop after processing that resets the array. \n\nTherefore, the code's array is properly reset after each test case, but not before. \n\nHence, the missing code is the initialization loop before reading the elements. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code given has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo the missing code is the condition and the initialization loop. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem says to output the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code includes both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's code's TODO is only the condition. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's author intended that the array is initialized to zero before each test case. \n\nWait, the code's solve function has the loop after processing that sets arr[i] =0. \n\nSo after processing, the array is reset. \n\nBut before processing, the array may have values from previous test cases. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing the initialization loop before processing. \n\nThe code's solve function is missing the initialization loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the initialization loop. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code's TODO is the condition. \n\nSo the missing code is both the initialization loop and the condition. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem says to output the missing code as plain text. \n\nThe user's code's solve function has the TODO in the if condition. \n\nSo the missing code is the condition and the initialization loop. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nPerhaps the code's author forgot the initialization loop, but the problem requires us to fill in the condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's array is initialized to zero elsewhere. \n\nWait, the code declares arr as a global array of size 200005. \n\nIn C++, global variables are initialized to zero by default. \n\nAh! That's an important point. \n\nGlobal variables in C++ are initialized to zero automatically. \n\nSo the array arr is initialized to all zeros at the start of the program. \n\nTherefore, the code does not need to initialize the array to zero before the first test case. \n\nBut after the first test case, the code's loop after processing sets arr[i] =0 for i up to len. \n\nWait, but after the first test case, the code's loop after processing sets arr[i] =0 for i from 1 to len. \n\nSo for the next test case, when the elements are read, the arr array for those indices are zero. \n\nBut for elements beyond the previous test case's len, their counts may have been left as zero (since they were not touched in previous test cases). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTest case 1 has len=3. \n\nThe code processes elements, and after that, loops from 1 to 3 and sets arr[i] =0. \n\nTest case 2 has len=5. \n\nThe elements can be up to 5. \n\nWhen processing the elements, the code increments arr[e]. \n\nFor e=4 and 5, arr[4] and arr[5] were initialized to zero (since they were not touched in previous test cases). \n\nBecause the global array is initialized to zero. \n\nWait, the global array is initialized to zero. \n\nSo the first time, when processing test case 1, the initial values of arr are all zero. \n\nAfter processing, the code's loop sets arr[1..3] to zero again. \n\nTest case 2 has len=5. \n\nThe code reads elements. \n\nFor e=4 and 5, arr[4] and arr[5] were zero (since they were not modified in previous test cases). \n\nSo the code's approach is correct. \n\nAh! Because the global array is initialized to zero, the code doesn't need to initialize it before each test case. \n\nThe only thing needed is to reset the array after each test case. \n\nThe code's current approach does that. \n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the condition in the if statement. \n\nThe condition should be (arr[i] >=3). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"arr[i] >=3\". \n\nThe other issues are not present because the global array is initialized to zero. \n\nSo the code's solve function is correct except for the condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill the TODO with \"arr[i] >=3\". \n\nSo the missing code is \"arr[i] >=3\"."
