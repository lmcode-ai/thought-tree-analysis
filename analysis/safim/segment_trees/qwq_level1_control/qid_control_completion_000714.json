So the first condition is already handled with if num >=1900. Then Division 2 is 1600 to 1899. The next condition is elif num >=1600, which makes sense because if it's not Division 1, then checking if it's 1600 or higher would put it in Division 2. That's correct. Now the next part is for Division 3, which is 1400 to 1599. So the code has an elif, but the condition is missing. The current code has \"elif # TODO: Your code here print(\"Division 3\")\". Wait, the print is attached to the elif? That's probably a typo. The original code might have a syntax error there. Oh right, the user probably meant to write the condition between the elif and the print. So I need to fix that. The Division 3 condition is when the number is between 1400 and 1599, inclusive.
