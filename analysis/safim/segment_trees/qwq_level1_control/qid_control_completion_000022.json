Else \u2192 set a[i]'s bit to false, and set all p's bits to true. Wait, but in the code, the code is in the else part (bits[i][j] is null). Wait, the code's code for the else part (when bits[i][j] is neither true nor false):\n\nvar wasFalse = false;\n\nfor (k from ind to indNext):\n\n   p = st[k].Item2;\n\n   if (bits[p][j] == false) \u2192 then wasFalse = true; break;\n\nif (wasFalse):\n\n   bits[i][j] = true;\n\nelse:\n\n   bits[i][j] = false;\n\n   for each p in those statements \u2192 set bits[p][j] = true; Wait, but in the code, the code is written as:\n\nif (wasFalse) \u2192 set bits[i][j] to true.\n\nelse \u2192 set bits[i][j] to false, and then loop through the statements and set bits[p][j] to true. Wait, but why set the p's bits to true? Because if a[i]'s bit is set to 0, then for each p in the statements (i, p, x), the OR must have the j-th bit set. Since a[i]'s bit is 0, then a[p]'s must be 1. Therefore, the code is enforcing that. But how does this affect other constraints? Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach. Now, the missing code is in the part where bits[i][j] is false (the second if clause). The code is in the loop over the statements starting at i (ind to indNext).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what the missing code is in the given C# program. The problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest array that satisfies all the given OR constraints. Let me look at the code structure and see where the TODO is.\n\nThe code is processing each bit from 0 to 29 (since x can be up to 2^30). The main part where the TODO is located is in the loop over each bit j and each index i. The code is trying to determine the bits for each element in the array based on the constraints.\n\nLooking at the code inside the for loop for each j (bit position):\n\nThe code first checks if bits[i][j] is true, so it skips. Then, if it's false, it loops through some constraints (from ind to indNext) and sets bits[p][j] to true. Wait, but why? Hmm, maybe that's part of enforcing the constraints. \n\nWait, the problem is that each statement says a_i OR a_j = x. So for each bit in x, if the bit is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have that bit as 0. If the bit is 1, then at least one of a_i or a_j has that bit set.\n\nThe code first processes all the constraints to set bits where necessary. The initial loop over the statements and bits:\n\nIn the first part, for each statement (ind1, ind2, x), if ind1 == ind2, then the OR is a_i | a_i = a_i, so x must equal a_i. So they set the bits of a_i to exactly x. \n\nOtherwise, they store the statements in 'st' list. Then, in the loop over each bit, they check for each statement whether the x's bit is 0. If so, both bits must be 0. So they set bits[from][i] and bits[to][i] to false. \n\nBut after that, there's more processing. The code then sorts the statements (st.Sort()), but I'm not sure how that's done. Wait, the code says st.Sort(); but the elements are tuples of (ind1, ind2, x). Since the tuples are sorted, perhaps they are sorted by their first element (ind1) and then second (ind2). That might be important for processing in order.\n\nThen, the main loop is for each i from 0 to n-1. For each i, they look at all the statements where the first element is i (since indNext is the next index where the first element is beyond i). \n\nInside the bit loop (for each j), the code is trying to determine the value of the j-th bit for a[i]. \n\nLooking at the code where the TODO is: \n\nIn the case where bits[i][j] is false (already set to false?), then for each k in ind to indNext (statements starting at i), the code is checking if p (the second element of the statement) has some condition. The code is supposed to set bits[p][j] to true? Or maybe there's a condition here. \n\nWait, the code is in the part where bits[i][j] is false. The code loops through each of the statements starting at i (since ind is tracking the current position in the sorted list). For each such statement (which is (i, p, x)), since the first element is i, the second is p. \n\nWait, the statements are stored as (ind1, ind2, x), and when they were added, if ind1 > ind2, they swapped them. So in the list 'st', the ind1 is always <= ind2. So when sorted, they are ordered by ind1 first, then ind2. \n\nSo when processing i, the statements in the current range (ind to indNext) are all those where the first element is i, and the second is varying. \n\nThe code is in the case where bits[i][j] is false. So for each such statement (i, p, x), since the bit j of x is 0 (since we already handled the case where x's bit is 0 by setting both bits to false?), but maybe not. Wait, the first loop over all statements and bits already handled the case where x's bit is 0. So in that case, both bits are set to false. \n\nWait, the first loop over all bits and statements:\n\nfor each bit i (from 0 to 29), and for each statement in st:\n\nif (x & b) == 0 (where b is 1 << j?), then set both bits[from][j] and bits[to][j] to false. \n\nWait, the code uses 'b' as 1 << j, but in the loop, the code is:\n\nlong b = 1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <30; i++, b <<=1) {\n\n   foreach (var t in st) {\n\n      from = t.Item1, to = t.Item2, x = t.Item3;\n\n      if ( (x & b) ==0 ) {\n\n          bits[from, i] = false;\n\n          bits[to, i] = false;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, here, the 'b' is 1 << i, so for each bit position j (since the loop is over i from 0 to 29, and b is shifted each time). So for each bit j (0-based), the code checks all statements. For each statement, if the x's j-th bit is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have that bit 0. So the code sets their bits to false. \n\nSo after this, the bits array has some bits set to true or false. The remaining bits are those that are not yet determined. \n\nNow, the code proceeds to process each position i, and for each bit j, determine the value of a[i]'s j-th bit. \n\nThe code is in the part where bits[i][j] is not yet determined (maybe null?), but in the code, the bits are initialized as nullable booleans. \n\nWait, the initial bits array is a 2D array of nullable bools. So when they are not set, they are null. \n\nSo the code first processes the constraints where x's bit is 0, setting the bits to false. \n\nNow, for the bits that are not yet set (i.e., null), they need to be determined in a way that satisfies the OR constraints. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be for each position i and each bit j, decide whether to set it to 0 or 1, ensuring that all constraints are met, and choosing the lex smallest array. \n\nThe lex smallest array is the one where the first differing element is as small as possible. So for each position, we want to set the bits as low as possible, but still satisfy all constraints. \n\nThe code's logic for each bit j and position i is as follows:\n\nIf the bit is already set to true, we can skip. \n\nIf it's set to false, then for all statements starting at i (i.e., the first element is i), the second element p must have their j-th bit set to true. Because, since a[i]'s j-th bit is 0 (since bits[i][j] is false), then for the OR of a[i] and a[p] to be x (which has the j-th bit set?), but wait, no. Wait, the original constraint is a_i | a_j = x. \n\nWait, the statements are stored as (ind1, ind2, x). So for each such statement, the OR of a[ind1] and a[ind2] must equal x. \n\nSuppose the j-th bit of x is 1. Then at least one of a[ind1] or a[ind2] must have that bit set. \n\nIf the j-th bit of x is 0, then both must have it 0, which was already handled. \n\nSo for the bits where the x's j-th bit is 1, the constraints are that at least one of the two has the bit set. \n\nThe code is now trying to handle the bits where the x's j-th bit is 1. \n\nThe code proceeds as follows:\n\nFor each i (current position), and for each bit j:\n\nIf bits[i][j] is true: skip. \n\nIf it's false: then for all statements starting at i (i.e., the first element is i), the second element p must have their j-th bit set to true. Because since a[i]'s bit is 0, the other element must have it set. \n\nWait, but in the code, when bits[i][j] is false, the code loops through each of the statements starting at i (ind to indNext), and for each p (the second element of the statement), sets bits[p][j] to true. \n\nWait, but why? Because if a[i]'s bit is 0, then for the OR of a[i] and a[p] to have the j-th bit set (since x's bit is 1 here?), then a[p] must have the bit set. \n\nWait, but the x's j-th bit could be 1. So the OR must be 1. Since a[i]'s bit is 0, a[p] must have it set. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the code is enforcing that for all such statements, the p's bit must be set. \n\nSo the code is correct here. \n\nNow, the next part is when bits[i][j] is null (i.e., not yet determined). \n\nIn that case, the code checks if any of the p's (the second elements in the statements starting at i) have their bits[j] set to false. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\nvar wasFalse = false;\n\nfor (k in ind to indNext):\n\n   p = st[k].Item2;\n\n   if bits[p][j] is false \u2192 then wasFalse is true. \n\nIf wasFalse is true, then that means that for some p in the statements starting at i, the p's bit is 0. \n\nWait, but in that case, since the OR of a[i] and a[p] must be x (which has the j-th bit set to 1?), then a[i] must have the bit set. \n\nBecause if a[p]'s bit is 0, then a[i]'s bit must be 1. \n\nSo in this case, the code sets bits[i][j] to true. \n\nOtherwise (if none of the p's bits are false), then the code can choose to set a[i]'s bit to 0, but then all the p's bits must be set to 1. \n\nWait, but how does that work? \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (wasFalse) \u2192 set bits[i][j] to true. \n\nElse \u2192 set bits[i][j] to false, and set all p's bits to true. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nIf none of the p's bits are set to false, then the OR constraints for those statements (i, p, x) must have their j-th bit set. \n\nSo the OR of a[i] and a[p] must have the j-th bit set. \n\nIf a[i]'s bit is 0, then a[p] must have it set. \n\nIf a[i]'s bit is 1, then it's okay. \n\nTo choose the lex smallest array, we want to set a[i]'s bit to 0 if possible. \n\nBut if we set it to 0, then all the p's bits must be set to 1. \n\nBut if we set it to 1, then the p's bits can be anything (as long as their OR is 1). \n\nTo choose the lex smallest, we want to set a[i]'s bit to 0 if possible. \n\nBut how do we know if that's possible? \n\nThe code's logic here is: \n\nIf any of the p's bits are already set to false (bits[p][j] is false), then a[i]'s bit must be set to 1. Because if a[p]'s bit is 0, then a[i]'s must be 1. \n\nOtherwise, if none of the p's bits are set to 0, then we can choose to set a[i]'s bit to 0, but then all the p's bits must be set to 1. \n\nWait, but in that case, the code sets bits[i][j] to false, and then sets all p's bits to true. \n\nBut why? Because if we set a[i]'s bit to 0, then for each p in the statements starting at i, the p's bit must be 1. \n\nSo the code is enforcing that. \n\nBut in this case, the code is trying to choose the lex smallest array. \n\nSetting a[i]'s bit to 0 is better (since lex order prefers smaller numbers). \n\nSo the code does that. \n\nHowever, this might affect other constraints. \n\nWait, but the code is processing the bits in order, and for each position i, processing the statements starting at i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to process the constraints in a way that for each i, the bits are set as low as possible, but ensuring that all constraints are met. \n\nNow, the missing code is in the part where bits[i][j] is null (so the code is in the else clause of the first two ifs). \n\nWait, the code is in the part where bits[i][j] is not true or false (so it's null). \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nif (bits[i][j] == true) \u2192 skip.\n\nelse if (bits[i][j] == false) \u2192 then for each statement starting at i, set p's bit to true. \n\nelse \u2192 the else part (the code with wasFalse). \n\nWait, the code in the else part (when bits[i][j] is null) is:\n\nCheck if any of the p's bits are false. \n\nIf yes \u2192 then a[i]'s bit must be set to true. \n\nElse \u2192 set a[i]'s bit to false, and set all p's bits to true. \n\nWait, but in the code, the code is in the else part (bits[i][j] is null). \n\nWait, the code's code for the else part (when bits[i][j] is neither true nor false):\n\nvar wasFalse = false;\n\nfor (k from ind to indNext):\n\n   p = st[k].Item2;\n\n   if (bits[p][j] == false) \u2192 then wasFalse = true; break;\n\nif (wasFalse):\n\n   bits[i][j] = true;\n\nelse:\n\n   bits[i][j] = false;\n\n   for each p in those statements \u2192 set bits[p][j] = true;\n\nWait, but in the code, the code is written as:\n\nif (wasFalse) \u2192 set bits[i][j] to true.\n\nelse \u2192 set bits[i][j] to false, and then loop through the statements and set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nWait, but why set the p's bits to true? Because if a[i]'s bit is set to 0, then for each p in the statements (i, p, x), the OR must have the j-th bit set. Since a[i]'s bit is 0, then a[p]'s must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the code is enforcing that. \n\nBut how does this affect other constraints? \n\nHmm, perhaps this is the correct approach. \n\nNow, the missing code is in the part where bits[i][j] is false (the second if clause). \n\nThe code is in the loop over the statements starting at i (ind to indNext). \n\nThe code is looping through each of those statements (each is (i, p, x)), and for each p, the code needs to set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nfor (int k = ind; k < indNext; k++) {\n\n   var p = st[k].Item2;\n\n   if(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\n       bits[p, j] = true;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is in the case where bits[i][j] is false. \n\nSo, since a[i]'s j-th bit is 0, then for each statement (i, p, x), the j-th bit of x must be 1 (since otherwise, the code would have already set both bits to 0). \n\nWait, but the code already handled the case where x's bit is 0. \n\nSo in this case, the j-th bit of x must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the OR of a[i] and a[p] must have the j-th bit set. Since a[i]'s bit is 0, a[p]'s must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the code must set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nSo the condition here is always true, so the code should set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is just to set bits[p][j] to true unconditionally. \n\nWait, but the code has an if statement there. So the TODO is to replace the condition with something that is always true. \n\nWait, the code is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\n    bits[p, j] = true;\n\nSo the condition should be true. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nif (true) \u2192 but that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the bit for p is not already set. \n\nWait, but in the case where bits[i][j] is false, then for each p in the statements starting at i, the p's bit must be set to true. \n\nBut maybe some of the p's bits are already set to true or false. \n\nWait, if bits[p][j] is already true, then no problem. \n\nIf it's false, then that's a conflict. \n\nWait, but how can that happen? \n\nSuppose in a previous step, for some other i', the code set bits[p][j] to false. \n\nBut that would mean that in some other constraint involving p, the bit must be 0. \n\nHmm, but that would conflict with the current requirement that it must be 1. \n\nWait, but the problem states that all the constraints are satisfiable. So such a conflict can't exist. \n\nTherefore, the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be true. \n\nSo the missing code is to have the condition evaluate to true. \n\nBut how to write that in C#? \n\nThe code can be written as:\n\nif (true) \u2192 but that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the bit for p is not already set. \n\nWait, but the code may have already set bits[p][j] to true in a previous step. \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the code is processing each bit j for each i in order. \n\nWait, the code is processing the bits in order of the bits (from 0 to 29?), and for each bit, processing each i in order. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the bit for p is not yet set (i.e., null). \n\nWait, but in the case where bits[i][j] is false, then the code is in the second if clause (bits[i][j] == false). \n\nThe code is processing the statements starting at i. \n\nThe code is trying to set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nBut if bits[p][j] is already set to false, that would be a conflict. \n\nBut since the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable, this can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be true. \n\nSo the missing code is simply to have the condition evaluate to true. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nif (true) \u2192 but in C#, you can't have an empty condition. \n\nWait, the code is written as:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\nSo the code inside the if must be replaced with a condition that is always true. \n\nThe simplest way is to remove the condition, but since it's an if statement, perhaps the code should be:\n\nif (bits[p, j] == null || bits[p, j] == false) \u2192 but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be:\n\nif (true) \u2192 but that's redundant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the current statement's x has the j-th bit set. \n\nWait, but the code is in the part where the j-th bit of x is 1 (since otherwise, the code would have set both bits to 0). \n\nWait, no. The code first processed all statements and for each bit, if the x's bit is 0, set both bits to 0. \n\nSo in this part (the second if clause), the bits[i][j] is false (so the j-th bit of x must have been 0?), but that can't be. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the code in the first loop (over all statements and bits) sets bits[from][j] and bits[to][j] to false only when the x's j-th bit is 0. \n\nSo in this case, if the code is in the second if clause (bits[i][j] == false), that means that the j-th bit of x for some statement must have been 0, and thus the code set it to false. \n\nWait, but then the OR of a_i and a_j must be x, which has the j-th bit 0. \n\nSo in that case, both bits must be 0. \n\nWait, but in this code's case, the code is processing a statement (i, p, x) where the j-th bit of x is 0. \n\nWait, but in that case, the code would have already set both bits[i][j] and bits[p][j] to false. \n\nSo why are we in the second if clause (bits[i][j] is false) for this statement? \n\nWait, perhaps the code is in a different scenario. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is in the case where the j-th bit of x is 1, but the code has set bits[i][j] to false for some other reason. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is in the case where the j-th bit of x is 1, but the code has set bits[i][j] to false because of some other constraint. \n\nWait, but that would violate the constraint. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. \n\nThe code's second if clause (bits[i][j] == false) is for when the bit is set to false. \n\nIn that case, for each statement starting at i (i.e., the first element is i), the second element p must have their j-th bit set to true. \n\nBecause the OR of a[i] (which has the bit 0) and a[p] must have the bit set (since the x's bit must be 1 here). \n\nWait, but how do we know that the x's bit is 1 here? \n\nAh, because if the x's bit was 0, then both bits would have been set to false in the first loop. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the x's j-th bit must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be true. \n\nSo the missing code is to have the condition evaluate to true. \n\nIn C#, the code can be written as:\n\nif (true) \n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the current statement's x has the j-th bit set. \n\nWait, but how to get the x here. \n\nWait, the code is in the loop over the statements starting at i (ind to indNext). \n\nEach of these statements is stored in st as (i, p, x). \n\nBut the code is in the loop over the statements for the current i. \n\nWait, the code is in the loop for each k from ind to indNext, which are the statements where the first element is i. \n\nEach such statement has a x value. \n\nThe j-th bit of x must be 1, because otherwise, the code would have set both bits to 0. \n\nTherefore, the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be true. \n\nSo the missing code is simply to have the condition evaluate to true. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nif (true) \n\nBut in C#, you can't have an empty condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the current statement's x has the j-th bit set. \n\nWait, but how to get the x here. \n\nThe current statement is st[k], which is a tuple of (ind1, ind2, x). \n\nSo in the loop over k, the current statement is st[k], so the x is st[k].Item3. \n\nThe j-th bit of x (since b is 1 << j) can be checked as (x & (1 << j)) != 0. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variable 'b' is 1 << j. \n\nWait, in the outer loop, the code has:\n\nlong b = 1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < 30; i++, b <<= 1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the loop variable here is i, but the code uses 'i' as the bit index. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is for each bit j (from 0 to 29). \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0; i < 30; i++, b <<=1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nSo the loop variable is i, but the bit is i. \n\nSo in the current code's context, the bit is j (the outer loop variable is i, but in the code's current context, the loop for j is part of the outer loop. Wait, no, the code's current loop is inside the for (int j=0; j <30; j++, b <<=1) loop. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each j from 0 to 29:\n\n      ... \n\nWait, no, the code's structure is:\n\nThe outer loop is for each i from 0 to n-1 (the for (int i=0; i <n; i++) loop). \n\nInside that, for each j from 0 to 29 (the for (int j=0; j <30; j++, b <<=1) loop). \n\nWait, the code's code for the j loop is:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < 30; j++, b <<= 1) {\n\n   if (bits[i, j] == true) \u2192 continue;\n\n   else if (bits[i, j] == false) \u2192 then loop through the statements and set bits[p][j] to true. \n\n   else \u2192 ... \n\n}\n\nSo in the case where bits[i][j] is false, the code is in the second if clause. \n\nThe code is looping through each of the statements starting at i (ind to indNext). \n\nEach of these statements is (i, p, x). \n\nThe j-th bit of x must be 1 (since otherwise, the code would have set both bits to 0). \n\nTherefore, the code can safely set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be true. \n\nSo the missing code is to have the condition evaluate to true. \n\nIn C#, the code can be written as:\n\nif (true) \n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to check if the current statement's x has the j-th bit set. \n\nWait, but how to get the x here. \n\nThe current statement is st[k], so the x is st[k].Item3. \n\nThe j-th bit of x is (x & (1 << j)) !=0. \n\nBut since the code is in the case where the j-th bit of x must be 1 (because otherwise, the code would have set both bits to 0), this condition will be true. \n\nTherefore, the code can check that. \n\nSo the condition would be:\n\nif ( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nBut since b is 1 << j, this checks if the j-th bit of x is set. \n\nYes, this makes sense. \n\nBecause in this case, the j-th bit of x must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the code should check that. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nBecause if the j-th bit of x is 0, then the code would have already set both bits to false. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the j-th bit of x must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the condition is always true. \n\nBut to make sure, the code can check it. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nWait, but in the code's current context, the variable 'b' is 1 << j. \n\nWait, in the code's current loop, the 'b' is initialized as 1, and for each j, it's shifted left. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nvar indNext = ind;\n\nwhile (indNext < st.Count && st[indNext].Item1 == i)\n\n    indNext++;\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < 30; j++, b <<= 1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the 'b' is declared outside the j loop. \n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nInside the for (int i=0; i <n; i++) loop:\n\nvar indNext = ... \n\nfor (int j=0; j <30; j++, b <<=1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the 'b' is declared as long b =1; before the j loop. \n\nWait, the code's code for the j loop is:\n\nb = 1;\n\nfor(int j=0; j<30; j++, b <<=1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nInside the for (int i=0; i <n; i++) loop:\n\nThe code has:\n\nb = 1;\n\nfor (int j=0; j <30; j++, b <<=1) {\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nAh, right. So for each i, the 'b' is reset to 1, and then for each j, it's shifted left. \n\nTherefore, for each j, the 'b' is 1 << j. \n\nTherefore, the j-th bit of x is (x & b) !=0. \n\nTherefore, the condition can be written as (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nBut since the code is in the case where the j-th bit of x must be 1 (because otherwise, the code would have set both bits to 0), this condition will always be true. \n\nTherefore, the code can safely use this condition. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nBut how to get the current statement's x? \n\nThe current statement is st[k], so the x is st[k].Item3. \n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nTherefore, the code inside the if statement is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nthen set bits[p][j] to true. \n\nThis ensures that only when the j-th bit of x is set (which it must be, since otherwise the code would have set both bits to 0), the code proceeds to set the p's bit. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nSo the code line is:\n\nif( (st[k].Item3 & b) !=0 )\n\nThus, the missing code is that condition."
