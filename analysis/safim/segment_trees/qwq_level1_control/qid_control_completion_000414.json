Hmm, but how can we compute this? Alternatively, let's think of the difference between consecutive elements. Suppose we have the array a. Let's consider the differences between a[i] and a[i-1]. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think of the example given in the problem. In the note, the second test case example's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Wait, let's see how that works. The process steps are given, and the final array is as such. Looking at the array, the first element is 2, which is higher than the next. The second is -1, third -1, fourth 0. Hmm, perhaps the key is that the array must satisfy certain conditions. Another idea: Let's model the required conditions. The pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me think of the total number of times the pointer moves right and left. Each right move contributes +1 to the current cell, and each left move (from that cell) subtracts 1. The total for each cell a[i] is (right moves from i) - (left moves from i). But the total displacement must be zero. Alternatively, the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. Wait, because each right move is +1, each left is -1, so total steps must sum to zero. So total right steps = total left steps. But how does that help with the array? Alternatively, let's think of the path as a walk starting and ending at 0. The array's elements are determined by the number of times the pointer was on each position and the direction taken. Hmm, perhaps the key is to model the required array's properties. Let me think of the array's elements. Let's consider the cumulative sum or something similar. Wait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track the required \"balance\" or something. Let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. To reach position i, you must have moved right i times more than left. Wait, but the path can be back and forth. Alternatively, let's consider the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the required array as a[1..n]. The pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based?), but maybe the problem uses 0-based. Wait, in the code, the input is read as for i from 1 to n, so probably 1-based. Wait, in the code's solve() function, the loop is for i from 1 to n. So the array is 1-based here. Wait, the problem says the array is given as a_1, a_2,...a_n. So the code is using 1-based. Hmm.",

The total displacement is sum over (R_i - L_i) for all i except the last? Not sure. Wait, the total displacement is (sum of R_i for all i) - (sum of L_i for all i) ) = 0, since the pointer ends where it started. So sum R_i = sum L_i.

Alternatively, you can do nothing. Since the initial array is all zeros, so the answer is yes. Another test case: array [ -1, 1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative sums: -1, 0. The first cumulative sum is negative, so according to the idea, it would be invalid. Indeed, can this array be formed? Let's see. The first element is -1. To get a[1] =-1, the pointer must have moved left from position 1. But the pointer starts at 1. You can't move left from 1. Hence, it's impossible. So the condition that cumulative sums are non-negative would reject this case. So this suggests that the condition is that the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative. Wait, but how exactly? Wait, the cumulative sum here would be the sum of a[1] to a[i].",

Wait, let's see: \n\nThe third element must be 0. To get a[3] =0, the number of right moves from 2 to 3 must equal the number of left moves from 3 to 2.

Then, for a[2], the right moves from 2 (to 3) is 1, and left moves from 2 (to 1) must be such that a[2] = (right moves) - (left moves). Suppose a[2] is -1. So right moves from 2 is 1, left moves from 2 must be 2. So total left moves from 2 is 2. So the path could be: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u21921). Move left to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192-1). Move right to 2 again (a[1] becomes 2). Move right to 3 (a[2] becomes 0). Move left to 2 (a[3] becomes -1). Move left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1 again). Move right to 2 (a[1] becomes 3). Move left to 1 (a[2] becomes -2). Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. Wait, let's see: \n\nThe desired a[3] is 0. To achieve that, the number of right moves from 2 to 3 must equal the number of left moves from 3 to 2. Suppose you have one right and one left. Then, a[3] =1-1=0. For a[2], the right moves from 2 (to 3) is 1, and left moves from 2 (to 1) must be such that a[2] = (right moves) - (left moves) \u2192 1 - L = -1 \u2192 L = 2. So the left moves from 2 must be 2.

Move right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, a3 becomes 1). Move left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). Move left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). Now the array is [2, -1, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Another path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a1=1). Move right to 3 (a2=1, a3=1). Move left to 2 (a3=0). Move left to 1 (a2=0). Now the array is [1, 0, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Another path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a1=1). Move left to 1 (a2=-1). Move right to 2 again (a1=2). Move left to 1 (a2=-2). Now, the array is [2, -2, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Perhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. If that's the case, then the conditions are sufficient. Because the array [1, -1, 0] would have met the conditions but is not possible. Wait, but why?

Suppose the current element is a[i]. The sum up to i is sum.

The total sum must be zero. The other condition is that the path can be constructed such that the pointer returns to the first position. The key is that the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. The path can be represented as a sequence of steps. The array's elements are determined by the number of right and left moves from each position. The path must be such that the net right moves equal net left moves. The cumulative sum condition (prefix sums non-negative) is necessary but not sufficient? Wait, in the case of the array",

Let me try again to find a path for [1, -1, 0]. The desired array is a[1]=1, a[2]=-1, a[3]=0. Let me try this path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a1=1). Move left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). Now, the pointer is at 1. To get a3 to 0, we need to move to 3 and back. So: \n\nMove right to 2 (a1 becomes 2). Move right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, a3 becomes 1). Move left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). Move left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). Now the array is [2, -1, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Another path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a1=1). Move right to 3 (a2=1, a3=1). Move left to 2 (a3=0). Move left to 1 (a2=0). Now the array is [1, 0, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Another path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a1=1). Move left to 1 (a2=-1). Move right to 2 again (a1=2). Move left to 1 (a2=-2). Now the array is [2, -2, 0]. Not desired. Hmm. Perhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. Thus, the conditions are sufficient. So the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum is zero. 2. All prefix sums are non-negative. Thus, the code needs to check these two conditions. Now, looking back at the provided code: The code has a loop that reads each element and adds to sum. In the loop for i from 1 to n: \n\nfor each element temp: \n\nsum += temp. Then, for i>1: \n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) \u2192 ans = \"No\". Also, if(sum==0 && temp ! =0) \u2192 ans = \"No\".",

If that previous sum is zero, then the current element (temp) must be non-negative. Because otherwise, the prefix sum up to i would be negative. Ah! That makes sense. So the condition should be: \n\nif (sum - temp ==0 and temp <0 \u2192 \"No\". Because if the sum up to i-1 is zero, then adding a negative temp would make the prefix sum up to i negative.

But the example is valid. So this suggests that the suffix condition is not needed. Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of the pointer's path. The pointer starts at position 1. Each move to the right increases the current position's value and moves to the next. Each move to the left decreases the current position's value and moves to the previous. The final position must be 1. The array's elements are the net of right and left moves from each position. Let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. The path must start and end at 1. The total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. The array's elements are a[i] = (number of right moves from i) - (number of left moves from i). The path must form a closed walk. Now, the key is to model the conditions on the array. Let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position of the pointer. We can model the path as a sequence of moves, but for large n, we need an O(n) solution.",

Let me think of the path. The path must be such that whenever you are at position i, you can choose to move left or right (if possible). Another idea: Let's model the required conditions by considering the path's \"balance\". Suppose we track the current position of the pointer. Let's think of the path as a sequence of moves. The key is that the array must be such that the path can be constructed in a way that the pointer ends at 0. Alternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's note example. Let me think of the array's elements in terms of the required path. Suppose we process the array from left to right.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the Java code for this problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through a series of specific operations, with the pointer ending back at the first element. The operations are either moving forward (increasing current element by 1 and moving next) or moving backward (decreasing current by 1 and moving previous). \n\nHmm, the key here is to model the possible changes and constraints. Let's think about the operations. Each forward step (operation 1) increases the current element and moves right. Each backward step (operation 2) decreases the current and moves left. The pointer must end at the first element.\n\nWait, the pointer starts at the first element. So all operations must result in it coming back to the first element. \n\nLet me think of the process as a sequence of moves. Each time you do an operation 1, you move right, and each operation 2 moves left. The total movement must result in the pointer returning to the start. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the net effect on the array and the path taken. Let's think of the array's elements as the result of the operations. \n\nLet me consider the difference between consecutive elements. Because each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current element and then move. Similarly, moving backward subtracts 1 and moves left. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to track the path of the pointer. Let's think of the pointer's path as a sequence of steps. Each step is either +1 (forward) or -1 (backward). But the path must start and end at position 0 (the first element). \n\nWait, the pointer starts at position 0. The path must end at position 0. So the total displacement must be zero. \n\nBut how does this relate to the array's values? Each time you perform an operation 1 (forward), you increase the current element by 1. So every time you are on a position and move forward, that position's value increases by 1. Similarly, when moving backward (operation 2), you decrease the current element by 1. \n\nWait, the operations are: \n\nOperation 1: if not last, increase current by 1, then move to next. \n\nOperation 2: if not first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous. \n\nSo each time you do an operation 1, you add 1 to the current cell and move right. Each operation 2 subtracts 1 from current and moves left. \n\nThe total number of times you go right and left must balance so that the pointer ends at the start. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required conditions on the array elements. Let me think of the array as the sum of all the increments and decrements made at each position. \n\nLet me think of the path of the pointer. Let's denote the path as a sequence of positions. Each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but constrained by the array's boundaries. \n\nThe total displacement must be zero. \n\nBut how does this affect the array's elements? Each time the pointer is on a position, the number of times it was part of an operation 1 (moving right) minus the number of times it was part of an operation 2 (moving left) gives the value of the array at that position. \n\nWait, more precisely: \n\nEach time the pointer is on position i and does an operation 1 (moving to i+1), that adds +1 to a[i]. \n\nEach time the pointer is on position i and does an operation 2 (moving to i-1), that subtracts 1 from a[i]. \n\nSo the value of a[i] is equal to (number of times the pointer was on i and moved right) minus (number of times it was on i and moved left). \n\nBut the path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the required conditions by looking at the differences between consecutive elements. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let's model the net movement. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: Let's consider the required array a. Let's process the array from left to right, keeping track of some variables. \n\nSuppose we track the current position of the pointer. But since the path can be complex, maybe there's a pattern in the array's elements that must hold. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the process as a series of moves. The pointer starts at 0. Each operation moves it either right or left. The total number of right moves must equal the number of left moves plus some? Wait, no. The total displacement must be zero. So the total right steps minus left steps must be zero. \n\nWait, each right step is +1, each left is -1. So the total sum of steps must be zero. \n\nBut how does this relate to the array's elements? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through that cell moving right versus left. \n\nWait, for each cell i (except the first?), the value a[i] is equal to (number of times the pointer was on i and moved right) minus (number of times it was on i and moved left). \n\nWait, but when moving right from i to i+1, that contributes +1 to a[i]. When moving left from i to i-1, that contributes -1 to a[i]. \n\nSo the total for a[i] is (number of right moves from i) minus (number of left moves from i). \n\nHmm, but how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the path of the pointer. Let's model the path as a sequence of positions. Let's denote the path as a sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_k where p_0 = 0 and p_k = 0. \n\nEach step from p_j to p_{j+1} is either +1 or -1. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times the pointer was on i and moved right (to i+1) is equal to the number of times the path goes from i to i+1. Similarly, the number of times it moved left from i is the number of times it goes from i to i-1. \n\nThe value a[i] is equal to (number of right moves from i) minus (number of left moves from i). \n\nHmm, but how can we compute this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the difference between consecutive elements. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let's consider the differences between a[i] and a[i-1]. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think of the example given in the problem. \n\nIn the note, the second test case example's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nWait, let's see how that works. \n\nThe process steps are given, and the final array is as such. \n\nLooking at the array, the first element is 2, which is higher than the next. The second is -1, third -1, fourth 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the array must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nAnother idea: Let's model the required conditions. \n\nThe pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nLet me think of the total number of times the pointer moves right and left. \n\nEach right move contributes +1 to the current cell, and each left move (from that cell) subtracts 1. \n\nThe total for each cell a[i] is (right moves from i) - (left moves from i). \n\nBut the total displacement must be zero. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. \n\nWait, because each right move is +1, each left is -1, so total steps must sum to zero. \n\nSo total right steps = total left steps. \n\nBut how does that help with the array? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a walk starting and ending at 0. The array's elements are determined by the number of times the pointer was on each position and the direction taken. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required array's properties. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements. Let's consider the cumulative sum or something similar. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track the required \"balance\" or something. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. To reach position i, you must have moved right i times more than left. \n\nWait, but the path can be back and forth. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the required array as a[1..n]. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based?), but maybe the problem uses 0-based. Wait, in the code, the input is read as for i from 1 to n, so probably 1-based. \n\nWait, in the code's solve() function, the loop is for i from 1 to n. So the array is 1-based here. \n\nWait, the problem says the array is given as a_1, a_2,...a_n. So the code is using 1-based. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nSuppose we track the current position of the pointer. But since the path can be complex, perhaps we can model the necessary conditions based on the array's elements. \n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total for a[i] is (number of right moves from i) minus (number of left moves from i). \n\nNow, the total number of right moves from i must be >=0, and similarly for left moves. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let's model the required a array in terms of the path. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of steps. Let's consider the net effect on each position. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nThe key is that the array must satisfy certain parity conditions and the sum must be zero. \n\nWait, the sum of all elements must be zero? Because every operation either adds 1 (when moving right) or subtracts 1 (when moving left). Each operation contributes a net of 0 to the total sum. Because when you move right, you add 1 to a[i], but moving left from i would subtract 1. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, each operation 1 (right) adds +1 to a[i], and the total sum increases by 1. \n\nEach operation 2 (left) subtracts 1 from a[i], so the total sum decreases by 1. \n\nSo the total sum of the array is equal to (number of operation 1 steps) minus (number of operation 2 steps). \n\nBut since the pointer must end at the start, the total displacement is zero. \n\nThe total displacement is (number of right steps) - (number of left steps) = 0. \n\nSo the number of right steps equals the number of left steps. \n\nTherefore, the total sum of the array is (R - L) where R is the number of right steps and L the left steps. But since R = L, the total sum must be zero. \n\nAh, so the first condition is that the sum of all elements must be zero. \n\nThe code already checks that in the end. \n\nBut there must be more conditions. \n\nIn the code's current solve() function, the loop over the elements is checking some conditions. The problem is in the \"if (i>1)\" block. \n\nThe code has a \"sum\" variable which is accumulating the elements. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is: \n\n- For each element in the array (starting from i=1 to n), it adds to sum. \n\n- Then, in the loop, for i>1, there is a condition that if sum ==0 and temp !=0, then ans is \"No\". \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track some cumulative condition. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the array must be such that for all positions except the first, the cumulative sum up to that point must not be negative? Or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the array must satisfy that the difference between consecutive elements follows certain constraints. \n\nWait, let me think of the process. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a sequence of moves. Let's think of the path as a walk starting at 0, ending at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell. Each time you move left, subtract 1 from current. \n\nThe array's elements are the total of these operations. \n\nLet me think of the array as a_i = (number of times the pointer was on i and moved right) - (number of times it was on i and moved left). \n\nHmm, but how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the following: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of times the pointer moves right from position i as R_i, and left from position i as L_i. \n\nThen, a[i] = R_i - L_i. \n\nThe total displacement is sum over (R_i - L_i) for all i except the last? Not sure. \n\nWait, the total displacement is (sum of R_i for all i) - (sum of L_i for all i) ) = 0, since the pointer ends where it started. \n\nSo sum R_i = sum L_i. \n\nAlso, the total sum of a[i] is sum (R_i - L_i) = (sum R_i) - (sum L_i) = 0. Which matches the first condition. \n\nSo the sum being zero is necessary. \n\nBut there must be other conditions. \n\nLet me think of the path. The path must be such that whenever you are at position i, you can choose to move left or right (if possible). \n\nAnother idea: Let's model the required conditions by considering the path's \"balance\". \n\nSuppose we track the current position of the pointer. Let's think of the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe key is that the array must be such that the path can be constructed in a way that the pointer ends at 0. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's note example. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements in terms of the required path. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nThe first element a[1] must be the number of times the pointer moved right from position 1 minus the number of times it moved left from position 1. \n\nWait, but the pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based?), so the first move can be to the right (to 2) or can't move left. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required path's constraints. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the array as a sequence of differences. \n\nSuppose we have the array a[1..n]. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1 (assuming 1-based). \n\nLet me think of the required conditions. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the required \"balance\" as the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nWe can model the problem by tracking the minimum required steps. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position of the pointer. \n\nBut since the path can be complex, perhaps we can model the necessary conditions using a variable that represents the current \"level\" or position. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from similar problems (like the \"Ulam's problem\" or some array path problems): \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative, and the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but something similar. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the number of times we have to move left to get back. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's movement constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based). \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current position's value and move to the next. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease the current and move back. \n\nThe final position must be 1 (the first element). \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required path's \"balance\". \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s consider the array a. \n\nWe can model the required conditions as follows: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all positions i from 1 to n, the following holds: \n\na[i] must be such that the cumulative \"excess\" of right moves over left moves up to that point is non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nLet\u2019s define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nWe process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each element a[i], the balance must be >=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nLet\u2019s track a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but that might be too complex. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note example. \n\nIn the second test case example, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe sum is 2-1-1+0 =0. \n\nLooking at the elements, the first element is 2, which is positive. The second is -1, third -1, fourth 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the first element to the ith element must be non-negative? \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIn the example, the cumulative sums are: \n\nAfter first element: 2 (okay). \n\nAfter second: 1 (okay). \n\nThird: 0 (okay). \n\nFourth: 0 (okay). \n\nHmm, but that's just the total sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cumulative sum from the first to the ith element must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but in the example, that holds. \n\nAnother test case: suppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0. \n\nSo that would be okay. \n\nBut can this array be formed? \n\nLet's see: \n\nStart at position 1. \n\nTo get a[1] =1, you must have moved right once from position 1. \n\nBut moving right from 1 takes you to 2. \n\nThen, to get a[2] =-1, you must have moved left once from position 2. \n\nSo the path would be: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right (to 2, a[1] becomes 1). \n\nThen move left (from 2 to 1, a[2] becomes -1). \n\nThen move left again? But can't move left from 1. \n\nWait, the pointer must end at 1. \n\nWait, after moving left from 2 to 1, the pointer is at 1. \n\nSo the path is: \n\n1 \u21922 \u21921. \n\nThe final position is 1, which is correct. \n\nSo the array [1, -1] is possible. \n\nAnother test case: array [0, 0]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums are 0, 0. \n\nPossible? \n\nYes. The pointer can just stay at 1 (but how? \n\nWait, the pointer starts at 1. To get a[1] =0, you can't do any operation 1 (since moving right would increase a[1], but then you have to return. \n\nAlternatively, you can do nothing. Since the initial array is all zeros, so the answer is yes. \n\nAnother test case: array [ -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: -1, 0. \n\nThe first cumulative sum is negative, so according to the idea, it would be invalid. \n\nIndeed, can this array be formed? \n\nLet's see. \n\nThe first element is -1. \n\nTo get a[1] =-1, the pointer must have moved left from position 1. But the pointer starts at 1. You can't move left from 1. \n\nHence, it's impossible. So the condition that cumulative sums are non-negative would reject this case. \n\nSo this suggests that the condition is that the cumulative sum from the first element up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but how exactly? \n\nWait, the cumulative sum here would be the sum of a[1] to a[i]. \n\nWait, in the first test case example given in the problem's note, the first test case (which is not possible because the pointer doesn't end at first element?), but the second test case's array has cumulative sums that are non-negative. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. For all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative. \n\n3. Additionally, when traversing from the end towards the start, the sum must also be non-negative? \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the path can be constructed such that the pointer ends at the first position. \n\nAnother approach inspired by the problem's movement: \n\nThe pointer can only move right or left, but must end at the start. \n\nLet me think of the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through each cell moving right versus left. \n\nThe key idea is that the path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. \n\nLet me model the problem as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s consider the array a. \n\nWe can model the required conditions by considering the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nBut since the path can be complex, perhaps we can track the required \"balance\" as we process the array. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the \"Ulam's problem\" or the \"stock span\" problem. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nLet\u2019s process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'balance'. \n\nThe 'balance' represents the number of steps to the right minus steps to the left up to that point. \n\nWait, but how does this relate to the array's elements? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that the path must form a walk that starts and ends at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are determined by the number of times each position was exited to the right minus exited to the left. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nLet\u2019s define for each position i, the number of times the pointer exits to the right (R_i) and to the left (L_i). \n\nThen, a[i] = R_i - L_i. \n\nThe total displacement is sum over (R_i - L_i) for all i except the last? No, the total displacement is (sum R_i) - (sum L_i) =0. \n\nAlso, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. \n\nNow, the array's elements must satisfy that for each position i, the number of times it was exited to the right minus exited to the left equals a[i]. \n\nHmm, but how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note example. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the first element to the ith element must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end to the start must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following conditions must hold: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements is non-negative. \n\nAdditionally, when traversing from the end to the start, the sum must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nIn the example given in the problem's note (second test case), the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the start are: \n\n2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the end (starting from the last element and moving left): \n\n0, -1, 1, 2 \u2192 but this includes negative. \n\nHmm, so that idea might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, let's see for the example: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting at the last element and moving left): \n\n0 \u2192 0 (okay). \n\nThen adding the third element: 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 which is negative. \n\nHmm, so that would violate the condition. \n\nHmm, so that idea is not correct. \n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the path as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe array's elements must be such that the walk can be constructed. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position of the pointer. \n\nWe can model the required conditions by keeping track of the current position and ensuring that we can return to 0. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's movement constraints: \n\nLet\u2019s process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet\u2019s consider that the path must form a closed walk. \n\nThe array's elements must satisfy that the sum of the first i elements is >= the number of steps needed to return. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nLet\u2019s define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nWe process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each element a[i], the balance must be >=0. \n\nWait, but how does this relate to the array's elements? \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nThe 'balance' variable represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nInitialize balance =0. \n\nWait, the pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based). \n\nWait, maybe the following approach: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position. \n\nInitially, position is 1. \n\nThe array's elements must be such that the path can be constructed. \n\nBut this might be too slow for large n. \n\nHmm, but the problem requires an O(n) solution. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position. \n\nBut since the path can be complex, perhaps the key is to track the required minimum steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note example: \n\nThe array must have a[i] such that the cumulative sum up to i is non-negative, and the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, in the example, the cumulative sums are non-negative. \n\nAnother test case where the array is [3, -1, -1, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 3, 2, 1, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThis should be possible. \n\nAnother test case: [1, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, -1, 0 \u2192 the second is negative \u2192 invalid. \n\nIndeed, can this array be formed? \n\nThe second element is -2. \n\nTo get a[2] =-2, the pointer must have exited to the left twice from position 2. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me see: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nThen move left twice from 2: \n\nFirst left move: subtract 1 from a[2], move to 1. \n\nSecond left move: can't do because you can't move left from 1. \n\nSo it's impossible. \n\nHence, the condition that all cumulative sums are non-negative is necessary. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. For all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative. \n\n3. Additionally, when traversing from the end to the start, the cumulative sum must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, why the third condition? \n\nWait, let me think of the array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting at the last element and moving left): \n\n0 \u2192 0 (okay). \n\nThen adding the third element: 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 which is negative. \n\nHmm, so that would violate the third condition. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nSo the third condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm, so maybe the third condition is not needed. \n\nWait, perhaps the third condition is needed for the path to return to the start. \n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-negative when traversed in reverse. \n\nWait, let me think of the example again. \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nIf we reverse the array and compute the cumulative sum from the end: \n\nThe reversed array is [0, -1, -1, 2]. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the start (of reversed array) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 (okay). \n\n0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 negative. \n\nHmm, so that would violate the condition. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nSo that suggests that the third condition is not needed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the only conditions are the total sum is zero and the cumulative sum from the start is non-negative for all prefixes. \n\nWait, but let's see another example. \n\nSuppose the array is [0, 0]. \n\nCumulative sums are 0 and 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nYes, possible. \n\nAnother example: [3, -3]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 3, 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nIs this possible? \n\nLet's see: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nThen move right again? But can't, since it's the last element. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, to get a[1] =3, you need to move right 3 times from position 1. \n\nEach time you move right from 1 to 2, you add 1 to a[1]. \n\nSo after 3 moves right, a[1] is 3, and the pointer is at position 4 (if n=2, then the second element is the last. So moving right from 1 (position 1) to 2 (position 2). \n\nWait, for n=2, the array has two elements. \n\nSo to get a[1] =3, you have to move right 3 times from position 1. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to a[1], then move to 2. \n\nAfter three moves right, you are at position 2. \n\nThen, to get back to position 1, you have to move left from 2 three times. \n\nEach left move subtracts 1 from a[2], so a[2] becomes -3. \n\nThus, the array would be [3, -3], which matches the example. \n\nSo the cumulative sums are okay, and it's possible. \n\nAnother test case: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nCumulative sums are okay. \n\nSo the conditions seem to hold. \n\nAnother test case: [1, 1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 2, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nIs this possible? \n\nLet's see: \n\nWe need to get a[1] =1, a[2]=1, a[3]=-2. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nPossible path: \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nMove right to 3 (a[2] becomes 1). \n\nNow, to get a[3] =-2, we need to move left twice from 3. \n\nEach left move subtracts 1 from a[3], so two moves would make it -2. \n\nBut moving left from 3 to 2, then to 1. \n\nSo the path is: \n\n1 \u21922 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nYes, this works. \n\nSo the conditions are sufficient. \n\nAnother test case where the cumulative sum is okay but the array is invalid? \n\nHmm, let's see. \n\nSuppose the array is [2, -3, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, -1 (which is negative \u2192 violates the condition). \n\nSo it's invalid. \n\nThus, the conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums (sum of first i elements) must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the last element? \n\nThe last element can be anything as long as the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum up to n must be zero. \n\nYes, because the total sum is zero. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n- The total sum of the array must be zero. \n\n- All prefix sums (sum of first i elements) must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the path returning to the first position? \n\nWait, the second condition ensures that the path can be constructed such that you never have to move left from the first position. \n\nHmm, perhaps these two conditions are sufficient. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Check if the total sum is zero. \n\n- Check that all prefix sums (summing from the first element up to each position) are non-negative. \n\nIf both conditions are met, output \"Yes\", else \"No\". \n\nWait, but let me think of another test case. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nPrefix sums: 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nIs this possible? \n\nYes. \n\nPath: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nThen move right again to 2 (a[1] becomes 2?), no. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, the desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nHmm, let's see: \n\nThe third element is 0. \n\nTo get a[3] =0, the number of right moves from 2 to 3 minus left moves from 3 must be 0. \n\nSo, for example: \n\nPath: \n\n1 \u21922 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921. \n\nThis would give: \n\na[1] =1 (from moving right once), \n\na[2] =1 (from moving right once) minus 1 (from moving left once) \u2192 0? \n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, let's track each step: \n\nStart at position 1. \n\nStep 1: move right to 2 \u2192 a[1] +=1 \u2192 a[1]=1. \n\nStep 2: move right to 3 \u2192 a[2] +=1 \u2192 a[2]=1. \n\nStep 3: move left to 2 \u2192 a[3] -=1 \u2192 a[3] =-1. \n\nStep 4: move left to 1 \u2192 a[2] -=1 \u2192 a[2] =0. \n\nNow, the array is [1, 0, -1]. Not the desired. \n\nHmm, maybe another path: \n\n1 \u21922 \u21921 \u21922 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921. \n\nLet's track: \n\nStep 1: move right to 2 \u2192 a[1] =1. \n\nStep 2: move left to 1 \u2192 a[2] =-1. \n\nStep 3: move right to 2 \u2192 a[1] becomes 2? No, moving right from 1 again adds 1 to a[1]. \n\nWait, each time you move right from position 1, you add 1 to a[1]. \n\nSo step 3: moving right again from 1 to 2 \u2192 a[1] becomes 2. \n\nStep 4: move right to 3 \u2192 a[2] becomes 0 (since it was -1, adding 1). \n\nStep 5: move left to 2 \u2192 a[3] becomes -1. \n\nStep 6: move left to 1 \u2192 a[2] becomes -1 again. \n\nNow the array is [2, -1, -1]. \n\nHmm, not the desired. \n\nWait, maybe I'm not getting the right path. \n\nThe desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nLet me think of another path: \n\n1 \u21922 \u21921 \u21922 \u21923 \u21922 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe third element must be 0. \n\nTo get a[3] =0, the number of right moves from 2 to 3 must equal the number of left moves from 3 to 2. \n\nSuppose you move right from 2 once (to 3), and then move left once (back to 2). \n\nSo a[3] =1-1=0. \n\nThen, for a[2], the right moves from 2 (to 3) is 1, and left moves from 2 (to 1) must be such that a[2] = (right moves) - (left moves). \n\nSuppose a[2] is -1. \n\nSo right moves from 2 is 1, left moves from 2 must be 2. \n\nSo total left moves from 2 is 2. \n\nSo the path could be: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u21921). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192-1). \n\nMove right to 2 again (a[1] becomes 2). \n\nMove right to 3 (a[2] becomes 0). \n\nMove left to 2 (a[3] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1 again). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 3). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -2). \n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe desired a[3] is 0. \n\nTo achieve that, the number of right moves from 2 to 3 must equal the number of left moves from 3 to 2. \n\nSuppose you have one right and one left. \n\nThen, a[3] =1-1=0. \n\nFor a[2], the right moves from 2 (to 3) is 1, and left moves from 2 (to 1) must be such that a[2] = (right moves) - (left moves) \u2192 1 - L = -1 \u2192 L = 2. \n\nSo the left moves from 2 must be 2. \n\nSo the path must have two left moves from 2. \n\nThe path could be: \n\n1 \u21922 (a1=1) \n\n\u21922 \u21921 (a2 becomes -1) \n\n\u21921 \u21922 (a1 becomes 2) \n\n\u21922 \u21923 (a2 becomes 0) \n\n\u21923 \u21922 (a3 becomes -1) \n\n\u21922 \u21921 (a2 becomes -1 again) \n\nNow, the array is a1=2, a2=-1, a3=-1. \n\nNot the desired. \n\nHmm, maybe it's not possible. \n\nSo the array [1, -1, 0] would have prefix sums 1, 0, 0 \u2192 which are okay, but it's not possible. \n\nWait, that would mean that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so my previous idea is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here? \n\nWait, the array [1, -1, 0] has sum 0 and all prefix sums non-negative. But it's not possible. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so there must be another condition. \n\nHmm, so what's the problem here? \n\nLet me think of the desired array [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe third element is 0. \n\nThe second element is -1. \n\nThe first is 1. \n\nLet me think of the path: \n\nThe pointer must end at position 1. \n\nLet me try to find a path that achieves this. \n\nLet me try: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1 becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow, to get a3 to 0, we need to have equal right and left moves from 2 and 3. \n\nWait, to reach position 3, you have to move right from 2. \n\nSo let's try: \n\nAfter the first two steps (a1=1, a2=-1), the pointer is at 1. \n\nThen move right to 2 again (a1 becomes 2). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, a3 becomes 1). \n\nNow, to get a3 to 0, we need to move left once from 3. \n\nSo move left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). \n\nNow, the pointer is at 2. \n\nWe need to get back to 1. \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow, the array is a1=2, a2 = -1, a3=0. \n\nNot the desired. \n\nHmm, so the first element is 2, but desired is 1. \n\nHmm, so this path doesn't work. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2=1, a3=1). \n\nNow, move left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes 0). \n\nNow, the array is [1, 0, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-1). \n\nMove right to 2 again (a1=2). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2=0, a3=1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a3=0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-1). \n\nNow, the array is [2, -1, 0]. \n\nWhich is the example given in the problem's note. \n\nAh! So this gives the desired array for the second test case. \n\nWait, but in this case, the array is [2, -1, 0], which has prefix sums 2, 1, 1. \n\nWait, the third element's cumulative sum is 2-1+0 =1? \n\nWait, no, the third element's cumulative sum is 2 + (-1) +0 =1. \n\nWait, the third element's cumulative sum is the sum of the first three elements. \n\nWait, the array in this case is [2, -1, 0], so the cumulative sums are: \n\nAfter first element: 2 \n\nAfter second: 1 \n\nAfter third: 1 \n\nAll are non-negative. \n\nSo the conditions are met. \n\nBut the desired array [1, -1, 0] has cumulative sums 1, 0, 0. \n\nWhich are also non-negative. \n\nBut why can't that array be formed? \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking it's not possible. \n\nLet me try again to find a path for [1, -1, 0]. \n\nLet me try this path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow, the pointer is at 1. \n\nWe need to get a3 to 0. \n\nTo do that, we need to move to 3 and then back. \n\nSo: \n\nMove right to 2 (a1 becomes 2). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, a3 becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow the array is [2, -1, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2=1, a3=1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a3=0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=0). \n\nNow the array is [1, 0, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-1). \n\nMove right to 2 again (a1=2). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-2). \n\nNow, the array is [2, -2, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. \n\nIf that's the case, then the conditions are sufficient. \n\nBecause the array [1, -1, 0] would have met the conditions but is not possible. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nIn the path I tried earlier, the final position is 1. \n\nBut the array's first element is 2 in that case. \n\nHmm, so the desired array [1, -1, 0] can't be formed. \n\nThus, the conditions are sufficient. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nCheck that the total sum is zero, and all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nNow, looking back at the code provided. \n\nThe code currently has a loop that reads each element and accumulates the sum. \n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n: \n\nsum += temp. \n\nThen, for i>1, there is a condition that if sum ==0 and temp !=0 \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nWait, that's not the same as checking prefix sums. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track something else. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\n- For each element, add to sum. \n\n- For i>1, if sum ==0 and the current element is not zero \u2192 \"No\". \n\nWait, what does that mean? \n\nLet me see. \n\nSuppose the current element is a[i]. \n\nThe sum up to i is sum. \n\nThe condition is: if (i>1) { \n\nif (sum ==0 and temp !=0 \u2192 \"No\". \n\n} \n\nWait, perhaps this is trying to enforce that when the cumulative sum reaches zero, the next element must be zero? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the prefix sums must be non-negative, and also the suffix sums must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are that the prefix sums are non-negative and the suffix sums are non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums (starting from the end) would be: \n\n0 \u21920 \n\n-1 +0 =-1 \u2192 negative. \n\nHmm, so that would violate the suffix condition. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nHmm, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the prefix sums are non-negative and the suffix sums (from the end) are also non-negative. \n\nWait, but in the example, the suffix sums would be: \n\n0 \u21920 \n\n-1 +0 =-1 \u2192 negative. \n\nSo that would be invalid. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nHmm, so that's not the case. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nLet me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nThe array's elements are the net of right and left moves from each position. \n\nThe total sum must be zero. \n\nThe other condition is that the path can be constructed such that the pointer returns to the first position. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe array's elements are determined by the number of right and left moves from each position. \n\nThe path must be such that the net right moves equal net left moves. \n\nThe cumulative sum condition (prefix sums non-negative) is necessary but not sufficient? \n\nWait, in the case of the array [1, -1, 0], the prefix sums are 1, 0, 0 \u2192 non-negative. \n\nBut the array can't be formed. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the missing condition? \n\nWait, perhaps the path must also allow returning to the first position. \n\nThe cumulative sum up to the end must be zero, which it is. \n\nBut perhaps there's another condition related to the path's ability to return. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe path must be such that the number of times you move right from position i must be at least the number of times you move left from position i+1. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the path must form a valid walk that can return to the start. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe total sum is zero. \n\nThe prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThe suffix sums (starting from the end) are also non-negative. \n\nWait, let's see the example [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums (starting from the end and moving left): \n\n0 \u21920 \n\n-1 +0 =-1 \u2192 negative. \n\nSo this would violate the suffix condition. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nHmm, so that's not it. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe path must be such that the cumulative sum never drops below zero when traversed from the start, and also when traversed from the end. \n\nWait, perhaps the suffix condition is that the cumulative sum from the end must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let's compute the suffix sums for the example: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums from the end (starting at the last element and moving left): \n\n0 \u21920 \n\n-1 +0 =-1 \u2192 negative. \n\nHmm, so that would violate the condition. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nSo this suggests that the suffix condition is not needed. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the pointer's path. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach move to the right increases the current position's value and moves to the next. \n\nEach move to the left decreases the current position's value and moves to the previous. \n\nThe final position must be 1. \n\nThe array's elements are the net of right and left moves from each position. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe path must start and end at 1. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. \n\nThe array's elements are a[i] = (number of right moves from i) - (number of left moves from i). \n\nThe path must form a closed walk. \n\nNow, the key is to model the conditions on the array. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current position of the pointer. \n\nWe can model the path as a sequence of moves, but for large n, we need an O(n) solution. \n\nAnother idea inspired by the problem's note example: \n\nThe array must be such that the cumulative sum from the first element to the ith element is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the ith element to the end is also non-negative. \n\nWait, let me see for the example [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the first to ith: \n\n2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative from the ith to the end: \n\nFor i=1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2: -1 + (-1)+0 =-2 \u2192 negative. \n\nHmm, so that's not good. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe path must be such that the pointer never goes beyond the array's bounds. \n\nBut that's already implied by the problem's operations. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are the total sum is zero and the prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nEven though the example I thought of [1, -1, 0] might not be possible, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking it's not possible. \n\nLet me try again to find a path for [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe desired array is a[1]=1, a[2]=-1, a[3]=0. \n\nLet me try this path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow, the pointer is at 1. \n\nTo get a3 to 0, we need to move to 3 and back. \n\nSo: \n\nMove right to 2 (a1 becomes 2). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, a3 becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a3 becomes 0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2 becomes -1). \n\nNow the array is [2, -1, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove right to 3 (a2=1, a3=1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a3=0). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=0). \n\nNow the array is [1, 0, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a1=1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-1). \n\nMove right to 2 again (a1=2). \n\nMove left to 1 (a2=-2). \n\nNow the array is [2, -2, 0]. \n\nNot desired. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the array [1, -1, 0] is not possible. \n\nThus, the conditions are sufficient. \n\nSo the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThus, the code needs to check these two conditions. \n\nNow, looking back at the provided code: \n\nThe code has a loop that reads each element and adds to sum. \n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n: \n\nfor each element temp: \n\nsum += temp. \n\nThen, for i>1: \n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nAlso, if(sum==0 && temp !=0) \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the missing condition is checking that the prefix sum up to i-1 must be positive before adding the current element. \n\nWait, the current code's logic is: \n\nFor each i>1: \n\nif (sum ==0 and temp !=0 \u2192 \"No\". \n\nWait, what does this mean? \n\nSuppose the current element is a[i]. \n\nThe sum up to i is sum. \n\nBut the condition is checking if the sum before adding this element was zero, and the current element is non-zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the prefix sum up to i-1. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe sum variable is accumulating the elements as they are read. \n\nSo when processing the ith element (i starts at 1), the sum after adding temp is the sum of the first i elements. \n\nThe condition inside the if (i>1) block is: \n\nif (sum ==0 and temp !=0 \u2192 \"No\". \n\nWait, that would mean that after adding the ith element, the sum is zero, but the current element is non-zero. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the prefix sum up to i-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to ensure that when the sum up to i-1 is zero, the current element must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nSuppose we are at i>1. \n\nThe sum before adding the current element (temp) is sum - temp. \n\nThe previous sum (up to i-1) is sum - temp. \n\nIf that previous sum is zero, then the current element (temp) must be non-negative. \n\nBecause otherwise, the prefix sum up to i would be negative. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo the condition should be: \n\nif (sum - temp ==0 and temp <0 \u2192 \"No\". \n\nBecause if the sum up to i-1 is zero, then adding a negative temp would make the prefix sum up to i negative. \n\nThus, the condition is: \n\nif ( (sum - temp) ==0 && temp <0 ) \u2192 \"No\". \n\nBut how is this implemented in the code? \n\nThe current code has: \n\nif (sum ==0 && temp !=0 \u2192 \"No\". \n\nWait, that's not the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the current prefix sum. \n\nWait, the code's current logic is: \n\nFor each element after the first (i>1), it checks if the current sum (after adding the current element) is zero and the current element is non-zero. \n\nBut that doesn't directly relate to the prefix sums. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the prefix sum up to i must be non-negative. \n\nThus, the code should track the current prefix sum and ensure it is non-negative. \n\nThe current code's sum variable is the prefix sum up to i. \n\nThus, the code should check that sum >=0 at every step. \n\nAh! That's the key. \n\nThe code should check that the prefix sum never becomes negative. \n\nSo in the loop, after adding the current element to sum, we check if sum <0 \u2192 then ans is \"No\". \n\nBut the current code doesn't do that. \n\nThe current code has a condition inside the i>1 block: \n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) \u2192 ans = \"No\"; \n\nPerhaps the missing condition is checking whether the current sum is negative. \n\nSo the code should have: \n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nBut the code's current structure is: \n\nfor each element: \n\nif ans is already \"No\", continue. \n\nthen, for i>1: \n\nif (some condition) \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nif (sum ==0 and temp !=0 \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the prefix sum must be non-negative. \n\nThus, the code should check after adding the current element to sum whether sum is negative. \n\nSo the code should have: \n\nsum += temp; \n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 ans = \"No\". \n\nBut in the current code's structure, the sum is added before the condition checks. \n\nSo the code should be modified to: \n\nfor each element in the loop: \n\ntemp = cin.nextLong(); \n\nsum += temp; \n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 ans = \"No\"; \n\nBut the current code's loop is structured as: \n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) { \n\ntemp = cin.nextLong(); \n\nif (!ans.isEmpty()) continue; \n\nif (i>1) { \n\n// TODO \n\n} \n\nsum += temp; \n\n} \n\nWait, no, the code's current loop has the sum += temp inside the loop, but the order is: \n\ntemp is read, then the conditions are checked, then sum is added. \n\nWait, looking at the code: \n\nThe code's loop is: \n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) { \n\ntemp = cin.nextLong(); \n\nif (!ans.isEmpty()) continue; \n\nif (i>1) { \n\n// TODO \n\n} \n\nsum = sum + temp; \n\n} \n\nWait, no, the code's current code has: \n\nsum = sum + temp; \n\nWait, the code's code has: \n\nsum = sum + temp; \n\nWait, the code's code is: \n\nsum = sum + temp; \n\nWait, the code's code is: \n\nsum = sum + temp; \n\nWait, the code's code is: \n\nsum = sum + temp;
