So in this case, the desired parity is 1 (odd). So for the odd elements (positions 1 and 3), their (1 - a_i) mod2 must be same. Original a1 is 1 mod2 is 1. (1-1) mod2 is 0. a3 is 1 mod2 is 1. (1-1) mod2 is 0. So for odd elements, the value is 0. For even elements (position 2), a2 is 2 mod2 is 0. (1-0) mod2 is 1. So for even elements, the value is 1. Thus, for case P=1, the odd elements have same value (0), even elements have same (1). So yes, possible. So the code needs to check for both cases. Therefore, the correct approach is to check for both P=0 and P=1. So, in code, perhaps the code should loop over the two possibilities (P=0 and P=1), and for each, check the conditions. Alternatively, the code can check for each case. Let me think of how to code this. First, for each test case, we can check for both possibilities. Let me outline the steps for code: For each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. Check two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: All elements even (P=0). Check for all odd elements: (0 - a_i) mod2 must be same. Check for all even elements: (0 - a_j) mod2 must be same. Possibility 2: All elements odd (P=1). Check for all odd elements: (1 - a_i) mod2 must be same. Check for all even elements: (1 - a_j) mod2 must be same. If either possibility is true, output YES, else NO. So, in code, perhaps:\n\nbool possible = false;\n\n// check for P=0\n\nbool valid0 = true;\n\nint req_x0 = (0 - a[1]) %2; // for first odd element. for (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) { \n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) ! = req_x0 ) { \n\n        valid0 = false; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check even elements for P=0. int req_y0 = (0 - a[2])%2; \n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) { \n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) ! = req_y0 ) { \n\n        valid0 = false; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Also, check if the even elements' first (a[2]) is part of the check. Wait, the even elements start at 2. So for even indices, the first is 2, then 4,6 etc. Wait, the even indices are 2,4,6,... So for even elements, the first even is a[2]. So for P=0, the required y must be (0 - a[2]) mod2.",

So the code is wrong here. Therefore, the code's current logic is incorrect. Hence, the correct approach is to check for both cases (P=0 and P=1). So, perhaps the code should be rewritten. Alternatively, let's think of the correct code. The correct code would need to check for both possibilities. Let me think of how to code this. First, for each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. Check for possibility 1 (all even):\n\nCheck all odd elements have the same (0 - a_i) mod2. Check all even elements have the same (0 - a_j) mod2. If both are true, then possible. Check possibility 2 (all odd):\n\nCheck all odd elements have same (1 - a_i) mod2. Check all even elements have same (1 - a_j) mod2. If either possibility is true, output YES else NO. So, in code:\n\nbool possible = false;\n\n// check for P=0\n\nbool valid0 = true;\n\n// check odd elements:\n\nint target0_odd = (0 - a[1]) %2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) ! = target0_odd ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check even elements:\n\nint target0_even = (0 - a[2])%2;\n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) ! = target0_even ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Also, check the second element (i=2):\n\nWait, the even elements start at 2. So the first even element is a[2]. The loop for even elements in the code above starts at 4, but that skips the second element.",

Then the second loop starts at 4 (index4 is 2 mod2 is 0. The second element (index2) is 3 mod2 is 1. The second loop's condition would check if a[2]%2 ! = a[4]%2. a[2]%2 is 1, a[4]%2 is 0. So the condition is true, so flag becomes false. Thus, the code would output NO. But what is the correct answer here? Let me see. The array is [1,3,1,2]. We need to see if we can make all even or all odd. Let's see for P=1 (all odd). For odd indices (1,3): \n\nEach must have (1 - a_i) mod2 same. a1 is 1 mod2 is 1 \u2192 (1-1) mod2 =0 \n\na3 is 1 mod2 \u2192 same \u2192 0. So for odd elements, the required x mod2 is 0. Even indices (2,4): \n\na2 is 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 (1-1) mod2 =0 \u2192 y mod2 must be 0. a4 is 2 mod2 \u2192 (1-0) mod2 =1 \u2192 y mod2 must be 1. Thus, conflicting requirements for y. So P=1 is not possible. For P=0: \n\nOdd elements: \n\n(0 -1) mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2 must be 1. \n\na3: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 same. Even elements: \n\na2: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 y mod2 must be 1. \n\na4: (0-0) mod2 =0 \u2192 y mod2 must be 0. \n\nConflicting. Thus, no solution. So the code's output would be NO, which is correct. But according to the code's logic, the second loop (i=4) would check a[2]%2 (1) vs a[4]%2 (0). Thus, the condition is true, so flag is set to false. Thus, the code would output NO, which is correct. Another test case where the second element is even and others are okay. Suppose the array is [1,2,1,2]. First loop: a[3] is 1 mod2 is 1 (same as a1). Second loop: i=4. Check a[2]%2 (0) vs a[4]%2 (0). So condition is false. Thus, flag remains true. Then, the code would output YES. Is that correct? Let's see. Can we make all even? For P=0: \n\nOdd elements: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 x must be 1 mod2. Even elements: (0-2 mod2=0 \u2192 (0-0) mod2=0 \u2192 y must be 0 mod2. Thus, x is 1, y is 0. Then, after x=1 (add to odds once), odds become 2 (even), 2 (even). Evens: add y=0 \u2192 remain 2 and 2. Thus, all even. So yes. Thus, the code's output is correct. Thus, the code's logic may be correct. Wait, the code's logic is: \n\nAll odd elements must have the same parity as the first element.",

But since x and y can be chosen freely, this is possible if and only if the difference between the first and second's parities can be adjusted by x and y. The difference between the first and second's desired parities is (parity_first +x) - (parity_second +y) mod2. We can choose x and y such that this difference is zero. Thus, the equation is: parity_first +x \u2261 parity_second + y mod2 \n\n=> x - y \u2261 (parity_second - parity_first) mod2 \n\nWe can choose x and y to satisfy this. For example, set x =0, then y must be (parity_second - parity_first) mod2. Thus, it is always possible. Thus, if the flag is true, then it is possible to choose x and y such that all elements have the same parity. Thus, the code's logic is correct. Ah! I see now.",

But since x and y can be chosen freely, we can choose x and y such that the two parities are equal. For example: \n\nLet desired parity be P. \n\nWe can choose x such that (parity_first +x) mod2 = P \n\nand y such that (parity_second +y) mod2 = P \n\nThus, x = (P - parity_first) mod2 \n\ny = (P - parity_second) mod2 \n\nThus, as long as the odds can be made to have the same parity (which they can, since all odds are already aligned to first's parity), and evens can be made to have the same parity (aligned to second's parity), then we can choose P to be either parity_first +x or parity_second +y. \n\nWait, but the parity of the odds after x is (parity_first +x) mod2. The parity of the evens after y is (parity_second +y) mod2. We can choose x and y such that these are equal. Thus, the equation is: \n\nparity_first +x \u2261 parity_second + y mod2 \n\nWe can choose x and y to satisfy this. For example, set x =0, then y must be (parity_first - parity_second) mod2. Thus, it is always possible. Thus, if the flag is true, then it is possible to make all elements have the same parity. Thus, the code's logic is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. The problem is about determining if we can make all elements in an array have the same parity (all even or all odd) using two types of operations. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices any number of times.\n\nHmm, the code provided has some loops checking the parity of elements. Let me look at what's there already. The first loop starts at i=3 and increments by 2 each time. It checks if the parity of a[1] is the same as a[i]. Wait, because i increases by 2, like 3,5,7... So those are the odd indices after the first one. So maybe the first loop is checking all the odd indices (since 3 is the next odd after 1) to see if their parity matches the first element's. \n\nThen there's another loop starting at i=4 and stepping by 2. So that's even indices starting from 4, like 4,6,8 etc. The condition there is missing. The current code has a comment saying \"TODO\" there. \n\nThe idea here is probably to check the even indices. Let me think: the code's logic might be trying to ensure that all elements at odd positions have the same parity as the first element, and all even positions have the same parity as the second element? Or maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, the problem requires that after some operations, all elements are even or all odd. Let's think about how the operations affect the parities. \n\nEach operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices) flips the parity of all odd elements. Similarly, type 2 flips the parity of even elements. \n\nWait, adding 1 changes even to odd and vice versa. So each operation of type 1 toggles the parity of all odd indices. Similarly for type 2. \n\nThe key is to find if there's a way to choose the number of times to perform each operation so that all elements end up with the same parity. \n\nLet me think of variables. Let x be the number of type 1 operations, and y the number of type 2. \n\nFor each element at position i (1-based), its final parity is:\n\nIf i is odd: original a_i's parity + x (mod 2). Because each type 1 operation adds 1, so x times. \n\nIf even: original a_i's parity + y (mod 2). \n\nWe need all elements to have the same parity. Let's denote the desired parity as either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). \n\nSo for all elements, (a_i + x*(i is odd) + y*(i is even)) mod 2 must be equal. \n\nAlternatively, for all elements, the parity after operations must be equal. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote for each element i:\n\nparity_i = (a_i + (x if i is odd else y)) mod 2 \n\nWe need all parity_i equal. \n\nSo, for all i and j, parity_i = parity_j. \n\nLet me consider two elements: the first (odd) and second (even). \n\nparity_1 = (a1 + x) mod 2 \n\nparity_2 = (a2 + y) mod 2 \n\nThese must be equal. \n\nSimilarly, for any other element, say the third (odd):\n\nparity_3 = (a3 +x) mod2 must equal parity_1. \n\nWait, so for all odd indices, their parity after x operations is (a_i +x) mod2. Since they are all odd indices, they all depend on x. \n\nSimilarly, even indices depend on y. \n\nSo, all the odd indices must have (a_i +x) mod2 equal to each other, and the even indices must have (a_j + y) mod2 equal to each other. But also, the parity of the odd and even groups must be the same. \n\nWait, actually, the parity of all elements must be the same. So the parity of the odd elements (after x) must equal the parity of the even elements (after y). \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. All odd elements must have the same parity after x operations. \n\nWait, no, because all odd elements are affected by x. So their parity after x is (a_i +x) mod2. Since all odd elements are in the same group, their parity after x will all be the same as each other. Because adding x to each of their original parities. \n\nWait, for example, if x is even, then their parity remains the same as original. If x is odd, then all their parities are flipped. \n\nSo all the odd elements will have the same parity after x operations. Similarly, all even elements will have the same parity after y operations. \n\nTherefore, the only requirement is that the parity of the odd group (after x) equals the parity of the even group (after y). \n\nSo, the parity of (a1 +x) mod2 must equal (a2 + y) mod2. \n\nBut also, since x and y can be any non-negative integers (including zero), we can choose x and y such that this equality holds. \n\nWait, but how do we choose x and y? Let me think of the equations. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the desired parity (0 or 1). \n\nWe need:\n\nFor all odd i: (a_i + x) mod2 = P \n\nFor all even j: (a_j + y) mod2 = P \n\nSo, for all odd i: x \u2261 (P - a_i) mod2 \n\nSimilarly, for all even j: y \u2261 (P - a_j) mod2 \n\nBut since x must be the same for all odd elements, the (P - a_i) mod2 must be the same for all odd i. \n\nSimilarly, for even elements, (P - a_j) mod2 must be the same for all even j. \n\nTherefore, for a solution to exist, the following must hold:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: Choose P = 0 (all even). \n\nThen, for all odd elements, (0 - a_i) mod2 must be the same (so x is fixed mod2). \n\nSimilarly, for even elements, (0 - a_j) mod2 must be the same (so y is fixed mod2). \n\nOR \n\nCase 2: Choose P =1 (all odd). \n\nThen, for all odd elements, (1 - a_i) mod2 must be same. \n\nFor even elements, (1 - a_j) mod2 must be same. \n\nIf either case is possible, then answer is YES. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether either of these two cases is possible. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck two possibilities:\n\n1. Can we make all elements even? \n\n   For this, check:\n\n   All odd elements must have the same (0 - a_i) mod2. \n\n   All even elements must have the same (0 - a_j) mod2. \n\n   Because x must be the same mod2 for all odd elements, so their (0 - a_i) mod2 must be same. \n\n   Similarly for even elements. \n\n2. Can we make all elements odd? \n\n   Similarly, check:\n\n   All odd elements have same (1 - a_i) mod2. \n\n   All even elements have same (1 - a_j) mod2. \n\nIf either of these two is true, then output YES, else NO. \n\nSo the code needs to check these two conditions. \n\nNow, looking back at the given code. The current code has a flag that is initially true, and then it's being set to false if certain conditions are not met. \n\nThe first loop is for i from 3 to n step 2. So that's checking the odd indices starting from 3. The code checks if a[1]%2 != a[i]%2. So this is checking whether all the odd indices have the same parity as the first element. \n\nWait, but that's only part of the condition. Because in the first case (making all even or all odd), perhaps the code is trying to see if the current parities can be adjusted. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is not correct. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element, but that's not the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as each other, but the current code's logic is incomplete. \n\nThe existing code's first loop is checking for all odd indices (starting from 3) whether their parity matches the first element. \n\nThe second loop is for even indices starting at 4 (so even indices 4,6, etc.), but the condition is missing. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to check if all elements have the same parity as the first element (for odd indices) and same as the second element (for even indices). But that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element, but that's not the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's current approach is not correct, and the missing part is part of that approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check whether all elements can be adjusted so that their parities are the same as the first element's parity after some operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to see if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element. \n\nWait, the first loop checks for all odd indices (starting from 3) whether their parity matches the first element. \n\nThe second loop is for even indices starting at 4. The condition there should be checking if their parity matches the second element's parity? \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to check that all odd elements have the same parity as the first element, and all even elements have the same parity as the second element. \n\nBut then, after that, the flag is set to true only if all those conditions are met. But that's not sufficient. Because the operations can change the parities. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, and the correct approach is to check the two cases (all even or all odd) as I thought earlier. \n\nSo maybe the code needs to be restructured. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check if the parities of the elements can be adjusted so that all elements have the same parity. \n\nWait, let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe key is that after any number of operations, the parity of each element depends on the number of times their respective operation (odd or even) was applied. \n\nSo for each element at position i (odd or even), the parity is (original a_i + x if odd, or y if even) mod2. \n\nWe need all these to be equal. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of type 1 operations (add to odds). \n\ny be the number of type 2 operations (add to evens). \n\nWe can choose x and y such that for all i:\n\n(a_i + (x if i is odd else y)) mod2 = same value for all i. \n\nLet me denote the desired parity as P (0 or 1). \n\nSo for all i:\n\n(a_i + (x if odd else y)) mod2 = P \n\nRearranged:\n\nx \u2261 (P - a_i) mod2 for all odd i \n\ny \u2261 (P - a_j) mod2 for all even j \n\nSo for all odd elements, (P - a_i) mod2 must be the same. Let's call this value X. \n\nSimilarly, for all even elements, (P - a_j) mod2 must be the same. Let's call this Y. \n\nThen, x must be X mod2, and y must be Y mod2. \n\nSo, for a given P (either 0 or 1), we can check:\n\n- All odd elements have the same (P - a_i) mod2. \n\n- All even elements have the same (P - a_j) mod2. \n\nIf both are true for either P=0 or P=1, then it's possible. \n\nSo the code needs to check for both possibilities. \n\nTherefore, the code should check for both cases (P=0 and P=1) and see if either is possible. \n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck if either of the following is true:\n\nCase 1 (all even):\n\nCheck that all odd elements have (0 - a_i) mod2 equal to some value (they must all be same). \n\nAND all even elements have (0 - a_j) mod2 equal to some value (they must all be same). \n\nCase 2 (all odd):\n\nCheck that all odd elements have (1 - a_i) mod2 equal to some value (same for all). \n\nAND all even elements have (1 - a_j) mod2 equal to some value (same for all). \n\nIf either case is true, output YES, else NO. \n\nSo how to implement this in code?\n\nThe current code's approach is not following this. The existing code has a flag that is set to true, then in the first loop, it checks for all odd indices (starting from 3) whether their parity matches the first element. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to see if all odd elements have the same parity as the first element, and all even elements have the same parity as the second element. \n\nBut that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element after some operations. \n\nWait, let's think of the first test case example given in the problem. \n\nFirst test case: [1,2,1]. \n\nThe first element is 1 (odd). \n\nThe second is 2 (even). \n\nThird is 1 (odd). \n\nThe solution says that after adding 1 to even indices once, the array becomes [1,3,1], all odd. \n\nSo in this case, the desired parity is 1 (odd). \n\nSo for the odd elements (positions 1 and 3), their (1 - a_i) mod2 must be same. \n\nOriginal a1 is 1 mod2 is 1. (1-1) mod2 is 0. \n\na3 is 1 mod2 is 1. (1-1) mod2 is 0. \n\nSo for odd elements, the value is 0. \n\nFor even elements (position 2), a2 is 2 mod2 is 0. (1-0) mod2 is 1. \n\nSo for even elements, the value is 1. \n\nThus, for case P=1, the odd elements have same value (0), even elements have same (1). So yes, possible. \n\nSo the code needs to check for both cases. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to check for both P=0 and P=1. \n\nSo, in code, perhaps the code should loop over the two possibilities (P=0 and P=1), and for each, check the conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the code can check for each case. \n\nLet me think of how to code this. \n\nFirst, for each test case, we can check for both possibilities. \n\nLet me outline the steps for code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCheck two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: All elements even (P=0). \n\nCheck for all odd elements: (0 - a_i) mod2 must be same. \n\nCheck for all even elements: (0 - a_j) mod2 must be same. \n\nPossibility 2: All elements odd (P=1). \n\nCheck for all odd elements: (1 - a_i) mod2 must be same. \n\nCheck for all even elements: (1 - a_j) mod2 must be same. \n\nIf either possibility is true, output YES, else NO. \n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\nbool possible = false;\n\n// check for P=0\n\nbool valid0 = true;\n\nint req_x0 = (0 - a[1]) %2; // for first odd element. \n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) { \n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != req_x0 ) { \n\n        valid0 = false; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check even elements for P=0. \n\nint req_y0 = (0 - a[2])%2; \n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) { \n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != req_y0 ) { \n\n        valid0 = false; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Also, check if the even elements' first (a[2]) is part of the check. \n\nWait, the even elements start at 2. So for even indices, the first is 2, then 4,6 etc. \n\nWait, the even indices are 2,4,6,... \n\nSo for even elements, the first even is a[2]. \n\nSo for P=0, the required y must be (0 - a[2]) mod2. \n\nThen, all even elements must have (0 - a_j) mod2 equal to that. \n\nSo the code for even elements would loop over all even indices starting from 2. \n\nWait, in the code above, the loop for even elements starts at 4, but that skips the second element (index 2). \n\nAh, that's a problem. \n\nSo the existing code's second loop starts at i=4, but that's incorrect. \n\nThe code's current second loop is for even indices starting at 4, but the even indices start at 2. \n\nSo the code's current approach is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to be fixed. \n\nThe original code's first loop is for i from 3 to n step 2 (odd indices starting at 3). \n\nThe second loop is for even indices starting at 4, but that's wrong. \n\nThe correct approach would be to check all even indices (starting at 2). \n\nSo, the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to be rewritten. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be fixed by changing the loops. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's current approach is trying to check if all elements can be made to have the same parity as the first element. \n\nWait, the first loop checks if all odd indices (after the first) have the same parity as the first element. \n\nThe second loop (the one with the TODO) is for even indices starting at 4, and perhaps checking if their parity matches the second element. \n\nThen, the flag is set to true only if all those conditions are met. \n\nBut that's not sufficient. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the first element is a1, and the second is a2. \n\nThe code's first loop checks that all odd indices (3,5, etc.) have the same parity as a1. \n\nThe second loop (the TODO) would check that even indices (4,6, etc.) have the same parity as a2. \n\nThen, the flag is true only if all those are true. \n\nBut then, after that, the code would output YES only if the first element and second element have the same parity. \n\nWait, because if all odds have same parity as a1, and all evens have same as a2, then the entire array's parity is same only if a1 and a2 have same parity. \n\nSo the code's logic is: \n\nCheck that all odd elements have same parity as a1, and all even elements have same as a2. \n\nThen, if a1 and a2 have same parity, then the entire array can be made to have that parity. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nBecause the operations can be applied. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that if all odds have same parity as a1, and evens as a2, then the difference between a1 and a2's parity must be even? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to see if the parities of the first and second elements can be made the same through some operations. \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is not considering the operations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to see if the array can be made to have all elements with the same parity as the first element. \n\nIn that case, the required condition is that all odd elements have the same parity as a1, and all even elements can be adjusted to match that. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nThe even elements can be adjusted via the even operations. \n\nSuppose the desired parity is the parity of a1. \n\nThen, for even elements, their current parity plus y (number of even operations) mod2 must equal a1's parity. \n\nSo for each even element a_j (even index), (a_j + y) mod2 = parity_a1. \n\nThus, y must be (parity_a1 - a_j_parity) mod2. \n\nBut this must be the same for all even elements. \n\nSo the parity of a_j must all have the same (parity_a1 - a_j_parity) mod2. \n\nWhich is equivalent to all even elements have the same (parity_a1 - (a_j mod2)) mod2. \n\nWhich is equivalent to all even elements have the same (a_j mod2) parity as each other, because parity_a1 is fixed. \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nSuppose parity_a1 is P. \n\nThen for even elements, (a_j mod2 + y) mod2 = P. \n\n=> y mod2 = (P - a_j mod2) mod2. \n\nThis must be the same for all even elements. \n\nThus, (P - a_j mod2) mod2 must be same for all even elements. \n\nWhich implies that all even elements have the same (a_j mod2) parity. \n\nBecause (P - a_j mod2) mod2 is same for all j even. \n\nSo, the even elements must all have the same parity. \n\nSimilarly, the odd elements must all have the same parity (same as a1's). \n\nThus, the code's first loop checks that all odd elements (after first) have same parity as a1. \n\nThe second loop (the TODO) should check that all even elements (starting from 2) have the same parity as a2. \n\nWait, but the second loop in the code starts at 4. \n\nSo the code's second loop is missing the check for the second element (index 2). \n\nWait, the second loop is for i from 4 to n step 2. \n\nSo the code is not checking the second element (index 2). \n\nThe code's second loop's condition is missing. \n\nThe code's current second loop is for even indices starting at 4, but the even indices start at 2. \n\nSo the code's second loop should start at 2, but the code's current loop starts at 4. \n\nWait, the code's second loop is written as:\n\nfor(i=4;i<=n;i+=2)\n\nSo that's starting at 4, so it skips the second element (index 2). \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach for the second loop would be to start at 2, but then check if the parity matches the second element. \n\nWait, the code's second loop is supposed to check even indices. \n\nThe second element (index 2) is even. \n\nSo the loop should start at 2, but the code starts at 4. \n\nSo the code is wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nHence, the correct approach is to check for both cases (P=0 and P=1). \n\nSo, perhaps the code should be rewritten. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the correct code. \n\nThe correct code would need to check for both possibilities. \n\nLet me think of how to code this. \n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCheck for possibility 1 (all even):\n\nCheck all odd elements have the same (0 - a_i) mod2. \n\nCheck all even elements have the same (0 - a_j) mod2. \n\nIf both are true, then possible. \n\nCheck possibility 2 (all odd):\n\nCheck all odd elements have same (1 - a_i) mod2. \n\nCheck all even elements have same (1 - a_j) mod2. \n\nIf either possibility is true, output YES else NO. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nbool possible = false;\n\n// check for P=0\n\nbool valid0 = true;\n\n// check odd elements:\n\nint target0_odd = (0 - a[1]) %2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != target0_odd ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check even elements:\n\nint target0_even = (0 - a[2])%2;\n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != target0_even ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Also, check the second element (i=2):\n\nWait, the even elements start at 2. So the first even element is a[2]. \n\nThe loop for even elements in the code above starts at 4, but that skips the second element. \n\nWait, the code's loops for even elements in the current code's second loop starts at 4, but in the code I'm thinking of, the even elements loop should start at 2. \n\nWait, in the code I'm writing now, the even elements loop for P=0's even elements should start at 2. \n\nWait, the code I'm writing now would have:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (i ==2) continue; // no, no. \n\nWait, no. The first even element is i=2. \n\nSo the loop for even elements should start at 2. \n\nWait, in the code above, the target0_even is (0 - a[2])%2. \n\nThen, the loop for even elements should check all even indices starting from 2. \n\nSo the loop should be:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (i ==2) continue; // no, no. \n\nWait, no. The first element is i=2. \n\nWait, the code for even elements in the P=0 case:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if ( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != target0_even ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but then the first element (i=2) is included. \n\nYes, because target0_even is set to (0 - a[2]) mod2. \n\nSo the loop includes i=2, which is okay. \n\nThus, the code for even elements in P=0 case is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if ( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != target0_even ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for the odd elements, the loop starts at 1? \n\nWait, the first odd element is 1. \n\nThe target0_odd is (0 - a[1]) mod2. \n\nThen, the loop for odd elements should start at 1, but since the first element is already the target, we can start at 3. \n\nWait, the loop for odd elements:\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if ( ( (0 - a[i])%2 ) != target0_odd ) {\n\n        valid0 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nYes, because the first odd element (i=1) is the target. \n\nSo, the code for P=0 is okay. \n\nSimilarly for P=1:\n\nbool valid1 = true;\n\nint target1_odd = (1 - a[1])%2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (1 - a[i])%2 ) != target1_odd ) {\n\n        valid1 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nint target1_even = (1 - a[2])%2;\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if( ( (1 - a[i])%2 ) != target1_even ) {\n\n        valid1 = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, if valid0 or valid1 is true, output YES. \n\nSo putting this into code. \n\nNow, the original code's current structure is:\n\nThe code has a flag initialized to true. \n\nThen, in the first loop (for odd indices starting at 3), it checks if a[1]%2 != a[i]%2. \n\nWhich is equivalent to checking whether all odd elements have the same parity as a[1]. \n\nThe second loop (for even indices starting at 4) is incomplete. \n\nThe code's current approach is not correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct code would need to implement the above logic. \n\nBut the problem is that the user wants us to complete the existing code, not rewrite it. \n\nHmm, the user's instruction says: \"Complete the code in cpp to solve this programming problem\". \n\nThe existing code has some loops, but the second loop's condition is missing. \n\nThe existing code's first loop is for i from 3 to n step 2, checking if a[1]%2 != a[i]%2. \n\nThis is equivalent to checking whether all odd elements (after the first) have the same parity as the first. \n\nThe second loop is for even indices starting at 4, but the condition is missing. \n\nThe code's current logic is: \n\nflag is true. \n\nThen, for each odd index (starting at 3), if their parity differs from a[1], set flag to false. \n\nThen, for even indices starting at 4, the condition is missing. \n\nThe code then outputs YES if flag is true. \n\nSo the code's current logic is: \n\nCheck that all odd elements (after first) have same parity as first element. \n\nCheck that even elements (starting at 4) have some condition. \n\nBut what is the condition supposed to be? \n\nPerhaps the second loop is supposed to check that even elements have the same parity as the second element. \n\nSo the condition would be: if (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) then flag = false. \n\nThus, the second loop's condition is: \n\nif (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) \n\nSo the missing code is: a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nBut then, the code's logic would be: \n\nAll odd elements must have same parity as first element. \n\nAll even elements (starting at 4) must have same parity as second element. \n\nBut also, the second element (index 2) must be checked. \n\nWait, the second loop starts at 4, so it skips the second element (index 2). \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nThe second loop should start at 2, but the code starts at 4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second loop is supposed to check even indices starting at 2, but the code's loop is written as starting at 4. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's second loop is supposed to check even indices starting at 4, but the second element (index 2) is not checked. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nBut the user wants us to complete the existing code, not rewrite it. \n\nThe existing code's second loop is for even indices starting at 4. \n\nThe condition in the second loop's if statement is missing. \n\nThe code's current logic is: \n\nflag is true. \n\nFirst loop: check all odd indices (3,5, etc.) have same parity as a[1]. \n\nSecond loop: check even indices (4,6, etc.) have some condition. \n\nThe code then outputs YES if flag is true. \n\nThe code's logic is that if all odd elements have same parity as first, and all even elements (starting at 4) have same parity as second element, then the entire array can be made to have same parity. \n\nWait, but the second element (index 2) is even. \n\nThe second loop starts at 4, so it doesn't check index 2. \n\nThus, the code is missing the check for the second element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second loop is supposed to check that even indices (starting at 4) have the same parity as the second element. \n\nThus, the condition would be: a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nSo the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nBut then, the second element (index 2) is not checked. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut given that the user wants us to complete the existing code, perhaps the correct answer is to fill in the missing condition as a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nBut then, the code would not check the second element (index 2). \n\nHmm, but perhaps the code's first loop is for odd indices, and the second loop is for even indices starting at 4, but the second element (index 2) is even. \n\nWait, the second element is index 2, which is even. \n\nThe second loop starts at 4, so it skips index 2. \n\nThus, the code is not checking the second element's parity. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is wrong. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the code can pass with this approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is correct in some way. \n\nWait, let's think of the first test case example. \n\nTest case 1: [1,2,1]. \n\nThe first loop checks indices 3 (which is 1). \n\nSo a[1]%2 is 1, a[3]%2 is 1. So no problem. \n\nThe second loop starts at 4, but n is 3, so the loop doesn't run. \n\nThus, the flag remains true. \n\nThen, the code outputs YES. Which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: the second example in the note, which outputs NO. \n\nSuppose the array is [1,3,2]. \n\nThe first loop checks index 3 (a[3] is 2 mod2 is 0. a[1] is 1 mod2 is 1. So the first loop would set flag to false. \n\nThus, the code would output NO. \n\nBut what if the array is [1,3,1,2]. \n\nThen, the first loop checks index 3 (1 mod2 is 1, same as a[1]. \n\nThen the second loop starts at 4 (index4 is 2 mod2 is 0. \n\nThe second element (index2) is 3 mod2 is 1. \n\nThe second loop's condition would check if a[2]%2 != a[4]%2. \n\na[2]%2 is 1, a[4]%2 is 0. So the condition is true, so flag becomes false. \n\nThus, the code would output NO. \n\nBut what is the correct answer here? \n\nLet me see. \n\nThe array is [1,3,1,2]. \n\nWe need to see if we can make all even or all odd. \n\nLet's see for P=1 (all odd). \n\nFor odd indices (1,3): \n\nEach must have (1 - a_i) mod2 same. \n\na1 is 1 mod2 is 1 \u2192 (1-1) mod2 =0 \n\na3 is 1 mod2 \u2192 same \u2192 0. \n\nSo for odd elements, the required x mod2 is 0. \n\nEven indices (2,4): \n\na2 is 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 (1-1) mod2 =0 \u2192 y mod2 must be 0. \n\na4 is 2 mod2 \u2192 (1-0) mod2 =1 \u2192 y mod2 must be 1. \n\nThus, conflicting requirements for y. So P=1 is not possible. \n\nFor P=0: \n\nOdd elements: \n\n(0 -1) mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2 must be 1. \n\na3: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 same. \n\nEven elements: \n\na2: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 y mod2 must be 1. \n\na4: (0-0) mod2 =0 \u2192 y mod2 must be 0. \n\nConflicting. \n\nThus, no solution. So the code's output would be NO, which is correct. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the second loop (i=4) would check a[2]%2 (1) vs a[4]%2 (0). \n\nThus, the condition is true, so flag is set to false. \n\nThus, the code would output NO, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case where the second element is even and others are okay. \n\nSuppose the array is [1,2,1,2]. \n\nFirst loop: a[3] is 1 mod2 is 1 (same as a1). \n\nSecond loop: i=4. \n\nCheck a[2]%2 (0) vs a[4]%2 (0). So condition is false. \n\nThus, flag remains true. \n\nThen, the code would output YES. \n\nIs that correct? \n\nLet's see. \n\nCan we make all even? \n\nFor P=0: \n\nOdd elements: (0-1) mod2 =1 \u2192 x must be 1 mod2. \n\nEven elements: (0-2 mod2=0 \u2192 (0-0) mod2=0 \u2192 y must be 0 mod2. \n\nThus, x is 1, y is 0. \n\nThen, after x=1 (add to odds once), odds become 2 (even), 2 (even). \n\nEvens: add y=0 \u2192 remain 2 and 2. \n\nThus, all even. So yes. \n\nThus, the code's output is correct. \n\nThus, the code's logic may be correct. \n\nWait, the code's logic is: \n\nAll odd elements must have the same parity as the first element. \n\nAll even elements (starting from index 4) must have the same parity as the second element. \n\nBut what about the second element itself? \n\nThe second element is even. \n\nThe second loop starts at 4, so the second element is not checked. \n\nWait, the second element is index 2. \n\nThe second loop's condition is checking whether a[2]%2 != a[i]%2. \n\nWait, the condition in the second loop's if statement is: \n\nif (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) \n\nThus, for the second element (index 2), it's not part of the loop. \n\nWait, the loop starts at i=4. \n\nThus, the second element's parity is not checked against itself. \n\nBut the condition is comparing a[2] with a[i]. \n\nThus, the second element's parity is only compared with other even elements (starting from 4). \n\nThus, the code's logic is that all even elements (starting from 2) must have the same parity as the second element. \n\nBecause the loop starts at 4, but the second element is not part of the loop. \n\nWait, the loop for even indices starts at 4, so the second element (index 2) is not checked. \n\nThus, the code's logic is that the second element's parity is the reference, and all other even elements (starting from 4) must match it. \n\nBut the second element itself is not checked against itself. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct in that aspect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is: \n\nAll odd elements (starting from 3) must have the same parity as the first element. \n\nAll even elements (starting from 4) must have the same parity as the second element. \n\nIf both are true, then the flag remains true. \n\nThen, the code outputs YES if flag is true. \n\nBut what about the second element's parity compared to the first? \n\nThe code's flag is true only if all odd elements match the first, and all even elements (from 4) match the second. \n\nBut the first and second elements can have different parities. \n\nIn that case, the entire array would have two different parities (odds and evens), so it's impossible to make all same. \n\nThus, the code's logic is missing the check between the first and second elements. \n\nAh! That's the key. \n\nThe code's current logic allows the first and second elements to have different parities, but then the array can't be made to have all same parity. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nFor example, consider the array [1,2,1,2]. \n\nThe first element is odd, second even. \n\nThe first loop checks that the third element (1) has same parity as first (1 \u2192 yes). \n\nThe second loop (i=4) checks a[2]%2 (0) vs a[4]%2 (0 \u2192 same \u2192 no problem. \n\nThus, flag is true. \n\nThe code outputs YES. \n\nWhich is correct, because we can make all even. \n\nBut what if the array is [1,2,1,3]. \n\nThen, the first element is odd, second even. \n\nThe third element is odd (1 \u2192 same as first). \n\nThe fourth element (3 mod2 is 1). \n\nThe second loop's condition is a[2]%2 (0) vs a[4]%2 (1 \u2192 different \u2192 flag becomes false. \n\nThus, code outputs NO. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case where first and second elements have different parities but the rest are okay. \n\nExample: [1, 3, 1, 3]. \n\nFirst element is odd, second is odd. \n\nThus, the first and second have same parity. \n\nThe first loop checks third element (1 \u2192 same as first). \n\nSecond loop (i=4) checks a[2]%2 (1) vs a[4]%2 (1 \u2192 same \u2192 flag remains true. \n\nThus, code outputs YES. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBut what if the first and second elements have different parities, but all other elements match their respective groups. \n\nExample: [1 (odd), 2 (even), 1 (odd), 2 (even)]. \n\nThe first and second have different parities. \n\nThe code's flag is true (because all odds match first, evens match second). \n\nBut can we make all elements have the same parity? \n\nNo, because the first and second elements have different parities. \n\nThus, the code would output YES, but the correct answer is NO. \n\nAh! This is a problem. \n\nIn this case, the code's logic would output YES, but the correct answer is NO. \n\nBecause the first element is odd, second even. \n\nThe code's flag is true because all odds match first (1,1), and evens match second (2,2). \n\nBut the first and second elements have different parities. \n\nThus, the entire array can't be made to have all same parity. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThe code's current approach is missing the check between the first and second elements. \n\nThus, the code's logic is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must involve checking that the first and second elements can be made to have the same parity. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct solution requires checking both cases (P=0 and P=1), as I thought earlier. \n\nBut the user wants us to complete the existing code. \n\nThe existing code's second loop is for even indices starting at 4. \n\nThe missing condition is: a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nThus, the code's second loop's condition is checking whether the even elements (starting from 4) have the same parity as the second element. \n\nBut the code's logic is missing the check between the first and second elements. \n\nThus, the code will fail in cases where the first and second elements have different parities but all other elements match their groups. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the third test case where all elements already have the same parity is a YES. \n\nThe code would handle that correctly. \n\nBut the example I mentioned earlier (first and second elements different) would be a problem. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's constraints allow this approach to work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct in a different way. \n\nWait, the code's flag is set to true only if all odd elements match the first, and all even elements (from 4) match the second. \n\nBut the first and second elements can have different parities. \n\nIn that case, the array can't be made to have all same parity. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must involve checking that the first and second elements can be made to have the same parity. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is wrong. \n\nBut the user wants us to complete the existing code. \n\nThe problem is that the existing code's logic is incorrect, but perhaps the missing part is simply the condition in the second loop. \n\nThe second loop is for even indices starting at 4. \n\nThe condition should be whether their parity matches the second element's parity. \n\nThus, the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nThus, the code's second loop's condition is: \n\nif (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) \n\nThus, the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nfor(i=4;i<=n;i+=2)\n\n{\n\n    if(a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) flag=false;\n\n} \n\nThis is what the user is asking for. \n\nEven though the code's logic is incorrect in some cases, perhaps this is what the problem expects. \n\nBecause the problem's sample input 3 is when all elements are already same parity. \n\nThe code would handle that correctly. \n\nThe first test case example would also be handled. \n\nThe example I mentioned earlier where first and second elements have different parities but other elements match would be a problem. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct. \n\nWait, let's think of the example where first and second elements have different parities but other elements match their groups. \n\nExample: \n\nTest case: n=2, array [1,2]. \n\nThe first element is odd, second even. \n\nThe first loop doesn't run (since n=2, i starts at 3 which is beyond n). \n\nThe second loop starts at 4, which is beyond n. \n\nThus, the flag remains true. \n\nThe code would output YES. \n\nBut can we make all elements have same parity? \n\nLet's see: \n\nPossible operations: \n\nWe can choose x and y. \n\nWe need (1 +x) mod2 == (2 + y) mod2. \n\nLet's see: \n\nWe want both to be even or both odd. \n\nCase 1: all even. \n\n1+x must be even \u2192 x must be 1 mod2. \n\n2+y must be even \u2192 y must be even mod2. \n\nThus, possible. \n\nFor example, x=1, y=0. \n\nThen, first element becomes 2, second becomes 2. \n\nThus, all even. \n\nThus, the correct answer is YES. \n\nThe code's output is YES, which is correct. \n\nAh! So in this case, the code's logic works. \n\nWait, the first and second elements have different parities, but the code's flag is true. \n\nThe code outputs YES, which is correct. \n\nBecause it is possible. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nWait, why? \n\nBecause the first and second elements can be adjusted to have the same parity. \n\nThe code's logic is that all odd elements (first) have the same parity as first, and all even elements (second) have the same as second. \n\nBut the first and second can have different parities, but through operations, they can be adjusted to have the same. \n\nAh! I see. \n\nThe code's logic is not checking whether the first and second elements can be made to have the same parity. \n\nBut the code's flag is true if all odds match first and evens match second. \n\nBut then, the first and second can have different parities. \n\nBut in that case, the code would output YES, but it's possible to make them have the same parity. \n\nWait, the code's flag is true, but the first and second elements have different parities. \n\nBut the code's flag being true means that all odds are same as first, and evens same as second. \n\nThus, the entire array has two parities: first and second. \n\nTo make all elements have the same parity, we need to choose x and y such that: \n\nparity of first +x \u2261 parity of second + y mod2 \n\nThus, x - y \u2261 (parity_second - parity_first) mod2 \n\nWe can choose x and y to satisfy this. \n\nFor example, in the case of [1,2], the first is odd (1), second even (0). \n\nWe need to choose x and y such that (1+x) mod2 == (2 + y) mod2. \n\nWhich simplifies to (x+1) mod2 == (y) mod2. \n\nWe can choose x=0, y=1 \u2192 then first becomes 1, second becomes 3 \u2192 both odd. \n\nThus, possible. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nThe flag being true means that all odds can be made to have the same parity as the first (after x operations), and all evens can be made to have the same parity as the second (after y operations). \n\nThen, the question is whether the first's parity after x and the second's after y can be made the same. \n\nThe code's flag being true means that all odds can be adjusted to have the same parity (as first +x), and all evens can be adjusted to have the same parity (as second +y). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to whether the parity of the first (after x) can be made equal to the parity of the second (after y). \n\nBut since x and y can be chosen freely, this is possible if and only if the difference between the first and second's parities can be adjusted by x and y. \n\nThe difference between the first and second's desired parities is (parity_first +x) - (parity_second +y) mod2. \n\nWe can choose x and y such that this difference is zero. \n\nThus, the equation is: \n\nparity_first +x \u2261 parity_second + y mod2 \n\n=> x - y \u2261 (parity_second - parity_first) mod2 \n\nWe can choose x and y to satisfy this. \n\nFor example, set x =0, then y must be (parity_second - parity_first) mod2. \n\nThus, it is always possible. \n\nThus, if the flag is true, then it is possible to choose x and y such that all elements have the same parity. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nAh! I see now. \n\nThe flag being true means that all odds can be made to have the same parity (by choosing x), and all evens can be made to have the same parity (by choosing y). \n\nThen, the question is whether those two parities can be made equal. \n\nBut since x and y can be chosen freely, we can choose x and y such that the two parities are equal. \n\nFor example: \n\nLet desired parity be P. \n\nWe can choose x such that (parity_first +x) mod2 = P \n\nand y such that (parity_second +y) mod2 = P \n\nThus, x = (P - parity_first) mod2 \n\ny = (P - parity_second) mod2 \n\nThus, as long as the odds can be made to have the same parity (which they can, since all odds are already aligned to first's parity), and evens can be made to have the same parity (aligned to second's parity), then we can choose P to be either parity_first +x or parity_second +y. \n\nWait, but the parity of the odds after x is (parity_first +x) mod2. \n\nThe parity of the evens after y is (parity_second +y) mod2. \n\nWe can choose x and y such that these are equal. \n\nThus, the equation is: \n\nparity_first +x \u2261 parity_second + y mod2 \n\nWe can choose x and y to satisfy this. \n\nFor example, set x =0, then y must be (parity_first - parity_second) mod2. \n\nThus, it is always possible. \n\nThus, if the flag is true, then it is possible to make all elements have the same parity. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code in the second loop is to check whether the even elements (starting from 4) have the same parity as the second element. \n\nThus, the condition is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nThus, the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the second loop's condition is: \n\nif (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) \n\nThus, the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nSo the answer is to fill in that condition. \n\nThus, the code's second loop's condition is: \n\nif (a[2]%2 != a[i]%2) \n\nThus, the missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nSo the code should be filled with that condition. \n\nThus, the correct missing code is a[2]%2 != a[i]%2 \n\nTherefore, the answer is to output that condition. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code as plain text. \n\nThe missing code is the condition inside the if statement of the second loop. \n\nThus, the answer is: \n\na[2]%2 != a[i]%2"
