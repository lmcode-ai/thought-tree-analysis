But then the initial 'a' (the test case count) is overwritten. But the problem requires that the number of test cases is given first, so the code must read 't' first, then read 't' ratings. So using cin >> a as the loop condition would read the first input (t) into 'a', then the next inputs as the ratings. That would be wrong because the first input is the test case count, not a rating. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of the correct approach first, then see how to fit it into the given code. The correct approach is:\n\nRead t. For each of t test cases:\n\n    read rating. determine division based on rating.\n\n    print the division. Now, the given code's structure is:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while( /* condition */ ) {\n\n        a /=100, printf(...);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe problem is that the code must read each rating into a variable, then process it. But in the current code, the loop's body is doing a /=100, which suggests that 'a' is the rating. So perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop reads the rating into 'a', but the loop's condition is based on the original 'a' (the test case count). But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with the loop's condition being while (a-- >0), and inside the loop, the code first reads the rating into 'a', overwriting the test case count. But then the loop's condition is based on the original 'a' (test case count) decremented each time. Let's see:\n\nSuppose:\n\nInitial a is t (after cin >> a). Then the loop is while (a-- >0). So the loop runs t times. Inside the loop: First, the code does:\n\na /=100, printf(...); Wait, but before that, the code must read the rating into 'a', but where is that?\n\nAh! The code is missing the part where it reads the rating. So the code's loop is missing a cin >> a; before the a /=100 line. But the current code's loop body is only the line with a /=100 and the printf. So the code is incomplete. Therefore, the correct code would have inside the loop:\n\ncin >> a;\n\nthen a /=100, then the printf. But then the loop's condition must be such that it runs t times. So the loop's condition would be while (t-- >0), but the original 'a' is t. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while(a-- >0) {\n\n        int rating;\n\n        cin >> rating;\n\n        // process rating.\n\n    }\n\n} But in the given code's structure, the loop's body is written as a single line. So perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop's condition is while(a--), and inside the loop, the code first reads the rating into 'a', then processes it. But that would overwrite the 'a' (the test case count). Let me see: Wait, let's think step by step. Suppose the code is:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while(a--) {\n\n        cin >> a; // read the rating into a, overwriting the original a (t). a /=100;\n\n        printf(\"Division %d\\n\", 1 + (a <14) + (a <16) + (a <19));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in this case, the loop runs t times. Each iteration:\n\n- The loop condition a-- is checked. The current a is the original t, then after the loop body, it's decremented.",

So the condition can be written as while(a--). Therefore, the code's while loop's condition should be while(a--). Then, the loop body must first read the rating into 'a', then process it. So the line inside the loop must be:\n\ncin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19)); But the original code's loop body is written as:\n\na/=100, printf(...);\n\nSo the missing part is the cin >> a.

So for each test case, I have to output the correct division.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the main function reads the number of test cases 't' (since the first input is an integer t). Then there's a while loop that's supposed to run for each test case. The loop's condition is missing, which I need to fill in. \n\nThe loop's body is a bit confusing. The code does a /= 100, then printf. Wait, let me parse that line. The line is: a/=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19));\n\nHmm. Let's break that down. The comma operator means that first a is divided by 100, then the printf is executed. But wait, the variable 'a' here is the input 't' from the first line. Wait, the main function's parameter is 'a', but in C++, main's first parameter is the argument count. Oh right, but the code here might be using 'a' as the number of test cases. Wait, the code starts with 'cin >> a;' so 'a' is being read as the first input, which is t. So the loop should run 't' times. So the while loop's condition should be something like --a or while(a-- >0), but I need to figure out exactly.\n\nWait, the code's loop is written as while( /* TODO */ ), and inside the loop body, after the a/=100, the printf is called. Wait, but the a here is the variable that was initially set to t. That might be a problem. Because if the code is using 'a' both for the number of test cases and then modifying it here, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the code is incorrect as given, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let me look at the printf line. The expression inside is 1 + (a <14) + (a <16) + (a <19). Since in C++, boolean expressions evaluate to 0 or 1. So let's see:\n\nSuppose the rating is stored in 'a' after some operation. Wait, but the code is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe line is a/=100, then the printf. Wait, the a here is the variable that was initially the number of test cases. But that can't be right. Because the code is supposed to process each test case's rating. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the code is written in a tricky way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's main function is written as:\n\nmain(int a) { ... }\n\nWait, the main function's first parameter is the argument count, but here the code is using 'a' as the first parameter, which is the number of arguments. But the code then reads 'a' from cin. That's probably a mistake. Wait, but maybe the code is written with some intention. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read the test cases into 'a', but the variable 'a' is being reused here. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the variable 'a' as the test case count, and for each iteration, it reads the rating into 'a', but that would overwrite the test case count. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop is processing each test case, and the 'a' here is being used as the rating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\ncin >> a; // So a is set to t, the number of test cases.\n\nThen, while ( /* TODO: condition here */ ) {\n\n   a /= 100, printf(...);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop's body is that line. So the loop must run t times, so the condition should be something like while(a-- >0). But then inside the loop, the code is doing a /=100, but that would modify 'a' (the test case count) each time, which would be a problem. So that can't be right. So perhaps the code is using a different variable for the rating. Wait, maybe the code is written in a way that the rating is read into 'a', but that's conflicting with the initial 'a' which is the test case count. That's a problem. So perhaps the code is incorrect, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is written with some cleverness. Let me look at the printf line again. The expression is 1 + (a <14) + (a <16) + (a <19). Let's see what this gives for different values of a (assuming a is the rating divided by 100?).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is taking the rating, divides it by 100, then uses that value to compute the division. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the rating is 2300. Divided by 100 is 23. Then:\n\n(a <14) is 23 <14 \u2192 0.\n\n(a <16) \u2192 23 <16 \u2192 0.\n\n(a <19) \u2192 23 <19 \u2192 0.\n\nSo total is 1 +0+0+0 =1 \u2192 Division 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 1679 \u2192 16.79 \u2192 but since it's integer division, 1679/100 is 16. So a is 16.\n\nThen (16 <14 \u2192 0), (16 <16 \u21920), (16 <19 \u21921). So sum is 0+0+1 \u2192 total 1+1=2 \u2192 Division 2. Correct.\n\nFor 1400 \u2192 14. (14 <14 \u21920, 14 <16 \u21921, 14 <19 \u21921 \u2192 sum 2 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 Division3. Correct.\n\nFor 1399 \u2192 13.99 \u2192 13. So (13 <14 \u21921, 13 <16 \u21921, 13 <19 \u21921 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 1+3=4 \u2192 Division4. Correct.\n\nFor 1299 \u2192 12 \u2192 same as above, sum 3 \u2192 division4.\n\nSo the formula works. So the key is that the variable 'a' in the printf line must be the rating divided by 100. But how is that variable being set?\n\nThe line is a /=100, which suggests that before the division, 'a' holds the rating. But where is the rating read?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code's main function starts with cin >> a, which reads the number of test cases into 'a'. Then the loop is supposed to process each test case. But the code's loop is written in a way that the body is a single line: a /=100, then the printf. So the loop must read each rating into 'a', but that would overwrite the original 'a' (the test case count). So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with a for loop, but the user wants to use a while loop. Let me think again. The code's structure is:\n\nmain(int a) { \n\n    cin >> a; // a is now the number of test cases.\n\n    while( /* condition */ ) {\n\n        a /=100, printf(...);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop's condition must run for each test case. So the loop needs to run 'a' times. But the problem is that inside the loop, the code is modifying 'a' (the test case count). So that would break the loop's condition.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code is incorrect as written, but perhaps the code is using a different variable. Alternatively, maybe the code is written in a way that the loop is processing each test case by reading the rating into 'a', but then the loop's condition is based on something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let me think of the code's logic again. The code is supposed to read t test cases, each with a rating. For each rating, compute division and print.\n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nRead t into 'a'.\n\nThen loop while ... ?\n\nInside the loop, the code does a /=100, then the printf.\n\nWait, perhaps the loop is supposed to read each rating into 'a', but then the loop's condition is that there are more test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the loop's condition is while (cin >> a). Because that would read each rating into 'a', and loop while there is input. But then the initial 'a' (the test case count) is overwritten. But that would work if the code is structured that way. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the code is:\n\nmain(int argc, char** argv) { ... }\n\nBut here the code's main is written as main(int a), which is the argument count. But the code starts with cin >> a, which would read the first input (the test case count) into 'a', which is the argument count. That's a problem because the argument count is not related to the input. So that's a mistake. Wait, perhaps the code is written with a mistake, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Alternatively, maybe the code is written with a different intention.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with the variable 'a' being reused. Let me think again. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the code is written as:\n\nmain() {\n\n    int t;\n\n    cin >> t;\n\n    while(t--) {\n\n        int rating;\n\n        cin >> rating;\n\n        // compute division and print\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the given code is different. The given code uses 'a' as the first parameter, which is the argument count. But that's probably a mistake. The code's first line is 'cin >> a;', which would read the first input (the test case count) into 'a', which is the argument count. That's wrong. So perhaps the code is written with a mistake, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Alternatively, maybe the code is written in a way that the variable 'a' is the test case count, and the loop is supposed to run while 'a' is greater than 0, but then inside the loop, the code is reading the rating into 'a', which would overwrite the test case count. That would be a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop is processing each test case by reading the rating into 'a', and the loop runs for 't' times. So the initial 'a' (the test case count) is stored, and then the loop runs 'a' times, but each time, the code reads the next input into 'a', overwriting the original 'a' (the test case count). But then the loop condition would have to be based on the original 'a' value. But that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with a for loop, but the user wants to use a while loop. Let me think of the code's current structure again.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nwhile( /* condition */ ) {\n\n    a /=100, printf(...);\n\n}\n\nThe problem is that the code must read each rating, then process it. So the missing part in the while loop's condition must be something that runs for each test case. The initial 'a' is the number of test cases. So perhaps the loop is while(a-- >0), but then inside the loop, the code must read the rating into another variable. But in the current code, the code is using 'a' for both the test case count and the rating. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with a mistake, but the user wants me to fix the missing part. Let me think of the code's current line:\n\nThe line inside the loop is a /=100, then the printf. So the 'a' here must be the rating. So the code must read the rating into 'a' before that line. But where is that happening?\n\nAh! The code's loop is missing the part where it reads the rating. The current code's structure is:\n\ncin >> a; // a is the test case count.\n\nThen the loop runs while ( ... ), and inside the loop, the code does a /=100 and prints. But where is the code reading the rating?\n\nThis suggests that the code is missing a cin >> a; inside the loop. Because otherwise, the 'a' in the loop would be the test case count, which is not the rating. So the code is probably supposed to read each rating into 'a' inside the loop. But the current code's loop doesn't have that. So the missing part is that the loop's condition is while (a-- >0), and inside the loop, first read the rating into another variable, but the code is written in a way that the code is using 'a' for both the test case count and the rating. That's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop is reading the rating into 'a', and the loop runs for each test case. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the code is:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is the number of test cases.\n\n    while (a--) {\n\n        int rating;\n\n        cin >> rating;\n\n        // process rating.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code, the loop's body is a single line: a /=100, then the printf. So perhaps the code is written with the following approach: the loop runs for each test case, and in each iteration, the code reads the rating into 'a', then processes it. But then the initial 'a' (the test case count) is overwritten. That would be a problem. So the loop's condition can't be based on the original 'a' because it's being overwritten.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with the loop's condition being while (cin >> a). That way, the loop reads each rating into 'a', and continues until there's no more input. But then the initial 'a' (the test case count) is overwritten. But the problem requires that the number of test cases is given first, so the code must read 't' first, then read 't' ratings. So using cin >> a as the loop condition would read the first input (t) into 'a', then the next inputs as the ratings. That would be wrong because the first input is the test case count, not a rating.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of the correct approach first, then see how to fit it into the given code.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each of t test cases:\n\n    read rating.\n\n    determine division based on rating.\n\n    print the division.\n\nNow, the given code's structure is:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while( /* condition */ ) {\n\n        a /=100, printf(...);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe problem is that the code must read each rating into a variable, then process it. But in the current code, the loop's body is doing a /=100, which suggests that 'a' is the rating. So perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop reads the rating into 'a', but the loop's condition is based on the original 'a' (the test case count). But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with the loop's condition being while (a-- >0), and inside the loop, the code first reads the rating into 'a', overwriting the test case count. But then the loop's condition is based on the original 'a' (test case count) decremented each time. Let's see:\n\nSuppose:\n\nInitial a is t (after cin >> a).\n\nThen the loop is while (a-- >0). So the loop runs t times.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nFirst, the code does:\n\na /=100, printf(...);\n\nWait, but before that, the code must read the rating into 'a', but where is that?\n\nAh! The code is missing the part where it reads the rating. So the code's loop is missing a cin >> a; before the a /=100 line. But the current code's loop body is only the line with a /=100 and the printf. So the code is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, the correct code would have inside the loop:\n\ncin >> a;\n\nthen a /=100, then the printf.\n\nBut then the loop's condition must be such that it runs t times. So the loop's condition would be while (t-- >0), but the original 'a' is t. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while(a-- >0) {\n\n        int rating;\n\n        cin >> rating;\n\n        // process rating.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's structure, the loop's body is written as a single line. So perhaps the code is written in a way that the loop's condition is while(a--), and inside the loop, the code first reads the rating into 'a', then processes it. But that would overwrite the 'a' (the test case count). Let me see:\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nSuppose the code is:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a; // a is t.\n\n    while(a--) {\n\n        cin >> a; // read the rating into a, overwriting the original a (t).\n\n        a /=100;\n\n        printf(\"Division %d\\n\", 1 + (a <14) + (a <16) + (a <19));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in this case, the loop runs t times. Each iteration:\n\n- The loop condition a-- is checked. The current a is the original t, then after the loop body, it's decremented.\n\nInside the loop body:\n\n- cin >> a reads the next input (the rating) into 'a', overwriting the current value of 'a' (which was the remaining count). But since the loop is controlled by the original 'a' (t), this would work. Because the loop runs exactly t times, and each time, the code reads the rating into 'a', then processes it.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code's loop body would be:\n\ncin >> a;\n\na /=100;\n\nprintf(...);\n\nBut in the given code's current structure, the loop's body is written as a single line: a /=100, printf(...). So the missing part is the cin >> a; before that.\n\nTherefore, the code's loop should be:\n\nwhile (a-- >0) {\n\n    cin >> a;\n\n    a /=100;\n\n    printf(...);\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's current structure, the loop's body is written as a single line. So the code's line inside the loop is:\n\ncin >> a; a /=100, printf(...);\n\nBut how to fit that into the existing code?\n\nThe existing code's loop body is:\n\na /=100, printf(...);\n\nSo to include the cin >> a, the line would be:\n\ncin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nBut the loop's condition must be while (a-- >0). So the code would be:\n\nmain(int a) {\n\n    cin >> a;\n\n    while(a-- >0) {\n\n        cin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\", 1 + (a <14) + (a <16) + (a <19));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the first iteration:\n\nInitial a is t (say 7). The loop condition is a-- >0 \u2192 7>0 \u2192 true. Then inside the loop:\n\ncin >> a reads the first rating into 'a', overwriting the original a (7). Then a is divided by 100, then the printf is called. Then the loop continues with a-- (but the a here is now the rating, not the original count). Wait, no, the loop's condition is a-- which is the original a (t) before the loop body. Wait, no, the loop's condition is evaluated first. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the loop is while(a-- >0). The a-- is post-decrement. So the value of a is checked first, then decremented. So the first iteration:\n\nInitial a is 7 (t=7). The condition is 7>0 \u2192 true. Then the loop body runs. After the body, a is decremented to 6.\n\nInside the loop body:\n\ncin >> a reads the first rating (say 2300) into a. So now a is 2300. Then a /=100 \u2192 23. Then the printf is called, which outputs division 1. \n\nThe next iteration:\n\nThe loop condition is a-- (now a is 6, since after the first iteration, the a was decremented to 6). Wait, no, the a in the condition is the original a (the test case count). Wait, no, the loop's condition is while(a-- >0). The a here is the variable 'a' which was initially set to t. So after the first iteration, the a is decremented to 6. The next iteration's condition is 6>0 \u2192 yes. Then inside the loop body, the code reads the next rating into 'a', which overwrites the current a (6) to the new rating. \n\nSo this would work. Because the loop runs exactly t times, and each time, the code reads the next rating into 'a', then processes it. The a in the loop condition is the original test case count, which is being decremented each time. The a inside the loop body is the rating, but that's okay because after the loop body, the a is overwritten again in the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, the code's missing part in the while loop's condition is 'a-- >0' or 'a--' (since a is an integer, and while(a--) would loop a times when a is positive). Let me see:\n\nThe loop condition can be written as while(a--). Because when a is the test case count (say 7), the loop will run 7 times. Because a-- is post-decrement. So the first iteration, a is 7 (so true), then decremented to 6. Second iteration, a is 6 (true), etc., until a becomes 0. The 7th iteration: a is 1 (true), then becomes 0. The 8th iteration: a is 0 \u2192 false. So exactly 7 times.\n\nSo the condition can be written as while(a--).\n\nTherefore, the code's while loop's condition should be while(a--). \n\nThen, the loop body must first read the rating into 'a', then process it. So the line inside the loop must be:\n\ncin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19));\n\nBut the original code's loop body is written as:\n\na/=100, printf(...);\n\nSo the missing part is the cin >> a. So the line should be:\n\ncin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nTherefore, the complete loop would be:\n\nwhile(a--) {\n\n    cin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\", ...);\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's structure, the loop's body is written as a single line. So the code's line inside the loop is:\n\ncin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nTherefore, the missing part in the while loop's condition is 'a--'.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code's while loop should be:\n\nwhile(a--) {\n\n    cin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19));\n\n}\n\nWait, but the original code's loop body is written as:\n\nwhile( /* condition */ ) a/=100, printf(...);\n\nWait, the original code's loop body is written as a single line after the while loop. Like:\n\nwhile(condition) a/=100, printf(...);\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nwhile(condition) {\n\n    a /=100;\n\n    printf(...);\n\n}\n\nSo in that case, to include the cin >> a, the line would be:\n\nwhile(a--) cin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nBecause the comma operator has lower precedence than the while loop's condition. Wait, no. The comma operator has the lowest precedence. So the expression after the while loop is evaluated as (cin >> a), then (a /=100), then (printf(...)), but that's not correct. Wait, no. The line:\n\nwhile(a--) cin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nwhile(a--) {\n\n    (cin >> a);\n\n    (a /=100);\n\n    (printf(...));\n\n}\n\nBecause the comma operator separates expressions in the statement list. So the loop body is three separate statements. \n\nWait, no. The comma operator in C++ allows multiple expressions to be separated by commas, and the entire expression evaluates to the last one. But when used in a statement like this, the code is structured as:\n\nwhile (a--) {\n\n    (cin >> a), (a /=100), printf(...);\n\n}\n\nWait, no. The line is written as:\n\nwhile(a--) cin >> a, a /=100, printf(...);\n\nWhich is parsed as:\n\nwhile(a--) {\n\n    (cin >> a);\n\n    (a /=100);\n\n    (printf(...));\n\n}\n\nBecause the comma here is separating statements. Wait, no. The comma operator is part of the expression. Wait, the line is:\n\nwhile(a--) expression1, expression2, expression3;\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nwhile(a--) {\n\n    (expression1, expression2, expression3);\n\n}\n\nBecause the comma operator has lower precedence than the while loop's condition. So the entire line after the while loop is treated as a single statement, which is the comma-separated expressions. So the three expressions are evaluated in sequence, and the last one's value is the result of the statement.\n\nBut in this case, the three expressions are:\n\ncin >> a,\n\na /=100,\n\nprintf(...)\n\nSo the first expression (cin >> a) is evaluated, then the second, then the third. The result of the third is the value of the statement. But since the while loop's body is this single statement, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the code would work as intended. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing part in the while loop's condition is 'a--', so the code becomes:\n\nwhile(a--) cin >> a, a /=100, printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19));\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the while loop's condition is 'a--'.\n\nSo the answer is to replace the TODO with 'a--'.\n\nWait, the original code's while loop is written as:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */)a/=100,printf(\"Division %d\\n\",1+(a<14)+(a<16)+(a<19));\n\nSo the condition is missing. The user needs to fill in the condition part. The correct condition is 'a--', so the while loop becomes:\n\nwhile(a--) \n\nThus, the missing code is 'a--'.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is to put 'a--' in the while condition. \n\nTesting this:\n\nSuppose t is 7. The initial a is 7. The loop runs while(a--). \n\nFirst iteration:\n\na is 7 \u2192 condition is true. Then the loop body runs:\n\ncin >> a (reads the first rating, say 2300 \u2192 a becomes 2300).\n\nThen a /=100 \u2192 23.\n\nThen printf outputs division 1.\n\nThen the a-- in the condition is done, so a becomes 6.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\na is 6 \u2192 condition true. \n\ncin >> a (reads next rating, say 1679 \u2192 a becomes 1679).\n\nThen a /=100 \u2192 16 \u2192 division 2.\n\nAnd so on until a becomes 0, then the loop stops.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is 'a--'."
