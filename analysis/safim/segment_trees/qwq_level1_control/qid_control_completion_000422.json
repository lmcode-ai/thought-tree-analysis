But according to the conditions, it should be possible. Hmm, so there's a contradiction here. This suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. The problem requires that the pointer ends at position 0. The array a must be formed by the operations. Let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\". Suppose we process the array from left to right. Let me define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. Wait, but how does this help? Alternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example. The pointer can move back and forth, but the final position must be 0. The array a is the result of all the increments and decrements. The key is that the path must form a closed loop. The array must satisfy that the sum is zero. Additionally, the path must not have any \"impossible\" steps. Perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. The cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative.",

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem differently. Let me think of the following: \n\nThe array a must be such that the path can be formed. The path must start and end at 0. The array a is the difference between the number of right moves from each position and left moves from that position. The total right moves must equal the total left moves. The sum of a is zero.

So the conditions are: \n\n1. The sum of the array is zero. 2. All prefix sums (cumulative from the start) are non-negative. 3. All suffix sums (cumulative from the end) are non-positive. Wait, but how to compute the suffix sums? Alternatively, the suffix sum from the end is the cumulative sum from the end moving left. Wait, the suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. The condition is that this suffix sum must be <=0 for all i. \n\nLet me see for the example [1, -1, 0]. The suffix sums are: For i=0: 1 + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 which is okay (<=0). i=1: -1 +0 =-1 \u2192 okay. i=2:0 \u2192 okay. So all are <=0. Yes. Another example: [2, -1, -1, 0]. The suffix sums are: \n\ni=0: 2-1-1+0=0 \u2192 okay. i=1: -1-1+0 =-2 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2: -1+0 =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=3:0 \u2192 okay. So all are <=0. Another example: [1,0,-1]. Suffix sums: \n\ni=0:1+0-1=0 \u2192 okay. i=1:0-1 =-1 \u2192 okay. i=2: -1 \u2192 okay. So conditions are met. Another example: [0,0,0]. All suffix sums are 0 \u2192 okay. Another example: [3, -2, -1]. Suffix sums: \n\ni=0:0 \u2192 okay. i=1: -2-1 =-3 \u2192 okay. i=2: -1 \u2192 okay. Cumulative from start: 3,1,0 \u2192 okay. So conditions are met. Another example: [1, -2, 1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative from start: 1, -1 (negative \u2192 invalid). So rejected. Another example: [-1,1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative from start: -1 \u2192 invalid. So rejected. Another example: [2, -3, 1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative from start: 2, -1 \u2192 invalid. So rejected. So the conditions seem to work. Thus, the algorithm is: For each test case: \n\n- Check if the sum of the array is zero. - Compute the prefix sums (cumulative from the start) and ensure all are non-negative. - Compute the suffix sums (cumulative from the end) and ensure all are non-positive. If all three conditions are met, output \"Yes\", else \"No\". Now, how to implement this efficiently? The constraints are up to 2e5 elements per test case. Computing prefix sums is straightforward. For suffix sums, we can compute them by iterating from the end and accumulating. Wait, the suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. To compute this efficiently, we can compute the suffix sums array as follows: Initialize suffix_sum as an array of length n. \n\nsuffix_sum[n-1] = a[n-1] \n\nfor i from n-2 down to 0: \n\n    suffix_sum[i] = a[i] + suffix_sum[i+1] \n\nThen, check that all suffix_sum[i] <=0. But this requires O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable. Now, the code given in the problem has some variables: The code starts with: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    input()\n\n    n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    s,f,m = 0,0,0\n\n    for i in n:\n\n        s +=i\n\n        if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break\n\n        if s ==0: f=1\n\n        if f and s>0: m=1; break\n\n    print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]) Hmm, the code is incomplete. The variables s, f, m are used. The code seems to be trying to track the prefix sum (s) and some flags. The final print statement uses a string slicing trick. The current code's logic is not correct. We need to modify it to implement the conditions I found. The correct approach is: For each test case: \n\n1. Read n and the array a. \n\n2. Check if the sum of a is not zero \u2192 output No. \n\n3. Compute the prefix sums and check if any is negative \u2192 if yes, No. \n\n4. Compute the suffix sums and check if any is positive \u2192 if yes, No. \n\nElse, output Yes. Now, let's see how to implement this in the given code. The given code has variables s, f, m. \n\nThe loop is over each element in n (the array). The current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the running sum (prefix sum). The variable f is set to 1 when the prefix sum reaches zero. The variable m is set to 1 if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. The print statement uses \"YNEOS\" slicing.",

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with the following observation: The suffix sum condition can be rephrased as the prefix sum from the end must be non-positive. The suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. This is equivalent to the total sum minus the prefix sum up to i-1.

The second condition is not needed. The correct condition is that the prefix sum never goes negative. Thus, the missing code in the TODO section should be checking if the prefix sum is negative. The current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the prefix sum. The first condition (the TODO) should check if s <0 \u2192 if so, set m=1 and break. The second condition sets f to 1 when the prefix sum reaches zero. The third condition checks if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. This third condition is not needed. Thus, the correct code would be: \n\nThe first condition (the TODO) should be: if s <0: \n\n    m=1 \n\n    break \n\nThe other conditions are not needed. The variables f and the third condition are not needed. Thus, the code should be modified as follows: \n\nThe loop becomes: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i if s <0: \n\n        m =1 \n\n        break \n\n    if s ==0: \n\n        f=1 \n\n    # the third condition is not needed \n\nWait, but the code's final print statement uses \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. This suggests that the code's logic is different. The current code's print statement is using a string slicing trick. The string \"YNEOS\" is 5 characters long. The index is computed as (m or not f)::2. Let me see: \n\nThe expression (m or not f) evaluates to a boolean. If m is true (1), then the value is 1. Else, if not f is true (i.e., f is 0), then the value is 1. Else, it's 0. Then, the slice is [1::2] or [0::2].",

But assuming that the code's first lines are fixed, the code can be modified as follows: \n\nThe first lines should be: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    n = int(input()) a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    s,f,m =0,0,0 \n\n    if sum(a)!=0: \n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        continue \n\n    for num in a: \n\n        s += num \n\n        if s <0: \n\n            m=1 \n\n            break \n\n        if s ==0: \n\n            f=1 \n\n    print(\"Yes\" if (m==0) else \"No\") But the given code's print statement uses a different logic.

Else, if f is not set (prefix never reached zero) \u2192 output 'N'. Else \u2192 'Y'. But the correct condition is that the sum is zero (already checked) and all prefix sums are non-negative (m==0). Thus, the print statement should be \"Yes\" if m==0, else \"No\". The current print statement's logic is different. Thus, the code's print statement should be changed.

Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information. \"\n\nThe missing code is the part in the TODO section. The current code's loop has: \n\nfor i in n: \n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m=1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe TODO section should be replaced with the condition that if s <0 \u2192 set m=1 and break. Thus, the missing code is: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nThus, the code after the TODO should be: if s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nThe other conditions (the third one) are not needed.

Thus, the missing code is the condition to check if s is negative. Thus, the answer is: if s <0: m=1;break \n\nBut in Python, the code must be properly indented and have colons. The code inside the loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe missing code is the first if condition. Thus, the code should be: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break But in the code's current structure, the line is written as a single line. The code uses semicolons to separate statements. Thus, the missing code is: if s <0: m=1;break \n\nThus, the correct missing code is: if s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis will set m to 1 and break the loop if the prefix sum becomes negative. The other conditions (the third one) are incorrect but are part of the given code. However, the problem requires to output only the missing code. Thus, the correct answer is the code to check if s is negative and set m and break. Thus, the missing code is: if s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis is the code to be placed in the TODO section. The other conditions in the loop are incorrect but are part of the given code. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code. Thus, the answer is the code for the first condition.

Alternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk where each step is +1 or -1. The array a is determined by the number of times each position was stepped over in each direction. Wait, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i, the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative. Wait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. Wait, but how does the array relate to the path? Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note. Let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. Each time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move to the next. Each time you move left, you subtract 1 from the current cell and move to the previous. The final array is the result of all these operations. The pointer must end at 0. Let me think of the process as a series of moves. Suppose we have a path that starts and ends at 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Python code for the given problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through certain operations with a pointer. The pointer starts at the first element, and each operation can either move right (increasing the current element by 1 and moving next) or move left (decreasing current by 1 and moving previous). But after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the possible sequences of operations and see what constraints the array must satisfy. Let's think about the process.\n\nFirst, every time you move right, you have to increase the current element by 1. Then moving left requires decreasing the current element by 1. But the pointer must end at the first position. \n\nWait, the operations can be done in any order, but the pointer's position depends on the sequence. Let me think of the operations as steps. Each step is either a right move (R) or a left move (L). But the pointer can't go beyond the array's ends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the process by tracking the path of the pointer. Since the pointer starts at position 0 and must end there, the total number of right and left moves must balance out in some way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array's elements can be represented in terms of the path taken by the pointer. Let's think of the pointer's movement as a path. Each time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move. Each left move subtracts 1 and moves back. \n\nWait, but the operations can be done any number of times. Let me think of the net effect. \n\nSuppose the pointer moves right k times and left m times. But the path must form a walk that starts and ends at position 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the array's elements can be determined by the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in a certain direction. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer moved right over a cell and the number of times it moved left. \n\nWait, perhaps each element a_i is equal to the number of times the pointer passed through it moving to the right minus the number of times moving to the left. Because each right move on that cell adds 1, and each left move subtracts 1. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's consider each cell. For cell i (starting from 0), every time the pointer moves right into it (from i-1 to i), that's a right step, which increments the cell. But when moving left from i to i-1, that's a left step, which decrements the cell. \n\nWait, actually, the operation when moving right is: first, you increase the current cell by 1, then move to the next. So when you are on cell i and do a right move, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. \n\nSimilarly, when moving left, you are on cell i, subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1. \n\nTherefore, the value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right while on i minus the number of times you moved left while on i. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path of the pointer. The pointer starts at 0. Each step is either R or L (if possible). The path must end at 0. \n\nThe array a is the result of all the increments and decrements along the way. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to track the cumulative steps. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let's denote the path as a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_k where p_0 = 0 and p_k = 0. \n\nEach step from p_j to p_{j+1} is either +1 (R) or -1 (L). \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times the pointer was on i and moved right (thereby adding 1 to a[i]) minus the number of times it was on i and moved left (subtracting 1) must equal a[i]. \n\nAlternatively, the total contribution to a[i] is (number of right moves from i) minus (number of left moves from i). \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a walk. The net effect on a[i] is the number of times the pointer was at i and moved right (adding 1) minus the number of times it was at i and moved left (subtracting 1). \n\nBut each time the pointer is at i, it can choose to move right or left (if possible). \n\nHmm, perhaps the array a must satisfy certain conditions. Let me think of the cumulative sum. \n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's consider the path of the pointer. The pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let's model the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe key observation might be that the array a must satisfy that the sum of all elements must be equal to the number of times the pointer has moved right minus the number of left moves. Wait, but each right move adds 1 to a cell, and each left move subtracts 1 from a cell. So the total sum of a is equal to (number of right moves) - (number of left moves). \n\nBut since the pointer starts and ends at 0, the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. Because each right move increases the position, and each left decreases it. The net displacement is zero. So total right moves = total left moves. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all a_i must be equal to (R - L) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, R is the total right moves, L the left. So R - L must equal the total sum of a. But since R = L (because the net displacement is zero), then the total sum of a must be zero. \n\nWait, that's an important point. So the first condition is that the sum of all elements in the array must be zero. Otherwise, it's impossible. \n\nSo that's one condition. \n\nBut there might be more constraints. \n\nLet me think of the example given in the problem's note. \n\nIn the second test case example, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The sum is 2-1-1+0 = 0, so that's okay. \n\nAnother example: the first test case (the note says that the array can be obtained but the pointer isn't on first element, so it's invalid). \n\nWait, the problem requires that after all operations, the pointer is back at the first element. So the path must end at 0. \n\nSo the sum of a must be zero. But that's necessary but not sufficient. \n\nWhat other conditions are there? \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. Let's model the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer moved right from each position minus the number of times it moved left from that position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the partial sums when traversing from left to right must not be negative? Or some other condition. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process in terms of the pointer's position and the accumulated steps. \n\nSuppose we track the current position and the current a array. But that's too vague. \n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a path and see what constraints the array must satisfy. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let's think of the path of the pointer. Each time the pointer moves right, it adds 1 to the current cell and moves. Each left move subtracts 1 and moves back. \n\nThe final array is the sum of all these operations. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let's consider the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nLet me think of the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in the forward direction (right) versus backward (left). \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all positions i from 1 to n-1, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to the value a[i-1]. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must be such that when you traverse from left to right, the cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\nWait, maybe we can model the problem by considering the path's \"height\" or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the pointer's movement. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a series of moves. Let's consider the path as a sequence of positions. \n\nThe key idea is that whenever the pointer is at position i, moving right increases a[i] by 1, then moves to i+1. Moving left decreases a[i] by 1 and moves to i-1. \n\nThe final array is the sum of all these operations. \n\nNow, the problem requires that the pointer ends at position 0. \n\nLet me think of the process as a walk starting and ending at 0. \n\nLet me think of the array a as the difference between the number of times the pointer was at each position and moved right versus left. \n\nWait, for each position i, the number of times the pointer was at i and moved right (R_i) minus the number of times it was at i and moved left (L_i) must equal a[i]. \n\nBut also, the total number of right moves must equal the total left moves (since the path starts and ends at 0). \n\nMoreover, the movement must form a valid path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the path's \"height\" or the current position. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let's track the current position. \n\nSuppose we start at 0. Each step is either +1 (R) or -1 (L). The path must end at 0. \n\nThe array a is determined by the number of times each position was incremented or decremented. \n\nWait, each time you are at position i and move right, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you are at i and move left, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nTherefore, the value a[i] is equal to (number of right moves from i) minus (number of left moves from i). \n\nBut the total number of right moves from all positions must equal the total left moves. \n\nNow, let's think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let's denote the path as p_0, p_1, ..., p_k where p_0 = 0 and p_k = 0. \n\nEach step from p_j to p_{j+1} is either +1 or -1. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times the pointer was at i and moved right is equal to the number of times the path went from i to i+1. Similarly, the number of left moves from i is the number of times the path went from i to i-1. \n\nTherefore, a[i] = (number of times path went from i to i+1) - (number of times path went from i to i-1). \n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to finding such a path where the a[i] values are as given. \n\nNow, how can we model this? \n\nLet me think of the path's movement. Let's consider the cumulative \"balance\" as we move along the path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the required a array and see if it can be represented in a way that the path can form it. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the required conditions as follows: \n\n1. The sum of all a[i] must be zero. Because the total right moves (sum of all R_i) minus left moves (sum of L_i) must equal the total a sum. But since R_total = L_total (because the path starts and ends at 0), the sum must be zero. \n\n2. Additionally, when traversing the array from left to right, the cumulative sum must not drop below zero. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but some similar condition. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the \"balance\" in some other problems (like parentheses). \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track a variable that represents the current \"height\" or the number of times we've moved right minus left up to that point. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a walk where each step is +1 or -1. The array a must be such that when you process the path, the a values are consistent. \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. Let's think of the path as a series of steps. The key is that whenever the pointer is at position i, moving left requires that there was a previous move to the right into i. \n\nWait, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all positions except the first, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. Or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the minimal required steps. \n\nSuppose we start at position 0. To reach position i, you must have moved right i times. But when moving back, you can subtract. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to any point must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWe can model the process as follows: \n\nThe array a is built by the operations. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to track the minimal number of times the pointer must have been at each position. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me think of the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in the forward direction (right) and backward (left). \n\nThe total a[i] = (forward passes from i) - (backward passes from i). \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a sequence of moves. Let's think of the path as a series of steps. \n\nThe key idea is that the path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. \n\nNow, the array a must be such that for each position i, the number of times the path went right from i minus the number of times it went left from i equals a[i]. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the required a array. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track the current position and some variables. \n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems (like the \"stock span\" problem or the \"valid parentheses\" problem). \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nWe can track the current \"balance\" as we process the array. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we start at position 0. \n\nThe pointer can move right or left, but must end at 0. \n\nThe array a must be such that when moving from left to right, the cumulative \"required\" steps do not cause the pointer to go into a position that can't be recovered. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet's track the current position and the required steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nWe can model the problem by considering the required a array and see if it can be formed by a path that starts and ends at 0. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nThe array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements is zero. \n\n2. When traversing the array from left to right, the cumulative sum (starting from 0) must never drop below zero. \n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but something similar. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk where each step is +1 or -1. The array a is determined by the number of times each position was stepped over in each direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i, the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let's track a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but how does the array relate to the path? \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's note. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move to the next. \n\nEach time you move left, you subtract 1 from the current cell and move to the previous. \n\nThe final array is the result of all these operations. \n\nThe pointer must end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the process as a series of moves. \n\nSuppose we have a path that starts and ends at 0. \n\nThe array a is the sum over all the increments and decrements. \n\nNow, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which is the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but how does the array relate to this? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet me consider the array a and compute a certain value that must be non-negative. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the minimal number of times we have to be at each position. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nWe can track the current \"height\" as we process the array. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which starts at 0. \n\nWe process each element a[i] in order from left to right (starting at i=0). \n\nAt each step, the current position is i. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer can move right or left, but the final position must be 0. \n\nThe array a must satisfy that the sum is zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must form a valid walk. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible way to model the problem: \n\nLet me consider the array a and compute the required path. \n\nSuppose we start at position 0. \n\nThe first element a[0] can be increased only by moving right from 0. \n\nWait, but moving right from 0 would take us to 1, and then we can move back. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to track the minimal required steps. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the problem by considering the required a array and see if it can be formed by a path that starts and ends at 0. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\". \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all positions except the first, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. \n\nWait, in the sample given in the note, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nLooking at the elements: \n\na[0] = 2 \n\na[1] = -1 \n\na[2] = -1 \n\na[3] = 0 \n\nThe first element is 2, then the next is -1 which is less than 2. \n\nHmm, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to any point must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following approach: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current position's \"balance\". \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which starts at 0. \n\nWe process each element a[i] in order. \n\nAt each step, the current value must be at least a[i], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by some similar problems: \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current \"height\" as we process the array. \n\nSuppose we start at position 0. \n\nThe first element a[0] can be increased by moving right, but each time you move right, you have to come back. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nWe can track the current position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's note's example. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the sum is zero. \n\nAdditionally, when moving from left to right, the cumulative sum of the array up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nIn the sample given in the note, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are: \n\nAfter first element: 2 (non-negative). \n\nAfter second: 1 (non-negative). \n\nThird: 0 (non-negative). \n\nFourth: 0. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [1, -1]. The sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0. So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: [3, -2, -1]. Sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 3, 1, 0. So okay. \n\nBut what about [ -1, 1 ]? Sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: -1 (negative), so that would be invalid. \n\nSo the array [-1,1] would not be possible. \n\nSo the condition is that the cumulative sum must never be negative. \n\nWait, but how does that relate to the problem's conditions? \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose the cumulative sum of the array up to position i is S_i. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum of the array's elements up to i is the total of a[0] to a[i]. \n\nWait, but how does that relate to the path? \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative sum of the array up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose the path starts at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. \n\nEach time you move left, you subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1. \n\nThe final array is the sum of all these operations. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nNow, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i is the total of a[0] to a[i]. \n\nBut how does that relate to the path? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose the path is such that whenever you are at position i, you can only move left if you have previously moved right into it. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum of the array up to i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me define S_i as the sum of a[0] to a[i]. \n\nThen, the condition is that all S_i must be >=0, and the total sum S_{n-1} must be zero. \n\nWait, that might be the key. \n\nLet me test this with the sample given. \n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. All non-negative. \n\nAnother example: [1, -1]. The cumulative sums are 1, 0. Okay. \n\nAnother example: [3, -2, -1]. Sums 3,1,0. Okay. \n\nThe array [-1,1] would have cumulative sums -1,0. So the first is negative, so it's invalid. \n\nAnother test case: [0,0,0]. Sum is zero. The cumulative sums are 0,0,0. So okay. \n\nAnother test case: [1, 0, -1]. Sum is 0. The cumulative sums are 1,1,0. So okay. \n\nAnother test case: [0, 1, -1]. Sum is 0. The cumulative sums are 0,1,0. Okay. \n\nAnother test case: [2, -3, 1]. Sum is 0. The cumulative sums are 2, -1, 0. The second is negative, so invalid. \n\nSo this condition seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, the two conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums (cumulative sums from the start up to each element) are non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the path's movement? \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nWait, the cumulative sum condition may not be sufficient. \n\nWait, let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose n=3, array [1, -1, 0]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0, 0. All non-negative. \n\nIs this possible? \n\nLet me see. \n\nWe need to form this array. \n\nLet me try to construct the path. \n\nStart at 0. \n\nFirst, move right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nThen, move left back to 0 (a[0] becomes 0, but that's not desired. Hmm, maybe another path. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nWait, the desired a[0] is 1, a[1] is -1, a[2] is 0. \n\nHmm, let's think of the steps: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] +=1 \u2192 1). \n\nMove right again to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u2192 1). \n\nThen, move left to 1 (a[2] is now 0, but moving left from 2 to 1 subtracts 1 from a[2], so a[2] becomes -1? Wait, no. \n\nWait, when moving left from position 2 (which is a[2]), you subtract 1 from a[2], then move to 1. \n\nWait, let's track the steps: \n\nInitial array: [0,0,0]. \n\nStep 1: move right from 0 to 1 \u2192 a[0] becomes 1. \n\nStep 2: move right from 1 to 2 \u2192 a[1] becomes 1. \n\nStep 3: move left from 2 to 1 \u2192 a[2] becomes -1. \n\nStep 4: move left from 1 to 0 \u2192 a[1] becomes 0. \n\nNow, the array is [1,0,-1]. Not the desired [1,-1,0]. \n\nHmm, maybe another path. \n\nAlternatively, let's try: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] =1). \n\nMove left back to 0 (a[1] is decreased by 1 \u2192 a[1] = -1. \n\nThen move right again to 1 (a[0] becomes 2, but that's not desired. \n\nHmm, maybe this is not possible. \n\nWait, the desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nLet me see: \n\nAnother path: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] =1). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] =1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes 0). \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 2, but that's not desired. \n\nHmm, perhaps this array is not possible. \n\nWait, but according to the conditions, the cumulative sums are 1,0,0. So it should be possible. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the path. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nLet me try another path: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] =1). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] =1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes 0). \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 2 \u2192 no, that's not desired. \n\nHmm, maybe this is not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cumulative sum must also be non-negative when traversed from the end. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of another condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-positive? \n\nWait, let me think of the problem in reverse. \n\nSuppose we process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must end at 0, so the last move must be a left move from 1 to 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must also satisfy that the reverse cumulative sum (starting from the end) must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example where the array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe reverse cumulative sum (starting from the end) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then adding 1 gives 0. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must also satisfy that the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample given in the problem's note. \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe reverse cumulative sum (starting from the end) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then -1 + (-1) = -2 \u2192 then -2 +2 =0. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the cumulative sum from the start is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start is 1,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element and moving left) would be 0, -1, 0. \n\nHmm, the first step (from the end) is 0, then adding -1 gives -1, then adding 1 gives 0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first of these (when moving left) is 0, then -1, which is negative. \n\nHmm, so maybe the reverse cumulative sum must be non-positive? \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative at every step. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive at every step. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nIn the sample given in the note: \n\nThe array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nCumulative from start: 2,1,0,0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nCumulative from end (starting from the end and moving left): \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then -1 + (-1) = -2 \u2192 then -2 +2 =0. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sums when moving from the end would be: \n\nStarting at the last element (0), then adding the previous element (-1) gives -1, then adding the next (-1) gives -2, then adding 2 gives 0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end (moving left) are 0, -1, -2, 0. \n\nThese are all <=0 except the last one (0). \n\nHmm, so the cumulative sums from the end must be <=0 at every step except the last? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, in the sample, the cumulative sums from the end (excluding the last step) are all <=0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me test this with the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nSum is zero. \n\nCumulative from start: 1,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nCumulative from end (starting from the end): \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then -1 +1 =0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first step (after the first element) is -1 (<=0), then 0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end are all <=0 except the last. \n\nHmm, so maybe the cumulative from the end must be <=0 at every step except the last. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, the cumulative from the end is computed as follows: \n\nLet me define the reverse cumulative sum as follows: \n\nLet me process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet me define S_rev[i] as the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative from the end would be the sum of the elements from the end up to each position. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum from the start and from the end, and ensure that the cumulative from the start is non-negative and the cumulative from the end is non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is okay. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting from the end and moving left) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then -1 +1 =0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first step (after the first element) is -1 (<=0), then 0. \n\nSo the cumulative from the end must be non-positive except the last step. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, but how to compute the cumulative from the end? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end is the same as the cumulative from the start but in reverse. \n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum from the start and ensure it's non-negative, and also compute the cumulative sum from the end (starting from the end and moving left) and ensure it's non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is okay. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting from the end) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) = -1 \u2192 then -1 +1 =0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first step (after the first element) is -1 (<=0), then 0. \n\nSo the cumulative from the end must be non-positive except the last step. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative from the end must be non-positive at every step except the last. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, the cumulative from the end is the sum of the elements from the end up to each position. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum from the start and ensure it's non-negative, and also compute the cumulative sum from the end (starting from the end and moving left) and ensure it's non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the end would be: \n\nStarting at the last element (0), cumulative is 0. \n\nThen adding the previous element (-1) gives -1 (<=0). \n\nThen adding the first element (1) gives 0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first two steps (excluding the last) are non-positive. \n\nHmm, so the cumulative from the end must be non-positive except the last step. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums (from the start) are non-negative. \n\n3. All suffix sums (from the end) are non-positive. \n\nWait, how to compute the suffix sums? \n\nThe suffix sum up to position i (from the end) would be the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the suffix sum from the end up to position i (moving left) would be the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the suffix sum from the end is the cumulative sum starting from the end and moving left. \n\nLet me think of the suffix sum as follows: \n\nLet me define S_rev[i] as the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nThen, for the condition, S_rev[i] must be <=0 for all i from 0 to n-1. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nIn the sample given in the note: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums are: \n\nFor i=0: 2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \n\ni=1: -1 + (-1)+0 =-2 \n\ni=2: -1 +0 =-1 \n\ni=3:0 \n\nSo the suffix sums are 0, -2, -1, 0. \n\nThese are all <=0 except the first and last. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample in the note. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is 2,1,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting from the end and moving left) would be: \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) =-1 \u2192 then -1 + (-1) =-2 \u2192 then -2 +2 =0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums are 0, -1, -2, 0. \n\nThese are all non-positive except the first and last. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive except the last step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive for all positions except the last. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum from the start and ensure it's non-negative, and also compute the cumulative sum from the end (starting from the end and moving left) and ensure it's non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is 1,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting from the end) is 0 \u2192 then adding -1 gives -1 (non-positive), then adding 1 gives 0. \n\nSo the cumulative sums from the end are 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first two steps (excluding the last) are non-positive. \n\nSo the condition would be that all cumulative sums from the end except the last are non-positive. \n\nHmm, but how to implement this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, but how to compute the cumulative from the end? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end can be computed as follows: \n\nWe can compute the cumulative sum from the end by starting from the end and moving left, accumulating the sum. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nWe can compute the cumulative sum from the start and check if all are non-negative. \n\nThen compute the cumulative sum from the end and check if all are non-positive. \n\nWait, let me try this with the sample in the note. \n\nSample array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nCumulative from start: 2,1,0,0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nCumulative from end (starting from the end and moving left): \n\n0 \u2192 0 + (-1) =-1 \u2192 then -1 + (-1) =-2 \u2192 then -2 +2 =0. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 0, -1, -2, 0. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the end are 0, -1, -2, 0. \n\nThe first element (0) is okay (non-positive?), but the first step is 0 (which is okay), then -1, etc. \n\nWait, but the cumulative from the end must be non-positive. \n\nThe first cumulative sum (0) is okay (0 is non-positive?), but the last is 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive for all positions except the last. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative from the end must be non-positive for all positions except the first. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. \n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the path's movement. \n\nThe pointer starts at 0 and must end at 0. \n\nThe array a is the result of all the increments and decrements. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe array a must be such that the path can be constructed. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\". \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example. \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me see the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is okay. \n\nThe cumulative from the end (starting from the end) is 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the end are 0 (non-positive?), then -1 (non-positive), then 0 (non-positive). \n\nWait, 0 is non-positive. \n\nSo that would satisfy the condition. \n\nAnother example: [2, -3, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative from start: 2, -1 (negative \u2192 invalid). \n\nSo it's rejected. \n\nAnother example: [0,0,0]. \n\nCumulative sums are 0,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nCumulative from end: 0,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAnother example: [1,0,-1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative from start: 1,1,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nCumulative from end: -1 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 but wait, let's compute it properly. \n\nWait, the array is [1,0,-1]. \n\nCumulative from the end (starting from the end and moving left): \n\nStart at the last element (-1): cumulative is -1 (non-positive). \n\nAdd the previous element (0): cumulative is -1 \u2192 still non-positive. \n\nAdd the first element (1): cumulative is 0 \u2192 non-positive. \n\nSo all are non-positive. \n\nSo this array would be accepted. \n\nBut can it be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nWe need to get [1,0,-1]. \n\nPossible path: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes 0). \n\nThen move left is not possible (already at 0). \n\nWait, but the pointer must end at 0. \n\nThe final array would be a[0] =1, a[1] =0, a[2] =-1. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo the conditions are holding. \n\nAnother test case: [1, -1, 0]. \n\nCumulative from start is okay. \n\nCumulative from end is 0, -1, 0 \u2192 all non-positive. \n\nSo it should be accepted. \n\nBut earlier I couldn't find a path. \n\nWait, let me try again. \n\nThe desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nPossible path: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes -1). \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 2 \u2192 no, that's not desired. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, maybe another path: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] =1). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] =1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes 0). \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 2 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, this is not working. \n\nWait, maybe it's not possible. \n\nBut according to the conditions, it should be possible. \n\nHmm, so there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at position 0. \n\nThe array a must be formed by the operations. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\". \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but how does this help? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example. \n\nThe pointer can move back and forth, but the final position must be 0. \n\nThe array a is the result of all the increments and decrements. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe array must satisfy that the sum is zero. \n\nAdditionally, the path must not have any \"impossible\" steps. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nBut in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is 0, -1, 0 \u2192 which are all non-positive. \n\nBut the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of another approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe array a must be such that when you process it from left to right, the current position can't go below zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\". \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\ncurrent_pos = 0 \n\nbalance = 0 \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nWe can model the process as follows: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. \n\nThe array a is the result of all the operations. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move to the next. \n\nEach time you move left, you subtract 1 from the current cell and move to the previous. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nThe array a is the sum of all these operations. \n\nNow, the problem is to determine if such a sequence of moves exists. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position and the current \"balance\" of the pointer's movement. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nBut in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is non-positive, but the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's another condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative from the end must also be non-positive. \n\nWait, in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first step (after the first element) is -1, which is okay. \n\nBut the path can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative from the start must be non-negative and the cumulative from the end must be non-positive. \n\nBut in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is non-positive. \n\nBut the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem differently. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe array a must be such that the path can be formed. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe array a is the difference between the number of right moves from each position and left moves from that position. \n\nThe total right moves must equal the total left moves. \n\nThe sum of a is zero. \n\nNow, the path must form a closed loop. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe array a must be such that for each position i, the number of right moves from i minus left moves from i equals a[i]. \n\nThe path must form a closed loop. \n\nNow, the problem is to determine if such a path exists. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the problem by tracking the current position and the required steps. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\ncurrent_pos = 0 \n\nWe can track the current position and the required steps. \n\nBut how to model this for the entire array? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note's example: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nBut in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is non-positive, but the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's another condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative from the end must also be non-positive. \n\nWait, in the example [1, -1, 0], the cumulative from the end is 0, -1, 0. \n\nThe first element's cumulative from the end is 0 (non-positive), the second is -1 (non-positive), the third is 0 (non-positive). \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nBut the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nLet me try to find a path for the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe desired array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nLet me try the following steps: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 0 (a[1] becomes -1). \n\nNow, the pointer is at 0. \n\nWe need to end here. \n\nThe array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nYes! \n\nWait, that works. \n\nWait, the steps are: \n\nInitial array: [0,0,0]. \n\nStep 1: move right to 1 \u2192 a[0] becomes 1. \n\nStep 2: move left to 0 \u2192 a[1] becomes -1. \n\nNow, the pointer is back at 0. \n\nThe array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nYes! \n\nSo the path is possible. \n\nI must have made a mistake earlier. \n\nSo the conditions are sufficient. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n1. The sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums (cumulative from the start) are non-negative. \n\n3. All suffix sums (cumulative from the end) are non-positive. \n\nWait, but how to compute the suffix sums? \n\nAlternatively, the suffix sum from the end is the cumulative sum from the end moving left. \n\nWait, the suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nThe condition is that this suffix sum must be <=0 for all i. \n\nLet me see for the example [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums are: \n\nFor i=0: 1 + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 which is okay (<=0). \n\ni=1: -1 +0 =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2:0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo all are <=0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe suffix sums are: \n\ni=0: 2-1-1+0=0 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=1: -1-1+0 =-2 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2: -1+0 =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=3:0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo all are <=0. \n\nAnother example: [1,0,-1]. \n\nSuffix sums: \n\ni=0:1+0-1=0 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=1:0-1 =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2: -1 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo conditions are met. \n\nAnother example: [0,0,0]. \n\nAll suffix sums are 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAnother example: [3, -2, -1]. \n\nSuffix sums: \n\ni=0:0 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=1: -2-1 =-3 \u2192 okay. \n\ni=2: -1 \u2192 okay. \n\nCumulative from start: 3,1,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo conditions are met. \n\nAnother example: [1, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative from start: 1, -1 (negative \u2192 invalid). \n\nSo rejected. \n\nAnother example: [-1,1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative from start: -1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo rejected. \n\nAnother example: [2, -3, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative from start: 2, -1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo rejected. \n\nSo the conditions seem to work. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Check if the sum of the array is zero. \n\n- Compute the prefix sums (cumulative from the start) and ensure all are non-negative. \n\n- Compute the suffix sums (cumulative from the end) and ensure all are non-positive. \n\nIf all three conditions are met, output \"Yes\", else \"No\". \n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently? \n\nThe constraints are up to 2e5 elements per test case. \n\nComputing prefix sums is straightforward. \n\nFor suffix sums, we can compute them by iterating from the end and accumulating. \n\nWait, the suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can compute the suffix sums array as follows: \n\nInitialize suffix_sum as an array of length n. \n\nsuffix_sum[n-1] = a[n-1] \n\nfor i from n-2 down to 0: \n\n    suffix_sum[i] = a[i] + suffix_sum[i+1] \n\nThen, check that all suffix_sum[i] <=0. \n\nBut this requires O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable. \n\nNow, the code given in the problem has some variables: \n\nThe code starts with: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    input()\n\n    n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    s,f,m = 0,0,0\n\n    for i in n:\n\n        s +=i\n\n        if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break\n\n        if s ==0: f=1\n\n        if f and s>0: m=1; break\n\n    print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2])\n\nHmm, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe variables s, f, m are used. \n\nThe code seems to be trying to track the prefix sum (s) and some flags. \n\nThe final print statement uses a string slicing trick. \n\nThe current code's logic is not correct. \n\nWe need to modify it to implement the conditions I found. \n\nThe correct approach is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Read n and the array a. \n\n2. Check if the sum of a is not zero \u2192 output No. \n\n3. Compute the prefix sums and check if any is negative \u2192 if yes, No. \n\n4. Compute the suffix sums and check if any is positive \u2192 if yes, No. \n\nElse, output Yes. \n\nNow, let's see how to implement this in the given code. \n\nThe given code has variables s, f, m. \n\nThe loop is over each element in n (the array). \n\nThe current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the running sum (prefix sum). \n\nThe variable f is set to 1 when the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\nThe variable m is set to 1 if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. \n\nThe print statement uses \"YNEOS\" slicing. \n\nThe current code's logic is checking whether the prefix sum ever becomes negative, and whether after reaching zero, it goes positive again. \n\nBut this is not the correct conditions. \n\nWe need to modify the code to check the prefix sums are non-negative, and the suffix sums are non-positive. \n\nBut how to compute the suffix sums efficiently in the given code's structure? \n\nThe given code's loop is processing the array elements one by one. \n\nThe current code's loop is processing the prefix sum. \n\nTo compute the suffix sums, we need to process the array from the end. \n\nBut in the given code's structure, the loop is over the elements in the array as given (from first to last). \n\nSo perhaps the code needs to be restructured. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with the following approach: \n\nThe conditions are: \n\nsum(a) ==0 \n\nprefix sums are all non-negative \n\nsuffix sums are all non-positive \n\nTo compute the suffix sums, we can compute the suffix sum array. \n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), this is manageable. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nRead the array. \n\nCheck sum is zero. \n\nCompute prefix sums and check all are >=0. \n\nCompute suffix sums and check all are <=0. \n\nIf all conditions met \u2192 yes else no. \n\nNow, let's see how to implement this in the given code. \n\nThe given code's loop is processing the elements in the array. \n\nThe current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the prefix sum. \n\nThe current code is checking whether the prefix sum ever becomes negative (the first condition in the TODO). \n\nThe second condition is checking if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. \n\nBut this is not the correct condition. \n\nThe correct conditions are: \n\nprefix sum must be non-negative for all elements. \n\nThe suffix sum must be non-positive for all elements. \n\nSo the first part (prefix sum) can be checked in the loop. \n\nThe second part (suffix sum) requires another loop. \n\nSo the code needs to be modified as follows: \n\nRead the array. \n\nCheck sum is zero. \n\nCheck prefix sums are all non-negative. \n\nCompute suffix sums and check all are non-positive. \n\nThus, the code can be written as: \n\nfor each test case: \n\n    read n and a \n\n    if sum(a)!=0: \n\n        print(\"No\") \n\n        continue \n\n    # check prefix sums \n\n    prefix =0 \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for num in a: \n\n        prefix += num \n\n        if prefix <0: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    if not valid: \n\n        print(\"No\") \n\n        continue \n\n    # check suffix sums \n\n    suffix =0 \n\n    for num in reversed(a): \n\n        suffix += num \n\n        if suffix >0: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    if valid: \n\n        print(\"Yes\") \n\n    else: \n\n        print(\"No\") \n\nThis would work. \n\nBut the given code's structure is different. \n\nThe given code has variables s,f,m. \n\nThe loop is over the elements. \n\nThe current code's logic is trying to track whether the prefix sum ever becomes negative, and whether after reaching zero, it goes positive again. \n\nBut this is not the correct condition. \n\nThe correct conditions are: \n\nprefix sum must be non-negative for all elements. \n\nThe suffix sum must be non-positive for all elements. \n\nThe given code's current logic is not sufficient. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO section is probably checking whether the prefix sum is negative. \n\nThe current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the prefix sum. \n\nThe first condition (the TODO) should check if the prefix sum is negative. \n\nIf so, set m=1 and break. \n\nThe second condition sets f to 1 when the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\nThe third condition checks if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. \n\nThis is not the correct condition. \n\nThe correct conditions are: \n\nThe prefix sum must be non-negative for all elements. \n\nThe suffix sum must be non-positive for all elements. \n\nThe current code's logic is not capturing the suffix sum condition. \n\nThus, the given code's approach is not sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach requires checking both prefix and suffix sums. \n\nBut the given code's structure may not allow this easily. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved with the following observation: \n\nThe suffix sum condition can be rephrased as the prefix sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nThe suffix sum for position i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nThis is equivalent to the total sum minus the prefix sum up to i-1. \n\nSince the total sum is zero, the suffix sum for position i is equal to -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nThe prefix sum up to i-1 is sum(a[0..i-1]). \n\nThe suffix sum for position i is sum(a[i..n-1]) = total_sum - prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nSince total_sum is zero, this is -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nThus, the suffix sum for position i is -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nThe condition that suffix_sum[i] <=0 is equivalent to -prefix_sum[i-1] <=0 \u2192 prefix_sum[i-1] >=0. \n\nWait, this is interesting. \n\nSo the suffix sum condition is equivalent to the prefix_sum up to i-1 being >=0. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nFor the suffix sum at position i: \n\nsum(a[i..n-1]) = total_sum - prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nSince total_sum is zero, this is -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nThe condition that this is <=0 is equivalent to -prefix_sum[i-1] <=0 \u2192 prefix_sum[i-1] >=0. \n\nThus, the suffix sum condition is equivalent to all prefix sums up to i-1 are non-negative. \n\nWait, this is a crucial insight! \n\nThis means that the suffix sum condition is automatically satisfied if the prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think carefully. \n\nThe suffix sum for position i is the sum from a[i] to a[n-1]. \n\nThis is equal to total_sum - prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nSince total_sum is zero, this is -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nThe condition that this is <=0 is equivalent to prefix_sum[i-1] >=0. \n\nThus, the suffix sum condition is equivalent to all prefix sums up to i-1 are non-negative. \n\nBut the prefix sums up to i-1 are exactly the prefix sums computed up to that point. \n\nThus, the suffix sum condition is automatically satisfied if the prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nWait, this is a key point. \n\nSo the two conditions (prefix sums non-negative and suffix sums non-positive) are equivalent to the prefix sums being non-negative. \n\nBecause the suffix sum condition is automatically satisfied if the prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nWait, let me see with an example. \n\nTake the array [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 1,0,0. \n\nThe suffix sums are: \n\nFor i=0: 0 \u2192 which is -prefix_sum[-1] (prefix_sum[-1] is 0? \n\nWait, the prefix_sum for i-1 when i=0 is prefix_sum[-1], which is undefined. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. \n\nLet me rephrase: \n\nThe suffix sum for position i is the sum from a[i] to a[n-1]. \n\nThis is equal to total_sum - prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nThus, for i=0, the suffix sum is total_sum - prefix_sum[-1]. \n\nBut prefix_sum[-1] is the prefix sum up to index -1, which is zero (since there are no elements before index 0). \n\nThus, the suffix sum for i=0 is total_sum -0 =0. \n\nWhich is okay. \n\nFor i=1, the suffix sum is total_sum - prefix_sum[0] =0 -1 =-1. \n\nWhich is okay. \n\nFor i=2, the suffix sum is 0 - prefix_sum[1] =0-0=0. \n\nThus, all suffix sums are non-positive. \n\nThus, the suffix sum condition is satisfied if the prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThus, the two conditions (prefix sums non-negative and suffix sums non-positive) are equivalent to the prefix sums being non-negative. \n\nThis is a crucial insight! \n\nThus, the problem reduces to two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. All prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThis simplifies the problem. \n\nThus, the correct conditions are: \n\nsum(a) ==0 \n\nand all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThis is a big simplification. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows: \n\nfor each test case: \n\n    read n and a \n\n    if sum(a)!=0: \n\n        print(\"No\") \n\n        continue \n\n    prefix =0 \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for num in a: \n\n        prefix += num \n\n        if prefix <0: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    print(\"Yes\" if valid else \"No\") \n\nThis is much simpler. \n\nNow, let's see why this works. \n\nThe suffix sum condition is automatically satisfied because the suffix sum for position i is -prefix_sum[i-1]. \n\nSince prefix_sum[i-1] is non-negative (due to the prefix condition), the suffix sum is non-positive. \n\nThus, the two conditions are equivalent to the prefix sums being non-negative and the total sum zero. \n\nThis explains why the example [1, -1, 0] is valid. \n\nThe prefix sums are 1,0,0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe suffix sums are 0, -1,0 \u2192 all non-positive. \n\nThus, the conditions are met. \n\nAnother example: [2, -1, -1,0]. \n\nPrefix sums are 2,1,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, valid. \n\nAnother example: [3, -2, -1]. \n\nPrefix sums are 3,1,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus valid. \n\nAnother example: [1,0,-1]. \n\nPrefix sums are 1,1,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus valid. \n\nAnother example: [0,0,0]. \n\nPrefix sums are 0,0,0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus valid. \n\nAnother example: [1, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is zero. \n\nPrefix sums are 1, -1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus rejected. \n\nAnother example: [-1,1]. \n\nSum is zero. \n\nPrefix sums are -1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus rejected. \n\nThus, the correct conditions are sum is zero and all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThus, the code can be written as above. \n\nNow, looking back at the given code's structure: \n\nThe code has variables s, f, m. \n\nThe loop is over the elements. \n\nThe current code's logic is trying to track whether the prefix sum ever becomes negative (the first condition in the TODO), and whether after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again (the second condition). \n\nThe second condition is not needed. \n\nThe correct condition is that the prefix sum never goes negative. \n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO section should be checking if the prefix sum is negative. \n\nThe current code's loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe variables s is the prefix sum. \n\nThe first condition (the TODO) should check if s <0 \u2192 if so, set m=1 and break. \n\nThe second condition sets f to 1 when the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\nThe third condition checks if after reaching zero, the sum becomes positive again. \n\nThis third condition is not needed. \n\nThus, the correct code would be: \n\nThe first condition (the TODO) should be: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m=1 \n\n    break \n\nThe other conditions are not needed. \n\nThe variables f and the third condition are not needed. \n\nThus, the code should be modified as follows: \n\nThe loop becomes: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if s <0: \n\n        m =1 \n\n        break \n\n    if s ==0: \n\n        f=1 \n\n    # the third condition is not needed \n\nWait, but the code's final print statement uses \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. \n\nThis suggests that the code's logic is different. \n\nThe current code's print statement is using a string slicing trick. \n\nThe string \"YNEOS\" is 5 characters long. \n\nThe index is computed as (m or not f)::2. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe expression (m or not f) evaluates to a boolean. \n\nIf m is true (1), then the value is 1. \n\nElse, if not f is true (i.e., f is 0), then the value is 1. \n\nElse, it's 0. \n\nThen, the slice is [1::2] or [0::2]. \n\nThe string \"YNEOS\" is: \n\nIndices 0: 'Y', 1: 'N', 2: 'E', 3: 'O', 4: 'S' \n\nSo [1::2] gives 'N' followed by 'O' \u2192 but the step is 2. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\n\"YNEOS\"[1::2] \u2192 starts at index 1, then every 2nd character: 'N', 'O' \u2192 but the slice is from index 1 to end with step 2 \u2192 'N' and 'O' \u2192 but the string is length 5. \n\nThe first character is index 1: 'N', then index 3: 'O', then index 5 (which is beyond). \n\nSo the slice is 'NO'. \n\nTaking the first character gives 'N'. \n\nSimilarly, [0::2] gives 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 first character is 'Y'. \n\nThus, the code is using this to choose between 'Y' and 'N'. \n\nThe condition is: \n\nif (m or not f) is true \u2192 then the index is 1 \u2192 returns 'N' \n\nelse \u2192 index 0 \u2192 returns 'Y'. \n\nThus, the code's logic is: \n\nIf m is set (meaning the prefix sum went negative) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse, if f is not set (meaning the prefix sum never reached zero) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse \u2192 output 'Y'. \n\nWait, but the correct condition is that the sum is zero and all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\n- m is set if any prefix sum is negative \u2192 output 'N'. \n\n- f is set when the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\n- If f is not set, then the final sum is zero (since sum is checked?), but the prefix never reached zero \u2192 but the final sum must be zero. \n\nWait, the code's first line after reading the array is: \n\ninput() \n\nWait, the first line of each test case is the n. \n\nThe code reads the first line as input(), then reads the array. \n\nWait, the code's first line after the for loop is: \n\ninput() \n\nThen, n is read as list(map(...)), but the first line is the n. \n\nWait, the code has a mistake here. \n\nThe input for each test case is: \n\nFirst line: n \n\nSecond line: the array. \n\nThe code reads the first line as input() (discarded), then reads the array as list(map(...)), which is stored in n. \n\nThus, the variable n is actually the array. \n\nThe actual n is read as the first line, but it's not stored. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nThe code should be: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # proceed with n and a \n\nThus, the current code has a bug where n is not stored properly. \n\nThis is a critical error. \n\nThe current code's first line after the for loop is: \n\ninput() \n\nThen, n is assigned to list(map(...)), which is the array. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nThis means that the code's logic is completely wrong. \n\nThus, the correct code must first read n, then the array. \n\nThe given code has this error. \n\nThus, the first step to fix the code is to read n properly. \n\nThe code's first lines are: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    input()\n\n    n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\nThis is wrong. \n\nThe first input after the test case is the n. \n\nThe code reads it as input() (discarded), then reads the array as n. \n\nThus, the array is stored in n, and the actual n is lost. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nThus, the first step is to fix this. \n\nThe correct code should be: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # proceed \n\nThus, the first line of the test case is read as n. \n\nThe second line is the array. \n\nThus, the code's first lines are incorrect. \n\nThis is a critical error. \n\nThe given code's first lines are wrong. \n\nThus, the code must be fixed first. \n\nAssuming that the code's first lines are fixed, then the next step is to implement the conditions. \n\nThe correct conditions are: \n\nsum(a) must be zero. \n\nAll prefix sums must be non-negative. \n\nThus, the code should: \n\nCheck sum(a) !=0 \u2192 output No. \n\nElse, compute the prefix sums and check if any is negative. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    if sum(a)!=0:\n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        continue\n\n    s =0 \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for num in a:\n\n        s += num \n\n        if s <0:\n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    print(\"Yes\" if valid else \"No\")\n\nThis would work. \n\nBut the given code's structure is different. \n\nThe given code has variables s,f,m. \n\nThe loop is over the elements in the array (stored in n, which is actually the array). \n\nThe code's current logic is incorrect due to the first lines. \n\nAssuming that the first lines are fixed, the code can be modified as follows: \n\nThe code's loop is: \n\nfor i in a: \n\n    s +=i \n\n    if s <0: \n\n        m =1 \n\n        break \n\n    if s ==0: \n\n        f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: \n\n        m=1 \n\n        break \n\nThe variables f and the third condition are not needed. \n\nThe correct condition is whether s ever becomes negative. \n\nThus, the code can be modified to set m=1 if s <0. \n\nThe final print statement should be \"Yes\" if m is 0 and the sum is zero. \n\nBut the current print statement uses \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\nIf m is set (prefix went negative) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse, if f is not set (prefix never reached zero) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse \u2192 'Y'. \n\nBut the correct condition is that the sum is zero and all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nThe sum is checked before the loop. \n\nThus, the code's logic is: \n\nIf the sum is zero and all prefix sums are non-negative \u2192 output 'Yes'. \n\nElse \u2192 'No'. \n\nThus, the code's print statement should be: \n\nprint(\"Yes\" if (sum is zero and no negative prefix) else \"No\"). \n\nThe current code's print statement is using a different logic. \n\nThus, the correct code would require changing the print statement. \n\nBut given the constraints of the problem, the user wants to complete the given code. \n\nThe given code has the following structure: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    input()\n\n    n = list(map(int,input().split())) # this is the array \n\n    s,f,m =0,0,0 \n\n    for i in n: \n\n        s +=i \n\n        if # TODO: Your code here m=1; break \n\n        if s ==0: f=1 \n\n        if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\n    print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]) \n\nThe first lines are incorrect (n is the array, not the length). \n\nBut assuming that the code's first lines are fixed, the code can be modified as follows: \n\nThe first lines should be: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    s,f,m =0,0,0 \n\n    if sum(a)!=0: \n\n        print(\"No\")\n\n        continue \n\n    for num in a: \n\n        s += num \n\n        if s <0: \n\n            m=1 \n\n            break \n\n        if s ==0: \n\n            f=1 \n\n    print(\"Yes\" if (m==0) else \"No\") \n\nBut the given code's print statement uses a different logic. \n\nThe current print statement uses \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\nIf m is set (prefix went negative) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse, if f is not set (prefix never reached zero) \u2192 output 'N'. \n\nElse \u2192 'Y'. \n\nBut the correct condition is that the sum is zero (already checked) and all prefix sums are non-negative (m==0). \n\nThus, the print statement should be \"Yes\" if m==0, else \"No\". \n\nThe current print statement's logic is different. \n\nThus, the code's print statement should be changed. \n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nThe missing code is the part in the TODO section. \n\nThe current code's loop has: \n\nfor i in n: \n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m=1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe TODO section should be replaced with the condition that if s <0 \u2192 set m=1 and break. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nThus, the code after the TODO should be: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nThe other conditions (the third one) are not needed. \n\nBut the current code has the third condition (if f and s>0 \u2192 set m=1 and break). \n\nThis third condition is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct code would require removing that condition. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe problem is that the current code has other errors (like the first lines reading n incorrectly), but the user's code may have those errors and we have to complete it as is. \n\nAssuming that the code's first lines are correct (even though they are not), the missing code in the TODO section is: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nThus, the code after the TODO should be this condition. \n\nThe other conditions (the third one) are incorrect and should be removed, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the missing code is the condition to check if s is negative. \n\nThus, the answer is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nBut in Python, the code must be properly indented and have colons. \n\nThe code inside the loop is: \n\nfor i in n:\n\n    s +=i \n\n    if # TODO: Your code here m =1; break \n\n    if s ==0: f=1 \n\n    if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\nThe missing code is the first if condition. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nif s <0: \n\n    m =1 \n\n    break \n\nBut in the code's current structure, the line is written as a single line. \n\nThe code uses semicolons to separate statements. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThus, the correct missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis will set m to 1 and break the loop if the prefix sum becomes negative. \n\nThe other conditions (the third one) are incorrect but are part of the given code. \n\nHowever, the problem requires to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the correct answer is the code to check if s is negative and set m and break. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis is the code to be placed in the TODO section. \n\nThe other conditions in the loop are incorrect but are part of the given code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the answer is the code for the first condition. \n\nThe other conditions are not part of the missing code. \n\nThus, the correct missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis will ensure that if the prefix sum ever becomes negative, the loop breaks and m is set to 1. \n\nThe final print statement uses the logic that if m is set or f is not set (prefix never reached zero), then output 'No'. \n\nBut the sum is already checked to be zero. \n\nWait, the code's first line after reading the array is: \n\ninput() \n\nn = list(map(...)) \n\nThus, the code's sum is not checked. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to complete the given code. \n\nAssuming that the code's first lines are correct (even though they are not), the missing code is the condition to check for negative prefix sums. \n\nThus, the answer is the code to check if s is negative. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis is the correct code to fill in the TODO section. \n\nThe other conditions in the loop are incorrect but are part of the given code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the answer is the code for the first condition. \n\nThe other conditions are not part of the missing code. \n\nThus, the correct missing code is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break \n\nThis will set m to 1 and break the loop if the prefix sum becomes negative. \n\nThe final print statement uses the logic that if m is set or f is not set (prefix never reached zero), then output 'No'. \n\nBut the sum is not checked. \n\nHowever, the problem requires to complete the given code. \n\nThus, the missing code is the condition to check for negative prefix sums. \n\nThe other errors in the code (like not checking the sum) are part of the given code and cannot be changed. \n\nThus, the correct answer is the code to check if s is negative. \n\nThe final code after filling in the TODO would be: \n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n\n    input()\n\n    n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    s,f,m =0,0,0 \n\n    for i in n:\n\n        s +=i \n\n        if s <0: m=1;break \n\n        if s ==0: f=1 \n\n        if f and s>0: m=1; break \n\n    print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2]) \n\nThis code will check for negative prefix sums and set m. \n\nThe print statement uses the logic that if m is set (prefix went negative) or f is not set (prefix never reached zero), then output 'No'. \n\nBut the sum is not checked. \n\nHowever, the problem's sample input may have the sum checked elsewhere. \n\nBut according to the problem's description, the sum must be zero. \n\nThus, the given code is incorrect in not checking the sum. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to complete the given code. \n\nThus, the missing code is the condition to check for negative prefix sums. \n\nThus, the correct answer is the code to check if s is negative. \n\nThe final answer is: \n\nif s <0: m=1;break"
