Let's see:\n\nAll substrings of length 1: 4 \u2192 valid. Length 2: 3 substrings, all are \"01\", \"10\", \"01\" \u2192 all valid. Length 3: 2 substrings: \"010\" (transitions 2, which is 3-1=2 \u2192 valid), \"101\" (same). Length 4: 1 substring, which is the whole string (transitions 3 \u2192 valid). Total 4+3+2+1 = 10. So that works. Another example: \"001\". The runs are \"00\" (non-alternating, so run length 2), then \"1\" (run length 1).",

So R1 is 0, R2 is 1, R3 is 0, etc. So the concatenation of R1 and R2 is \"0...0\" followed by \"1...1\", so the transition between them is 0 to 1, which is okay.

So the problem is that the runs themselves can have length greater than 1, so the individual runs can't be part of a valid substring unless their length is 1. So the valid substrings can only be formed by taking a sequence of runs, but each run in the sequence must have length 1. Because otherwise, the run itself has two same characters in a row, making the substring invalid. Wait, that complicates things. Let me think again. The valid substrings are those that have no two consecutive same characters. So any substring that includes a run of length >=2 is invalid, unless the run is of length 1. Wait, no. For example, a run of length 2 (like \"00\") can't be part of any valid substring except as single characters. So the only valid substrings are those that do not include any run of length >=2, except when they are split between runs. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem in terms of the positions where the characters change. Let me model the string as a sequence of transitions between 0 and 1. Let's say the transitions occur at certain indices. For example, in the string \"0101\", transitions are between 0 and 1, then 1 and 0, etc. The positions where the character changes are important.",

Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the code is 0-based. Let's see for the example \"010\" (n=3):\n\nThe code initializes c =3. Then, for i from 1 to 2 (since n-1 is 2):\n\ni=1 (second character):\n\nCheck if aa[1] ! = aa[0]. Let's say the string is \"010\", so aa[0] is false (0), aa[1] is true (1). So different. So add 1 to c. Now c is 4.\n\ni=2 (third character):\n\naa[2] is false (0), aa[1] is true \u2192 different. Add 2 \u2192 c becomes 6. Which matches the correct answer of 6. Another example: \"001\" (n=3):\n\nc starts at 3. i=1: aa[1] == aa[0] (both 0 \u2192 false). So no addition.\n\ni=2: aa[2] is 1 (true), different from previous (false). So add 2 \u2192 c becomes 3+2=5. But the correct answer is 4. So this approach is wrong. Hmm, so the code's current approach is incorrect. So the user's code is wrong, and I need to fix it. The correct approach is to compute the dp array and sum all dp[i]. So the code should be: Initialize sum =0.\n\nprev = 1 (since dp[0] is 1). sum += prev. Then for i from 1 to n-1 (assuming 0-based):\n\nif S[i] ! = S[i-1], then current_dp = prev +1.\n\nelse current_dp =1.\n\nsum += current_dp. prev = current_dp. Wait, let's see for \"001\" (0-based):\n\nS[0] = '0', S[1]='0', S[2]='1'. Initialize sum =1 (dp[0] =1). i=1 (second character):\n\nS[1] == S[0], so current_dp =1. sum +=1 \u2192 sum is 2.\n\ni=2 (third character):\n\nS[2] ! = S[1], so current_dp =1+1=2. sum +=2 \u2192 total 4.

Another example \"010\" (0-based):\n\nsum starts at 1 (dp[0]=1). i=1 (S[1] is '1' vs '0' \u2192 different. current_dp =1+1=2 \u2192 sum +=2 \u2192 3.\n\ni=2 (S[2] is '0' vs '1' \u2192 different. current_dp =2+1=3 \u2192 sum +=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nWhich is correct. So the code needs to be adjusted to compute this. Looking at the given code: In the Solve() method:\n\nThe current code is:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] ! = aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is using 0-based indices for aa (since it's a boolean array from the input). The loop runs from i=1 to n-1 (since i <n). The initial c is n (sum of all 1's if all dp[i] were 1).",

The user's code is adding i when the characters are different, but that's not the right approach. Therefore, the correct code should replace the existing loop with this logic. So in the given code's Solve() method:\n\nReplace the current code:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] ! = aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nWith the correct code:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n} So the initial c is 0, then add currentDp (1) first. Then loop from i=1 to n-1. Wait, let's see for the first example where n=1:\n\nThe loop doesn't run. So c is initialized to 0, then currentDp is 1, so c +=1 \u2192 total 1. Which is correct. Another test case \"01\" (n=2):\n\nInitial c=0, currentDp=1 \u2192 c becomes 1. Then i=1 (second character):\n\naa[1] (1) vs aa[0] (0) \u2192 different. currentDp becomes 2. Add to c \u2192 1+2=3. Which is correct. So the code should be written as such. Therefore, the missing code in the provided code is the loop and the initial setup. Looking at the code provided, the user's code in Solve() is:\n\nprivate void Solve()\n\n        {\n\n            int n = _r.I();\n\n            bool [] aa = _r.OnesZeroes(n);\n\n            long c = n;\n\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)\n\n            {\n\n                if (aa[i] ! = aa[i - 1])\n\n                    c += i;\n\n            }\n\n            _w.WriteLine(c);\n\n        }\n\nSo the correct code should replace the initial c =n and the loop with the correct approach. So the correct code would be:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1; c += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\nSo replacing the existing code's c initialization and loop. Therefore, the missing code is the replacement of the current loop and initial c. The user's code currently has:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1])\n\n        c +=i;\n\n} The correct code should be:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1; c += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n} So the user's code needs to be changed to this. Therefore, the missing code to fill in is the replacement of the existing code block with the above code. The problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user's code has the loop and initial c wrong, so the correct code is the above. So the correct code for the Solve() method's body is:\n\nint n = _r.I();\n\nbool [] aa = _r.OnesZeroes(n);\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\n_w.WriteLine(c); Therefore, the missing code is replacing the existing code block with this. The user's code currently has:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] ! = aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n} So the correct code replaces that with the new code. Therefore, the answer is the code block replacing the existing code in the Solve() method.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of paranoid substrings in a given binary string. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo, a paranoid string T of length m can be reduced to a single character by performing m-1 operations. The operations are either replacing \"01\" with \"1\" or \"10\" with \"0\". The key is to find all substrings of S that are paranoid.\n\nHmm, the example given: For \"001\", they can perform the first operation on the substring \"01\" (positions 2-3), resulting in \"01\", then again on that to get \"0\". So that's a valid paranoid string.\n\nWait, the problem says that after m-1 operations, you end up with length 1. So the process must be possible for the substring to be considered paranoid.\n\nI need to find all (l, r) pairs where the substring S[l..r] is paranoid.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what makes a substring paranoid. Let's think about the process of reducing the string. Each operation reduces the length by 1. So for a substring of length m, after m-1 steps, it becomes length 1. The question is, under what conditions can this process be done?\n\nLet me think of the operations. Each operation replaces either \"01\" with \"1\" or \"10\" with \"0\". So each operation effectively removes a '0' and a '1' and replaces them with one character. The order of operations might matter, but perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the substring must alternate between 0 and 1, but in a way that allows the operations to collapse it step by step. Alternatively, maybe the number of transitions between 0 and 1 must be exactly one less than the length? Or perhaps the parity of the number of transitions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substring can be reduced to a single character only if the number of transitions between 0 and 1 is exactly one. Because each operation reduces the number of transitions by 1. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the substring has k transitions between 0 and 1. Each operation can reduce the transitions. For example, if you have \"01\", which is a transition, replacing it with \"1\" removes that transition. Similarly, \"10\" becomes \"0\", removing that transition. So each operation reduces the number of transitions by 1. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me see:\n\nTake \"010\". The transitions are between 0-1 and 1-0. So two transitions. If I first replace the first \"01\" with \"1\", resulting in \"10\", which has one transition. Then replace that with \"0\", so total steps 2, which is the length minus 1 (3-1=2). So that works. The transitions started at 2, ended at 0. So each step reduces transitions by 1.\n\nAnother example: \"101\". Transitions between 1-0 and 0-1. Two transitions. Similarly, replacing the \"10\" with 0 gives \"01\", then replace that to 1. So again, transitions go from 2 to 0.\n\nHmm, so the number of transitions must be exactly equal to the length minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, the transitions in a string of length m can be at most m-1. For example, \"0101\" has 3 transitions (0-1, 1-0, 0-1). So transitions can be up to m-1. But in the example above, \"010\" has two transitions (m-1=2). So that works. Wait, but what about a string like \"0011\"?\n\nLet's see: \"0011\" has transitions between 0-1 (position 2-3) and then 1-? No, the transitions are only between the 0 and 1. So transitions count is 1. The length is 4. So m-1 is 3. So transitions are 1, which is less than m-1. Let's see if this can be reduced to a single character.\n\nThe string is \"0011\". Let's see possible operations:\n\nPossible steps:\n\nFirst, look for \"01\" or \"10\" substrings. The \"01\" is between the second and third characters. So replacing that with \"1\" gives \"011\". Now, the string is \"011\". Now, check again. The first two characters are \"01\", so replace with \"1\", resulting in \"11\". Now, there are no more operations possible. The length is 2, but we needed to get to 1. So this can't be done. So \"0011\" is not a paranoid string. So the number of transitions must be exactly m-1? Because in that case, each step reduces the transitions by 1, so after m-1 steps, you end up with 0 transitions (a single character).\n\nWait, in the example of \"0011\", transitions are 1, which is less than m-1 (3). So that's why it can't be reduced. So the condition for a substring to be paranoid is that the number of transitions between 0 and 1 in the substring is exactly m-1, where m is the length of the substring. Because then, each operation reduces the transitions by 1, so after m-1 steps, you get to 0 transitions (a single character).\n\nWait, but transitions can't be more than m-1. So the only way to have transitions equal to m-1 is that the string alternates between 0 and 1. For example, \"0101\" has 3 transitions (m=4, transitions 3). So that would be paranoid. Similarly, \"1010\" would also be paranoid.\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"010\"? It has two transitions (m=3, transitions 2 = 3-1). So that works. So the condition is that the substring must alternate between 0 and 1, so that every adjacent pair is a transition. So the substring must be of the form 0101..., 1010..., 010..., etc. So the transitions between every consecutive pair must be different. So the substring must be a sequence that alternates between 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all substrings of S that are alternating between 0 and 1. Because only those substrings have transitions equal to m-1, so they can be reduced to a single character.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the examples given in the problem.\n\nFirst sample: S is of length 1. So all single-character substrings are paranoid. That's correct.\n\nSecond sample: all substrings are paranoid. So the input must be a string that is already alternating. For example, if the input is \"01\", then the substrings are \"0\", \"1\", and \"01\". The \"01\" is paranoid. The entire string is length 2, transitions 1 (which is 2-1=1). So yes.\n\nThird sample: the problem says that except for S[2..3], and the entire string. Wait, the third sample's input is probably \"011\" or something. Let me think. The problem says that the substring [S2S3] can't be reduced. Let's see: if the substring is \"11\", then transitions are 0. So m=2, transitions 0 < 1. So it can't be reduced. The entire string is \"011\", which has transitions between 0 and 1 (positions 1-2), and then 1-1 (no transition). So transitions count is 1. The length is 3, so m-1 is 2. So transitions are 1 < 2, so it can't be reduced. So the entire string is not paranoid. So the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all substrings of S that are alternating between 0 and 1. So the key is to find all substrings where every consecutive pair is different. So the substring must be of the form 0101..., 1010..., etc.\n\nSo how do I compute the number of such substrings efficiently?\n\nThe approach would be to find all runs of alternating characters and count the possible substrings within those runs.\n\nFor example, consider a run of length k (i.e., a maximal sequence of alternating characters). For a run of length k, the number of valid substrings is k*(k+1)/2. Because each possible substring of length 1, 2, ..., k is valid. Because any substring of an alternating run is also alternating.\n\nWait, yes. Because if the entire run is alternating, then any substring of it will also alternate. So for a run of length L, the number of valid substrings is L*(L+1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to splitting the original string into maximal alternating runs, and for each run of length L, add L*(L+1)/2 to the total count.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the entire string is \"0101\". The runs here are just one run of length 4. So the total would be 4*5/2 = 10. Let's see:\n\nAll substrings of length 1: 4 \u2192 valid.\n\nLength 2: 3 substrings, all are \"01\", \"10\", \"01\" \u2192 all valid.\n\nLength 3: 2 substrings: \"010\" (transitions 2, which is 3-1=2 \u2192 valid), \"101\" (same).\n\nLength 4: 1 substring, which is the whole string (transitions 3 \u2192 valid).\n\nTotal 4+3+2+1 = 10. So that works.\n\nAnother example: \"001\". The runs are \"00\" (non-alternating, so run length 2), then \"1\" (run length 1). The first run is non-alternating (since the two 0s are same), so the substrings from the first run can't be part of valid substrings except the single characters. The second run is length 1, so contributes 1.\n\nWait, but the first run is \"00\", which is a run of two same characters. So the valid substrings from the first run are the individual 0s. So each contributes 1 each. So for the first run of length 2, the valid substrings are 2 (each single 0). The second run of length 1 contributes 1. So total 3. But the problem's second sample says that all substrings are paranoid. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem's second sample.\n\nWait the problem says in the second sample, all substrings are paranoid. Let me see. Suppose the input is \"01\". Then the runs are \"0\" and \"1\", each of length 1. So each run contributes 1, so total 2. But the total substrings are 3 (each single, and the whole). The whole is \"01\", which is valid. So total 3. So the runs approach would give (1*2/2) + (1*2/2) = 1 +1 = 2, but the actual total is 3. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAh, right. Because the runs are separated by transitions. So in the case of \"01\", the runs are each of length 1. So the runs are \"0\" (run length 1) and \"1\" (run length 1). The total would be (1*2/2) + (1*2/2) = 1 +1 = 2, but the actual valid substrings are 3 (the two singles and the whole). So the approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so my previous idea is incorrect. So I need to think again.\n\nWait, the problem is that the runs are maximal sequences of the same character. Wait, no. Wait, the runs here are the maximal alternating sequences? Or perhaps I need to think of the runs as the maximal sequences where consecutive characters alternate. Wait, perhaps I need to model the runs as the maximal sequences where each character alternates with the previous. So for example, in \"010\", the entire string is a single run of length 3. But in \"01\", the runs are each single characters, but the entire string is a valid substring. So the problem is that the runs are not the maximal alternating sequences, but the maximal same-character runs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the runs as the maximal same-character runs. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of transitions between characters. The key is that a substring is paranoid if and only if it is an alternating sequence. So the substring must have all consecutive characters different. So the substring cannot have two same characters in a row.\n\nTherefore, the valid substrings are exactly those that do not contain two identical consecutive characters. So the problem reduces to counting all substrings of S that do not have two identical consecutive characters.\n\nWait, that's a different way to put it. Because if a substring has two same characters in a row, like \"00\", then it can't be reduced to a single character. Because the transitions are less than m-1. So the condition is that the substring has no two same consecutive characters. So the substring must be such that every pair of consecutive characters are different.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to counting all substrings of S that do not have any two identical consecutive characters.\n\nSo how do I count that efficiently?\n\nHmm, the straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible substrings and check, but that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo we need a linear or O(n) approach.\n\nLet me think of the structure of the string. Let's consider the runs of same characters. For example, the string can be divided into runs like \"000\", \"11\", \"0\", etc. Each run is a maximal sequence of the same character.\n\nSuppose the runs are R1, R2, ..., Rk, where each Ri has length Li.\n\nNow, any valid substring must consist of a sequence of runs where each consecutive run alternates between 0 and 1. Moreover, the substring can't have two runs of the same character in a row. Wait, but the runs are already separated by different characters. So between two consecutive runs, the characters are different. So the valid substrings can be formed by taking a sequence of runs, but each run must be of alternating characters. Wait, but the runs are already alternating. So the runs themselves alternate between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, the runs are sequences of same characters, so consecutive runs must alternate between 0 and 1. So the runs alternate between 0 and 1. So the entire string's runs are like 0,1,0,1 etc. or 1,0,1,0 etc.\n\nTherefore, the valid substrings can be formed by taking a consecutive sequence of runs, but the total length must be such that the runs alternate. Wait, but since the runs already alternate, any consecutive sequence of runs will form an alternating string. So the problem reduces to counting all possible intervals of runs that form a valid alternating sequence, and then for each such interval, count the number of possible substrings within that interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the runs and then for each position, track the maximum possible length of a valid substring ending at that position.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the runs. Let's say the runs are R1, R2, ..., Rk. Each run has a length Li and a character (0 or 1).\n\nA valid substring must be a sequence of runs that are consecutive and alternate in character. Since the runs already alternate, any consecutive runs form an alternating sequence. So the entire sequence of runs from Ri to Rj (for i <= j) is a valid alternating sequence. However, the substring must consist of exactly those runs. So the total length of the substring is the sum of the lengths of the runs from Ri to Rj. But the substring must be exactly those runs. So the valid substrings are exactly those that are formed by taking a consecutive sequence of runs (since they alternate), and the substring can start at any position within the first run and end at any position within the last run, as long as the entire sequence of runs is taken.\n\nWait, no. Because the runs are already alternating, so any consecutive runs form an alternating sequence. So the entire sequence of runs from Ri to Rj is an alternating sequence. Therefore, the substring formed by the concatenation of these runs is an alternating string. So any such substring is valid. So the total number of valid substrings is the sum over all possible intervals of runs (i to j) of the number of possible substrings that exactly cover those runs.\n\nWait, but the runs themselves are sequences of same characters. So the concatenation of runs R_i to R_j is an alternating string. So the entire concatenation is a valid substring. But also, any substring that is a subsequence of this concatenation but not covering all runs would also be valid? Wait no. Because the runs are already alternating, so any substring that is a part of the runs from R_i to R_j would also be an alternating string. Wait, no. For example, suppose the runs are R1 (0, length 2), R2 (1, length 1), R3 (0, length 3). The concatenation of R1 and R2 is \"001\", which has two 0s in a row. So that's not an alternating string. Wait, but that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. The runs are sequences of same characters. So R1 is \"00\", R2 is \"1\", R3 is \"000\". The concatenation of R1 and R2 is \"001\", which has two 0s in a row. So that's not an alternating string. So my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nAh, right. So the runs are sequences of same characters. So the runs alternate between 0 and 1. So R1 is 0, R2 is 1, R3 is 0, etc. So the concatenation of R1 and R2 is \"0...0\" followed by \"1...1\", so the transition between them is 0 to 1, which is okay. But within R1, the characters are same, so the substring R1 itself (the first run) is not valid unless its length is 1. Because if R1 has length 2, then the substring consisting of the first two characters is \"00\", which is invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that the runs themselves can have length greater than 1, so the individual runs can't be part of a valid substring unless their length is 1. So the valid substrings can only be formed by taking a sequence of runs, but each run in the sequence must have length 1. Because otherwise, the run itself has two same characters in a row, making the substring invalid.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nThe valid substrings are those that have no two consecutive same characters. So any substring that includes a run of length >=2 is invalid, unless the run is of length 1. Wait, no. For example, a run of length 2 (like \"00\") can't be part of any valid substring except as single characters. So the only valid substrings are those that do not include any run of length >=2, except when they are split between runs.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem in terms of the positions where the characters change.\n\nLet me model the string as a sequence of transitions between 0 and 1. Let's say the transitions occur at certain indices. For example, in the string \"0101\", transitions are between 0 and 1, then 1 and 0, etc. The positions where the character changes are important.\n\nAlternatively, the valid substrings are those that are between two transitions (or the start/end) and have no two same characters in a row. So perhaps the approach is to find all possible intervals [l, r] where between l and r, there are no two consecutive same characters.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can track the last position where a character change occurred and compute the possible valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nFor each position i:\n\n- If the current character is different from the previous one, then the number of valid substrings ending at i is dp[i-1] + 1. Because we can take all the substrings that ended at i-1 and extend them by 1, plus the substring consisting of just the current character.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose S[i] != S[i-1]. Then, the valid substrings ending at i can be formed by:\n\n- The substring S[i], which is valid.\n\n- All substrings ending at i-1 that are valid, and adding S[i] to them. Since the previous character was different, adding it won't create a duplicate.\n\nWait, but the previous substrings ending at i-1 must themselves be valid. So if the previous character was different, then yes, extending them by one would still be valid.\n\nWait, let's formalize this:\n\nSuppose at position i, the current character is different from the previous. Then, the maximum length of a valid substring ending at i is (length of the previous maximum +1). So the number of new substrings added is the length of this maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of dp[i] as the length of the longest valid substring ending at i. Then, the total number of valid substrings ending at i is dp[i].\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nLet's define dp[i] as the length of the longest valid substring ending at position i. Then, the total number of valid substrings is the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, in the string \"010\":\n\nPositions 1: '0' \u2192 dp[1] =1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nPosition 2: '1' \u2192 different from previous. dp[2] = dp[1]+1 = 2 \u2192 total +=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nPosition3: '0' \u2192 different from previous. dp[3] = dp[2]+1 =3 \u2192 total +=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\nAll single characters (3), the two 2-length substrings (01, 10), and the 3-length (010). Total 3+2+1 =6. Which matches the sum of dp[i] (1+2+3=6).\n\nAnother example: \"001\".\n\nPosition1: '0' \u2192 dp[1]=1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nPosition2: '0' \u2192 same as previous. So the longest valid substring ending here is 1 (just the current character). So dp[2] =1 \u2192 total +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nPosition3: '1' \u2192 different from previous. dp[3] = dp[2]+1 =2 \u2192 total +=2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\nEach single character (3), the substring \"00\" is invalid, \"01\" (positions 2-3) is valid, and \"001\" is invalid. So valid substrings are 3 (singles) +1 (positions 2-3) \u2192 total 4. Which matches the sum (1+1+2=4).\n\nAnother example: \"01\".\n\nPositions 1: dp[1]=1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nPosition2: '1' is different from previous? Wait, no, previous is '0', so yes. So dp[2] =2 \u2192 total 3. Which is correct (3 substrings).\n\nSo this approach works. So the total is the sum of dp[i], where dp[i] is defined as:\n\ndp[i] = 1 if S[i] == S[i-1], else dp[i-1]+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when S[i] is different from S[i-1], then the maximum length is dp[i-1]+1. Because the previous maximum was a substring ending at i-1, which can be extended by 1. But if S[i] is same as S[i-1], then the maximum length is 1 (only the current character can be a valid substring ending here).\n\nWait, let me rephrase the recurrence:\n\nIf S[i] != S[i-1], then dp[i] = dp[i-1] +1.\n\nElse, dp[i] =1.\n\nBecause, when the current character is same as previous, the only valid substring ending at i is the single character. Because any longer substring would include the previous character, leading to two same in a row.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake \"00\".\n\nAt position 2, since S[2] == S[1], dp[2] =1. The valid substrings ending at 2 are just the single '0'.\n\nAt position 1, dp[1] =1.\n\nTotal sum is 2, which is correct (each single character).\n\nAnother example: \"010\".\n\nAt position 3, since S[3] != S[2], dp[3] = dp[2]+1 = 2+1=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the recurrence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0 (assuming 1-based index). Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let's index from 1 to n.\n\nInitialize dp[1] =1.\n\nFor i from 2 to n:\n\nif S[i] != S[i-1], then dp[i] = dp[i-1]+1.\n\nelse, dp[i] =1.\n\nThe total is the sum of all dp[i].\n\nWait, let's test this with the third sample mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe third sample's input is probably \"011\".\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=3, S = \"011\".\n\ndp[1] =1.\n\ndp[2] = dp[1]+1 =2 (since '0' vs '1' are different).\n\ndp[3] =1 (since '1' == '1').\n\nTotal sum is 1+2+1 =4.\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\nAll single characters (3), the substring [1..2] (01, valid), and [2..3] (11 invalid). So total 3+1 =4. Which matches.\n\nAnother example from the problem's third note: the entire string \"011\" is not valid. The total is 4, which includes the first two characters (01) as a valid substring, but the entire string is not counted because it's invalid. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the dp array as described and sum all dp[i].\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the string S.\n\n- Initialize dp array (or just track previous dp value and accumulate the sum).\n\n- The sum is the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the code to be filled in. Looking at the given code:\n\nIn the Algo.Solve() method:\n\nThe current code is:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me see what that code does.\n\nThe code initializes c = n (sum of all 1's from the dp array if all were 1). Then, for each i from 1 to n-1 (assuming 0-based?), the code adds i if the current and previous characters are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code uses aa as a boolean array (from the OnesZeroes method, which converts '1's to true and '0's to false). So aa[i] is true if the character is '1', else false.\n\nThe code's current approach is:\n\nc starts as n (each single character is counted).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1 (assuming 0-based?), if the current and previous characters are different, then add i to c.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum of dp[i], but the recurrence is different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the code is 0-based. Let's see for the example \"010\" (n=3):\n\nThe code initializes c =3.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to 2 (since n-1 is 2):\n\ni=1 (second character):\n\nCheck if aa[1] != aa[0]. Let's say the string is \"010\", so aa[0] is false (0), aa[1] is true (1). So different. So add 1 to c. Now c is 4.\n\ni=2 (third character):\n\naa[2] is false (0), aa[1] is true \u2192 different. Add 2 \u2192 c becomes 6. Which matches the correct answer of 6.\n\nAnother example: \"001\" (n=3):\n\nc starts at 3.\n\ni=1: aa[1] == aa[0] (both 0 \u2192 false). So no addition.\n\ni=2: aa[2] is 1 (true), different from previous (false). So add 2 \u2192 c becomes 3+2=5. But the correct answer is 4. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is incorrect. So the user's code is wrong, and I need to fix it.\n\nThe correct approach is to compute the dp array and sum all dp[i].\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nInitialize sum =0.\n\nprev = 1 (since dp[0] is 1).\n\nsum += prev.\n\nThen for i from 1 to n-1 (assuming 0-based):\n\nif S[i] != S[i-1], then current_dp = prev +1.\n\nelse current_dp =1.\n\nsum += current_dp.\n\nprev = current_dp.\n\nWait, let's see for \"001\" (0-based):\n\nS[0] = '0', S[1]='0', S[2]='1'.\n\nInitialize sum =1 (dp[0] =1).\n\ni=1 (second character):\n\nS[1] == S[0], so current_dp =1. sum +=1 \u2192 sum is 2.\n\ni=2 (third character):\n\nS[2] != S[1], so current_dp =1+1=2. sum +=2 \u2192 total 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example \"010\" (0-based):\n\nsum starts at 1 (dp[0]=1).\n\ni=1 (S[1] is '1' vs '0' \u2192 different. current_dp =1+1=2 \u2192 sum +=2 \u2192 3.\n\ni=2 (S[2] is '0' vs '1' \u2192 different. current_dp =2+1=3 \u2192 sum +=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted to compute this.\n\nLooking at the given code:\n\nIn the Solve() method:\n\nThe current code is:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is using 0-based indices for aa (since it's a boolean array from the input). The loop runs from i=1 to n-1 (since i <n).\n\nThe initial c is n (sum of all 1's if all dp[i] were 1). Then, for each i where the current and previous are different, it adds i. But this doesn't align with the correct approach.\n\nThe correct approach requires tracking the previous dp value and accumulating the sum.\n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nlong sum = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nsum += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    sum += currentDp;\n\n}\n\nreturn sum;\n\nSo in the code, the current code's loop is incorrect. The user's code is adding i when the characters are different, but that's not the right approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct code should replace the existing loop with this logic.\n\nSo in the given code's Solve() method:\n\nReplace the current code:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nWith the correct code:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\nSo the initial c is 0, then add currentDp (1) first. Then loop from i=1 to n-1.\n\nWait, let's see for the first example where n=1:\n\nThe loop doesn't run. So c is initialized to 0, then currentDp is 1, so c +=1 \u2192 total 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case \"01\" (n=2):\n\nInitial c=0, currentDp=1 \u2192 c becomes 1.\n\nThen i=1 (second character):\n\naa[1] (1) vs aa[0] (0) \u2192 different. currentDp becomes 2. Add to c \u2192 1+2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be written as such.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the provided code is the loop and the initial setup.\n\nLooking at the code provided, the user's code in Solve() is:\n\nprivate void Solve()\n\n        {\n\n            int n = _r.I();\n\n            bool[] aa = _r.OnesZeroes(n);\n\n            long c = n;\n\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)\n\n            {\n\n                if (aa[i] != aa[i - 1])\n\n                    c += i;\n\n            }\n\n            _w.WriteLine(c);\n\n        }\n\nSo the correct code should replace the initial c =n and the loop with the correct approach.\n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\nSo replacing the existing code's c initialization and loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the replacement of the current loop and initial c.\n\nThe user's code currently has:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1])\n\n        c +=i;\n\n}\n\nThe correct code should be:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\nSo the user's code needs to be changed to this.\n\nTherefore, the missing code to fill in is the replacement of the existing code block with the above code.\n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user's code has the loop and initial c wrong, so the correct code is the above.\n\nSo the correct code for the Solve() method's body is:\n\nint n = _r.I();\n\nbool[] aa = _r.OnesZeroes(n);\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nint currentDp = 1;\n\nc += currentDp;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i-1]) {\n\n        currentDp +=1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        currentDp =1;\n\n    }\n\n    c += currentDp;\n\n}\n\n_w.WriteLine(c);\n\nTherefore, the missing code is replacing the existing code block with this.\n\nThe user's code currently has:\n\nlong c = n;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (aa[i] != aa[i - 1])\n\n        c += i;\n\n}\n\nSo the correct code replaces that with the new code.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the code block replacing the existing code in the Solve() method."
