Wait, the code's variables might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the code step by step. The variables declared in solve are a bunch of ll's, like n, t, j initialized to INT_MAX, etc. Then:\n\ncin >> n >> t; // So t here is m, the number of friend pairs. Then aoc is an array of size n+1, initialized to 0. Then for each i from 1 to n, they read aoc[i], which is the a_i values. So aoc is the array of unhappiness values when not invited.",

Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each member is a node, and edges are the friend pairs. The number of edges in the selected subset must be even.

Then, when the number of edges is odd, they need to find a way to make it even. The way to do this is to either not invite one of the pair (so the edge is not counted), which would cost a_i or a_j.

Wait, but what if excluding that node is better than other options? Like, maybe there's a pair of nodes whose exclusion would also flip the parity but with a lower cost? Hmm, perhaps there's a better way. For example, excluding two nodes with even degrees would also change the parity? No, because each exclusion removes edges connected to them. Alternatively, the minimal cost is indeed the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the total edges m. \n\n2. If m is even, then the minimal is 0 (invite everyone). 3. Else, find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. The answer is that minimal a_i.

So the code should compute the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. Thus, the missing condition is whether the degree of the node is odd. The code's current variables include pum, which counts the number of friends each node has (the degree). So the condition is (pum[i] % 2 == 1). Thus, the missing code is:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i] % 2 == 1) j = min(j, aoc[i]);\n\nThen, the code outputs j. \n\nWait, but the code's current j is initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair. So when the number of edges is odd, the code computes the minimal between the minimal pair's a_i + a_j (which would remove that edge, thus flipping the parity) and the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree (which would also flip the parity). The minimal between these two options is the correct adjustment. Thus, the missing condition is whether the node has an odd degree. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nif(pum[i] % 2 == 1) Thus, the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i] % 2) j = min(j, aoc[i]);\n\nThen, the code outputs j. \n\nThis would handle the case when the number of edges is odd. In the second sample's note, if the friend pairs are between 1-2 and 1-3 (m=2 even), then the code would output 0. But the note's example has a minimal of 2. Wait, perhaps the second sample's friend pairs are different. Suppose the second test case has m=1 (odd). The friend pair is between 1 and 2. The degrees are 1 for nodes 1 and 2, 0 for node 3. The minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree is min(a_1, a_2). Suppose a_1 is 3 and a_2 is 5 (as per the note's example where inviting 2 and 3 gives a_1=3). Then the minimal a_i is 3. The minimal pair's a_i + a_j is a_1 + a_2 = 8. Thus, the minimal between 3 and 8 is 3. The code would output 3, but the note's example has a minimal of 2. Hmm, this suggests that the approach is still incorrect. Wait, in the note's second test case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The number of edges is 0 (even). The unhappiness is a_1 (3) because 1 is not invited. So the total is 3. But the note says the minimal is 2. Ah, perhaps the a array is different. In the note's example, the minimal is 2 when inviting 2 and 3. So the a_1 must be 3, a_2 is 0, a_3 is 0? No, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. If 2 and 3 are invited, then the not invited are 1. So the unhappiness is a_1.",

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a graph where each node has a cost of not being invited. We need to choose a subset S such that the number of edges in S is even, and the sum of a_i for not in S is minimized. This is an optimization problem with a parity constraint. The key idea is that the parity constraint can be handled by considering the connected components. Each connected component can be treated independently, except for the parity.",

Use dynamic programming to track the minimal total cost for each possible parity (0 or 1). 3. The answer is the minimal cost for parity 0. To compute the even and odd costs for a component:\n\nWe can model it as follows:\n\nThe component's nodes form a graph. We need to choose a subset S such that the number of edges in S has a certain parity. The minimal cost for even and odd can be computed using a recursive function or dynamic programming. For example, for a tree:\n\nWe can root the tree and track the current parity. At each node, we decide whether to include it or not, and track the number of edges modulo 2. The base case is when the subtree has no nodes, cost 0 and parity 0. This approach would work for small components but may be too slow for large ones. However, given the problem's constraints (sum of n and m up to 1e5), this approach may not be feasible. Perhaps there's a smarter way.",

Alternatively, the minimal adjustment is to find the minimal a_i among all nodes that are part of an odd number of edges in the current subset (when all are invited). Wait, when all are invited, the number of edges is m. So if m is even, then that's the best. If m is odd, then we need to make it even. To do that, we can exclude one node that is in an odd number of edges. The cost would be a_i (since we're not inviting them anymore). The number of edges would decrease by the number of edges connected to that node. If that number is odd, then the total edges becomes even. So the minimal cost in this case would be the minimal a_i",

Wait, let me re-examine the second test case's note. The second test case's note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 2); etc. The minimal is 2.\" So the minimal unhappiness is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The number of cakes is 0, which is even. Suppose the friend pairs are such that 1 and 2 are friends, and 2 and 3 are not friends. Then, inviting 2 and 3 would have 0 cakes (since they are not friends). The total edges when inviting everyone would depend on the friend pairs. Wait, perhaps the second test case has m=1 (so odd). Then according to my previous logic, the answer would be the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree.",

In the note's example, the unhappiness when inviting 2 and 3 is a_1 (since 1 is not invited). The a_1 must be 3 (since the unhappiness is 3 when inviting 1 and 2, but that's not the case here). Wait, the note says that when inviting 2 and 3, the unhappiness is 2. So the a_1 is not part of that. The a_i's for not invited are a_1 (since 1 is not invited). So the unhappiness is a_1. Wait, the example's unhappiness for inviting 2 and 3 is 2. So a_1 must be 2? Or perhaps the a array is different. This suggests that my previous approach is incorrect. Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. The problem requires that the number of cakes (edges in the invited subset) must be even. The minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited.",

My previous assumption that inviting everyone is optimal is wrong. So the problem is more complex. The correct approach must consider all possible subsets S, but with the parity constraint.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program to solve the problem. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value when inviting club members such that the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some variables and structures, but the solve function is incomplete. Let me read through the problem again to understand the approach needed.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Each member not invited adds a_i to the unhappiness.\n- The number of cakes (friend pairs both invited) must be even.\n- We need to minimize the total unhappiness under this constraint.\n\nThe approach probably involves considering whether the current number of cakes is even or odd and adjusting accordingly. Since the problem requires the total to be even, maybe we can model this with some kind of parity check.\n\nLooking at the existing code in the solve function:\n\nThey read n and t (probably m is t here?), then the aoc array (maybe a_i's). Then for each of the m friend pairs, they increment pum[k] and pum[o], which might be counting the number of friends each member has? Not sure. Then they compute j as the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o] for each pair. Wait, that might be trying to find the minimal cost of inviting a pair, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the code's variables might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the code step by step.\n\nThe variables declared in solve are a bunch of ll's, like n, t, j initialized to INT_MAX, etc. Then:\n\ncin >> n >> t; // So t here is m, the number of friend pairs.\n\nThen aoc is an array of size n+1, initialized to 0. Then for each i from 1 to n, they read aoc[i], which is the a_i values. So aoc is the array of unhappiness values when not invited. Wait, actually, the problem says that if a member is not invited, the unhappiness increases by a_i. So the total unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited members. So the goal is to choose a subset of members to invite such that the number of friend pairs in the subset is even, and the sum of a_i for non-invited is minimized.\n\nHmm, so the problem is to select a subset S of members, such that the number of friend pairs (u, v) where both u and v are in S is even. We need to minimize the sum of a_i for all i not in S.\n\nThe code's current approach seems to be trying to find some minimal value. Let's see:\n\nIn the loop over the friend pairs (k and o), they do pum[k]++ and pum[o]++. So pum might be counting the number of friends each member has? Or maybe the number of edges each is part of? Not sure. Then j is being set to the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o] for each pair. Wait, that's the sum of the two a_i's of the pair. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal cost of inviting a pair? Or perhaps it's trying to find the minimal cost of not inviting one of them? Not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nThe problem requires that the number of cakes (friend pairs both invited) is even. So the parity of that count must be even. The minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited, so we want to invite as many as possible (since a_i could be zero, but not necessarily). Wait, actually, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize that, we want to invite as many as possible (since if a_i is small, it's better to invite them, but if a_i is large, better not). But the constraint complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a problem that can be modeled using graph components. Since friends are pairs, the invited members form a subset where the edges (friend pairs) between them must have an even count. \n\nWait, the key idea here might be that the parity of the number of edges in the induced subgraph must be even. To handle this, perhaps each connected component in the friend graph contributes to the parity. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each member is a node, and edges are the friend pairs. The number of edges in the selected subset must be even. To achieve this, perhaps we can model the problem with some parity constraints on each connected component.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of connected components. Suppose the friends form a graph. Each connected component can be considered independently, except for the parity. Wait, but the total number of edges must be even. So the sum over all components of the number of edges in each component's selected subset must be even. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal unhappiness can be found by considering each connected component and choosing whether to flip the parity of that component's edge count, but ensuring the total is even. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nEach connected component can be considered as a separate unit. For each component, we can compute the minimal cost for both parities (even or odd number of edges in that component). Then, the total must have an even parity, so we can choose the combination of parities across components such that their sum is even, and the total cost is minimized.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node's decision (invite or not) affects the edges. The key is that the total number of edges (friend pairs both invited) must be even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited. To minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible (since not inviting someone adds a_i, so if a_i is small, better to invite). But the constraint complicates this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node has a cost of not being invited (a_i), and edges between friends. The edges contribute to the parity. The problem is to choose a subset S of nodes (invited) such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for nodes not in S is minimized.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming on connected components. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the graph is divided into connected components. For each component, we can compute two values: the minimal cost when the number of edges in the component's subset is even, and when it's odd. Then, the total must have an even parity, so we can combine the components' options such that the sum of their parities is even, and choose the minimal total cost.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the approach would be:\n\n1. For each connected component in the friend graph, compute the minimal cost for both parities (even or odd number of edges in the component's subset).\n\n2. Then, the overall problem is to choose for each component whether to take even or odd parity, such that the total is even, and the sum of their costs is minimized.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal cost for each component's parity?\n\nWait, but how do the parities of each component's edges contribute to the total? The total is the sum of edges in all components. So the total parity is the sum modulo 2 of each component's edge count parity. So, to have the total even, the sum of the parities (mod 2) must be 0.\n\nTherefore, for each component, we can track the minimal cost for each possible parity (even or odd). Then, the problem reduces to selecting for each component a parity (even or odd) such that the total is even, and the sum of their costs is minimized.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Split the graph into connected components.\n\n- For each component, compute the minimal cost for even and odd parity.\n\n- Then, combine these options to get the minimal total cost with even total parity.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute for each component the minimal cost for even and odd parity.\n\nHmm, how to model the cost for a component's parity?\n\nLet me think of each component as a graph. The cost is the sum of a_i for nodes not invited. The edges in the subset (those where both ends are invited) contribute to the parity. We need to choose a subset S of nodes in the component such that the number of edges within S is even (or odd, depending on the desired parity for the component), and the cost is minimized.\n\nWait, but for each component, we need to compute two values: the minimal cost when the edges in the component's subset have even count, and when they have odd count.\n\nSo for each component, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem on the component's nodes, tracking the current parity and the minimal cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be represented as a tree (if it's a tree) or a more complex graph, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be considered as a bipartition problem. Wait, maybe the minimal cost can be found by considering whether the component's parity can be adjusted by flipping certain nodes.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nSuppose that for each connected component, the minimal cost for even parity is either the minimal cost without considering parity, or the minimal cost plus some adjustment. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost for even parity is the minimal possible, and the odd parity is either that plus some value or something else. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: For each connected component, the minimal cost when the number of edges is even is the minimal possible, and the minimal cost when it's odd is that plus some delta. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the parity can be adjusted by excluding a single node. For example, if a component has an odd number of edges when choosing a certain subset, then by excluding one node, you can flip the parity. But this depends on the structure of the component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be treated as a graph where the minimal cost for even and odd can be found by considering all possible subsets, but that's computationally impossible for large n.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the minimal total unhappiness is achieved by inviting all possible members except for some minimal set, but with the parity constraint.\n\nWait, let's think of the problem differently. The total number of cakes (edges in the subset) must be even. So, if the current number of edges is even, that's okay. If it's odd, we need to flip it to even. To flip the parity, we can either add or remove an edge. But how?\n\nAlternatively, flipping the parity can be done by changing the inclusion of a single node. For example, if there's a node that is part of an odd number of edges in the current subset, then removing it would change the parity. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the code given. Let me look back at the code provided.\n\nIn the code, after reading the a_i's and the friend pairs, they loop through each pair and compute j as the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o]. Wait, that's the sum of the two a_i's of the pair. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost of not inviting both members of a pair. Because if you don't invite either, then the unhappiness increases by a_k + a_o. But that might not be directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find the minimal cost of inviting both, but that's not clear. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\n\nWait, the code's current logic is:\n\nAfter reading all the friend pairs, it's looping through each pair and adding to pum[k] and pum[o], which counts the number of friends each has. Then j is set to the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o] over all pairs. Then, if the number of friend pairs (t) is odd, then it loops through all nodes and if some condition is met, it takes the min between j and aoc[i]. Then output j, else 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think of the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample input, all members can be invited. So the unhappiness is 0. The code would have t (number of pairs) even? Let's see. Suppose in the first test case, there are m pairs. If m is even, then the code outputs 0, which matches the sample. But if m is odd, then it would do something else. But the sample's first case probably has an even number of pairs, so it outputs 0.\n\nThe second sample's note says that in one case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which are friends. So the number of cakes is 1 (if they are friends). Wait, but in the note, the example given has 0 cakes eaten. Wait, the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, but the number of cakes eaten is 0? Wait, maybe I misread the note.\n\nWait the second test case's note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 2).\"\n\nWait, that implies that 2 and 3 are not friends? Because if they were friends, then the number of cakes would be 1. So perhaps in that test case, the friend pairs are different. So the code's approach must be incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's current approach is not correct, and I need to figure out the correct approach.\n\nLet me think again of the problem.\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited. To minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible, but with the constraint that the number of edges (friend pairs both invited) is even.\n\nThe key is that the number of edges must be even. So, if the current number of edges in the invited set is odd, we need to adjust it to even. The adjustment can be done by either adding or removing an edge. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be found by considering two cases:\n\n1. The total number of edges is even. Then, that's acceptable.\n\n2. The total is odd. Then, we need to flip the parity by changing the inclusion of some nodes such that the total edges become even, and the cost is minimized.\n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimum between the case where the edges are even, and the case where we have to flip the parity by making some change.\n\nWait, but how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness without considering the parity constraint is the sum of a_i for all not invited. But we have to ensure that the number of edges is even. So, the minimal possible is either the minimal without parity, or the minimal plus some adjustment if the parity is wrong.\n\nWait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible is the minimal between two scenarios:\n\n- The minimal total unhappiness where the number of edges is even.\n\n- The minimal total where it's odd, plus the minimal cost to flip the parity.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the minimal between two options:\n\n1. The minimal possible when the number of edges is even.\n\n2. The minimal possible when the number of edges is odd, plus the minimal cost to flip the parity (by changing the inclusion of a single node or pair).\n\nWait, but flipping the parity can be done by changing the inclusion of a node that is part of an odd number of edges. For example, if you have a node that is in an odd number of edges in the current subset, then removing it would change the parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find a node whose exclusion would flip the parity, and choose the minimal a_i among such nodes. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nThe minimal total unhappiness without considering the parity is S. Let E be the number of edges in the invited set. If E is even, then S is acceptable. If E is odd, then we need to find a way to make it even. To do this, we can either:\n\n- Remove one node that is part of an odd number of edges in the current set. This would change the parity.\n\n- Or add a node that is part of an odd number of edges (but adding a node might introduce new edges, so this is more complex).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find the minimal a_i among all nodes that are in an odd number of edges in the current set. Because by excluding that node, you can flip the parity. \n\nWait, but how do we know which nodes are in an odd number of edges?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nThe minimal possible unhappiness is the minimal between the total when the edges are even, and the total when edges are odd plus the minimal a_i of some node that can flip the parity.\n\nWait, but this is vague. Let me think of the problem in terms of the graph components.\n\nSuppose the graph is divided into connected components. For each component, the parity of the edges in that component contributes to the total. To have the total even, the sum of the parities of all components must be even.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each component whether to have even or odd parity, such that the total is even, and the sum of their costs is minimized.\n\nNow, for each component, we can compute the minimal cost for even and odd parity. Then, the overall solution is the minimum over all possible combinations where the sum of parities is even.\n\nThe key is to compute for each component the minimal cost for even and odd.\n\nNow, how to compute for a component the minimal cost for even and odd?\n\nLet me think of a component as a connected graph. The cost is the sum of a_i for nodes not invited. The edges in the subset (invited nodes) must have a certain parity.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost for a component can be found by considering all possible subsets, but that's not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost for even and odd can be found by considering the component as a tree and using dynamic programming.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints and the code's variables:\n\nThe code's current approach is trying to find the minimal a_i + a_j for any pair (i,j) in the friend list. Then, if the number of friend pairs is odd, it adds the minimal a_i. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the code again:\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nAfter reading the aoc array, for each friend pair (k, o), they increment pum[k] and pum[o]. Then j is the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o] over all pairs. \n\nThen, if t (number of friend pairs) is odd, they loop through all nodes and if some condition is met, they take the min between j and aoc[i]. Then output j, else 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to handle the case when the number of edges is odd. The idea is that when the number of edges is odd, we need to make it even. To do this, we can either remove one edge (by not inviting one of the pair) or add an edge (by inviting another pair). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal adjustment is to either:\n\n- Not invite one member of a pair, which reduces the edge count by 1 (so flipping parity). The cost would be a_i (the unhappiness of not inviting that member) plus the previous total minus the a_i of the other member (since they were invited before). Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost when the total edges is odd is the minimal between the current total plus the minimal a_i (for some node that can flip the parity) or subtract some value.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is trying to handle the case when the number of edges is odd. The j variable is initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j for any pair. Then, when the number of edges is odd, they need to find a way to make it even. The way to do this is to either not invite one of the pair (so the edge is not counted), which would cost a_i or a_j. Or perhaps, the minimal a_i among all nodes?\n\nWait, the code's current approach for when t is odd is to loop through all nodes and if some condition is met, then take the min between j and aoc[i]. But what is the condition?\n\nThe code has a comment: /* TODO: Your code here */ in the for loop over i from 1 to n. The condition is missing. The code is trying to find the minimal between j (the minimal a_i + a_j for any pair) and aoc[i], but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal a_i among all nodes, and then the minimal between that and the minimal pair's a_i + a_j. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to handle the case where the number of edges is odd. To make it even, you can either:\n\n- Remove one edge by not inviting one of the pair. The cost would be the a_i of that node plus the a_j of the other (since they were both invited before, but now one is not). Wait, no. Suppose the pair was both invited, contributing to an edge. To remove that edge, you can exclude one of them. The cost would increase by a_i (if you exclude i) or a_j (if you exclude j). So the minimal cost to remove that edge is min(a_i, a_j). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes in any edge. Because by excluding that node, you can reduce the number of edges by the number of edges it was part of, which might flip the parity.\n\nWait, but the parity is the total number of edges. So, if you exclude a node that is part of an odd number of edges, then the total edges would decrease by that number, which is odd, so the parity flips. \n\nTherefore, to flip the parity, you can exclude any node that is part of an odd number of edges in the current subset. The minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among such nodes.\n\nBut how do we know which nodes are part of an odd number of edges in the current subset?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem requires that the minimal adjustment is the minimal a_i among all nodes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is the minimal a_i among all nodes, because by excluding that node, you can flip the parity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is trying to compute the minimal between the minimal pair's a_i + a_j (which would be the cost of not inviting both, thus removing all edges between them) and the minimal a_i (the cost of not inviting one node, which might flip the parity). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to handle the case when the number of edges is odd. In that case, to make it even, you can either:\n\n- Remove one edge by not inviting one of the pair (cost is a_i or a_j for one of them), or \n\n- Add another edge (but that would require inviting another pair, which might not be possible).\n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes. Because by not inviting that node, you remove all edges connected to it. If the node was part of an odd number of edges, then the total edges would decrease by an odd number, flipping the parity. \n\nTherefore, the minimal adjustment is the minimal a_i over all nodes. \n\nWait, but how do we know that there exists a node whose exclusion would flip the parity?\n\nHmm, perhaps in any graph with an odd number of edges, there must be at least one node with an odd degree. Because the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges, so if the number of edges is odd, the sum of degrees is even, but each degree contributes to the sum. Wait, the sum of degrees is 2E, so if E is odd, then the sum is even. The number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So there are at least two nodes with odd degrees. \n\nTherefore, there are nodes with odd degrees. So, excluding one of them would reduce the number of edges by an odd number (the degree of that node), thus flipping the parity. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree in the current subset. But how do we know which nodes have odd degree in the subset?\n\nWait, but the subset is the one that gives the minimal unhappiness. So this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is the minimal a_i among all nodes. Because even if the node has even degree, excluding it would reduce edges by an even number, which doesn't change the parity. So we need to choose a node with odd degree. \n\nBut how to find such a node?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of all a_i minus the sum of a_i for invited members. Wait, no. The unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. So to minimize it, we want to invite as many as possible (since not inviting adds a_i). \n\nThe optimal solution without the parity constraint is to invite all members, but then check if the number of edges is even. If it is, that's the answer. If not, then we need to find the minimal cost to adjust it to even.\n\nThe adjustment can be done by either:\n\n- Removing one edge (by not inviting one member of a pair), which costs the a_i of that member (since they were invited before, now not invited, so adding a_i to the unhappiness).\n\n- Or adding an edge (by inviting a pair that wasn't invited before), but that would require not inviting someone else, which might not be better.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal adjustment is to find the minimal a_i among all nodes that are part of an odd number of edges in the current subset (when all are invited). \n\nWait, when all are invited, the number of edges is m. So if m is even, then that's the best. If m is odd, then we need to make it even. To do that, we can exclude one node that is in an odd number of edges. The cost would be a_i (since we're not inviting them anymore). The number of edges would decrease by the number of edges connected to that node. If that number is odd, then the total edges becomes even.\n\nSo the minimal cost in this case would be the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree in the full graph (since when all are invited, their degree is their actual degree in the graph). \n\nWait, the degree of a node in the full graph is the number of friends it has. So the degree is the count of edges connected to it. \n\nSo, if the total edges m is odd, then the sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. So the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So there are at least two nodes with odd degrees. \n\nTherefore, the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree would be the minimal cost to exclude one of them, thus flipping the parity. \n\nTherefore, the total cost would be the sum of all a_i not invited (which is zero if all are invited except that one node) plus the a_i of the excluded node. \n\nWait, no. The initial case when all are invited has unhappiness zero (since all are invited, so no a_i added). But if we exclude a node, the unhappiness increases by a_i. So the total would be a_i. \n\nSo the minimal adjustment is the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nTherefore, the overall solution is:\n\nIf the number of edges (m) is even:\n\n- The minimal unhappiness is 0 (invite everyone).\n\nElse:\n\n- The minimal unhappiness is the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, but what if excluding that node doesn't flip the parity? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the total edges when all are invited is m (odd). The node has degree d (odd). Excluding it removes d edges. So the new total edges is m - d. Since d is odd, m - d is even. So yes, the parity is flipped. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nBut what if there are multiple such nodes? We choose the one with the smallest a_i. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the sum of a_i for not invited members. The optimal is to invite everyone, but if m is odd, then we must exclude one node with odd degree, which has the smallest a_i. \n\nWait, but what if excluding that node is better than other options? Like, maybe there's a pair of nodes whose exclusion would also flip the parity but with a lower cost?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way. For example, excluding two nodes with even degrees would also change the parity? No, because each exclusion removes edges connected to them. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is indeed the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the total edges m. \n\n2. If m is even, then the minimal is 0 (invite everyone).\n\n3. Else, find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. The answer is that minimal a_i. \n\nWait, but what if there are no nodes with odd degree? That can't happen because m is odd. The sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. So the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So there are at least two. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute the degrees of each node, then if m is even, output 0. Else, find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, but the problem's first sample's note says that when all are invited, the unhappiness is zero. So that's correct. \n\nThe second sample's note: in the second test case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which are friends. So the number of edges is 1 (if they are friends). Wait, but in the note's example, the number of cakes is 0. So perhaps they are not friends. \n\nWait, the note says in the second test case, inviting 2 and 3 gives 0 cakes. So they are not friends. So the friend pairs must be different. \n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is not correct. Because according to the above logic, when m is even, output 0. But in the second test case, if m is even, then the answer would be 0, but the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nWait, this suggests that my logic is wrong. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the second test case's note. \n\nThe second test case's note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 2); etc. The minimal is 2.\"\n\nSo the minimal unhappiness is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The number of cakes is 0, which is even. \n\nSuppose the friend pairs are such that 1 and 2 are friends, and 2 and 3 are not friends. Then, inviting 2 and 3 would have 0 cakes (since they are not friends). \n\nThe total edges when inviting everyone would depend on the friend pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the second test case has m=1 (so odd). Then according to my previous logic, the answer would be the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nSuppose the friend pair is between 1 and 2. Then the degrees are:\n\nnode 1: degree 1 (odd)\n\nnode 2: degree 1 (odd)\n\nnodes 3: degree 0 (even)\n\nSo the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree is min(a_1, a_2). \n\nIn the note's example, the unhappiness when inviting 2 and 3 is a_1 (since 1 is not invited). The a_1 must be 3 (since the unhappiness is 3 when inviting 1 and 2, but that's not the case here). \n\nWait, the note says that when inviting 2 and 3, the unhappiness is 2. So the a_1 is not part of that. The a_i's for not invited are a_1 (since 1 is not invited). So the unhappiness is a_1. \n\nWait, the example's unhappiness for inviting 2 and 3 is 2. So a_1 must be 2? Or perhaps the a array is different. \n\nThis suggests that my previous approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that the number of cakes (edges in the invited subset) must be even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited. \n\nThe optimal solution is to choose a subset S of members to invite such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for not in S is minimized. \n\nThe key is to find such a subset S with minimal cost. \n\nThe approach of inviting everyone and then adjusting if needed may not work because sometimes excluding a single node may not be the best option. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model this as a graph and find for each connected component the minimal cost for even and odd parity, then combine them. \n\nLet me try to think of each connected component as a tree. \n\nSuppose a connected component is a tree. To compute the minimal cost for even and odd parity:\n\nThe cost is the sum of a_i for not invited. \n\nThe edges in the subset S are those edges where both ends are in S. \n\nThe parity is the count of such edges mod 2. \n\nWe need to choose S such that the total edges in all components have even parity. \n\nFor each component, we can compute two values: the minimal cost when the component's edges are even, and when they are odd. \n\nThen, the overall solution is the minimum over all combinations where the sum of parities is even. \n\nThe question is how to compute these two values for each component. \n\nLet me think of a component as a connected graph. \n\nThe minimal cost for even parity is the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal cost when the component's edges are even.\n\n- The minimal cost when they are odd plus some adjustment. \n\nWait, perhaps for each component, we can compute the minimal cost for even and odd, and then combine them. \n\nTo compute for a component, perhaps we can use dynamic programming. \n\nLet me consider a component as a graph. \n\nWe can model the problem for the component as follows:\n\nWe need to choose a subset S of nodes in the component. Let E be the number of edges in S. We want to find the minimal cost (sum of a_i not in S) such that E mod 2 is either 0 or 1. \n\nWe can represent this with a DP where for each node, we track whether including it or not affects the parity. \n\nAlternatively, for a connected component, the minimal cost for even and odd can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal cost for even is the minimal between the minimal cost without considering parity and the minimal cost plus some adjustment. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost for even and odd can be computed by considering whether to include or exclude a particular node. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nAnother idea: the problem can be viewed as a graph where each node has a cost of not being invited (a_i). The edges impose a parity constraint on the number of edges in the subset. \n\nThe minimal cost is the sum of a_i for not invited nodes, with the constraint that the number of edges in the subset is even. \n\nThis is similar to a problem where you have to choose a subset with certain parity constraints on edges. \n\nPerhaps the solution involves finding a subset S where the number of edges is even, and the cost is minimized. \n\nThe minimal cost is the minimal between the global minimum (without parity) and the global minimum plus the minimal adjustment to flip the parity. \n\nThe adjustment would be the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe global minimum without parity is achieved by inviting all members (if possible). \n\nWait, but inviting all members may not be the minimal cost. For example, if some a_i are very large, it's better not to invite them. \n\nAh, right! My previous assumption that inviting everyone is optimal is wrong. \n\nSo the problem is more complex. \n\nThe correct approach must consider all possible subsets S, but with the parity constraint. \n\nThis seems computationally heavy, but perhaps there's a way to model it with the connected components. \n\nLet me think of each connected component as a separate entity. \n\nFor each component, we can compute two values: the minimal cost when the number of edges in the component's subset is even (even_cost) and when it's odd (odd_cost). \n\nThen, the total cost is the sum of the chosen costs for each component, such that the total number of edges is even. \n\nThe minimal total cost is the minimum between even_total and odd_total adjusted to be even. \n\nTo compute even_cost and odd_cost for a component:\n\nWe can model this with dynamic programming. \n\nLet me consider a component as a tree (since it's connected). \n\nWe can root the tree and perform a post-order traversal. \n\nAt each node, we track the current parity and the minimal cost. \n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can decide whether to include it or not, and track the number of edges in the subset. \n\nThis might be feasible for small components but not for large ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost for even and odd can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal cost for even is the minimal between the minimal cost when the component has even edges and the minimal cost when it has odd edges plus the minimal a_i of a node in the component. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for each component, the difference between even and odd cost is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look back at the code provided and see what it's trying to do. \n\nThe code's current approach:\n\n- For each friend pair, it increments pum[k] and pum[o], which counts the number of friends each has. \n\n- Then, j is the minimum of aoc[k] + aoc[o] for all pairs. \n\n- If the number of friend pairs (t) is odd, then it loops through all nodes and if some condition is met, it takes the min between j and aoc[i]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal cost when the number of edges is odd. \n\nThe j variable is the minimal a_i + a_j for any pair. This could represent the cost of not inviting both members of a pair, thus removing that edge. \n\nThen, when the total edges is odd, the code is trying to find the minimal between that j (which would reduce the edge count by 1, making it even) and the minimal a_i (which could be excluding a single node to flip the parity). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal between two options:\n\n1. Remove one edge by not inviting both members of a pair (cost a_i + a_j for that pair). \n\n2. Remove one node (cost a_i) which may flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal between these options would be the minimal adjustment needed. \n\nSo the code's approach is:\n\nIf the number of edges (t) is even, then the minimal is 0 (invite everyone, but only if that gives even edges). Wait, but that's not necessarily true. \n\nWait, the code's current logic is:\n\nif(t%2) { ... } else { cout << 0; }\n\nBut that can't be right. For example, if there are no edges (m=0), then the number of edges is even (0), so output 0. Which is correct because you can invite everyone, and the number of edges is 0 (even). \n\nBut what if there are edges but the minimal unhappiness is not zero? Like if some a_i are large. \n\nAh, right! The code's current approach is wrong because it assumes that when the number of edges is even, the minimal is zero. But that's only true if inviting everyone is allowed. \n\nThe code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach must consider the a_i's. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a graph where each node has a cost of not being invited. We need to choose a subset S such that the number of edges in S is even, and the sum of a_i for not in S is minimized. \n\nThis is an optimization problem with a parity constraint. \n\nThe key idea is that the parity constraint can be handled by considering the connected components. \n\nEach connected component can be treated independently, except for the parity. \n\nFor each component, we can compute two values: the minimal cost when the number of edges in the component is even, and when it's odd. \n\nThen, the total cost is the sum of the chosen values for each component, such that the total number of edges is even. \n\nThe minimal total cost is the minimum between the even and odd combinations. \n\nTo compute the even and odd costs for a component:\n\nWe can model this with dynamic programming. \n\nLet me think of the component as a graph. \n\nThe minimal cost for even and odd can be computed using a recursive approach. \n\nFor example, for a tree, we can root it and track the parity. \n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can decide whether to include it or not, and track the number of edges modulo 2. \n\nThis might be feasible for small components but not for large ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost for even and odd can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal cost for even is the minimal between the minimal cost without considering parity and the minimal cost plus the minimal a_i of a node in the component. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost for even is the minimal cost when the component has even edges, which can be obtained by either:\n\n- Choosing a subset with even edges, or \n\n- Choosing a subset with odd edges and then flipping the parity by excluding a node. \n\nThe minimal between these options. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the problem's constraints. \n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the subset is even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. \n\nTo minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible, but with the parity constraint. \n\nThe optimal solution is to invite all members except for a minimal set of nodes such that the number of edges in the subset is even. \n\nThe minimal set can be either:\n\n- A single node whose exclusion flips the parity. \n\n- Or a pair of nodes whose exclusion also flips the parity. \n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal between these options. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal a_i of a node with odd degree in the current subset (when all are invited). \n\n- The minimal a_i + a_j of a pair of nodes whose exclusion flips the parity. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal adjustment is the minimal between the minimal a_i (for a node with odd degree) and the minimal a_i + a_j (for a pair of nodes whose exclusion flips the parity). \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the following:\n\nThe minimal possible unhappiness is the minimal between two cases:\n\n1. The minimal unhappiness when the number of edges is even. \n\n2. The minimal unhappiness when the number of edges is odd plus the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe first case is the minimal possible when the edges are even. \n\nThe second case is the minimal possible when edges are odd, plus the minimal cost to flip to even. \n\nThe overall answer is the minimum of these two. \n\nTo compute the first case, we can try to find the minimal unhappiness with even edges. \n\nTo compute the second case, we can find the minimal unhappiness with odd edges, then add the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nBut how to compute these? \n\nThis seems too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal unhappiness is the minimal between the following two options:\n\n- The minimal possible unhappiness without any parity constraint, but with the number of edges even. \n\n- The minimal possible unhappiness without any parity constraint, but with the number of edges odd, plus the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal between these two would be the answer. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i of a node with odd degree in the current subset (when the subset is the one that gives the minimal unhappiness for odd edges). \n\nBut this is still not clear. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal unhappiness is the minimal between the following two options:\n\n1. The minimal possible unhappiness when the number of edges is even. \n\n2. The minimal possible unhappiness when the number of edges is odd plus the minimal a_i of any node. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal adjustment to flip the parity is to exclude a single node. The cost is a_i. \n\nThe minimal such a_i is the minimal a_i over all nodes. \n\nTherefore, the overall answer is the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal unhappiness with even edges. \n\n- The minimal unhappiness with odd edges plus the minimal a_i. \n\nBut how to compute the minimal unhappiness with even or odd edges? \n\nThis is still not clear. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the minimal unhappiness is the minimal between the following two values:\n\n- The minimal possible unhappiness when the number of edges is even. \n\n- The minimal possible unhappiness when the number of edges is odd plus the minimal a_i of any node. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct approach based on the problem's sample and the code's structure. \n\nThe code's current approach is:\n\n- For each friend pair, compute the minimal a_i + a_j (j is initialized to INT_MAX and updated with min). \n\n- If the number of friend pairs is odd, then find the minimal a_i and take the minimal between that and the previous j. \n\n- Output j if odd, else 0. \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nIn the second sample's note, the minimal is 2. \n\nSuppose the friend pairs are between 1-2 and 1-3. Then m is 2 (even), so the code would output 0. But the note's example has a minimal of 2. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimal unhappiness as follows:\n\nThe minimal possible is the sum of a_i for all not invited members, with the number of edges even. \n\nTo find this, we can model it as a graph and find the minimal cost with the parity constraint. \n\nThe key is to realize that the parity constraint can be handled by considering the connected components. \n\nEach connected component contributes to the parity. \n\nThe minimal cost for each component is the minimal between even and odd, and the total must have even parity. \n\nThe minimal cost for a component can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each component, compute the minimal cost for even and odd. \n\nThe minimal cost for even is the minimal between the cost when the component has even edges and the cost when it has odd edges plus the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the minimal even cost is the minimal between the even cost and the odd cost plus the minimal a_i. \n\nThis way, we can flip the parity of the component by excluding a node with minimal a_i. \n\nThus, for each component, the even cost is min(even_cost, odd_cost + min_a_in_component). \n\nSimilarly, the odd cost is min(odd_cost, even_cost + min_a_in_component). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for each component, the minimal even cost is the minimal between the even cost and the odd cost plus the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nThis way, if the component's odd cost is better, we can flip its parity by excluding a node with minimal a_i, thus adding its a_i to the cost. \n\nThis would allow us to choose the best between even and odd for each component. \n\nThe overall solution would then be to choose for each component whether to take even or odd, such that the total parity is even, and the sum is minimized. \n\nThis requires dynamic programming over the components' parities. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. For each connected component, compute the minimal even and odd costs. \n\n2. Use dynamic programming to track the minimal total cost for each possible parity (0 or 1). \n\n3. The answer is the minimal cost for parity 0. \n\nTo compute the even and odd costs for a component:\n\nWe can model it as follows:\n\nThe component's nodes form a graph. We need to choose a subset S such that the number of edges in S has a certain parity. \n\nThe minimal cost for even and odd can be computed using a recursive function or dynamic programming. \n\nFor example, for a tree:\n\nWe can root the tree and track the current parity. \n\nAt each node, we decide whether to include it or not, and track the number of edges modulo 2. \n\nThe base case is when the subtree has no nodes, cost 0 and parity 0. \n\nThis approach would work for small components but may be too slow for large ones. \n\nHowever, given the problem's constraints (sum of n and m up to 1e5), this approach may not be feasible. \n\nPerhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nAnother idea: the minimal cost for even and odd can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal cost for even is the minimal between the minimal cost without any parity constraint and the minimal cost plus the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nSimilarly for odd. \n\nThis way, the parity can be flipped by excluding a node with minimal a_i. \n\nThus, for each component:\n\neven_cost = min( (cost when edges are even), (cost when edges are odd) + min_a )\n\nodd_cost = min( (cost when edges are odd), (cost when edges are even) + min_a )\n\nBut how to compute the initial cost when edges are even or odd? \n\nThis is still unclear. \n\nPerhaps the minimal cost for even is the minimal possible cost for the component, and the minimal cost for odd is that plus the minimal a_i. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to provide the missing code, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal adjustment when the number of edges is odd is the minimal a_i among all nodes. \n\nThus, the code should compute the minimal a_i among all nodes, and when the number of edges is odd, the answer is the minimal between the minimal a_i and the minimal pair's a_i + a_j. \n\nWait, the code's current approach has j initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j for any pair. \n\nThen, when the number of edges is odd, it loops through all nodes and if some condition is met (like the node has odd degree?), it takes the min between j and aoc[i]. \n\nThe missing condition is probably whether the node has an odd degree. \n\nThus, the code should loop through all nodes and if the degree of the node is odd, then consider aoc[i] as a candidate for the minimal adjustment. \n\nThe minimal adjustment is the minimal between the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree and the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair (which would remove that edge, thus flipping the parity). \n\nWait, but the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree is sufficient. \n\nSo the code should compute the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThus, the missing condition is whether the degree of the node is odd. \n\nThe code's current variables include pum, which counts the number of friends each node has (the degree). \n\nSo the condition is (pum[i] % 2 == 1). \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i] % 2 == 1) j = min(j, aoc[i]);\n\nThen, the code outputs j. \n\nWait, but the code's current j is initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair. \n\nSo when the number of edges is odd, the code computes the minimal between the minimal pair's a_i + a_j (which would remove that edge, thus flipping the parity) and the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree (which would also flip the parity). \n\nThe minimal between these two options is the correct adjustment. \n\nThus, the missing condition is whether the node has an odd degree. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif(pum[i] % 2 == 1)\n\nThus, the loop would be:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i] % 2) j = min(j, aoc[i]);\n\nThen, the code outputs j. \n\nThis would handle the case when the number of edges is odd. \n\nIn the second sample's note, if the friend pairs are between 1-2 and 1-3 (m=2 even), then the code would output 0. But the note's example has a minimal of 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the second sample's friend pairs are different. \n\nSuppose the second test case has m=1 (odd). \n\nThe friend pair is between 1 and 2. \n\nThe degrees are 1 for nodes 1 and 2, 0 for node 3. \n\nThe minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree is min(a_1, a_2). \n\nSuppose a_1 is 3 and a_2 is 5 (as per the note's example where inviting 2 and 3 gives a_1=3). \n\nThen the minimal a_i is 3. \n\nThe minimal pair's a_i + a_j is a_1 + a_2 = 8. \n\nThus, the minimal between 3 and 8 is 3. \n\nThe code would output 3, but the note's example has a minimal of 2. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the approach is still incorrect. \n\nWait, in the note's second test case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. \n\nThe number of edges is 0 (even). \n\nThe unhappiness is a_1 (3) because 1 is not invited. \n\nSo the total is 3. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nAh, perhaps the a array is different. \n\nIn the note's example, the minimal is 2 when inviting 2 and 3. \n\nSo the a_1 must be 3, a_2 is 0, a_3 is 0? \n\nNo, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. \n\nIf 2 and 3 are invited, then the not invited are 1. \n\nSo the unhappiness is a_1. \n\nThe note says it's 2, so a_1 must be 2. \n\nThen the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree (nodes 1 and 2) would be min(2, a_2). \n\nIf a_2 is 5, then the minimal is 2. \n\nThus, the code would output 2, which matches the note. \n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is to loop through all nodes with odd degree and take the minimal a_i. \n\nThe code's current j is initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair. \n\nThen, when the number of edges is odd, the code loops through all nodes with odd degree and takes the minimal between j and aoc[i]. \n\nThus, the missing condition is (pum[i] % 2 == 1). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif(pum[i] % 2)\n\nThus, the line should be:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i]%2) j=min(j, aoc[i]);\n\nSo the complete code for the solve function would have that loop. \n\nThe code's current j is initialized to the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair. \n\nBut when the number of edges is odd, the minimal adjustment is the minimal between that j and the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, no. The code's j is initially set to the minimal a_i + a_j of any pair. \n\nThen, in the loop over nodes with odd degree, it takes the min between j and aoc[i]. \n\nThus, the final j will be the minimal between the minimal pair's a_i + a_j and the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree. \n\nThis is correct because both options are valid ways to flip the parity. \n\nThe minimal between them is the best option. \n\nThus, the missing code is indeed checking whether the node has an odd degree. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is:\n\nif(pum[i]%2)\n\nSo the line is:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=n; i++) if(pum[i]%2) j=min(j, aoc[i]);"
