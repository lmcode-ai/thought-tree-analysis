So according to the example, this is possible. But according to my previous logic, this would be invalid because of the two B's. So my previous logic is wrong. Hmm. This means that the first condition (no two same consecutive non-W) is not required. So I need to think differently. Alternative Idea: Perhaps the key is that any two consecutive non-W cells must be part of a stamp. Wait, but how? Alternatively, the problem allows overlapping stamps, so two consecutive non-W cells can be part of different stamps. Wait, in the first example's final string, the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nHow did that happen?",

Wait, but the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait position3 is R? Or B? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's steps. The problem's example says the third step is stamping at 1-2 as RB.",

The case of a single R would split into a segment \"R\", which has set size 1 \u2192 output NO. The case of \"RR\" would have a segment \"RR\" \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 output NO. The case of \"RBRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. The case of \"BRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. The case of \"B\" \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 NO. This seems to align with the problem's examples.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B. The stamp can be applied multiple times, and each time it can be either RB or BR. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key here is to figure out the conditions that the string must satisfy for it to be possible. Let me think about the constraints.\n\nFirst, since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, any non-white cell must be part of such a pair. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, maybe the main thing is that the non-white parts must follow some pattern.\n\nWait, but each stamp changes two cells. So every time you stamp, you're setting two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. But since you can stamp over the same area multiple times, maybe the order matters, but perhaps the final configuration must satisfy some properties.\n\nLet me think of the possible patterns. Let's consider the non-W parts. Because each stamp affects two cells, any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Wait, but maybe not exactly, because overlapping stamps can interfere. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence of non-W characters must alternate in some way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that between any two non-W characters, there can't be a single W. Because if there's a single W between two non-Ws, maybe that's a problem. Or maybe the non-W parts must form pairs?\n\nWait, let's look at the examples given. The first example's final string is BRB BW (the example given in the problem). Let's see: the example's final string is B R B B W. Wait, how did that happen? The steps were:\n\nStart with WWWW W. Then stamp at positions 4-5 (assuming 1-based?), making RB there. Then stamp at 0-1 (positions 0 and 1?), making BR. Then stamp at 1-2, making RB again. So the final string is B R B B W. \n\nLooking at that, the non-W parts are B R B B. Let's see the pairs here. The first two are BR (from the first stamp?), but then the next two are RB? Or maybe overlapping.\n\nHmm, perhaps the main idea is that any two consecutive non-W characters must be either R and B or B and R. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B in some order. But if there are three in a row, like RBR, that's okay because each adjacent pair is valid. But if there's a pair like RR, then that's impossible. Because each pair of non-W must be RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W must be different. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me think again. Suppose in the target string, there are two adjacent non-W characters that are the same. Then that's impossible. Because every time you stamp, you can only create a pair of R and B. So any two adjacent non-W must alternate between R and B. So for example, if there's an RR in the string, that's impossible. Similarly BB would also be impossible. \n\nWait, but what about overlapping stamps? Suppose you stamp a pair as RB, then stamp the next pair as BR. Then the middle cell would be B from the first stamp and R from the second? Wait no, each stamp changes both cells. So if you first stamp positions 0-1 as RB, then stamp positions 1-2 as BR, then the cells would be:\n\nFirst stamp: 0 is R, 1 is B.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2: 1 becomes R, 2 becomes B. So the sequence would be R (from first stamp's 0), then R (from second stamp's 1), then B (from second's 2). So the middle two are R and R? Wait that's possible? Wait no, because the second stamp changes the 1st cell again. So the first cell (0) is R, the second (1) was B, then after the second stamp, it becomes R again. So the two adjacent cells (positions 0 and 1) would be R and R. Which would be invalid. But according to the problem's example, maybe that's allowed?\n\nWait, but according to the problem's example, the fifth test case is W W W \u2192 W R B \u2192 then B R B. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the stamping process. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each time it's applied, the two cells under it are set to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous state. So overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors. \n\nSo in the example I just thought of, after two overlapping stamps, you can have two Rs next to each other. But according to the problem's constraints, is that allowed?\n\nWait the problem says that the final string can have any combination, but the question is whether it can be formed via the stamps. So if the final string has two Rs next to each other, then that would require that those two cells were set by some combination of stamps. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose the desired final string is \"RR\". How can that be achieved?\n\nEach stamp must be either RB or BR. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first stamp is BR (so first cell B, second R). Then, stamp again on the same two cells as RB. The first becomes R, second B. So that's back to original. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe stamping in some other way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible. Because each time you stamp on those two cells, you have to set them to either RB or BR. So to get RR, you need both to be R. But each stamp on those two cells would set one to R and the other to B. So it's impossible. So any occurrence of two same non-W characters adjacent would be impossible. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is that in the target string, there are no two consecutive non-W characters that are the same. \n\nWait, but what about a single non-W character? Like if the string is \"R\", then n=1. Since the stamp requires two cells, you can't stamp at all. So the only possible string for n=1 is all W. So if the input is \"R\" for n=1, it's impossible. \n\nSo the conditions would be:\n\n1. All instances of non-W characters must form sequences where consecutive characters alternate between R and B. So no two same in a row.\n\n2. Additionally, any non-W must be part of at least one stamp. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, perhaps the main constraints are the first one and also that any non-W must be in a pair? Wait, no. Because a single non-W can't exist. Because each stamp affects two cells. So any non-W must be part of at least one stamp's application. But if there's a single non-W, like in a string of length 3: \"WRW\", then the R is in the middle. To get that R, you must have stamped either positions 1-2 (so the R would be part of a pair with the next cell, but that's W. Wait, but the stamp would set both cells. So if you stamp positions 0-1 as RB, then the first cell is R, second B. But then the third is W. So the middle cell (position 1) is B, so the R in the middle can't be achieved unless there's another stamp. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to check that all non-W runs (i.e., sequences of non-W characters) must have even length? Or not?\n\nWait, let's think of the example given in the problem's note. The fifth test case's desired string is \"BRB\". Let's see: the length is 3. The non-W run is length 3. But according to the example, it's possible. Wait, the example's fifth test case's steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 WRB (stamp at positions 1-2 as RB), then stamp at 0-1 as BR. So the first two become B and R, then the third is B. So the final string is BRB. The non-W run is 3 characters, which is odd. So that's allowed. So the length can be odd. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. So the first condition is that in any non-W run, the characters alternate between R and B. So for example, RBR is okay, but RRB is not. \n\nSo the first step is to split the string into segments separated by W's. Each such segment (non-W parts) must be a sequence where no two adjacent characters are the same. \n\nWait, but also, each such segment must be non-empty. So for example, if a segment is \"RBRB\", that's okay. But \"RR\" is invalid. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: split the string into parts separated by W. For each such part (non-empty), check that it has no two consecutive same characters. If any part fails this, output NO. Otherwise, YES. \n\nWait, but what about the case where a non-W segment is of length 1? Like \"R\" in the middle of W's. For example, the string \"WRW\". \n\nIn this case, the non-W parts are \"R\" (length 1). The check would pass because there are no two consecutive characters. But can this be achieved?\n\nTo get a single R, you need to have a stamp that covers that R and another cell. Let's see: the string is of length 3. The middle cell is R. To get that, you could stamp positions 1-2 as RB. Then the second cell (position 1) would be R, and the third (position 2) would be B. But then the third cell is B, not W. So that's not the desired \"WRW\". Alternatively, maybe stamp positions 0-1 as BR. Then the first cell is B, second R. But then the third is W. So the middle cell is R, but the first is B. So the string would be BRW, not WRW. \n\nHmm, so to get a single R in the middle, you need to have some way to set that R without affecting the adjacent cells. But since each stamp affects two cells, you can't have a single R. Because any stamp that affects the middle cell would also affect either the left or right cell, turning it into B or R. So the adjacent cell would have to be non-W. \n\nTherefore, a single R (or B) in isolation (surrounded by W's) is impossible. \n\nSo the condition is not just that the non-W segments have no two same adjacent characters, but also that each non-W segment has even length? Or maybe that each non-W segment's length is at least 1 but can be any as long as the alternation is correct, but also that the entire segment can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nWait, let's think of the case where a non-W segment is of length 1. Let's say the target is \"WRW\". How can that be achieved?\n\nSuppose the string is of length 3. To have the middle cell R and the others W. \n\nEach stamp must cover two cells. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we stamp positions 0-1 as BR. Then cells 0 is B, 1 is R. Then, stamp positions 1-2 as RB. Then cell 1 becomes R again (since the stamp is RB, so first cell (position1) is R, second (position2) is B. So after the second stamp, the cells are B (from first stamp's 0), R (from second stamp's 1), and B (from second's 2). So the string would be BRB. Not WRW. \n\nAlternatively, is there any way to get a single R in the middle? \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible. So the non-W segments of length 1 are invalid. \n\nSo the condition must also be that each non-W segment has even length? Or perhaps that each non-W segment's length is at least 1 but can be any as long as the alternation is correct, but also that the entire segment can be formed by some combination of stamps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that each non-W segment must have even length? Let me think again. \n\nWait the fifth test case in the problem's note is \"BRB\" (length 3). Which is allowed. So that's an odd length. So that idea is wrong. \n\nHmm. So the problem is more complex. Let me think of the fifth test case. The desired string is BRB. The steps were:\n\nStart with WWW. Stamp at positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based?), making RB. So the string becomes WRB. Then stamp at 0-1 as BR. So the first two become B and R. The third is B. So the final string is BRB. \n\nSo the non-W segment is length 3. So that's allowed. \n\nSo the length can be odd. \n\nHmm. So the problem is not about the length. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. Each application can be thought of as adding a pair. But since overlapping is allowed, the order and overlapping can lead to any combination. \n\nThe key is that the final string must be such that every non-W cell is part of at least one such pair. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the final string's non-W parts. Each non-W run must be a sequence where each pair of consecutive characters alternates between R and B. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. So any two adjacent non-W must be different. \n\nWait, that's the first condition. So the first check is that in the entire string, there are no two consecutive non-W characters that are the same. \n\nBut also, the entire non-W segments must be possible to form by some combination of stamps. \n\nWait, but even if the non-W segments have alternating characters, but the length is 1, like \"R\", then it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that a single non-W character can't be formed. Because any stamp that affects it must also affect another cell. \n\nTherefore, the non-W segments must have even length? Or maybe not. Let's see the fifth test case's example: the non-W segment is length 3 (odd). So that's allowed. \n\nHmm, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait in the fifth test case's example, the non-W segment is length 3. So how is that possible? Because the stamps can overlap. \n\nWait the first stamp was on positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based), making RB. Then the second stamp on 0-1 as BR. So the first two cells are BR, and the third is B. So the sequence is B R B. The third character is B, which was set by the first stamp. \n\nSo the total non-W is 3 characters. So the length can be odd. \n\nSo the problem is that the non-W segments can be of any length (even or odd) as long as the characters alternate. \n\nWait but how can a single character be formed? Let's see. Suppose the target is \"R\" in a string of length 1. Then n=1. Since you can't stamp at all (needs two cells), so the only possible is all W. So \"R\" is impossible. \n\nAnother example: target is \"R\" in a string of length 2. Then possible? Let's see. The two cells can be stamped as RB or BR. So to get \"R\" in the first cell and W in the second? No, because the stamp would set both. So to have \"R\" in first and W in second is impossible. \n\nWait, the stamp must turn both cells into either RB or BR. So the only possible options for two cells are RB, BR, or any combination from multiple stamps. Wait, but each stamp overwrites the cells. \n\nWait, for two cells, if you stamp them as RB, then they are R and B. If you stamp them again as BR, they become B and R. So you can't have one of them being W. \n\nSo for a two-cell string, the only possible final states are either both W (no stamps), or RB, BR, or any combination from multiple stamps. But each stamp changes both cells. So after one stamp, they are RB or BR. After two stamps, they could be back to original or something else. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of stamps. So for two cells, the possible final states are any combination except WW (if you stamp once, you can't get back to WW). Wait no, if you stamp once, you can't get back to WW. So the only way to have WW is to not stamp at all. \n\nSo for a two-cell string, the possible final strings are:\n\n- WW (no stamps)\n\n- RB (one stamp as RB)\n\n- BR (one stamp as BR)\n\n- After two stamps: for example, first RB, then BR on the same cells: first becomes B, second R. So BR again. Or first BR then RB gives RB again. So the only possible non-W options are RB and BR. \n\nSo if the target is \"RW\", that's impossible. \n\nSo the key is that any non-W must be part of a pair. So the non-W segments must have even length? Or not? \n\nWait the fifth test case's example has a non-W segment of length 3. So that's allowed. So the length can be odd. \n\nHmm, so the problem is more complex. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the entire string. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The order of stamps doesn't matter because each stamp overwrites the cells. \n\nThe final color of each cell is the result of all the stamps applied to it. Each cell can be part of multiple stamps. \n\nWait, but each time a stamp is applied to a pair, it sets both cells to specific colors. So the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nAh! That's an important point. Because each stamp overwrites the colors of the two cells. So the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nTherefore, for a cell to be non-W, it must have been part of at least one stamp. And the color is determined by the last stamp that covered it. \n\nSo, for a cell to be R, the last stamp that covered it must have set it to R (either as the first or second in the pair). Similarly for B. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to: can we assign to each non-W cell a set of stamps such that:\n\n- Each non-W cell is covered by at least one stamp (so that it's not white).\n\n- The last stamp covering each cell determines its color.\n\n- Each stamp is applied to two adjacent cells, and each stamp's pair is either RB or BR. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. Any two consecutive non-W characters must be different (so R and B alternating).\n\n2. The entire string's non-W parts must form a sequence where each pair of adjacent non-W can be part of some stamp. \n\nWait, but how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, the first condition is that the non-W parts must alternate between R and B. So no two same in a row. \n\nAdditionally, the entire non-W segments must be possible to be formed by some overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, but how to check that? \n\nWait, perhaps the first condition is sufficient. Let me see. \n\nTake the case of a single R in the middle (like \"WRW\"). The non-W part is \"R\", which has no consecutive duplicates, so condition 1 is satisfied. But it's impossible. So the first condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. So there must be another condition. \n\nAnother idea: the non-W segments must have even length? Let's see. \n\nIn the fifth test case's example, the non-W segment is length 3 (odd), so that would violate the even length condition. So that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. \n\nEach non-W segment must be a sequence of alternating R and B. So the first character can be R or B, then alternates. \n\nAdditionally, the length of the segment must be at least 1, but can be any as long as the alternation is correct. \n\nWait but how to handle the case where a segment has length 1? \n\nLike \"R\" in the middle. \n\nIn that case, the R must be part of a stamp. But the stamp must cover two cells. So the adjacent cell must also be non-W. \n\nTherefore, a single R cannot exist. So the segment length must be at least 2? \n\nWait, no. Because in the fifth test case, the segment is length 3. So that's allowed. \n\nWait, but in that case, the third character is B. So the first and third are B and B. Wait no, the example's final string is B R B. So the first and third are B and B. Are they adjacent? The first and second are B and R (different), second and third R and B (different). So the entire sequence alternates correctly. \n\nSo the problem with a single R is that it can't be part of any stamp without affecting another cell. \n\nTherefore, the non-W segments must have even length? Or perhaps the length can be any as long as the alternation is correct, but the entire segment must be covered by some overlapping stamps. \n\nAlternatively, the necessary conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Additionally, each non-W segment must have even length? \n\nWait, but the fifth test case's segment is length 3 (odd), so that would fail. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W segments can have any length (even or odd) as long as the alternation is correct. \n\nBut how to handle the case of a single R? \n\nIn that case, the segment is length 1. The alternation is okay (no consecutive duplicates), but it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the segment must have at least two characters? \n\nWait, no. The example with length 3 is allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the stamps as covering pairs. Each stamp can be thought of as contributing a pair of R and B. The final colors are determined by the last stamp applied to each cell. \n\nTherefore, for a cell to be R, it must be the first in some stamp's pair (RB) or the second in a BR pair. \n\nBut the key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one stamp. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nPerhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. The non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n2. The entire string's non-W segments must form a sequence where each pair of adjacent non-W can be part of a stamp. \n\nWait, but how to check that? \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows: the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two consecutive characters are different, and the entire sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nWait, but overlapping is allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the non-W segments must have even length? \n\nWait let's see the fifth test case's example: the non-W segment is length 3. 3 is odd. So that would contradict that idea. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the non-W segments. Each such segment must be a sequence of R and B that alternates. So the sequence can be of any length (even or odd) as long as the alternation is correct. \n\nBut for the entire sequence to be possible, the first and last characters must be different if the length is odd. Because in a sequence of length 3 like RBR, the first and third are R and R. Wait no, RBR has first R, second B, third R. So first and third are same. \n\nWait, but in that case, the sequence is R B R. The first and third are R. So the length is 3 (odd). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the entire non-W segment must be possible to be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. \n\nEach stamp covers two cells. So for a segment of length L, the minimal number of stamps needed would be ceil(L/2), but overlapping can allow for more. \n\nBut how does that affect the possibility? \n\nAlternatively, the key is that the non-W segments must be such that they can be covered by a set of overlapping pairs (each pair being RB or BR) such that the final colors are as desired. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nPerhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the non-W segments alternate between R and B. \n\nBecause any such sequence can be formed by choosing the stamps appropriately. \n\nWait, let's see the case of a single R. The non-W segment is \"R\". The alternation is okay (no consecutive duplicates). But it's impossible. \n\nSo the condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of the stamps as operations that can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The order of operations doesn't matter except for the last one. \n\nThe final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nTherefore, for a cell to be R, it must be the first in an RB pair or the second in a BR pair in the last stamp that covers it. \n\nSimilarly for B. \n\nNow, for a non-W segment, each cell must be covered by at least one stamp. \n\nSuppose the non-W segment is of length 1. Let's say it's \"R\". \n\nThis R must be part of a stamp. The stamp must cover this cell and its neighbor. But the neighbor must also be non-W (since the stamp's other cell must be set to B or R). \n\nTherefore, the single R cannot exist because its neighbor must also be non-W. \n\nThus, the non-W segments must have even length? Or at least length >=2? \n\nWait, no. The fifth test case's segment is length 3. So that's allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, in the fifth test case's example, the non-W segment is B R B. The first and third are B. \n\nThe first B is part of a stamp (the first two cells as BR?), and the third B is part of a stamp (the last two as RB). \n\nSo the first B is the first in a BR pair (so the first cell is B, second R). The third B is the second in an RB pair (so the second cell is R, third B). \n\nThus, the first and third B's are covered by different stamps. \n\nSo the length can be odd. \n\nSo the problem with a single R is that it can't be covered without affecting a neighbor. \n\nThus, the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n2. Each non-W segment must have even length? Or not? \n\nWait, the fifth test case's segment is length 3 (odd), so that's allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the entire non-W segment. Since each stamp affects two cells, the entire segment must be covered by some overlapping stamps. \n\nThe key is that the entire sequence can be formed by a series of overlapping pairs. \n\nThe necessary condition is that the sequence alternates between R and B. \n\nBecause any such sequence can be formed by choosing the stamps appropriately. \n\nWait, let's see the single R case. The sequence is \"R\". It alternates (trivially), but can't be formed. \n\nSo the alternation is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother Idea: Let's think of the entire non-W segment. \n\nSuppose the segment is of length L. \n\nThe first character can be R or B. \n\nThe second must be the opposite. \n\nThe third must be the opposite of the second, etc. \n\nThus, the entire sequence must alternate. \n\nNow, to form this sequence, you can start from one end and apply stamps. \n\nFor example, for the sequence R B R B (length 4):\n\nYou can stamp the first two as RB, then the next two as BR, etc. \n\nAlternatively, for a sequence of length 3 (like B R B):\n\nStamp positions 0-1 as BR (so B R), then positions 1-2 as RB (so R B). The result is B R B. \n\nThus, it works. \n\nFor a single R (length 1):\n\nThe only way to have R is to have a stamp that covers it and the next cell. But that next cell must be non-W. \n\nThus, the single R can't exist. \n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Additionally, each non-W segment must have length at least 2? \n\nWait, no. The fifth test case's segment is length 3, which is allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the problem is that a single non-W character can't exist. So any non-W segment must have length at least 2? \n\nNo, because the fifth test case's segment is length 3. \n\nWait, the length can be any as long as it's at least 1, but the alternation holds. \n\nBut the single character case is impossible. \n\nSo the condition is that all non-W segments must have length >= 2? \n\nNo, because the fifth test case's segment is length 3. \n\nWait, the problem is that a single character can't exist, but longer segments can. \n\nThus, the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n2. Each non-W segment must have length at least 2? \n\nWait, no. Because the fifth test case's segment is length 3, which is allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the problem with a single character is that it can't be formed. So the non-W segments must have length >= 2. \n\nBut the fifth test case's segment is length 3, which is okay. \n\nSo the condition is that each non-W segment must have length >= 2. \n\nWait, but what about a segment of length 2? That's allowed. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Each non-W segment must have length >= 2. \n\nWait, but what about a segment of length 1? \n\nYes, that's prohibited. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSplit the string into non-W segments (split on W's). For each such segment:\n\n- If the segment is empty, skip.\n\n- Else, check two things:\n\n   a) The characters alternate between R and B (no two same in a row).\n\n   b) The length of the segment is at least 2. \n\nIf all segments satisfy these, then output YES, else NO. \n\nWait, let's test this with the examples. \n\nFirst example's desired string is BRBBW? Or the example given in the problem's first test case is BRBBW? \n\nWait the first example's final string is B R B B W. Wait, the fourth character is B and the third is B. So that would have two B's in a row. Which would violate the first condition. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem's first test case is the sequence leading to B R B B W. Wait, but that has two B's in a row. \n\nWait that can't be right. \n\nWait the problem's first example says the final picture is B R B B W. \n\nWait that would have two B's in a row. Which would violate the first condition. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait the problem's first example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nThe non-W segments are \"BRBB\". \n\nThe first two are B and R (okay), then R and B (okay), then B and B (same). So that would have two B's in a row. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. \n\nWait this is a problem. \n\nWait the example's final string must be possible. But according to my conditions, it would be invalid. \n\nSo my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nHmm, this is a critical point. \n\nThe first example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nThe non-W segment is \"BRBB\". \n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. So two B's in a row. \n\nWhich would violate the first condition. \n\nBut according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. \n\nSo my previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nThis means I need to re-examine the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the example. Let me recheck the problem's first example. \n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture B R B B W could be WWWWW \u2192 WW R B W \u2192 B R R B W \u2192 B R B B W. Here the underline shows the stamp's position.\"\n\nWait the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nSo according to the example, this is possible. \n\nBut according to my previous logic, this would be invalid because of the two B's. \n\nSo my previous logic is wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis means that the first condition (no two same consecutive non-W) is not required. \n\nSo I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the key is that any two consecutive non-W cells must be part of a stamp. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the problem allows overlapping stamps, so two consecutive non-W cells can be part of different stamps. \n\nWait, in the first example's final string, the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nHow did that happen? \n\nLooking at the steps:\n\nThe first step: stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), making RB. So the string becomes WWWRB W. \n\nSecond step: stamp at 0-1 as BR, so first two are BR. So the string is BR R B W. \n\nThird step: stamp at 1-2 as RB. So positions 1 and 2 become R and B. \n\nSo the string after third step is B (from first stamp's 0), then R (from second stamp's 1?), then B (from third's 2), then B (from first stamp's 3?), and W. \n\nWait, the third step's stamp is applied to positions 1-2. \n\nAfter the second step, the string is B R R B W. \n\nThen the third step stamps positions 1-2 as RB. \n\nSo position 1 becomes R (from the stamp's first part?), and position 2 becomes B. \n\nSo the string becomes B (position0), then R (position1), then B (position2), then B (position3), and W. \n\nSo the third and fourth characters are B and B. \n\nSo how did that happen? \n\nThe fourth character (position3) was set by the first stamp (position3-4 as RB, so position3 was R, then in the third step, it wasn't touched. \n\nWait, the third step's stamp is on positions 1-2. So position3 remains as B from the first stamp? \n\nWait the first stamp was on positions 3-4 (assuming the first step's stamp is at the end). \n\nSo after first step, positions 3 and 4 are R and B. \n\nSecond step: stamp 0-1 as BR \u2192 positions0 is B, 1 is R. \n\nThird step: stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 positions1 becomes R (from the first part of the stamp?), and position2 becomes B. \n\nSo after third step:\n\nposition0: B \n\nposition1: R \n\nposition2: B \n\nposition3: R (from first stamp's position3) \n\nposition4: B (from first stamp's position4). \n\nWait, but the final string is B R B B W. \n\nWait position3 is R? Or B? \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's steps. \n\nThe problem's example says the third step is stamping at 1-2 as RB. \n\nThe previous string after second step was B R R B W. \n\nStamping 1-2 as RB would set position1 to R (from the first part of the stamp?), and position2 to B. \n\nSo the new string after third step would be B (0), R (1), B (2), R (3), B (4). \n\nSo the fourth character (position3) is R, and fifth is B. \n\nBut the final string is B R B B W. \n\nAh, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W, but the fourth character is B. \n\nSo how did that happen? \n\nMaybe the third step's stamp was applied to positions 2-3. \n\nLet me recheck the problem's example description:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nWWW WW \u2192 WW RB W (first stamp at positions 3-4, assuming 0-based? Or maybe 1-based? \n\nThe problem's example uses underlines to show the stamp's position. \n\nThe first step is WW followed by RB underlined, then W. So the stamp is applied to the last two cells (positions 3 and 4 in 0-based, or 4 and 5 in 1-based). \n\nThe second step is the first two underlined as BR, so positions 0 and 1. \n\nThe third step is the second and third underlined as RB, so positions 1 and 2. \n\nSo after third step:\n\nposition0: B (from first stamp on 0-1)\n\nposition1: R (from second stamp's first part?)\n\nWait, the second step's stamp is BR on positions 0-1 \u2192 position0 is B, position1 is R. \n\nThird step's stamp is RB on positions 1-2 \u2192 position1 becomes R (from the first part of the stamp?), and position2 becomes B. \n\nSo after third step:\n\nposition0: B \n\nposition1: R \n\nposition2: B \n\nposition3: R (from first stamp's position3) \n\nposition4: B \n\nSo the string is B R B R B. \n\nBut the example's final string is B R B B W. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third step's stamp is applied to positions 2-3. \n\nIn that case, after third step:\n\nposition2 and 3 are set to RB. \n\nSo position2 becomes R, position3 B. \n\nThen the string would be B R (position1), then R (position2?), B (position3), B (position4). \n\nWait this is getting too confusing. \n\nThe key point is that the example's final string has two B's in a row, which according to my previous logic would be invalid, but the problem says it's valid. \n\nSo my previous approach is wrong. \n\nThis means I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the key is that any two consecutive non-W cells must be part of at least one stamp. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nAlternatively, the problem allows any configuration except those with three consecutive non-W of the same color. \n\nWait, but the example has two B's in a row. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the stamps as operations that can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe final colors are the result of all the stamps applied, with the last stamp on each cell determining its color. \n\nThus, for any two adjacent cells, their colors must be achievable by some combination of stamps. \n\nBut how? \n\nSuppose two adjacent cells are R and B. That can be achieved by a single stamp of RB or BR. \n\nIf they are B and R, similarly. \n\nIf they are R and R, then it's impossible because any stamp covering them would have to set one to B. \n\nWait, but if they are covered by two overlapping stamps. \n\nFor example, suppose two cells are R and R. \n\nTo get this, the last stamp covering the first cell must set it to R, and the last stamp covering the second must set it to R. \n\nBut each stamp covering the first cell must be either RB or BR. \n\nFor the first cell to be R, the last stamp covering it must be either the first part of an RB pair or the second part of a BR pair. \n\nSimilarly for the second cell. \n\nSuppose the first cell is covered by a stamp as the first of an RB pair (so the second cell of that stamp is B). \n\nBut the second cell is also covered by another stamp as the second of a BR pair (so the first of that stamp is B). \n\nBut then the second cell's final color is R (from the BR pair's second part). \n\nSo to have both cells R, the last stamps covering them must have set them to R. \n\nFor the first cell: it must be the first of an RB pair or the second of a BR pair. \n\nFor the second cell: it must be the first of an RB pair or the second of a BR pair. \n\nBut the two cells are adjacent. \n\nSuppose the first cell is the first of an RB pair (so the second cell is B from that stamp). \n\nBut the second cell is also the first of an RB pair (so its next cell must be B). \n\nBut the second cell's final color is R. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the entire string has no three consecutive non-W characters where the first and third are the same. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's solution is to check that every occurrence of two consecutive non-W characters must be either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but the first example has two B's in a row. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that any non-W segment must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nLet me look at the code that the user provided. \n\nThe user's code is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nWait, this code splits the string into parts separated by W's. For each part, it checks if all characters are the same (set size 1). If any such part exists, output NO, else YES. \n\nSo the code is checking that in each non-W segment, the characters are not all the same. \n\nFor example, the first test case's non-W segment is \"BRBB\". The set of characters is {'B', 'R'}, so it's okay. \n\nThe two B's in a row are allowed because the set has more than one character. \n\nThe code would output YES for that case. \n\nThe case of a single R would split into a segment \"R\", which has set size 1 \u2192 output NO. \n\nThe case of \"RR\" would have a segment \"RR\" \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 output NO. \n\nThe case of \"RBRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. \n\nThe case of \"BRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. \n\nThe case of \"B\" \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 NO. \n\nThis seems to align with the problem's examples. \n\nThe first example's segment is \"BRBB\" \u2192 set is {B, R} \u2192 okay. \n\nThe code's logic is that any non-W segment must not be all the same character. \n\nSo the condition is that each non-W segment must have at least two different characters. \n\nThis would allow segments like \"BRBB\" (since it has both B and R), even though there are two B's in a row. \n\nSo the code's logic is correct? \n\nLet me see the problem's note examples. \n\nThe second, third, and fourth test cases are not possible because they are single cells (n=1). \n\nThe fifth test case's desired string is \"BRB\" \u2192 split into one segment \"BRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. \n\nThe sixth test case's example is \"RBB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 YES. \n\nThe seventh test case is all W \u2192 no non-W segments \u2192 YES. \n\nThe code's logic seems to align with the problem's examples. \n\nSo the correct condition is that each non-W segment must not be composed of the same character. \n\nThus, the code provided by the user is almost correct. \n\nWait, but the user's code has a for loop that is incomplete. The first line is \"for # TODO: Your code here\". \n\nThe user's code is probably supposed to loop over the test cases. \n\nThe code given is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nThe first line is incomplete. The correct code should loop over the test cases. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    parts = s.split('W')\n    valid = True\n    for p in parts:\n        if len(p) ==0:\n            continue\n        if len(set(p)) ==1:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut the user's code uses input().split('W') on the string. \n\nWait the user's code is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nThe first line is missing the loop over test cases. \n\nThe first line should be for _ in range(int(input())): \n\nSo the missing code is the loop over the test cases. \n\nThe user's code has \"for # TODO: Your code here\" \u2014 so the first line should be replaced with the proper loop. \n\nThe rest of the code is okay. \n\nSo the problem is to complete the code by adding the loop over test cases. \n\nThe user's code has the first line as a for loop that is incomplete. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    # the rest as before \n\nBut in the user's code, the first line is missing the loop. \n\nThe user's code's first line is \"for # TODO: Your code here\" \u2014 so the correct code would replace that line with the proper loop. \n\nThe rest of the code is okay. \n\nSo the missing code is the first line: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nThus, the user's code is almost correct except for the first line. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code given by the user has the first line as \"for # TODO: Your code here\" \u2014 so the missing part is the loop over the test cases. \n\nThe correct first line is \"for _ in range(int(input())):\"\n\nSo the missing code is that line. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to replace the first line with the loop. \n\nBut the user's code has the first line as a for loop with a TODO. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nThe missing code is the first line: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nThus, the correct missing code is that line. \n\nThe rest of the code is okay. \n\nSo the answer is to output that line. \n\nWait, but the user's code after the first line has \"l = int(input())\". \n\nWait the first line is the loop over test cases. \n\nThe code inside the loop should read the n and the string. \n\nThe user's code has:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nSo the first line is the loop over test cases. \n\nThe user's code's first line is incomplete. \n\nThe correct first line is for _ in range(int(input())): \n\nThen inside the loop, the code reads l (which is n) as l = int(input()), then reads the string. \n\nThe user's code uses l = int(input()), which is correct (since n is the length). \n\nThe rest of the code is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is the first line. \n\nSo the answer is to output the first line as for _ in range(int(input())): \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nSo the user's code is missing that line. \n\nThus, the correct missing code is that line."
