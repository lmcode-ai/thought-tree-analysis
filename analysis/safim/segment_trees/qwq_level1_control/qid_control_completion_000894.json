But maybe the code added a 'W' at the end (since in main, s = s + 'W'). So the loop is from 0 to n (inclusive), which is n+1 characters. The 'W' is added to the end, perhaps to handle the end of the string. The current code's check function is trying to track the counts of R and B, but the logic is incomplete.

Let me outline the steps in code:\n\nlong long check() {\n\n    int start = -1, end = -1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // since s is now length n+1, but the original string is n characters, but the added W is at position n.\n\n        if (s[i] ! = 'W') {\n\n            if (start == -1) start = i;\n\n            end = i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Now, if start is -1, then all are W \u2192 return 1. if (start == -1) return 1;\n\n    // Check that the block is contiguous.\n\n    for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == 'W') return 0; // there's a W in the block \u2192 not contiguous.\n\n    }\n\n    // Check the length is at least 2. if (end - start + 1 < 2) return 0;\n\n    // Check each consecutive pair. for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n        char a = s[i], b = s[i+1]; if ( (a == 'R' && b == 'B') || (a == 'B' && b == 'R') ) continue;\n\n        else return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n} But the current code's check function is written in a different way. The existing code's check function loops up to i <=n (since s has been extended with a 'W'). So perhaps the code can be adapted to this approach. But the current code's check function is inside a function that is called for each test case, and the variables are declared as global. So perhaps the code can be modified to implement this logic.",

Then the next B would start a new block, which would trigger the count>0 condition and return 0. Yes, that would work. So this approach would:\n\n- Ensure that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block (because any W between non-W would split into two blocks, which is detected by the count>0 check).\n\n- Ensure that each consecutive pair is valid.\n\n- Ensure that the block length is at least 2. So this seems promising. Now, how to implement this in the current code's check function. The current code's check function has variables num1 and num2, but perhaps we can replace that with the above logic. Let me try to write the check function accordingly. The check function would need to loop through the string s (which has been extended with a 'W' in main). The variables needed are:\n\n- has_started: whether we are in a non-W block. - prev_char: the previous non-W character.\n\n- count: the length of the current block. - count_blocks: the number of blocks encountered (should be 0 or 1). Wait, but the count_blocks can be tracked via the 'count' variable. Let's see:\n\nInitialize:\n\nhas_started = false;\n\nprev_char = 'W';\n\ncount = 0;\n\nblocks = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <=n; i++) { // since s is now length n+1. char c = s[i];\n\n    if (c == 'W') {\n\n        if (has_started) {\n\n            // end of block.\n\n            has_started = false;\n\n            blocks++;\n\n        }\n\n        continue;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (!has_started) {\n\n            // new block starts. if (blocks > 0) {\n\n                // already had a block \u2192 multiple blocks \u2192 invalid. return 0;\n\n            }\n\n            has_started = true;\n\n            prev_char = c;\n\n            count = 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // check with previous character. if ( (prev_char == 'R' && c == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && c == 'R') ) {\n\n                prev_char = c;\n\n                count++;\n\n            } else {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// After loop:\n\nif (blocks == 0) {\n\n    // all W \u2192 return 1. return 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    // check count >=2. if (count < 2) return 0;\n\n    return 1;\n\n} Wait, but the 'blocks' variable is incremented when a block ends (when a W is encountered after a block).",

So this works. Another example: \"BRB\" \u2192 works. Another example: \"BB\" \u2192 the first two are B and B \u2192 invalid pair.

Then when the second block starts, the 'blocks>0' condition is triggered, returning 0. So this should work. Now, the code's check function can be replaced with this logic. But in the current code's check function, the loop is from i=0 to n (since s has been extended with a 'W' in main). So this should work. Now, the original code's check function had a loop that went up to i<=n, which is correct now. So the missing code in the original problem's code is the implementation of the check function as above. The original code's check function had a loop with an incomplete condition for the W case. The user's code had:\n\nelse if(/* TODO: Your code here */) num1=num2=0;\n\nBut that approach was incorrect. So the correct code is the one I outlined above. So the missing code is the entire check function rewritten as above.

The original code's check function is:\n\nlong long check(){\n    long long num1=0,num2=0;\n    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n        if(s[i]=='R') num1++;\n        else if(s[i]=='B') num2++;\n        else if(/* TODO: Your code here */) num1=num2=0;\n        else return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n} The correct code for the check function is the one I wrote above. So the missing code is the entire body of the check function, replacing the existing code. Thus, the correct code for the check function is as follows:\n\nlong long check(){\n    bool has_started = false;\n    char prev_char = 'W';\n    int count = 0;\n    int blocks = 0;\n    for(int i=0; i <=n; i++){\n        char c = s[i];\n        if(c == 'W'){\n            if(has_started){\n                has_started = false;\n                blocks++;\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n        else{\n            if(!has_started){\n                if(blocks >0){\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                has_started = true; prev_char = c;\n                count =1;\n            }\n            else{\n                if( (prev_char == 'R' && c == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && c == 'R') ){\n                    prev_char = c;\n                    count++;\n                }\n                else{\n                    return 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if(blocks ==0){\n        return 1;\n    }\n    else{\n        if(count <2) return 0;\n        else return 1;\n    }\n} So this is the code that should replace the original check function.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the check function so that the code works correctly. Let's see the problem again. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B, and can be applied multiple times. The key is to find the conditions that make the string impossible.\n\nHmm, the check function is supposed to return 1 if possible, else 0. The current code loops through the string, tracking num1 (count of R) and num2 (count of B). But the logic here is a bit unclear. Let me think about the constraints.\n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells. So every time you stamp, you add one R and one B. But since you can stamp over existing cells, the order matters. However, the final configuration must be such that the counts and arrangement can be built through these steps.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the difference between the number of R and B must be even? Or perhaps not. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: the final string is B R B B W. Let's see the counts: R is 1, B is 3. The difference is 2. But how does that relate to the stamps? Each stamp adds one R and one B, so each stamp increases the total of R+B by 2. But the difference between R and B can vary. Wait, each stamp can be either RB or BR. So for each stamp, the R and B can be in either order. So each stamp contributes either +1 R and +1 B, but their positions matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by looking at the sequence and ensuring that any non-white cell must be part of a pair that can be formed by the stamps. But how?\n\nAnother thought: since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the colors must form a pattern where every non-white cell is part of some overlapping or adjacent pairs. But perhaps the key is that the sequence of non-W must alternate in a way that allows for the stamps.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that every time you stamp, you can create a pair of R and B. But overlapping stamps can change previous colors. However, the final configuration must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nLet me think of the constraints:\n\n1. Any occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair that can be formed by some stamp. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, maybe the key is that the sequence of non-W's must form a pattern where every two consecutive non-W's can be part of some overlapping pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of R and B must be equal modulo something. Wait, each stamp adds one R and one B, so the total number of R and B must have the same parity. Because each stamp adds one to each, so the difference between R and B must be even? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the total R and B counts are R and B. Each stamp adds 1 to R and 1 to B, so R - B remains the same as before each stamp. Wait, no. Wait, each stamp can be either R followed by B, or B followed by R. So each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total R and B counts must have R = B + k, but each stamp adds 1 to each, so the difference R-B remains the same as the initial (which is zero, since starting from all W). Wait, no. Wait, the initial state has R=0 and B=0. Each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So after m stamps, total R and B must be equal? Because each stamp adds 1 to each. So R must equal B. Because each stamp contributes +1 to R and +1 to B. So the total R and B must be equal. Wait, that's a crucial point!\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because every stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R and B in the final string must be equal. Because each stamp contributes one of each. So if the final string has R_count != B_count, then it's impossible. So that's a necessary condition.\n\nSo first check: if the number of R and B in the string are not equal, then return NO.\n\nWait, but what about the W's? The W's are not counted. So the total R and B must be equal. So that's a necessary condition. So in the code, first, we can check if the counts of R and B are equal. If not, return 0.\n\nWait, but let's see the example given in the problem's fifth test case. The example says that the fifth test case can be done. Let me see what that example is. The fifth test case's example input is \"BRB\". Let's see: R count is 1, B is 2. Wait, that would mean R and B counts are not equal. Wait, but according to the note, the fifth test case is possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait the fifth test case's example says:\n\n\"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW \u2192 W R B \u2192 B R B. So the final string is BRB. So R count is 1, B is 2. So R and B counts are 1 and 2, which are not equal. That contradicts the earlier conclusion. So my previous reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So my initial thought that R and B counts must be equal is incorrect. So I need to think again.\n\nWait in the example given in the problem's fifth test case, the final string is BRB. Let's count R and B: R is 1, B is 2. So total R + B is 3, which is odd. But each stamp adds two colors (R and B), so the total R+B must be even. But 3 is odd, so that's impossible. But the example says it is possible. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait the example's fifth test case's steps:\n\nStart with WWW (3 W's). Then first stamp is applied to positions 2-3, turning them into R and B. So the string becomes W R B. Then the second stamp is applied to positions 1-2, which are W and R. The stamp can be either BR or RB. Wait, the stamp can be rotated. So if you apply the stamp to positions 1-2 (W and R), then the stamp can turn them into B and R (if using BR) or R and B (RB). Wait, but the existing R is already there. So when you stamp over existing cells, they are overwritten. So in the second step, applying the stamp to positions 1-2 (W and R):\n\nIf the stamp is BR, then position 1 becomes B and position 2 becomes R. So the new string is B R B. So the total R is 1 (position 2), B is 2 (positions 1 and 3). So R count is 1, B is 2. So total R+B is 3, which is odd. But each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. The first stamp added 1 R and 1 B (total 2). The second stamp added 1 R and 1 B again, but overwriting existing cells. Wait, but the second stamp's application would overwrite the existing R (position 2) to R again? Or does it set it to B?\n\nWait, the stamp's effect is that the two cells under it are set to either RB or BR. So when you stamp over existing cells, their colors are replaced. So in the second step, the first two cells (W and R) are stamped as BR (so first becomes B, second becomes R). So the R in position 2 was already there, but now it's set to R again. So the total R and B counts would be:\n\nFirst stamp: R count 1, B 1. Second stamp: the first cell becomes B (so B count increases by 1?), but the second cell was R and remains R. So the total R is 1 (position 2), B is 2 (positions 1 and 3). So total R + B is 3, which is odd. But each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. The first stamp added 2 (1+1), the second stamp also adds 2 (1+1), so total 4? But the actual total is 3. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the stamps can overwrite existing colors, so the total R and B can be anything. So the previous idea that R and B must be equal is wrong. So I need to think differently.\n\nHmm, so the key must be something else. Let's think of the problem differently. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning them into either RB or BR. The order can be chosen each time. The stamps can be applied multiple times, so overlapping is allowed. The initial state is all W. The final state must be achievable through any number of such operations.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the final string. Let's consider the positions where the cells are not W. Each such cell must have been set by some stamp. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, the final color depends on the last stamp that affected it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the non-W cells must form a sequence where every two consecutive non-W cells can be part of a stamp's pair. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as the final string must satisfy that for every position, the color can be explained by some sequence of stamps. Let's think of the colors in the string and see what constraints they must satisfy.\n\nSuppose the string has a 'R' followed by a 'B'. That could be the result of a single stamp applied there as RB. Or maybe it's the result of overlapping stamps. But perhaps the key is that the colors must alternate in a way that allows for the stamps.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the sequence of non-W colors must form a pattern where every two adjacent non-W cells are either R and B or B and R. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B in some order. But overlapping stamps can change this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string must be such that every occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair of adjacent non-W's that form either RB or BR. But that might not be the case because a single non-W could be part of a stamp that's overlapping with others.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be approached by looking for invalid patterns. For example, if there are three consecutive non-W cells that form a pattern like R R B, then that might be impossible.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: every time you apply a stamp, you are setting two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. So the final string must be such that every non-W cell is part of at least one such pair. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, it's tricky.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the positions where the color is not W. Let's look at the sequence of these colors. The key is that between any two non-W cells, there must be a way to form pairs that can be covered by the stamps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as the following: the entire string must be covered by some overlapping pairs of R and B, such that each non-W cell is part of at least one such pair. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of R and B must be equal. Wait, in the fifth test case example, the final string has R=1 and B=2, which are not equal. But according to the problem's note, that case is possible. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the counts don't have to be equal. So that approach is invalid.\n\nLet me think of the fifth test case again. The final string is BRB. The counts are R=1, B=2. So the difference is 1. But how is that possible?\n\nWait, each stamp adds exactly one R and one B. So the total number of R and B must be equal. Because each stamp contributes one of each. So the total R and B must be equal. But in the example, they are not. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait the example's fifth test case's steps:\n\nThe first stamp is applied to positions 2-3, resulting in R and B. So after first stamp, R=1, B=1. Then the second stamp is applied to positions 1-2. The stamp can be BR, so position 1 becomes B and position 2 becomes R. So after that, the counts are R=1 (position 2), B=2 (positions 1 and 3). So total R + B is 3, which is odd. But each stamp adds two (1 R and 1 B). So two stamps would add 2 each, so total 4. But the actual total is 3. So that's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait the first stamp adds 1 R and 1 B. The second stamp also adds 1 R and 1 B, but overwrites existing cells. So the first cell was W, so becomes B (so +1 B). The second cell was R, now becomes R again (so no change). So the second stamp's contribution is +1 B (from first cell) and 0 R (since the second cell was already R). So the total R remains 1, B becomes 2. So the total R and B are 3, which is indeed odd. But each stamp must add exactly one R and one B. So the total R and B must be equal. So this example contradicts that. So perhaps the example is wrong, or my understanding is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for the stamps to be applied in such a way that the total R and B can be anything. So my initial assumption is wrong. So I need to think differently.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the sequence must not have three consecutive non-W cells where the middle one is W. Wait, no. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: each stamp can be thought of as adding a pair of R and B in some order. The order can be chosen each time. The stamps can be applied anywhere, overlapping, and each application overwrites the previous colors. The final configuration must be achievable through any number of such operations.\n\nThe key is to find a way to model the constraints on the final string.\n\nLet me think of the following: every time you apply a stamp, you can choose to set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final string must be such that for every position, the color can be explained by the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final string must satisfy that any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because otherwise, there's no way to have them set that way without conflicting.\n\nWait, for example, if there is a sequence like R followed by R, then that's impossible. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. So two R's in a row would require that they were set by two different stamps, but overlapping in a way that allows both to be R. But how?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose you have two R's in a row. Let's say positions 1 and 2 are both R. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose first, you stamp position 1-2 as BR (so position 1 is B, 2 is R). Then, you stamp position 0-1 (but that's out of bounds). Or maybe stamp position 1-2 again as RB. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nSuppose first stamp is on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 positions 1 is R, 2 is B.\n\nThen, a second stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 position 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R. So now they are B and R again. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe stamping on positions 0-1 (if possible) but that's outside the array. So perhaps it's impossible to have two R's in a row. So the final string cannot have two R's adjacent, or two B's adjacent, except for certain cases?\n\nWait, let's think of the example given in the problem's fifth test case: the final string is B R B. The middle is R and next is B. So that's allowed. But the first and third are B and B. So two B's separated by an R. That's allowed. So two B's can be separated by other colors.\n\nHmm, so the key might be that any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because otherwise, they can't be the result of a stamp. Wait, but in the example of B R B, the first two are B and R (which is BR, which is allowed as a stamp). The second and third are R and B (RB, which is allowed). So that works. \n\nWait, but what about a string like \"BRB\" \u2014 the first and third are B and B. They are not adjacent, so that's okay. But the adjacent pairs are BR and RB, which are valid.\n\nAnother example: the string \"BB\". Can this be formed? Let's see. To get two B's, you need to have applied a stamp in such a way that both are B. But each stamp can only set one to R and the other to B. So for two B's, you can't have that. Because each stamp on those two cells would set one to R and the other to B. So \"BB\" is impossible. So the adjacent B's would be invalid.\n\nSo the key is that any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because otherwise, they can't be the result of a stamp. Because each stamp on those two cells would have to set them to one of those two options. So if two adjacent non-W cells are not RB or BR, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but what about a single non-W cell? Like a single R. How can that happen?\n\nSuppose the string is \"R\" (n=1). Since the stamp requires two cells, you can't apply any stamp. So the only possible final string is all W. So a single R is impossible. So the code must return NO for that case.\n\nAnother example: the string \"B\". Similarly, impossible.\n\nAnother example: the string \"WRB\". The first two are W and R. The W can be ignored, but the R and B are adjacent and form RB, which is okay. So that's possible.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n1. All non-W cells must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W cells are either RB or BR. \n\n2. Additionally, the entire string must not have any isolated non-W cells (i.e., a non-W cell that is not part of any adjacent pair of non-W cells). Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, a single R in the middle of W's. Like \"W R W\". The R is isolated. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose you stamp the R and the next W (position 2 and 3). But then the R would be part of a pair with the next cell. But after that, the next cell would be B or R. So the R in position 2 would require that the next cell is B or R. But if the next cell is W, then that would mean that the last stamp applied to that position must have set it back to W, which is impossible because stamps can only set to R or B. So an isolated non-W is impossible.\n\nWait, because any non-W cell must have been set by a stamp. The stamp affects two cells. So if a cell is non-W, then it must be part of at least one stamp's pair. But if it's isolated (like surrounded by W's on both sides), then the only way it could be set is if a stamp was applied to it and the next cell (but the next cell is W, so that would require that the next cell is set to either R or B, but in the final string it's W. So that's impossible. Hence, any non-W cell must be part of a pair with at least one adjacent non-W cell. So the non-W cells must form a contiguous block where every two adjacent are either RB or BR.\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"RBR\"? Let's see:\n\nThe pairs are R-B and B-R. Both are valid. So that's okay. So the entire string is allowed.\n\nAnother example: \"BRBR\". All adjacent pairs are valid.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking two things:\n\n1. All non-W cells form a contiguous block (so no W between non-W cells).\n\n2. Within this block, every pair of adjacent cells is either RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string can be all W's (so zero stamps applied).\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"WBRW\"? The non-W part is BR, which is okay. The W's on either side are allowed. So the non-W part is a contiguous block. So that's okay.\n\nSo the steps to check would be:\n\n- Check that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. Because if there are two separate blocks of non-W, then between them there must be a W, which would mean that those non-W blocks are not connected, so the stamps can't reach both.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"BRWBR\", then the non-W parts are separated by a W. So the first BR and the last BR are separated by a W. So how could that be formed? Because the stamps can only affect adjacent cells. The middle W would have to be part of a stamp, but then it would be turned into R or B, which contradicts. So such a case is impossible. Hence, the non-W must form a single contiguous block.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block.\n\n2. Within this block, every two adjacent characters are either RB or BR.\n\n3. Additionally, the count of R and B must be equal? Or not?\n\nWait, in the fifth test case example, the string is BRB. The counts are R=1, B=2. So they are not equal. But according to the example, it's possible. So the count equality is not required. So that condition is not necessary.\n\nHmm, so the count of R and B can be different. So the key is the contiguous block and the adjacent pairs.\n\nWait, but in the fifth test case example, the contiguous block is BRB. The pairs are BR and RB. So each adjacent pair is valid. So the conditions are met. So the code must check for those two conditions.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, check if all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. If not, return NO.\n\nSecond, check that every pair of adjacent non-W characters is either RB or BR. If any pair is not, return NO.\n\nThird, also handle the case where all are W (so the block is empty, which is allowed).\n\nAdditionally, for the case where the block has length 1 (a single non-W character), that's impossible because you can't have a single cell being non-W. Because any stamp affects two cells. So if there's a single non-W, it must have been set by a stamp, but that would require the adjacent cell to also be non-W. So a single non-W is impossible. So the length of the non-W block must be even? Or at least 2?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the block has length 1. For example, the string is \"R\" (n=1). Since the stamp requires two cells, you can't apply any stamp. So the only possible final string is all W. So a single R is impossible. So the length of the non-W block must be at least 2, and also even?\n\nWait, the fifth test case has a block of length 3 (BRB). So that's allowed. So the length can be odd?\n\nHmm, in the fifth test case, the block length is 3. So the length can be odd. So the length doesn't have to be even. So that's not a condition.\n\nWait, but how can a block of length 3 be formed? Let's see:\n\nThe example's fifth test case has BRB. The pairs are BR and RB. So each adjacent pair is valid. The total length is 3, which is allowed. So the length can be any as long as the adjacent pairs are valid.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The non-W characters form a single contiguous block.\n\n- Every adjacent pair in this block is either RB or BR.\n\n- The block length is at least 1? No, because a block of length 1 is impossible. So the block length must be at least 2? Or can it be zero (all W's)?\n\nWait, if the block length is zero (all W's), that's allowed (return YES). If the block length is 1, it's impossible (return NO). So the code must also check that the block length is either zero or at least 2, and that the pairs are valid.\n\nWait, but the block length can be 1 only if all are W except one, which is impossible. So the code must check that if the block length is 1, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck that the non-W block is contiguous.\n\nCheck that the block length is 0 \u2192 allowed.\n\nElse, check that the block length is at least 2, and all adjacent pairs are RB or BR.\n\nSo how to implement this in code?\n\nThe current code has a check function that loops through the string and tracks num1 and num2 (counts of R and B). But the current code's logic is unclear. Let's see the code again.\n\nThe code's check function:\n\nlong long check(){\n    long long num1=0,num2=0;\n    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n        if(s[i]=='R') num1++;\n        else if(s[i]=='B') num2++;\n        else if(/* TODO: Your code here */) num1=num2=0;\n        else return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nHmm, the loop goes up to i<=n, which is probably a mistake since the string is of length n. But maybe the code added a 'W' at the end (since in main, s = s + 'W'). So the loop is from 0 to n (inclusive), which is n+1 characters. The 'W' is added to the end, perhaps to handle the end of the string.\n\nThe current code's check function is trying to track the counts of R and B, but the logic is incomplete. The TODO is for the else if condition for when the character is W. The current code's logic is that whenever a W is encountered, it resets num1 and num2 to zero. But why?\n\nPerhaps the idea is to track the current run of non-W characters. Let me think: the code is trying to ensure that the non-W characters form a contiguous block. So whenever a W is encountered after some non-W characters, it resets the counters, but if there were previous non-W characters, that would mean the block is broken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the difference between R and B counts as you go along, ensuring that they alternate properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the current run of non-W characters and ensure that the counts of R and B are balanced in some way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the start and end indices of the non-W block. Then check that between start and end, every adjacent pair is RB or BR.\n\nSo steps for code:\n\n1. Find the first and last occurrence of non-W characters. Let start be the first index where s[i] is not W. Let end be the last such index. If there are no non-W characters, return YES.\n\n2. If there are non-W characters, check that between start and end, all characters are non-W. (i.e., the block is contiguous).\n\n3. Check that the length of the block (end - start + 1) is at least 2.\n\n4. Check that every pair of consecutive characters in the block is either RB or BR.\n\nIf all these are true, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this in the given code?\n\nThe current code's check function is supposed to return 1 if valid. Let's see how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the check function can be rewritten to do these steps.\n\nBut given the existing code structure, perhaps the current check function can be modified to track the necessary conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's current structure. The code in main appends a 'W' to the string s. So s now has n+1 characters, with the last being W. The check function loops from i=0 to n (inclusive). \n\nThe current code's check function is trying to track the counts of R and B, but perhaps the idea is to track the difference between R and B counts as you go along, ensuring that they alternate properly.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the difference between the number of R and B must alternate between +1 and -1 as you move along the string. Because each stamp adds one R and one B, but their order can be chosen. So the difference between R and B can be +1 or -1, but must alternate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between R and B must be zero at the end, but that's not the case in the example.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to track the current state of the difference between R and B counts. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we process the string from left to right. Whenever we encounter a non-W character, we need to ensure that it can be part of a valid sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: the sequence of non-W characters must form a string where every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. So the entire non-W block must be a sequence of alternating R and B, but can start with either R or B.\n\nWait, for example, the fifth test case's BRB is B followed by R followed by B. The pairs are BR and RB, which are both allowed. So the sequence is allowed.\n\nAnother example: RBR is allowed (RB and BR).\n\nA sequence like RBRB is allowed.\n\nA sequence like RBB would have the second and third as BB, which is invalid.\n\nSo the non-W block must be a sequence where each adjacent pair is either RB or BR.\n\nSo the code can check this by iterating through the non-W block and checking each pair.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the start and end indices of the non-W block.\n\n- If the block is empty: return YES.\n\n- Else, if the block length is 1: return NO.\n\n- Else, check that every consecutive pair in the block is either RB or BR.\n\n- Also, check that the entire block is contiguous (no W in between).\n\nSo how to implement this in the given code?\n\nThe current code's check function is inside a loop that goes through the entire string (including the added W). Let me think of how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the check function can be rewritten as follows:\n\nIn the check function:\n\n- Find the first and last non-W characters.\n\n- Check if they exist (i.e., the block is non-empty):\n\n   - If the block length is 1 \u2192 return 0.\n\n   - Check that between first and last, all characters are non-W.\n\n   - Check each consecutive pair in the block.\n\n- Else, return 1 (all W).\n\nBut how to implement this in the current code's structure?\n\nAlternatively, the current code's check function can be modified to track the start and end of the non-W block, and check the pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured as follows:\n\nIn the check function:\n\nInitialize variables to track the start and end indices.\n\nLoop through the string s (including the added W):\n\n   For each character:\n\n      if it's non-W:\n\n          if it's the first non-W encountered, set start = current index.\n\n          set end = current index.\n\n      else:\n\n          if we are in the middle of a non-W block (i.e., start is set but end hasn't been finalized yet), then check if the previous characters were contiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to first find the start and end indices.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nlong long check() {\n\n    int start = -1, end = -1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // since s is now length n+1, but the original string is n characters, but the added W is at position n.\n\n        if (s[i] != 'W') {\n\n            if (start == -1) start = i;\n\n            end = i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Now, if start is -1, then all are W \u2192 return 1.\n\n    if (start == -1) return 1;\n\n    // Check that the block is contiguous.\n\n    for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == 'W') return 0; // there's a W in the block \u2192 not contiguous.\n\n    }\n\n    // Check the length is at least 2.\n\n    if (end - start + 1 < 2) return 0;\n\n    // Check each consecutive pair.\n\n    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {\n\n        char a = s[i], b = s[i+1];\n\n        if ( (a == 'R' && b == 'B') || (a == 'B' && b == 'R') ) continue;\n\n        else return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nBut the current code's check function is written in a different way. The existing code's check function loops up to i <=n (since s has been extended with a 'W'). So perhaps the code can be adapted to this approach.\n\nBut the current code's check function is inside a function that is called for each test case, and the variables are declared as global. So perhaps the code can be modified to implement this logic.\n\nAlternatively, the current code's check function can be rewritten to do this.\n\nBut given the current code's structure, perhaps the check function can be modified as follows:\n\nThe current code's check function uses num1 and num2, but perhaps the correct approach is to track the previous character and ensure that each new character forms a valid pair.\n\nWait, let's think of another approach. Let's process the string and track the previous character. Whenever we encounter a non-W character, we need to ensure that it forms a valid pair with the previous non-W character (if any).\n\nBut also, we need to ensure that the non-W characters are contiguous.\n\nSo here's an alternative approach:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\n- prev_char = 'W'\n\n- in_block = false\n\n- first = true\n\nLoop through each character in s (including the added W):\n\n   if current_char is 'W':\n\n      if in_block is true:\n\n          // we are leaving the block, so check if this is the first time.\n\n          // but after the block, there should be no more non-W.\n\n          // but since we added a W at the end, the loop will end.\n\n          // but need to ensure that after the block, there are no more non-W.\n\n          // perhaps this is handled by the loop.\n\n      in_block = false\n\n   else:\n\n      if not in_block:\n\n          // starting a new block.\n\n          if first is false: // already had a block before \u2192 multiple blocks \u2192 invalid.\n\n              return 0;\n\n          in_block = true;\n\n          prev_char = current_char;\n\n          first = false;\n\n      else:\n\n          // check that current_char and prev_char form a valid pair.\n\n          if ( (prev_char == 'R' && current_char == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && current_char == 'R') ) {\n\n              prev_char = current_char;\n\n          } else {\n\n              return 0;\n\n          }\n\n   // Also, after the loop, check that the block length is at least 2.\n\nWait, but this approach may not track the entire block's contiguity. Because the 'W's between non-W characters would break the block.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach can work:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\n- has_started = false\n\n- prev = 'W'\n\n- count = 0\n\nLoop through each character in s (including the added W):\n\n   if current_char is 'W':\n\n      if has_started:\n\n          // after the block, we can't have any more non-W.\n\n          // but since we added a W at the end, this is okay.\n\n          // but need to ensure that after the block, there are no more non-W.\n\n          // but the loop will continue, so any non-W after would trigger a return 0.\n\n          has_started = false;\n\n      continue;\n\n   else:\n\n      if not has_started:\n\n          // starting a new block.\n\n          if count > 0: // already had a block \u2192 multiple blocks \u2192 invalid.\n\n              return 0;\n\n          has_started = true;\n\n          prev = current_char;\n\n          count = 1;\n\n      else:\n\n          // check with previous character.\n\n          if ( (prev == 'R' && current_char == 'B') || (prev == 'B' && current_char == 'R') ) {\n\n              prev = current_char;\n\n              count++;\n\n          } else {\n\n              return 0;\n\n          }\n\nAfter the loop:\n\nif count == 0 \u2192 all W \u2192 return 1.\n\nelse if count < 2 \u2192 return 0.\n\nelse \u2192 return 1.\n\nWait, but this approach may not account for the contiguity of the block. Because the 'W's between non-W characters would break the block. For example, if the string is \"BRWBR\", then the first BR is processed, then a W is encountered (has_started is true, so it sets has_started to false. Then the next B would start a new block, which would trigger the count>0 condition and return 0.\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nSo this approach would:\n\n- Ensure that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block (because any W between non-W would split into two blocks, which is detected by the count>0 check).\n\n- Ensure that each consecutive pair is valid.\n\n- Ensure that the block length is at least 2.\n\nSo this seems promising.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the current code's check function.\n\nThe current code's check function has variables num1 and num2, but perhaps we can replace that with the above logic.\n\nLet me try to write the check function accordingly.\n\nThe check function would need to loop through the string s (which has been extended with a 'W' in main).\n\nThe variables needed are:\n\n- has_started: whether we are in a non-W block.\n\n- prev_char: the previous non-W character.\n\n- count: the length of the current block.\n\n- count_blocks: the number of blocks encountered (should be 0 or 1).\n\nWait, but the count_blocks can be tracked via the 'count' variable. Let's see:\n\nInitialize:\n\nhas_started = false;\n\nprev_char = 'W';\n\ncount = 0;\n\nblocks = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <=n; i++) { // since s is now length n+1.\n\n    char c = s[i];\n\n    if (c == 'W') {\n\n        if (has_started) {\n\n            // end of block.\n\n            has_started = false;\n\n            blocks++;\n\n        }\n\n        continue;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (!has_started) {\n\n            // new block starts.\n\n            if (blocks > 0) {\n\n                // already had a block \u2192 multiple blocks \u2192 invalid.\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n            has_started = true;\n\n            prev_char = c;\n\n            count = 1;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // check with previous character.\n\n            if ( (prev_char == 'R' && c == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && c == 'R') ) {\n\n                prev_char = c;\n\n                count++;\n\n            } else {\n\n                return 0;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// After loop:\n\nif (blocks == 0) {\n\n    // all W \u2192 return 1.\n\n    return 1;\n\n} else {\n\n    // check count >=2.\n\n    if (count < 2) return 0;\n\n    return 1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the 'blocks' variable is incremented when a block ends (when a W is encountered after a block). However, the last character is a W added in main, so the final block will be ended, so blocks will be 1 if there was a single block.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the original string is \"BRB\" (n=3). The s becomes \"BRBW\".\n\nLoop through i from 0 to 3 (since n is 3, the added W is at index 3).\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: 'B' \u2192 new block starts. blocks is 0 \u2192 okay. count=1.\n\ni=1: 'R' \u2192 check with B \u2192 valid. count becomes 2.\n\ni=2: 'B' \u2192 check with R \u2192 valid. count becomes 3.\n\ni=3: 'W' \u2192 ends the block. has_started is true \u2192 set to false, blocks becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nThen, since blocks is 1 (which is okay), and count is 3 (>=2 \u2192 return 1.\n\nAnother example: \"R\" (n=1). s becomes \"RW\".\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0: 'R' \u2192 new block. blocks is 0 \u2192 okay. count=1.\n\ni=1: 'W' \u2192 ends block. blocks becomes 1.\n\nAfter loop: count is 1 \u2192 <2 \u2192 return 0.\n\nAnother example: \"BRWBR\" \u2192 the added W makes it \"BRWBRW\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: B \u2192 new block. count=1.\n\ni=1: R \u2192 valid. count=2.\n\ni=2: W \u2192 ends block. blocks becomes 1.\n\ni=3: B \u2192 new block. But blocks was 1 \u2192 returns 0.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother example: \"BRB\" \u2192 works.\n\nAnother example: \"BB\" \u2192 the first two are B and B \u2192 invalid pair. So during processing:\n\ni=0: B \u2192 new block. count=1.\n\ni=1: B \u2192 check with previous B \u2192 invalid \u2192 return 0.\n\nSo this works.\n\nSo this logic should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in the current code's check function.\n\nThe current code's check function has variables num1 and num2, but we can replace that with the variables needed for this logic.\n\nThe code's check function is inside a function that has access to the global variables n and s (since they are declared globally).\n\nSo the code for check would be:\n\nlong long check(){\n\n    bool has_started = false;\n\n    char prev_char = 'W';\n\n    int count = 0;\n\n    int blocks = 0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i <=n; i++){\n\n        char c = s[i];\n\n        if(c == 'W'){\n\n            if(has_started){\n\n                has_started = false;\n\n                blocks++;\n\n            }\n\n            continue;\n\n        }\n\n        else{\n\n            if(!has_started){\n\n                if(blocks >0){\n\n                    return 0;\n\n                }\n\n                has_started = true;\n\n                prev_char = c;\n\n                count =1;\n\n            }\n\n            else{\n\n                if( (prev_char == 'R' && c == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && c == 'R') ){\n\n                    prev_char = c;\n\n                    count++;\n\n                }\n\n                else{\n\n                    return 0;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if(blocks ==0){\n\n        return 1;\n\n    }\n\n    else{\n\n        if(count <2) return 0;\n\n        else return 1;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the 'blocks' variable is incremented when a block ends. The final block is ended by the added W. So the number of blocks should be exactly 1 if there was a single block. Because the added W ensures that any block is properly ended.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the original string has a single block, then after processing, the blocks variable will be 1 (because the block is ended by the added W).\n\nIf there are no blocks (all W), then blocks remains 0 \u2192 returns 1.\n\nIf there are two blocks, then during processing, when the first block ends (due to a W in the middle), blocks becomes 1. Then when the second block starts, the 'blocks>0' condition is triggered, returning 0.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, the code's check function can be replaced with this logic.\n\nBut in the current code's check function, the loop is from i=0 to n (since s has been extended with a 'W' in main).\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, the original code's check function had a loop that went up to i<=n, which is correct now.\n\nSo the missing code in the original problem's code is the implementation of the check function as above.\n\nThe original code's check function had a loop with an incomplete condition for the W case. The user's code had:\n\nelse if(/* TODO: Your code here */) num1=num2=0;\n\nBut that approach was incorrect. So the correct code is the one I outlined above.\n\nSo the missing code is the entire check function rewritten as above.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The original code's check function is incomplete, so the user needs to replace the entire check function with the correct one.\n\nThe original code's check function is:\n\nlong long check(){\n    long long num1=0,num2=0;\n    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\n        if(s[i]=='R') num1++;\n        else if(s[i]=='B') num2++;\n        else if(/* TODO: Your code here */) num1=num2=0;\n        else return 0;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n\nThe correct code for the check function is the one I wrote above. So the missing code is the entire body of the check function, replacing the existing code.\n\nThus, the correct code for the check function is as follows:\n\nlong long check(){\n    bool has_started = false;\n    char prev_char = 'W';\n    int count = 0;\n    int blocks = 0;\n    for(int i=0; i <=n; i++){\n        char c = s[i];\n        if(c == 'W'){\n            if(has_started){\n                has_started = false;\n                blocks++;\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n        else{\n            if(!has_started){\n                if(blocks >0){\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                has_started = true;\n                prev_char = c;\n                count =1;\n            }\n            else{\n                if( (prev_char == 'R' && c == 'B') || (prev_char == 'B' && c == 'R') ){\n                    prev_char = c;\n                    count++;\n                }\n                else{\n                    return 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if(blocks ==0){\n        return 1;\n    }\n    else{\n        if(count <2) return 0;\n        else return 1;\n    }\n}\n\nSo this is the code that should replace the original check function."
