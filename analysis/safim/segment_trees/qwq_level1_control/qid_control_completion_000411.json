The problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through certain operations with a pointer. The pointer starts at the first element, and we can perform two types of operations any number of times. The key points are:\n\n1. Operation 1: If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next. 2. Operation 2: If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n3. After all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element. Hmm, the main thing is to find conditions that the array must satisfy for it to be possible. Let's think about the constraints. First, the sum of all elements must be zero? Because every operation either increases one element and moves right, or decreases and moves left. Wait, each operation 1 adds +1 to an element and moves right.",

Yes: do nothing. The pointer is already at 0. Another test case: array [ -1, 1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative sums after first element: -1 \u2192 which is negative. So this would be invalid. Indeed, can this array be formed? Suppose trying to get a[0] = -1 and a[1] =1. To get a[0] =-1, you must have done op2 at position 0. But you can't do op2 on the first element (position 0). So it's impossible. So the array is invalid, which matches the condition that the first cumulative sum is negative. So this seems to hold. Another test case: array [3, -2, -1].

Wait, but in this case n is 3. Wait, the array is [3, -2, -1].

So after three op1s, you can't do that. Hmm, maybe this example is not possible. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the steps again. Wait, let's try to construct the array [3, -2, -1]. We need a[0] =3, a[1]=-2, a[2]=-1. Let me see:\n\nStart at 0.",

The path must start at 0 and end at 0, never going below 0. The a[i] is the number of times you did op1 at i minus the number of times you did op2 at i. The total number of op1 steps must equal the number of op2 steps. The path's steps must form a walk that never goes below zero. The a array must be such that the walk can be constructed. Let me think of the a array as the difference between the number of right steps and left steps at each position.",

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note example: The second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The cumulative sums from the start are 2, 1, 0, 0. The cumulative sums from the end (starting from the last element) are 0, -1, -2, 0. Wait, perhaps the array must also satisfy that the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive? In the example, the cumulative from the end for the first three elements are 0, -1, -2, which are non-positive. In the previous problematic example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative from the end would be: Starting from the end:\n\na[2] =-1 \u2192 cumulative is -1 (okay).\n\na[1] + a[2] =-3 (okay). a[0]+a[1]+a[2] =0 (okay). So that condition holds, but the array is not possible. Hmm, so that's not sufficient. Another idea: Let me think of the path's maximum position. The maximum position reached must be such that the array's elements can be formed. Alternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i, a[i] must be even? Or have some parity condition.

The cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. Wait, let me test this with the previous example [3, -2, -1]. Cumulative from start: 3, 1, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. Cumulative from end (starting from the end):\n\na[2] =-1 \u2192 cumulative is -1 (non-positive).\n\na[1] + a[2] =-3 \u2192 non -positive. a[0]+a[1]+a[2] =0 \u2192 okay. So conditions 2 and 3 are met, but the array is not possible. Hmm, so that's not sufficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the example [3, -2, -1]. Is it possible to form this array? Let me try to see:\n\nWe need a[0] =3, a[1]=-2, a[2]=-1. The pointer starts at 0. To get a[0] =3, you must have done 3 op1 steps at position 0. But each op1 moves to the next position. So first op1: a[0] becomes 1, move to 1. Second op1: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. Third op1: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=3, so can't do that. So this is impossible. Thus, the array is invalid. So the problem is that the cumulative sum from the start up to position 0 is 3, but the path can't reach beyond the array. Ah! So the cumulative sum up to position i must not exceed (n - i -1) ? Or something like that. Wait, perhaps the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) ? Wait, let me think of the maximum possible steps you can take to the right from position i.",

Hmm, so what's the correct condition? The problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. The current code's logic is that after the sum reaches zero, the remaining elements must be zero. This ensures that the path returns to zero and stays there. Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum must reach zero exactly at the last element. Wait, let me think:\n\nThe path must end at position 0. The cumulative sum of the array up to the last element must be zero. But also, the path must return to zero at the end. The current code's logic requires that after the sum reaches zero, all subsequent elements are zero. This would ensure that the path doesn't move away from zero after reaching it. This would mean that the path must return to zero and stay there until the end.",

So this is not correct. Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for the correct approach. The problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. The path must start and end at 0. The array's elements are the difference between the number of op1 and op2 at each position. The path must form a closed walk that never goes below zero. The key is to model the path's constraints. The correct conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum is zero. 2. The cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative. 3. The cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. These two conditions ensure that the path never goes below zero and never goes above the maximum possible. Wait, let me see the second test case's array [2, -1, -1, 0]. The cumulative from the start is 2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. The cumulative from the end is 0, -1, -2, 0 \u2192 all non-positive. So this satisfies the conditions. The first test case's array (which is invalid) must violate one of these conditions. For example, if the array is [1, -1], the cumulative from the end is 0, -1 \u2192 non-positive.",

Sum is 1 \u2192 invalid. Hmm, I'm not sure. But according to the code's logic, the conditions are:\n\n- Sum is zero. - The cumulative sum never goes negative. - After the cumulative sum reaches zero, all remaining elements are zero. These conditions ensure that the path returns to zero and stays there until the end. Thus, the pointer must be at position 0 at the end. Therefore, the code's current logic is correct. The first test case's array must violate one of these conditions. Perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. Sum is 1 \u2192 invalid.",

For example, array [2, -1, -1, 1]. Sum is 1 \u2192 invalid. Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should proceed with the code's current logic and see what the missing condition is. The code has a loop where for each a in the array:\n\nsum += a \n\nThen, there is a condition: if(/* TODO: Your code here */) valid = false;\n\nThe current code also has:\n\nif(zeroed && a ! =0) valid = false;\n\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\nThe missing condition is likely to check that the cumulative sum never goes negative. So the first condition is: if the current sum is negative, then it's invalid. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false; So the code would be:\n\nfor each element a:\n\nsum += a;\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nif(zeroed && a ! =0) valid = false;\n\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\nThis way, the cumulative sum must never be negative. The other condition is that after the sum reaches zero, all remaining elements must be zero. This is handled by the 'zeroed' flag. Thus, the missing code is checking that the cumulative sum is non-negative. So the code should have:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nThus, the missing line is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nThis would ensure that the cumulative sum never goes below zero. The other conditions are handled by the existing code. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nSo the complete code would have:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    int a = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a;\n\n    if(sum <0) valid = false;\n\n    if(zeroed && a ! =0) valid = false;\n\n    if(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\n}\n\nThis way, the conditions are:\n\n- The cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\n- After reaching zero, all remaining elements must be zero. - The total sum is zero. This should be correct. Testing with the second test case's array [2, -1, -1, 0]:\n\nThe cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. All are non-negative. After the third element (sum 0), the fourth element is zero. Thus, valid remains true.",

Additionally, the total sum must be zero. Wait, let's see the example [3, -2, -1]. The cumulative from the end for position 0 is the sum of all elements, which is zero \u2192 okay. For position 1: a[0]+a[1] =1 \u2192 which is positive, but the cumulative from the end up to position 1 is (a[0]+a[1]) \u2192 but the cumulative from the end would be a[0]+a[1] + a[2] =0, but the cumulative from the end up to position 1 would be a[0]+a[1] =1, which is positive, violating the condition. Wait, perhaps the cumulative from the end is computed as follows: For each position i, the cumulative from the end up to i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. So for the example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative from the end for position 0 is 3 + (-2) + (-1) =0 \u2192 okay. For position 1: (-2) + (-1) =-3 \u2192 okay. For position 2: -1 \u2192 okay. So the cumulative from the end for each position is non-positive. But the cumulative from the start for position 0 is 3, which is okay. But the array is invalid. Hmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. Perhaps there's another condition. Wait, let me think of the path's maximum position. In the example [3, -2, -1], the maximum position would have to be 2 (since n=3). But to get a[0] =3, you have to move right three times from position 0, but that would require moving to position 1, then 2, then 3 (which is beyond the array). So it's impossible. Ah! So the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through certain operations with a pointer. The pointer starts at the first element, and we can perform two types of operations any number of times. The key points are:\n\n1. Operation 1: If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next.\n2. Operation 2: If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n3. After all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm, the main thing is to find conditions that the array must satisfy for it to be possible. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nFirst, the sum of all elements must be zero? Because every operation either increases one element and moves right, or decreases and moves left. Wait, each operation 1 adds +1 to an element and moves right. Each operation 2 subtracts 1 and moves left. But each operation's effect on the sum: operation 1 adds 1, operation 2 subtracts 1. However, the total sum would depend on the number of each operation. Wait, but the initial array is all zeros. So the total sum after all operations must be equal to (number of op1) - (number of op2). But since the pointer must end at the first element, maybe there's some relation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the array that must hold. Let's think of the path the pointer takes. Each time you do an operation 1, you move right, and each time you do operation 2, you move left. The pointer starts at position 0 and must end at 0. So the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. But each operation 1 moves right once, and each operation 2 moves left once. So the total right steps (from op1) minus left steps (from op2) must be zero? Wait, no. Because each op1 is a right move, and each op2 is a left move. The net displacement must be zero. So the total number of right moves (from op1) minus left moves (from op2) must equal zero. Because starting at 0, ending at 0.\n\nBut each op1 contributes +1 to the displacement (since moving right), and each op2 contributes -1 (moving left). So total displacement is (number of op1) - (number of op2) = 0. So the number of op1 must equal the number of op2. But how does that relate to the array?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the array's elements have to satisfy certain conditions. Let's think of the process as a path. The pointer's movement can be thought of as a sequence of steps. Each time you do an op1, you go right, and each op2, you go left. The path must start and end at 0, so the total steps must form a balanced walk.\n\nBut how does the array's values come into play? Each time you perform an op1 on position i, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. Each op2 on position i (current) subtracts 1 from a[i], then move to i-1.\n\nWait, the array's elements are the sum of all the times you've done op1 on that position minus the times you've done op2 on that position. Because each op1 on i adds +1, each op2 on i subtracts 1. So for each position i, a[i] = (number of op1 at i) - (number of op2 at i).\n\nBut how do the operations' sequences affect this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the process as a path. The pointer's position changes over time. Let's think of the path as a sequence of positions. Each step is either +1 (op1) or -1 (op2), except that you can't go beyond the array's bounds.\n\nBut the key is that the array's elements are determined by how many times each position was \"visited\" in a certain way. For example, every time you pass through a position moving right (op1), you might be adding to it, but when moving left (op2), subtracting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences between consecutive elements must satisfy some condition. Let me think of the array as a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\nSuppose we model the process as a series of moves. Let's think of the path of the pointer. The path starts at 0 and ends at 0. Each step is either +1 or -1, but can't go beyond 0 or n-1 (assuming 0-based indices). \n\nWait, but the operations are constrained by the current position. For example, you can't do op1 if you're at the last element, and can't do op2 if at first.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required conditions on the array. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me consider the differences between consecutive elements. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Let's think of the path of the pointer. Each time you move right (op1), you are at position i, then move to i+1. Each time you move left (op2), you are at position i, then move to i-1.\n\nThe total number of times you move right must equal the total number of times you move left, because you start and end at 0. So the total displacement is zero.\n\nNow, for each position i (except the first and last?), the number of times you enter it from the left (i-1) must equal the number of times you exit to the right (i+1) plus the number of times you do an op2 there (since op2 would subtract and then move left). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array's elements in terms of the path. Let me think of the net effect on each a[i]. Each time you are at position i and perform an op1, you add 1 to a[i], then move right. Each time you are at i and perform an op2, you subtract 1 from a[i], then move left.\n\nThe total a[i] is equal to (number of times you did op1 at i) minus (number of times you did op2 at i).\n\nNow, the path starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let's model the path as a sequence of steps. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions, starting at 0 and ending at 0. Each step is either +1 or -1, but can't go beyond the array's boundaries.\n\nThe key is to find the conditions on the a array such that there exists such a path where the a[i] values are exactly the counts (op1 - op2) for each position.\n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nLet me consider the differences between consecutive elements. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we have the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Let me consider the differences between a[i] and a[i+1], but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a walk. Let me model the required conditions.\n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me denote the number of times we are at position i and perform an op1 as x_i, and the number of times we perform op2 at i as y_i. Then, a[i] = x_i - y_i.\n\nThe total number of steps is the sum of all x_i and y_i, but each step is either an op1 or op2. However, the path must start at 0 and end at 0.\n\nThe movement constraints must be such that the path is valid. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let me model the path as a series of steps, and track the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nThe key idea is that the array must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The sum of all elements must be zero. Because each op1 adds +1 to the total sum, each op2 subtracts 1. The total sum is (total op1) - (total op2). But since the number of op1 must equal the number of op2 (since the net displacement is zero), then (op1 - op2) = 0 \u2192 sum must be zero. Wait, no. Wait, the total displacement is (op1 - op2) steps to the right. Since we start and end at 0, the total displacement must be zero. So op1 - op2 = 0 \u2192 op1 = op2. Therefore, the total sum of the array is (sum (x_i - y_i)) = (sum x_i) - (sum y_i) = (op1) - (op2) = 0. So the sum must be zero. So that's one condition.\n\nSo first condition: sum of all a_i must be zero. The code already checks this, because in the code, after the loop, it checks if sum ==0. So that's covered.\n\nBut there must be more conditions. Because in the sample input given in the problem's note, the first test case's array might have sum zero but still not be possible because the pointer wasn't at first. Wait, but the problem requires that after all operations, the pointer is back at first. So the sum must be zero, but there are other constraints.\n\nAnother condition: Let's think of the path. The path must be such that whenever you do an op2 (move left), you can't go beyond the first element. So the path can't go left from position 0. But how does that affect the array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the cumulative sum up to i (starting from the first element) must be non-negative? Or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the path as a walk starting at 0, ending at 0, with steps +1 and -1, but never going beyond 0 or n-1 (since you can't go beyond the array). Wait, but the array's elements are determined by how many times you did op1 and op2 at each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the partial sums (from left to right) have certain properties. Let me think of the following approach inspired by the \"Catalan number\" path constraints.\n\nSuppose we model the path as a sequence of steps. Let me think of the path as a walk where each step is +1 (right) or -1 (left). The walk starts and ends at 0, and never goes below 0 or above n-1. But how does this relate to the array?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array's elements in terms of the number of times you passed through each position in a certain direction. For example, the difference between the number of times you moved right from position i and left from position i+1 might relate to a[i].\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: Let's consider the differences between consecutive elements. Let me think of the array as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Let me define d_i = a_i - a_{i+1} for i from 1 to n-1. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the required conditions for the array. Let me consider the following:\n\nSuppose we traverse the array from left to right. Let me track the \"balance\" of steps. Let me think of the path as a series of moves. Each time you move right (op1), you are increasing the current a[i], then moving to the next. Each time you move left (op2), you are decreasing the current a[i], then moving back.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the array must be such that when you process it from left to right, the cumulative \"required\" steps can be satisfied without going negative.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me define for each position i, the required number of times we have to move right from i (op1) and left from i (op2). But how?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me model the required conditions on the array's elements.\n\nSuppose that the path starts at 0. Let me consider the number of times we pass through each position. Let me think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times we did op1 and op2 at each position.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: Let me consider the path as a sequence of steps. Let me track the current position and the required a[i] values. Let me think of the process as building the array step by step.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me define for each position i, the number of times we have to be at that position and perform an op1 (x_i) and op2 (y_i). Then, a[i] = x_i - y_i.\n\nThe total number of op1 steps is the sum of x_i for all i except the last (since you can't do op1 on the last element). Similarly, the total op2 steps is the sum of y_i for all i except the first (since you can't do op2 on first element? Wait, no. Wait, op2 can be done on any position except the first? Wait, the problem says for op2: if the pointer is not on the first element. So you can do op2 on any position except the first. So y_1 can be zero, but y_i for i >=2 can be non-zero.\n\nWait, the pointer can be on position 1 and do op2, moving to 0. So y_1 can be done, but only if the pointer is on position 1. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the path as a walk and find that the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to each point must be non-negative, or something similar.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note example. Let me think of the array as needing to have certain parity or cumulative conditions.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me track a variable called \"balance\". The balance starts at 0. For each element a[i], the balance must be >=0, and the way the balance changes depends on the a[i].\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Each time you go right (op1), you add 1 to the current a[i], then move to the next. Each time you go left (op2), subtract 1 from current a[i], then move to previous.\n\nThe total a[i] is the number of times you did op1 at i minus the number of times you did op2 at i.\n\nNow, the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. Let me model the path as a sequence of moves. Let me think of the path as a series of steps, and for each position, the number of times you entered and exited.\n\nAlternatively, here's a key insight from similar problems: The array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative, and the total sum is zero. Wait, but that might not be exactly it.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of the path's height. Let me model the path as a walk where each step is +1 (right) or -1 (left). The walk starts and ends at 0, and never goes below 0 (since you can't go left from position 0). Wait, but you can go left from position 1 to 0, so the walk can reach 0 again. Hmm, but the walk can go to 0 multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the partial sums from the start to each position must be non-negative. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which is the current position of the pointer. The path starts at 0. Let me think of the required a[i] as the difference between the number of times we moved right from i and left from i+1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's note example:\n\nLooking at the second test case example given in the problem's note:\n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's see how the path works:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nStart at 0 (position 0).\n\nThen op1 (move to 1, a[0] becomes 1).\n\nThen op2 (move back to 0, a[1] becomes -1).\n\nThen op1 again (move to 1, a[0] becomes 2, then move to 1 again? Wait, the example's steps are a bit more involved. But the key is that the array's elements must allow the path to return to 0.\n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the required conditions as follows:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all positions i from 1 to n-1, the cumulative sum up to i (starting from the first element) must be non-negative. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but something similar.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me track the \"balance\" as I go through the array from left to right. The balance starts at 0. For each element a[i], the balance must be >=0, and the way it changes is:\n\nbalance += a[i] \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, here's an idea from similar problems (like the \"valid parentheses\" problem or the \"array formation\" problem):\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable called 'current' which represents the number of steps we have to take to the right. \n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of times we have to move right in the future. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. Let me model the path as a series of moves. Each time you move right (op1), you are effectively \"adding\" to the current position's a value, and moving forward. Each time you move left (op2), you subtract from the current a and move back.\n\nThe key is that whenever you are at position i, you can only move left if you have previously moved right into it. So the number of times you can move left from i must be less than or equal to the number of times you have moved right into it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative, and the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. We process the array from left to right. For each element a[i], the balance is updated as follows:\n\nbalance += a[i]\n\nBut this must always be >=0. Wait, maybe not exactly, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me imagine that each time you move right (op1), you are contributing +1 to the current a[i], and moving to the next. Each time you move left (op2), you subtract 1 from a[i], and move back.\n\nThe total a[i] is the number of times you did op1 at i minus the number of times you did op2 at i.\n\nNow, the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions on the a array.\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me track the number of times we have to move left in the future. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's note example:\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be even? Or perhaps the parity must be even?\n\nAlternatively, here's a key insight:\n\nThe required conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum of the array must be zero.\n\n2. For all positions i from 1 to n, the cumulative sum of the first i elements must be non-negative. Wait, maybe not exactly, but something similar.\n\nWait, let me think of the path as a walk where each step is +1 (right) or -1 (left). The walk starts and ends at 0, and never goes below 0 (since you can't go left from position 0). Wait, but you can go to position 0 again. So the walk can touch 0 multiple times, but can't go below 0.\n\nWait, the walk must never go below 0. Because you can't move left from position 0. So the path must be such that the walk never goes below 0. So the minimal y-coordinate is 0.\n\nIn such a case, the array's elements must satisfy certain conditions. Let me think of the walk's path and how the a[i] values are determined.\n\nThe a[i] is the number of times you did op1 at i minus the number of times you did op2 at i. \n\nEach time you are at position i and do an op1, you move to i+1. Each time you do an op2, you move to i-1.\n\nThe total number of times you move right (op1) must equal the number of times you move left (op2), since you start and end at 0.\n\nNow, the walk must never go below 0. So the path must be a Dyck path (a path that never goes below the starting point and returns to it). \n\nWait, but Dyck paths are balanced parentheses, but here the path can go up and down as long as it doesn't go below zero. \n\nIn such a case, the array's elements must satisfy that the partial sums (from the start) must be non-negative. Wait, perhaps the partial sums of the array's elements must be non-negative?\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nLet me define the \"balance\" as the current position. The path starts at 0. Each op1 increases the current position by 1 (since moving right), and each op2 decreases it by 1 (moving left). \n\nThe balance must never be less than 0. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nThe a[i] is the number of times you were at position i and did an op1 minus the number of times you did an op2 there. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[1] to a[i] must be non-negative? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note example:\n\nLet me think of the array's elements in terms of the path's steps. Let me consider the difference between consecutive elements. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of steps. Let me think of the a array as the difference between the number of right steps and left steps at each position. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me track the required \"balance\" as I process the array from left to right. \n\nInitialize balance = 0.\n\nFor each element a[i] in the array (starting from the first):\n\nbalance += a[i]\n\nWait, but how does this relate to the path?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible condition:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be even? Or perhaps the cumulative sum must be non-negative?\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0, and never go below 0. \n\nThe number of times you are at position i and do an op1 is x_i, and the number of times you do op2 at i is y_i. \n\nThe a[i] = x_i - y_i.\n\nThe total number of op1 steps is the sum of x_i for all i except the last (since you can't do op1 on the last element). \n\nThe total number of op2 steps is the sum of y_i for all i except the first (since you can't do op2 on the first element). \n\nThe total displacement is (sum x_i) - (sum y_i) = 0 \u2192 sum (x_i - y_i) = 0 \u2192 sum a[i] =0, which is already covered.\n\nNow, the path must form a walk that never goes below 0. \n\nLet me model the walk as follows:\n\nLet me think of the walk's position after each step. Let me denote the path as a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m where p_0 =0 and p_m=0. \n\nEach step is either +1 or -1. \n\nThe walk must never go below 0. \n\nNow, the a[i] is the number of times the step was +1 at position i minus the number of times it was -1 at position i. \n\nWait, perhaps the a[i] must be such that the cumulative sum up to position i is non-negative?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the reflection principle in combinatorics:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n, the sum of the first i elements must be non-negative, and the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2 (from the note):\n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are:\n\nAfter first element: 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nAfter second: 2-1=1 \u2192 okay.\n\nAfter third: 0 \u2192 okay.\n\nAfter fourth: 0 \u2192 okay.\n\nSo all cumulative sums are non-negative. \n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [1, -1]. The cumulative sums are 1 and 0. So that's okay. But the total sum is 0. \n\nBut can this array be formed?\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo op1: move to 1, a[0] becomes 1. \n\nThen do op2: move back to 0, a[1] becomes -1. \n\nThen we are back at 0. So yes. So this array is valid. \n\nAnother test case: array [0, 0]. Sum is 0. The cumulative sums are 0 and 0. \n\nPossible? \n\nYes: do nothing. The pointer is already at 0. \n\nAnother test case: array [ -1, 1]. Sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums after first element: -1 \u2192 which is negative. So this would be invalid. \n\nIndeed, can this array be formed?\n\nSuppose trying to get a[0] = -1 and a[1] =1. \n\nTo get a[0] =-1, you must have done op2 at position 0. But you can't do op2 on the first element (position 0). So it's impossible. So the array is invalid, which matches the condition that the first cumulative sum is negative.\n\nSo this seems to hold. \n\nAnother test case: array [3, -2, -1]. \n\nCumulative sums: 3, 1, 0. All non-negative. Sum is 0. \n\nIs this possible?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo op1 three times: each time moving to next. \n\nAfter three op1s, you are at position 3 (if n is 3). Wait, but in this case n is 3. \n\nWait, the array is [3, -2, -1]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst, after three op1s on position 0, you would have a[0] =3, and moved to position 1, then 2, then 3 (but n=3, so the last element is index 2. So after three op1s, you can't do that. Hmm, maybe this example is not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the steps again. \n\nWait, let's try to construct the array [3, -2, -1].\n\nWe need a[0] =3, a[1]=-2, a[2]=-1. \n\nLet me see:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo op1 three times on position 0? But each op1 moves to the next. \n\nFirst op1: a[0] becomes 1, move to 1.\n\nSecond op1: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2.\n\nThird op1: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=3, so can't do that. So this is impossible. \n\nHmm, so maybe my previous idea is not sufficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum must be non-negative, but also other conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative sum must be non-negative, and also the cumulative sum after each step must not exceed some value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element up to the ith must be non-negative, and the total sum is zero. \n\nIn the previous example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative sums are 3, 1, 0. So they are non-negative. But the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so that suggests that the condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so maybe there's another condition. \n\nWait, let me think of the path again. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0, never going below 0. \n\nThe a[i] is the number of times you did op1 at i minus the number of times you did op2 at i. \n\nThe total number of op1 steps must equal the number of op2 steps. \n\nThe path's steps must form a walk that never goes below zero. \n\nThe a array must be such that the walk can be constructed. \n\nLet me think of the a array as the difference between the number of right steps and left steps at each position. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element up to the ith must be non-negative, and also the cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i, the cumulative sum up to i is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end (starting from the last element):\n\na[2] =-1 \u2192 cumulative is -1 (non-positive). \n\na[1] + a[2] =-3 \u2192 also non-positive. \n\na[0]+a[1]+a[2] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo that condition holds. \n\nBut the array can't be formed. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem differently. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions on the array. \n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me define for each position i, the number of times we have to move right from i (op1) as x_i, and the number of times we move left from i (op2) as y_i. \n\nThen, a[i] = x_i - y_i. \n\nThe total number of right steps (sum x_i) must equal the total number of left steps (sum y_i). \n\nThe path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed walk that never goes below 0. \n\nNow, the number of times you are at position i and move right (x_i) must be equal to the number of times you arrive at i from the left (i-1) plus the number of times you arrive at i from the right (i+1) minus the number of times you leave via left (y_i). \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note example:\n\nThe second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the start are 2, 1, 0, 0. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the end (starting from the last element) are 0, -1, -2, 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the array must also satisfy that the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive? \n\nIn the example, the cumulative from the end for the first three elements are 0, -1, -2, which are non-positive. \n\nIn the previous problematic example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative from the end would be:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\na[2] =-1 \u2192 cumulative is -1 (okay).\n\na[1] + a[2] =-3 (okay).\n\na[0]+a[1]+a[2] =0 (okay). \n\nSo that condition holds, but the array is not possible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the path's maximum position. \n\nThe maximum position reached must be such that the array's elements can be formed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that for all i, a[i] must be even? Or have some parity condition. \n\nWait, in the example [2, -1, -1, 0], the a[0] is 2 (even), a[1] is -1 (odd), a[2] is -1 (odd), a[3] is 0 (even). So that doesn't seem to fit. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum is zero.\n\n2. The cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative.\n\n3. The cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me test this with the previous example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nCumulative from start: 3, 1, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nCumulative from end (starting from the end):\n\na[2] =-1 \u2192 cumulative is -1 (non-positive).\n\na[1] + a[2] =-3 \u2192 non-positive.\n\na[0]+a[1]+a[2] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo conditions 2 and 3 are met, but the array is not possible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nIs it possible to form this array?\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nWe need a[0] =3, a[1]=-2, a[2]=-1. \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nTo get a[0] =3, you must have done 3 op1 steps at position 0. But each op1 moves to the next position. \n\nSo first op1: a[0] becomes 1, move to 1.\n\nSecond op1: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2.\n\nThird op1: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=3, so can't do that. So this is impossible. \n\nThus, the array is invalid. \n\nSo the problem is that the cumulative sum from the start up to position 0 is 3, but the path can't reach beyond the array. \n\nAh! So the cumulative sum up to position i must not exceed (n - i -1) ? Or something like that. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) ?\n\nWait, let me think of the maximum possible steps you can take to the right from position i. \n\nAt position i, you can move right only if you are not at the last position. \n\nSo the number of times you can move right from position i is limited by the remaining positions. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus some other terms. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be non-negative and also the cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive. \n\nWait, but in the example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative from the start is 3 at position 0. \n\nThe maximum possible steps you can take from position 0 is moving to position 1, then to 2, then you can't go further. So the maximum possible a[0] is 2 (since you can do two op1 steps from 0: first to 1, then to 2, but then you can't do another op1 from 2 (since it's the last position). \n\nWait, the maximum a[0] can be is the number of times you can move right from 0. Each time you move right from 0, you can do it as long as you are not at the last position. \n\nWait, the maximum possible a[0] is the number of times you can move right from 0, which is the number of times you can go to 1, then possibly come back. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are:\n\nThe cumulative sum from the start up to each position i must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end up to each position i must be non-positive. \n\nAdditionally, the total sum must be zero. \n\nWait, let's see the example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative from the end for position 0 is the sum of all elements, which is zero \u2192 okay. \n\nFor position 1: a[0]+a[1] =1 \u2192 which is positive, but the cumulative from the end up to position 1 is (a[0]+a[1]) \u2192 but the cumulative from the end would be a[0]+a[1] + a[2] =0, but the cumulative from the end up to position 1 would be a[0]+a[1] =1, which is positive, violating the condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative from the end is computed as follows: \n\nFor each position i, the cumulative from the end up to i is the sum of a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]. \n\nSo for the example [3, -2, -1], the cumulative from the end for position 0 is 3 + (-2) + (-1) =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nFor position 1: (-2) + (-1) =-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nFor position 2: -1 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo the cumulative from the end for each position is non-positive. \n\nBut the cumulative from the start for position 0 is 3, which is okay. \n\nBut the array is invalid. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nPerhaps there's another condition. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's maximum position. \n\nIn the example [3, -2, -1], the maximum position would have to be 2 (since n=3). \n\nBut to get a[0] =3, you have to move right three times from position 0, but that would require moving to position 1, then 2, then 3 (which is beyond the array). So it's impossible. \n\nAh! So the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end? \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to the remaining steps possible from that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end? \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to the maximum possible steps you can take from that position. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's note example:\n\nThe second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe differences between consecutive elements are 2-(-1)=3? No, the differences are between a[i] and a[i+1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the array must be such that the differences between consecutive elements are non-positive? \n\nIn the example, the differences are 2 to -1 (difference -3), then -1 to -1 (0), then -1 to 0 (1). So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the path as a series of moves. Each time you move right, you increase the current a[i], then move to the next. Each time you move left, you decrease the current a[i], then move back. \n\nThe total a[i] is the number of times you were at i and moved right minus the number of times you were at i and moved left. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed walk that never goes below 0. \n\nThe array's elements must be such that the walk can be constructed. \n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet me define for each position i, the number of times you arrive at i from the left (i-1) as L[i], and the number of times you arrive from the right (i+1) as R[i]. \n\nThe number of times you leave to the right (op1) is R[i] = L[i] + x_i, where x_i is the number of times you did op1 at i. \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution approach:\n\nThe array is valid if and only if:\n\n1. The total sum is zero.\n\n2. The cumulative sum from the start up to each position is non-negative.\n\n3. The cumulative sum from the end up to each position is non-positive.\n\nWait, let me test this with the example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start up to position 0 is 3 (okay).\n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 0 is 0 (okay).\n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 1 is -3 (okay).\n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 2 is -1 (okay).\n\nBut the array is invalid. \n\nHmm, so this condition is not sufficient. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are:\n\nThe cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the start up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end up to i+1? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum from the start up to position i must be less than or equal to the cumulative sum from the end up to position i+1. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0 and must end at 0. \n\nEach time you do an op1, you move right. Each op2 moves left. \n\nThe total number of op1 and op2 must be equal. \n\nThe array's elements are the difference between the number of op1 and op2 at each position. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk that never goes below 0. \n\nThe key is to model the path's constraints. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of steps: each step is +1 or -1. \n\nThe path must never go below 0. \n\nThe array's elements are determined by the number of times each position was visited and the direction of the step taken there. \n\nThe a[i] is the number of times the step was +1 (op1) at position i minus the number of times it was -1 (op2) at position i. \n\nThe total number of +1 steps equals the number of -1 steps. \n\nThe path must be such that the a array is formed. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking whether such a path exists. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of a[i] is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative for all i. \n\n3. The cumulative sum of a[i..n-1] must be non-positive for all i. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe cumulative sum from the start up to i must be non-negative because the path can't go below zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the end up to i must be non-positive because the path can't go below zero when moving backwards. \n\nWait, perhaps the third condition is that the cumulative sum from the end up to position i must be non-positive. \n\nLet me test this with the example [3, -2, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start up to position 0 is 3 (okay). \n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 0 is 0 (okay). \n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 1 is -3 (okay). \n\nThe cumulative from the end up to position 2 is -1 (okay). \n\nBut the array is invalid. \n\nHmm, so this condition is not sufficient. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are:\n\nThe cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the start up to position i must be less than or equal to the maximum possible steps you can take from that position. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to (n - i -1) plus the cumulative sum from the end up to i+1. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe array is valid if and only if:\n\n- The sum is zero.\n\n- The cumulative sum from the start up to each position is non-negative.\n\n- The cumulative sum from the end up to each position is non-positive.\n\n- Additionally, the cumulative sum from the start up to position i must be less than or equal to the cumulative sum from the end up to position i+1 plus (n - i -1). \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. \n\nBut in the example [3, -2, -1], this holds but the array is invalid. \n\nSo what's the problem with that array?\n\nThe issue is that the first element is 3, which requires that the pointer has moved right three times from position 0. But after the first op1, the pointer is at position 1. The second op1 moves to 2, and the third would require moving to 3, which is beyond the array. \n\nSo the maximum possible a[0] is 2 (since you can move to position 1 and 2, but can't go further). \n\nAh! So the cumulative sum up to position i must also not exceed the maximum possible steps you can take from that position. \n\nThe maximum possible steps you can take from position i is the number of steps you can move right from there. \n\nThe maximum possible a[i] is the number of times you can move right from i without exceeding the array's bounds. \n\nWait, but how to model this. \n\nThe maximum possible a[i] is the number of times you can move right from i, which is the number of times you can move to i+1, but each such move requires that you can come back. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to the cumulative sum from the end up to position i+1 plus (n - i -1). \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to the remaining steps possible from that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum up to position i must be less than or equal to the cumulative sum from the end up to position i+1 plus (n - i -1). \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible a[0] is the number of times you can move right from 0, which is the number of times you can move to 1, then possibly come back. \n\nThe maximum a[0] can be is the number of times you can move right from 0 and then return. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the code given. \n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe code has a loop over the elements, and for each a, it does:\n\nsum += a.\n\nThen, there is a condition: if(/* TODO: Your code here */) valid = false;\n\nThen, if(zeroed && a!=0)valid = false;\n\nif(sum==0) zeroed = true;\n\nThe code also checks if valid and sum==0 to print yes.\n\nThe current code's logic is:\n\n- sum is the running total of the array elements.\n\n- zeroed is a flag that is set to true when the sum reaches zero. \n\n- The condition 'if(zeroed && a !=0)' sets valid to false. \n\nThis suggests that once the sum reaches zero, all subsequent elements must be zero. \n\nWait, that's an important point. \n\nLet me think:\n\nThe code's current logic is:\n\n- We track the sum of the elements as we read them.\n\n- We have a flag 'zeroed' which is set to true when the sum reaches zero. \n\n- Once 'zeroed' is true, any subsequent element that is not zero makes the array invalid. \n\n- Also, the sum must be zero at the end. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum must be zero.\n\n2. After the sum reaches zero for the first time, all remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThis is what the code is currently doing. \n\nBut does this condition capture the necessary conditions?\n\nLet me test this with the sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nSecond test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe sum progression is:\n\n2 \u2192 sum is 2, not zero. \n\n2-1=1 \u2192 still not zero. \n\n1-1=0 \u2192 now zeroed is set to true. \n\nNext element is 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo valid remains true. \n\nThe total sum is zero. So output is yes. \n\nAnother test case: the first test case in the note (which is not valid because the pointer isn't at first). \n\nSuppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nThe sum after first element is 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nSecond element: sum becomes 0 \u2192 zeroed is set to true. \n\nNo more elements. \n\nSo valid is true. \n\nBut the problem says that in the first test case, the pointer isn't at first. \n\nWait, what's the first test case's array? \n\nThe problem says in the first test case's note: \n\nNoteIn the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\n\nSo the array must be such that the conditions are met (sum zero, and after reaching zero, the rest are zero), but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nWait, but according to the code's logic, the first test case's array would be valid. \n\nBut the problem says it's not possible because the pointer isn't at first. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1]. \n\nThe code would accept it, but the problem says it's not possible because the pointer isn't at first. \n\nWait, but according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be obtained but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo the array is valid according to the problem's conditions (it can be formed), but the pointer must be at first. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after all operations, the pointer is back at first. \n\nSo the array is valid if it can be formed with the pointer ending at first. \n\nThe first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first, so it's invalid. \n\nBut according to the code's current logic, it would be considered valid. \n\nSo the code's current logic is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the conditions are not captured by the current code. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition?\n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nThe current code's logic is that after the sum reaches zero, the remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThis ensures that the path returns to zero and stays there. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the cumulative sum must reach zero exactly at the last element. \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe path must end at position 0. \n\nThe cumulative sum of the array up to the last element must be zero. \n\nBut also, the path must return to zero at the end. \n\nThe current code's logic requires that after the sum reaches zero, all subsequent elements are zero. \n\nThis would ensure that the path doesn't move away from zero after reaching it. \n\nThis would mean that the path must return to zero and stay there until the end. \n\nThis would ensure that the pointer is at position 0 at the end. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum must never be negative. \n\n3. Once the cumulative sum reaches zero, all remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThis way, after reaching zero, the pointer can't move further right (since the remaining elements are zero), so it must stay at position 0. \n\nThus, the pointer ends at position 0. \n\nThis would explain why the first test case's array (like [1, -1]) would be accepted by the code's current logic, but the problem says it's not valid. \n\nWait, but according to this logic, the array [1, -1] would be valid. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo perhaps the first test case's array is different. \n\nLet me think of the first test case's array. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 0]. \n\nThe sum is 1+0=1 \u2192 not zero. So it's invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first test case's array is [1, -1]. \n\nThe sum is zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum after first element is 1, then reaches zero. \n\nThe remaining elements (none) are zero. \n\nSo the code would accept it. \n\nBut the problem says that in this case, the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo what's the issue? \n\nPerhaps the array [1, -1] can be formed with the pointer ending at first. \n\nLet me see:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo op1: move to 1, a[0] becomes 1. \n\nThen do op2: move back to 0, a[1] becomes -1. \n\nNow the pointer is back at 0. \n\nSo this is valid. \n\nSo the first test case's array must be different. \n\nPerhaps the first test case's array is [0, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [2, -1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, 0]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, 0, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 1, 0. \n\nAfter the third element, the sum reaches zero. \n\nThe remaining elements (none) are zero. \n\nSo the code would accept it. \n\nBut the pointer would end at position 0. \n\nHmm, I'm confused. \n\nPerhaps the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0, 0. \n\nThe code would accept it. \n\nThe pointer would end at 0. \n\nSo I'm not sure what the first test case's array is. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo the array must be such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but the pointer is not at first. \n\nWait, perhaps the array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe path would be:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo op1: move to 1, a[0] becomes 1. \n\nDo op2: move back to 0, a[1] becomes -1. \n\nNow, the pointer is at 0. \n\nThen, do op1 again: move to 1, a[0] becomes 2. \n\nThen do op2 twice: move back to 0, a[1] becomes -3. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, 0]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nI'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo the array must be such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but the pointer is not at first. \n\nBut according to the code's current logic, such an array would be invalid because after reaching zero, the remaining elements must be zero. \n\nSo perhaps the first test case's array has non-zero elements after the cumulative sum reaches zero. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, 0, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 1, 0. \n\nThe code would set zeroed to true only at the end. \n\nSo the code would accept it. \n\nThe pointer would end at position 0. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nPerhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -1, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, 1, 0. \n\nThe code would accept it. \n\nThe pointer would end at position 0. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure what the first test case's array is. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo the array must be such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but the pointer is not at first. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, this would be allowed only if the remaining elements are zero. \n\nSo perhaps the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end but the pointer is not at first. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, this would be allowed only if the remaining elements are zero. \n\nSo perhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are:\n\nThe array must have a cumulative sum that never goes negative, and the cumulative sum reaches zero exactly at the last element. \n\nThis way, the pointer must return to zero at the end. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum is non-negative at every step. \n\n3. The cumulative sum reaches zero for the first time at the last element. \n\nThis would ensure that the pointer is at position 0 at the end. \n\nLet me test this with the second test case's array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. \n\nThe cumulative sum reaches zero at the third element (index 2), not the last. \n\nSo this would be invalid. But the problem says it's valid. \n\nHmm, this suggests this condition is incorrect. \n\nThe example in the note's second test case is valid, but according to this condition, it would be invalid. \n\nSo this is not correct. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct approach. \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nThe path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are the difference between the number of op1 and op2 at each position. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk that never goes below zero. \n\nThe key is to model the path's constraints. \n\nThe correct conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum from the start up to each position must be non-negative. \n\n3. The cumulative sum from the end up to each position must be non-positive. \n\nThese two conditions ensure that the path never goes below zero and never goes above the maximum possible. \n\nWait, let me see the second test case's array [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative from the start is 2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative from the end is 0, -1, -2, 0 \u2192 all non-positive. \n\nSo this satisfies the conditions. \n\nThe first test case's array (which is invalid) must violate one of these conditions. \n\nFor example, if the array is [1, -1], the cumulative from the end is 0, -1 \u2192 non-positive. \n\nCumulative from the start is 1, 0 \u2192 non-negative. \n\nSo it would be valid. \n\nBut the problem says that the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nHmm, but according to this condition, it would be valid. \n\nPerhaps the first test case's array is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the two cumulative sums plus the total sum. \n\nThus, the code should check:\n\n- The total sum is zero. \n\n- The cumulative sum from the start is always non-negative. \n\n- The cumulative sum from the end is always non-positive. \n\nThe code currently only checks the first condition and the cumulative sum from the start. \n\nThe code's current logic is:\n\n- Track the cumulative sum from the start. \n\n- Once it reaches zero, all remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThis ensures that the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive. \n\nBecause after reaching zero, the remaining elements must be zero, so the cumulative from the end would be zero or negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's current logic is correct. \n\nThe code's logic ensures that the cumulative sum from the start never goes negative (because if it does, valid is set to false). \n\nAnd the cumulative sum from the end is non-positive because after the first time the cumulative reaches zero, the remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThus, the cumulative from the end would be non-positive. \n\nSo the code's current logic is correct. \n\nThe first test case's array must be such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nAnother example: array [1, 0, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums from start: 1, 1, 0. \n\nThe code would set zeroed to true only at the end. \n\nThus, the code would allow this array. \n\nThe pointer would end at position 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array is [1, 0]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nPerhaps the array is [1, 0]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the conditions are:\n\n- Sum is zero. \n\n- The cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\n- After the cumulative sum reaches zero, all remaining elements are zero. \n\nThese conditions ensure that the path returns to zero and stays there until the end. \n\nThus, the pointer must be at position 0 at the end. \n\nTherefore, the code's current logic is correct. \n\nThe first test case's array must violate one of these conditions. \n\nPerhaps the first test case's array is [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the first test case's array is [2, -1, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, 1, 0. \n\nThe code would accept it. \n\nThe pointer would end at position 0. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't at first. \n\nSo perhaps the array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -2, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the code's current logic is correct, and the first test case's array is such that the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end but there are non-zero elements after. \n\nFor example, array [2, -1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the code's current logic and see what the missing condition is. \n\nThe code has a loop where for each a in the array:\n\nsum += a \n\nThen, there is a condition: if(/* TODO: Your code here */) valid = false;\n\nThe current code also has:\n\nif(zeroed && a !=0) valid = false;\n\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\nThe missing condition is likely to check that the cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\nSo the first condition is: if the current sum is negative, then it's invalid. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each element a:\n\nsum += a;\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nif(zeroed && a !=0) valid = false;\n\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\nThis way, the cumulative sum must never be negative. \n\nThe other condition is that after the sum reaches zero, all remaining elements must be zero. \n\nThis is handled by the 'zeroed' flag. \n\nThus, the missing code is checking that the cumulative sum is non-negative. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nThus, the missing line is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nThis would ensure that the cumulative sum never goes below zero. \n\nThe other conditions are handled by the existing code. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;\n\nSo the complete code would have:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    int a = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a;\n\n    if(sum <0) valid = false;\n\n    if(zeroed && a !=0) valid = false;\n\n    if(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\n}\n\nThis way, the conditions are:\n\n- The cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\n- After reaching zero, all remaining elements must be zero. \n\n- The total sum is zero. \n\nThis should be correct. \n\nTesting with the second test case's array [2, -1, -1, 0]:\n\nThe cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. \n\nAll are non-negative. \n\nAfter the third element (sum 0), the fourth element is zero. \n\nThus, valid remains true. \n\nThe first test case's array (which is invalid) must have a cumulative sum that goes negative or has non-zero elements after reaching zero. \n\nFor example, if the array is [1, -2, 1], sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, -1 (invalid). \n\nThus, the code would set valid to false. \n\nAnother example: array [1, -1, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is checking that the cumulative sum never goes negative. \n\nThe missing line is:\n\nif(sum <0) valid = false;"
