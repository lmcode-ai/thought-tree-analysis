Maybe a marker for the center? Then h[++cnt] = {r, 1}; // r is x_i + p_i, the end. Wait, perhaps the events are for the intervals where the rain contributes. The events are the start and end of the interval where the rain contributes. The center might be a point where the contribution is maximum? Hmm, maybe the events are for the intervals where the rain's contribution is non-zero. The start and end points are the edges of the interval where the rain's contribution is positive. The center might be a point where the contribution is p_i, but I'm not sure. The code then sorts all the events by their id (position). Then, in the loop over the events, they compute 'now' which is the accumulated contribution up to that point. The 'tag' variable probably represents the current number of overlapping rain contributions. Wait, maybe 'tag' is the number of active rain days contributing at that position. But how does that work? Wait, the 'tag' variable is being added by h[i].num. The h[i].num for the start events is 1, and for the center is -2. Hmm, maybe the events are for the start and end of the rain's influence. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the events are for the start and end of the rain's effect. Each rain contributes a diamond-shaped area (since the contribution is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|)). The maximum contribution at the center (x_i) is p_i, and it decreases as you move away. The total a_j is the sum of all these contributions from each day. The line sweep approach is trying to track the maximum a_j. To find the maximum, perhaps they are tracking the current sum of contributions as they move along the line. The events are the points where the contribution starts or ends, and the center points where the contribution peaks. Wait, the code's variables L and R are initialized to 1e9+5 and -1e9-5. Then, in the loop over the events, they compute 'now' as the accumulated contribution. The 'tag' is the number of overlapping rain contributions? Or maybe the current slope?

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in the code provided. The problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The code seems to be using some event-based approach with line sweeps, but there's a missing condition in the loop where they process the events.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem again. Each day's rain contributes to the accumulated rainfall at each position. The flood occurs if any position's a_j exceeds m. The task is, for each day i, check if removing that day's rain (setting p_i to 0) would ensure that no position ever exceeds m.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be using a line sweep to track the maximum a_j. The events are probably the start and end of the rain's effect. The nodes in the h array are events. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThey read n and m, then for each of the n days, they create three events: the start of the rain's effect (left edge), the center (maybe?), and the end. Wait, the code for each i:\n\nh[++cnt] = {l, 1}; // l is x_i - p_i, so the start of the rain's influence.\n\nThen, h[++cnt] = {ori[i].id, -2}; // the center? Not sure why -2. Maybe a marker for the center?\n\nThen h[++cnt] = {r, 1}; // r is x_i + p_i, the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the events are for the intervals where the rain contributes. The events are the start and end of the interval where the rain contributes. The center might be a point where the contribution is maximum?\n\nHmm, maybe the events are for the intervals where the rain's contribution is non-zero. The start and end points are the edges of the interval where the rain's contribution is positive. The center might be a point where the contribution is p_i, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe code then sorts all the events by their id (position). Then, in the loop over the events, they compute 'now' which is the accumulated contribution up to that point. The 'tag' variable probably represents the current number of overlapping rain contributions. Wait, maybe 'tag' is the number of active rain days contributing at that position. But how does that work?\n\nWait, the 'tag' variable is being added by h[i].num. The h[i].num for the start events is 1, and for the center is -2. Hmm, maybe the events are for the start and end of the rain's influence. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the events are for the start and end of the rain's effect. Each rain contributes a diamond-shaped area (since the contribution is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|)). The maximum contribution at the center (x_i) is p_i, and it decreases as you move away. The total a_j is the sum of all these contributions from each day.\n\nThe line sweep approach is trying to track the maximum a_j. To find the maximum, perhaps they are tracking the current sum of contributions as they move along the line. The events are the points where the contribution starts or ends, and the center points where the contribution peaks.\n\nWait, the code's variables L and R are initialized to 1e9+5 and -1e9-5. Then, in the loop over the events, they compute 'now' as the accumulated contribution. The 'tag' is the number of overlapping rain contributions? Or maybe the current slope?\n\nHmm, perhaps the line sweep is tracking the maximum a_j. The idea is that the maximum a_j can only occur at certain critical points, like the centers of the rain events. The code is trying to find the positions where the accumulated a_j exceeds m, and then determine the ranges where this happens. Then, for each day i, if removing that day's rain would eliminate the maximum exceeding m, then it's a 1 in the output.\n\nWait, the code's final loop for each day i checks if the interval [L, R] (the problematic region where a_j exceeds m) is entirely within the interval [l, r] of day i's rain. If so, then removing day i's rain would remove that contribution, so the flood is avoided. Otherwise, even removing day i's rain won't help.\n\nWait, the code's output line is:\n\nprintf(\"%d\", l <= L && R <= r);\n\nSo, for day i, if the problematic interval [L, R] is entirely within the interval [l, r] (the area affected by day i's rain), then removing that day's rain would eliminate the excess. Because the maximum a_j that was over m was only in that interval, and removing day i's contribution would reduce it there.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is to find the minimal L and maximal R such that in the original scenario (without any removal), the maximum a_j exceeds m. Then, for each day i, if the interval where the flood occurs (L to R) is entirely within the interval covered by day i's rain (l to r), then removing that day's rain would remove the excess in that region, so the flood is avoided. Otherwise, even removing that day's rain won't help.\n\nSo the problem is to compute L and R correctly. The code's current approach is to track the accumulated 'now' (the current a_j?), and whenever the accumulated value exceeds m, they update L and R. But the missing condition in the TODO is probably checking if now > m, so that whenever the current a_j exceeds m, we need to track the positions where this happens.\n\nWait, in the loop over the events, the code is processing the events in order. The 'now' variable is being updated as the accumulated contribution. The 'tag' variable is the number of overlapping events? Or perhaps the current slope?\n\nWait, let me think again. The line sweep approach for this problem might involve tracking the current a_j as you move along the line. The events are the start and end of each rain's contribution. Each rain contributes a diamond shape, so the start is at x_i - p_i, and the end at x_i + p_i. The contribution increases as you approach the center, then decreases.\n\nThe total a_j is the sum of all these contributions. To find the maximum a_j, perhaps the line sweep tracks the current a_j as you move along the line, and whenever it exceeds m, we need to record the regions where this happens.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal L and maximal R such that in the original scenario, the maximum a_j exceeds m. The L is the leftmost position where a_j exceeds m, and R is the rightmost. Then, for each day i, if the interval [L, R] is entirely within the interval [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i], then removing that day's rain would eliminate the excess in that region, so the flood is avoided.\n\nTherefore, the code's approach is to compute L and R as the minimal and maximal positions where the a_j exceeds m. Then, for each day i, check if the problematic region is entirely within the day's rain's interval. If yes, then removing that day's rain would help.\n\nNow, the code's loop over the events:\n\nfor(int tag=0, now=0, i=1; i<=cnt; i++){\n\n    now += (h[i].id - h[i-1].id) * tag;\n\n    if ( /* condition */ ) {\n\n        L = min(L, h[i].id - (now - m));\n\n        R = max(R, h[i].id + (now - m));\n\n    }\n\n    tag += h[i].num;\n\n}\n\nWait, the 'now' variable here is the accumulated a_j? Or perhaps the current a_j at position h[i].id?\n\nHmm, the way 'now' is computed is by adding (h[i].id - h[i-1].id) multiplied by 'tag'. The 'tag' variable is being updated by adding h[i].num. The h[i].num for the start events (the first and third events for each day) is 1, and for the center event (the second) is -2.\n\nWait, perhaps 'tag' represents the current slope of the a_j function. Let me think: the a_j function is a piecewise linear function. Each rain contributes a V-shaped function. The total a_j is the sum of all these V's. The slope changes at the start and end of each rain's interval, and at the center (the peak). \n\nAlternatively, the 'tag' variable could represent the current rate of change of a_j. For example, when entering the interval of a rain, the slope increases by 1 (since moving to the right, the contribution increases until the center, then decreases). Wait, perhaps the slope changes as follows:\n\nEach rain's contribution has a slope of +1 until the center, then -1. So, the total slope is the sum of all the individual slopes at each point. The 'tag' variable might track the current slope. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'tag' variable is the current slope. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a rain starting at l and ending at r. The contribution from this rain is p_i - |x_i - j|. The slope of this contribution is +1 from l to x_i, then -1 from x_i to r. So, when moving from left to right, the slope increases by +1 at l (start), then decreases by 2 at x_i (the peak, where the slope changes from +1 to -1), and then decreases by -1 at r (end). \n\nTherefore, for each rain, the events are:\n\n- At l (x_i - p_i), the slope increases by +1 (so the event is +1).\n\n- At x_i, the slope decreases by 2 (so the event is -2).\n\n- At r (x_i + p_i), the slope increases by -1 (so the event is -1? Wait, no. Wait, the slope after r would decrease by 1 (since the contribution stops contributing). Wait, perhaps the end event is a slope change of -1.\n\nWait, the slope before the start (l) is 0 (no contribution from this rain). At l, the slope becomes +1 (since moving right, the contribution increases by 1 per unit until the center). At the center (x_i), the slope changes to -1, so the total change is -2 (from +1 to -1). At the end (r), the slope becomes 0 again, so the change is -1 (from -1 to 0). \n\nTherefore, the three events for each rain are:\n\n- At l: slope increases by +1 (so event is +1).\n\n- At x_i: slope decreases by 2 (so event is -2).\n\n- At r: slope decreases by -1 (wait, no, the slope after r is 0, so the change is from -1 to 0, which is +1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the slope changes are:\n\n- At l: +1 (start of the increasing part).\n\n- At x_i: -2 (the slope drops by 2, from +1 to -1).\n\n- At r: +1 (the slope goes from -1 to 0, so a change of +1).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the three events for each rain are:\n\n- l: +1 (slope increases by 1).\n\n- x_i: -2 (slope decreases by 2).\n\n- r: +1 (slope increases by 1 again? Wait, no. Wait, the slope at r is going from -1 to 0, so the change is +1. So the event at r is +1?\n\nHmm, perhaps the events are:\n\nEach rain contributes three events:\n\n1. Start (l = x_i - p_i): slope increases by +1 \u2192 event is +1.\n\n2. Center (x_i): slope decreases by 2 \u2192 event is -2.\n\n3. End (r = x_i + p_i): slope increases by +1 \u2192 event is +1? Wait, no. Wait, the slope after the end is 0, so the change from -1 (before r) to 0 (after r) is +1. So the event at r is +1.\n\nWait, but in the code, the third event is h[++cnt] = {r, 1}; so the num is 1. That matches. The second event is {x_i, -2}, which is correct for the center.\n\nSo the 'tag' variable is the current slope. So, as we process each event, the slope changes by h[i].num. \n\nNow, the 'now' variable is the current a_j. To compute a_j, we can track the integral of the slope over the interval. \n\nWait, the 'now' variable is being updated as:\n\nnow += (h[i].id - h[i-1].id) * tag;\n\nSo between the previous event position (h[i-1].id) and current position (h[i].id), the slope is 'tag', so the a_j increases by (distance) * (slope) over that interval. Wait, but the slope is the rate of change of a_j. So the a_j at position h[i].id would be the previous a_j plus the integral of the slope over the interval. \n\nWait, the slope is the derivative of a_j. So the change in a_j over an interval dx is slope * dx. So yes, the 'now' variable is the current a_j at position h[i].id. \n\nTherefore, the code is tracking the a_j as it moves along the events. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum a_j. But the code is trying to find the regions where a_j exceeds m. The variables L and R are being updated whenever a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe code's loop has a condition in the TODO. The idea is that whenever the current a_j (now) exceeds m, we need to record the positions where this happens. \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is to compute L and R as the minimal and maximal positions where the a_j exceeds m. \n\nWait, the code initializes L to a very large value and R to a very small one. Then, whenever now > m, they update L and R. \n\nWait, but how exactly? The code's current line is:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n\n    L = min(L, h[i].id - (now - m));\n\n    R = max(R, h[i].id + (now - m));\n\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that when the a_j is now, which is greater than m, the region where a_j exceeds m is from (current position - (now - m)) to (current position + (now - m))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum a_j occurs at the center of the current rain, and the region where a_j exceeds m is a certain interval. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the leftmost and rightmost points where a_j exceeds m. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal L and maximal R such that in the interval [L, R], the a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe way they compute L and R is by taking h[i].id minus (now - m) and plus (now - m). \n\nWait, let's think of the a_j as a function. Suppose at position x, the a_j is now. If now > m, then the region where a_j exceeds m is around x. The maximum a_j is at the peak, so the region where a_j > m would be a symmetric interval around the peak. \n\nWait, perhaps the a_j function is a piecewise linear function, and whenever it exceeds m, the region where it's above m is an interval. The code is trying to track the leftmost and rightmost points of such intervals. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal L and maximal R such that there exists some position between h[i-1].id and h[i].id where a_j exceeds m. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering the interval between the previous event and current event. The a_j increases (or decreases) linearly over that interval. \n\nSuppose between h[i-1].id and h[i].id, the slope is 'tag'. The a_j starts at previous a_j (before the interval) and increases by (distance)*(tag). \n\nWait, the 'now' variable is the a_j at h[i].id. \n\nWait, the code's 'now' is computed as:\n\nnow += (h[i].id - h[i-1].id) * tag;\n\nSo, the previous a_j was now before adding this term. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing events in order, and for each interval between events, the a_j is a linear function. \n\nThe idea is that between two consecutive events (positions x_prev and x_curr), the a_j increases at a constant rate (the slope 'tag'). \n\nSo, during that interval, the a_j is a linear function. \n\nThe code wants to find all positions where a_j exceeds m. \n\nTo do this, for each interval between x_prev and x_curr, we can check if the a_j in that interval ever exceeds m. \n\nThe maximum a_j in that interval would be either at x_prev, x_curr, or at some point in between. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal L and maximal R such that the entire interval where a_j exceeds m is covered. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost and rightmost points where a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe code's current approach is, whenever the current a_j (now) is greater than m, then the position h[i].id is part of the region where a_j exceeds m. But that's not sufficient, because the a_j could have been higher before. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum a_j and see where it exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal L and maximal R such that the maximum a_j occurs in that interval. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each event position, the current a_j. If that a_j exceeds m, then the position is part of the region where the flood occurs. \n\nBut the problem requires that the flood occurs if at any moment (i.e., any position) the a_j exceeds m. So, if there exists any position where a_j > m, then the flood occurs. \n\nThe code's variables L and R are initialized to extremes, and whenever a_j exceeds m, they update L and R to the minimal and maximal positions where this happens. \n\nWait, but how exactly? The code's current code for L and R is:\n\nL = min(L, h[i].id - (now - m));\n\nR = max(R, h[i].id + (now - m));\n\nHmm, perhaps this is trying to compute the interval where a_j exceeds m. \n\nSuppose at position x (h[i].id), the a_j is now. The maximum a_j at this point is now. The region where a_j exceeds m would be a symmetric interval around x with radius (now - m). Because the a_j decreases as you move away from the peak. \n\nWait, but the a_j could be part of a larger function. \n\nAlternatively, the code is assuming that the maximum a_j is at the current position, and the region where a_j exceeds m is from x - (now - m) to x + (now - m). \n\nSo, if now > m, then the interval [x - (now - m), x + (now - m)] is part of the region where a_j exceeds m. \n\nTherefore, the code is taking the minimal L as the minimum between the current L and (x - (now - m)), and similarly for R. \n\nThis would accumulate the minimal left and maximal right of all such intervals where a_j exceeds m. \n\nTherefore, the condition for updating L and R is when now > m. \n\nSo the missing condition in the TODO is \"now > m\".\n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif (now > m) {\n\n    L = min(L, h[i].id - (now - m));\n\n    R = max(R, h[i].id + (now - m));\n\n}\n\nWait, but the code's 'now' is the a_j at h[i].id. So, if now exceeds m, then the current position is part of the region. But the interval where a_j exceeds m would be centered at the peak, but perhaps the code is trying to capture that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that the maximum a_j in the interval between the previous event and current event is now. \n\nWait, the code's 'now' is the a_j at h[i].id. The previous a_j was before adding the term (h[i].id - h[i-1].id)*tag. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose between two events, the slope is positive. Then the a_j increases from the previous value to now. So the maximum in that interval is now. \n\nIf the slope is negative, then the a_j decreases from previous to now, so the maximum is the previous value. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the code is only considering the a_j at the event points. But that might not capture the maximum in between. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct in the way it's written, and the missing condition is indeed \"now > m\".\n\nSo, the code's loop is:\n\nfor each event, after updating 'now' (the a_j at h[i].id), if now exceeds m, then we need to consider the interval where a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe formula for L and R is taking the current position and subtracting/adding (now - m). \n\nThis would give the left and right boundaries of the region where a_j exceeds m, assuming that the a_j is at its peak here. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is that whenever the a_j at the current event position is above m, then the region where a_j exceeds m includes the interval [x - (now - m), x + (now - m)]. \n\nHence, the code is accumulating the minimal left and maximal right of all such intervals. \n\nTherefore, the missing condition is \"if (now > m)\".\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif (now > m) {\n\n    L = min(L, h[i].id - (now - m));\n\n    R = max(R, h[i].id + (now - m));\n\n}\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"now > m\".\n\nWait, but in the code, the 'now' is computed before the if statement. So the code is:\n\nnow += (h[i].id - h[i-1].id)*tag;\n\nthen check if (now > m), then update L and R.\n\nWait, but the 'now' here is the a_j at h[i].id. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the correct condition is \"now > m\".\n\nSo the missing code is \"now > m\".\n\nTherefore, the code should be filled with that condition."
