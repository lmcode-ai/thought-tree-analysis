Suppose that from node u, there are multiple outgoing edges to nodes v1, v2, etc. The minimal days for u would be 1 (the day when Keshi moves) plus the minimal dis among all the v's. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except the one leading to the v with the minimal dis. Wait, but that would be the case. So the recurrence would be dis[u] = 1 + min{ dis[v] }, where v is reachable via an outgoing edge. But then, the base case is dis[n] =0.",

Then, on the next day, you can tell Keshi to move. So the total days for that path would be (d-1) + 1 + dis[v] = d + dis[v]. Therefore, the minimal days for u is the minimal (d + dis[v]) over all outgoing edges v. \n\nWait, but that's exactly the formula in the code: dis[v] = deg[v] (the out-degree) + dis[u]?

But given the problem's constraints and the code's structure, perhaps the correct condition is simply checking whether the new dis[v] is better, and the deg[v]-- is part of the code's logic. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) So the code should be filled with that condition. Therefore, the answer is to replace the TODO with that condition. Wait, but in the code, the variables are:\n\nThe current node is u (the one popped from the priority queue).",

The deg[v]-- is part of the code's existing structure, but perhaps it's not needed. Wait, but in the code, after the if statement, the code does deg[v]--; Wait, why is that?

Suppose that for each outgoing edge of w to x, the dis[w] can be computed as deg[w] + dis[x]. The minimal dis[w] is the minimum of all such possibilities. Therefore, to compute dis[w], we need to know the minimal dis[x] among all x reachable from w.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. \n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly selects one of the reachable cities (via non-blocked roads) and moves there. The goal is to minimize the maximum possible days needed to ensure they meet at city n.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves some graph traversal and dynamic programming. Let me think about the code provided. The code uses a priority queue and seems to be doing a Dijkstra-like approach. The variables like dis and deg might be part of the solution.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the solve function initializes dis[n] to 0 and uses a priority queue. The deg array is being decremented. The comment in the code says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the condition for updating dis[v]. \n\nWait, the code is processing nodes in a way that might be related to the shortest path, but with some conditions involving the degree. Let me think about what the variables represent here.\n\nThe deg array probably represents the number of outgoing edges from a node. Because in the main function, when adding edges, deg[u] is incremented. So for each node u, deg[u] is the out-degree. \n\nIn the solve function, for each neighbor v of u (since we're traversing the reverse graph via gi, which is the inverse of g), the code is checking some condition before updating dis[v]. The dis array might represent the minimal days required to reach node n from v. \n\nWait, the dis array is initialized to 1e9 except for dis[n] =0. The priority queue is a max-heap (since stored as negative in a min-heap?), but the code uses a priority_queue<pair<int, int>> which by default is a max-heap. Wait, no, the code pushes {-dis[v], v}, so the priority queue is ordered by the negative distance, meaning that the smallest dis (since stored as -dis) comes first. Wait, maybe the priority queue is a min-heap for the actual distance. Let me see: when you pop, the element with the smallest -dis (i.e., the largest dis) is popped? No, the priority_queue by default is max-heap. So the top element has the largest first component. Since the first component is stored as 0 (for n initially), then when we push -dis[v], the elements are ordered such that the smallest dis comes first? Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dis array is storing the minimal required days to reach n from that node. The approach here is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm where we process nodes in order of their current known distance. \n\nThe condition in the TODO is probably checking if the current path through u gives a better (smaller) distance for v. But how does the deg come into play here?\n\nWait, the problem requires that AmShZ and Keshi can choose actions each day to minimize the maximum days. The key idea here might be to model the problem as a game where each node's required days is determined by the worst-case scenario. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of each node's required days. For a node u, the minimal days d needed to reach n from u can be determined as follows:\n\nIf u is n, then d is 0. \n\nOtherwise, when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, Keshi will choose one of the outgoing edges (non-blocked) and move. But since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, they can control the path. The optimal strategy would involve choosing the path that leads to the minimal maximum days. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that for each node u, the minimal days required is 1 plus the minimal among the maximum days of all its neighbors. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that they can guarantee to meet in at most d days. So, the strategy must ensure that no matter how Keshi chooses his path (since he picks randomly, but AmShZ can block roads to control the options), the days are within d. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a game where each node's required days is the minimal number of days such that, by blocking certain roads, AmShZ can force Keshi to reach n in that number of days. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of in terms of the maximum number of days required in the worst case. To minimize this, we need to find the minimal d where, for every path from 1 to n, the path's length plus the number of blocked roads along the way is <= d. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the process day by day. Each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The key is that AmShZ can choose the optimal sequence of actions to minimize the days. \n\nThe optimal strategy would involve blocking roads that are not on the shortest path, so that Keshi is forced to take the shortest path. But how to model this?\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a DAG and find the minimal maximum over all paths of (the path length plus the number of blocked edges not on the path). Wait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal d such that for every possible path from 1 to n, the number of edges in the path plus the number of edges not in the path but on some other path is <= d. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is equal to the length of the longest path from 1 to n minus 1, but that might not be correct. \n\nWait, looking at the code given, the code uses a priority queue and the dis array. The code's solve function initializes dis[n] to 0, and for each node, it's trying to compute dis[v] as deg[v] + dis[u], where u is a predecessor. \n\nWait, the code's current setup is:\n\nfor each neighbor v of u (in the reversed graph, so u is a predecessor of v in the original graph):\n\nif (some condition), then dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u], and push to queue.\n\ndeg[v] is being decremented here. \n\nHmm, perhaps the deg[v] here represents the number of outgoing edges from v. So, when processing the predecessors, the condition is whether the current edge is part of some path. \n\nAlternatively, the formula dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u] might be part of a dynamic programming approach where the dis[v] is the minimal days required from v. \n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of each node's required days. \n\nSuppose that for a node u, the minimal days required to reach n is dis[u]. \n\nWhen AmShZ tells Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge. To minimize the days, AmShZ would want to choose the path that leads to the minimal possible days. However, since Keshi chooses randomly, but AmShZ can block roads to control the options. \n\nWait, the key is that AmShZ can choose which roads to block each day. So, the optimal strategy would be to block all roads except one that leads to the minimal path. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: For each node u, the minimal number of days required is 1 (for the move day) plus the maximum of the days required for each possible next node. But since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, they can choose to only leave the path with the minimal required days. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is that dis[u] = 1 + (the minimal among the maximum dis of its neighbors). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal days required for node u is the minimal over all possible choices of a path (by blocking other edges) of (1 + the days required for the chosen next node). But since AmShZ can choose which edge to leave open, they can choose the path with the minimal days. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is dis[u] = 1 + min{ dis[v] for all v in outgoing edges of u }, but that would be if they can choose the best path. However, the problem requires that they can guarantee to reach in d days regardless of Keshi's choices. Wait, no, because Keshi chooses randomly, but AmShZ can block roads to control the options. \n\nWait, the problem says that AmShZ can choose which roads to block each day. So, when they tell Keshi to move, they can have already blocked all roads except one, so Keshi has no choice but to take that path. \n\nAh! That's a crucial point. So, when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, they can have already blocked all other roads except one, so Keshi must take that path. Therefore, the strategy is to choose the path that leads to the minimal possible days. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days required for a node u is 1 (for the move day) plus the minimal days required for the next node along the chosen path. But since AmShZ can choose which path to leave open, they can choose the path with the minimal dis[v]. \n\nWait, but the days are additive. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that from node u, there are multiple outgoing edges to nodes v1, v2, etc. The minimal days for u would be 1 (the day when Keshi moves) plus the minimal dis among all the v's. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except the one leading to the v with the minimal dis. \n\nWait, but that would be the case. So the recurrence would be dis[u] = 1 + min{ dis[v] }, where v is reachable via an outgoing edge. \n\nBut then, the base case is dis[n] =0. \n\nWait, but then the answer would be dis[1]. \n\nBut in the code provided, the code is using deg[v] in the formula. So perhaps my initial thought is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me look at the code again. \n\nIn the code's solve function, the dis[v] is being set to deg[v] + dis[u]. \n\nHmm, that suggests that the dis[v] is the sum of the current node's out-degree plus the dis of the predecessor. \n\nWait, perhaps the dis array represents the maximum number of days required. Let me think of the example given. \n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 8\n\n1 2\n\n2 6\n\n3 6\n\n4 6\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\nThe sample output is 1, because AmShZ can just tell Keshi to move on the first day. \n\nLet's see how the code would compute this. \n\nFor node 2, its outgoing edges are to 3,4,5,6. The out-degree (deg[2]) is 4. \n\nThe dis for node 2 would be 1 (the move day) plus the minimal dis of its next nodes. Wait, but according to the code's formula, perhaps it's different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is dis[u] = max( (number of edges to block) + 1 (the move day) + dis[v] ), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that each time you choose to move, you have to account for the number of edges you have to block. \n\nWait, the problem allows AmShZ to block a road each day. So each day, they can choose to either block a road (thereby using a day) or tell Keshi to move (using a day). \n\nThe total days must be the minimal d such that, through a sequence of blocking and moving, they can reach n in d days. \n\nThe key is that each time they choose to block a road, that takes a day, but doesn't move Keshi. Choosing to move takes a day and moves Keshi along an edge (the one not blocked). \n\nThe optimal strategy would be to minimize the number of days by choosing when to block and when to move. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal days required for a node u is the minimal number of days needed to reach n from u. \n\nLet me think recursively. \n\nSuppose that from node u, the minimal days required is d. \n\nIf u is n, then d is 0. \n\nOtherwise, AmShZ can choose between two options each day: \n\nOption 1: Block a road. This takes 1 day, but doesn't move Keshi. So the next day, they can again choose. \n\nOption 2: Tell Keshi to move. This takes 1 day, and Keshi moves to one of the outgoing edges (the ones not blocked). \n\nThe problem requires that they can choose the sequence of actions to guarantee that they reach n in at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices (but since AmShZ can block roads, they can control the path). \n\nWait, but when they tell Keshi to move, he will choose a path that is reachable (i.e., not blocked). So AmShZ can choose which roads to block so that when Keshi moves, he is forced to take a specific path. \n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to block all roads except one leading to the next node with the minimal required days. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for node u is 1 (the day when you tell Keshi to move) plus the minimal days of the next node. \n\nBut you can also choose to block roads first. \n\nWait, but blocking roads takes days. So perhaps the minimal days is the minimal between blocking some roads and then moving, but that might not be better. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal days for u is the minimal between: \n\n1. 1 + (the minimal days of any next node v, after blocking all other edges except one leading to v). \n\nOR \n\n2. Blocking a road (taking 1 day) and then proceeding from u again. \n\nWait, but blocking a road doesn't help unless it's part of a path that would otherwise be taken. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal strategy is to always choose to move when possible, and block roads as needed to force Keshi into the best path. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for u is 1 + the minimal days of the next node along the best path. \n\nBut how does the blocking come into play here? \n\nWait, the blocking is only needed when there are multiple paths. For example, if u has multiple outgoing edges, then to choose the best path, you need to block all other edges except one. Each blocked edge takes a day. \n\nWait, this complicates things. Because if there are k outgoing edges from u, then to choose one path, you need to block k-1 edges, each taking a day. \n\nAh! That's probably the key. \n\nSo, for a node u with out-degree d, if you want to force Keshi to take a particular outgoing edge, you have to block the other d-1 edges. Each block takes a day. Then, you can tell Keshi to move, which takes another day. \n\nTherefore, the total days for that path would be (d-1) (days to block) + 1 (day to move) + the days required for the next node. \n\nBut since you can choose which path to take, you would choose the path that gives the minimal total days. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for u is the minimal over all outgoing edges v of ( (number of edges to block (d-1) ) + 1 (move day) + dis[v] ). \n\nWait, but the number of edges to block is (d-1), but you can do the blocking over multiple days. \n\nWait, no. Because each block takes a day. So to block (d-1) edges, you need (d-1) days. Then, on the next day, you can tell Keshi to move. \n\nSo the total days for that path would be (d-1) + 1 + dis[v] = d + dis[v]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for u is the minimal (d + dis[v]) over all outgoing edges v. \n\nWait, but that's exactly the formula in the code: dis[v] = deg[v] (the out-degree) + dis[u]? Wait, no, in the code, the code is for the reversed graph. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the code, the current node is u (the predecessor in the reversed graph), and v is the current node. \n\nWait, the code's loop is over the reversed edges. So for each edge in the reversed graph (from u to v in the reversed graph), that corresponds to an edge from v to u in the original graph. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the variables. \n\nThe code uses the reversed graph (gi) to process predecessors. So for each node u in the reversed graph's adjacency list of v, that means there is an edge from v to u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original graph g has edges added as g.add(u, v), which means an edge from u to v. The reversed graph gi would have edges added as gi.add(v, u). So, in the reversed graph, the edge from v to u in the original becomes an edge from u to v in the reversed graph? Wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. \n\nWait, the code for adding edges is:\n\nfor each road from u to v in the input:\n\ng.add(u, v) \u2192 adds an edge in g from u to v.\n\ngi.add(v, u) \u2192 adds an edge in gi from v to u. \n\nSo, the reversed graph gi has edges pointing in the reverse direction. \n\nTherefore, when processing the reversed graph's edges for node u (in the reversed graph), the edges are the original edges' destinations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the dis array in a way that for each node v, dis[v] is the minimal days required from v to reach n. \n\nThe formula in the code is dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u], where u is a predecessor in the original graph (since we are traversing the reversed edges). \n\nWait, the deg array is the out-degree of the original graph. So for node v, deg[v] is the number of outgoing edges from v in the original graph. \n\nSo, the formula dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u] (where u is a predecessor in the original graph) would imply that the days required for v is the out-degree of v plus the days required for u. \n\nHmm, but according to the earlier analysis, the days for v would be (out-degree of v) + dis[next node]. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is that for each node v, the minimal days is the minimal over all its outgoing edges (to u) of ( (out-degree of v - 1) + 1 + dis[u] ), which simplifies to (out-degree of v) + dis[u]. \n\nAh! Because for each outgoing edge from v to u, the minimal days would be (number of edges to block (out_degree -1) ) + 1 (move day) + dis[u]. \n\nSo that's exactly (out_degree) + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for v is the minimum over all its outgoing edges of (out_degree[v] + dis[u]). \n\nWait, but since we can choose any outgoing edge, we pick the one with the smallest dis[u], so the minimal days for v is (out_degree[v] + (minimal dis[u] among all outgoing edges)). \n\nWait, no. The formula would be for each outgoing edge v\u2192u, the cost is (out_degree[v] -1) (days to block other edges) + 1 (move day) + dis[u]. \n\nWhich is (out_degree[v] -1 +1) + dis[u] \u2192 out_degree[v] + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for v is the minimum over all outgoing edges of (out_degree[v] + dis[u]). \n\nWait, but that's the same for all outgoing edges, because out_degree[v] is fixed. So the minimal is out_degree[v] + (minimal dis[u] among all outgoing edges). \n\nTherefore, the formula for dis[v] is out_degree[v] + (the minimal dis among all its next nodes). \n\nWait, but in the code, the code is doing for each predecessor u (in the original graph, via the reversed edges), and then setting dis[v] = deg[v] (out_degree) + dis[u]. \n\nWait, but that would be adding the out_degree of v plus the dis of u. \n\nWait, but the minimal dis among all outgoing edges' next nodes would be the minimal dis[u] (since u is the next node in the original edge v\u2192u). \n\nTherefore, to compute dis[v], we need to take the minimal dis[u] among all outgoing edges of v, then add the out_degree[v]. \n\nSo the correct way to compute dis[v] is dis[v] = deg[v] + (min_dis_of_outgoing_edges). \n\nBut how does the code do this? \n\nThe code is looping over all predecessors u (in the reversed graph, which are the nodes that have edges from v to u in the original graph). \n\nWait, no. The reversed graph's edges are from u to v in the reversed graph, which corresponds to original edges from v to u. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for each i in gi.head[u], so for each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u. \n\nWait, the code is in the solve function:\n\nfor each node u being processed (the current node in the priority queue), and for each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u (so edges pointing to u in the reversed graph, which are edges from u to v in the original graph?), no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. \n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = gi.head[u]; i; i = gi.nex[i]) {\n\n    int v = gi.to[i]; \n\n}\n\nWait, the reversed graph's edges are added as gi.add(v, u) when the original edge is u\u2192v. \n\nSo, in the reversed graph, the edge is from v to u. \n\nTherefore, the adjacency list for node u in the reversed graph contains all the nodes v such that there is an edge from v to u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose in the original graph, there is an edge from a to b. \n\nThen, in the reversed graph, we add an edge from b to a. \n\nTherefore, the reversed graph's adjacency list for node b will have an entry pointing to a. \n\nSo, when processing node u in the reversed graph's adjacency list, the edges are all the nodes that can reach u in the original graph. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nThe code is processing the reversed graph's edges. For each u (the current node being processed in the priority queue), it loops through all edges in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u. \n\nEach such edge in the reversed graph is from some node v to u. \n\nTherefore, in the original graph, this corresponds to an edge from u to v. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the reversed graph's edge is from v to u, which corresponds to the original edge from u to v. \n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal edge is u \u2192 v. \n\nWhen adding to the reversed graph, we do gi.add(v, u). So the reversed graph has an edge from v to u. \n\nTherefore, in the reversed graph's adjacency list for v, there is an edge pointing to u. \n\nSo, when the code loops over the reversed graph's edges for node u, it's looking at all edges in the reversed graph that start at u. \n\nWait, no. The code's loop is for each i in gi.head[u], which is the adjacency list for node u in the reversed graph. \n\nEach entry in that list is an edge from u to some node in the reversed graph. \n\nWhich corresponds to an original edge from that node to u. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose in the original graph, there is an edge from a to b. \n\nThen, in the reversed graph, there is an edge from b to a. \n\nSo, in the reversed graph's adjacency list for b, there is an entry pointing to a. \n\nTherefore, when processing node b in the reversed graph, the edges in its adjacency list are all the nodes that can reach it in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The reversed graph's edges are the reverse of the original. So the adjacency list for node b in the reversed graph contains all nodes that have edges to b in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, in the code's loop, for each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u, the 'v' (the to[i]) is the node that has an edge to u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The 'to[i]' is the destination of the reversed edge. So for an edge in the reversed graph from u to v, the original edge is from v to u. \n\nTherefore, the code's loop for each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u (the current node) is iterating over all edges that in the original graph go from v to u. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as for each predecessor v of u in the original graph. \n\nBecause in the reversed graph, edges are reversed, so the adjacency list of u in the reversed graph contains all the nodes v that have an edge to u in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, in the code's loop, for each such v (predecessor of u in original), the code is considering the edge v \u2192 u in the original graph. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variable v is assigned as gi.to[i], which is the destination of the reversed edge. \n\nWait, the reversed edge is from u to v (in the reversed graph), so the original edge is from v to u. \n\nTherefore, the code is processing all predecessors v of u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The original edge is from v to u, so v is a predecessor of u in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, in the code's loop, for each predecessor v of u in the original graph, the code is considering the edge v \u2192 u. \n\nWait, but the code is trying to compute dis[v], not dis[u]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute dis[v] based on dis[u]. \n\nWait, the code's current node is u (the one being processed from the priority queue). \n\nThe loop is over all edges in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u, which correspond to edges v \u2192 u in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, for each such edge, the 'v' is the predecessor of u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the original is v \u2192 u, so v is a predecessor of u. \n\nThe code is trying to compute dis[v], perhaps? \n\nWait, the code's current node is u. \n\nThe code is looking at edges in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u, which are edges from u to v in the reversed graph. \n\nWait, no. The reversed graph's edge is from v to u (original edge v\u2192u). \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:\n\nThe reversed graph's edge is added as gi.add(v, u) when the original edge is u\u2192v. \n\nSo, in the reversed graph, the edge is from v to u. \n\nTherefore, the adjacency list for node v in the reversed graph contains an entry pointing to u. \n\nTherefore, when the code loops over the edges in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u, it's looking at edges that start at u in the reversed graph. \n\nWhich would correspond to original edges from u to some node. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the adjacency list for node u in the reversed graph contains all edges that start at u in the reversed graph. \n\nEach such edge is from u to some node w in the reversed graph. \n\nWhich corresponds to an original edge from w to u. \n\nTherefore, the code's loop is iterating over all nodes w such that there is an edge from w to u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edge is from u to w in the reversed graph \u2192 original edge is from w to u. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u. \n\nEach such edge is stored as an entry in the adjacency list, which has a 'to' value of w. \n\nTherefore, the edge in the reversed graph is u \u2192 w, which corresponds to an original edge w \u2192 u. \n\nTherefore, the code is iterating over all nodes w that have an edge to u in the original graph. \n\nSo, for each such w, the code is considering the edge w \u2192 u in the original graph. \n\nThe code then does:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n\n    dis[w] = deg[w] + dis[u]; \n\n    q.push( ... )\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is trying to compute dis[w] based on dis[u]. \n\nAh! So the formula is dis[w] = deg[w] (the out-degree of w in the original graph) plus dis[u]. \n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, the minimal days for w is the minimal over all its outgoing edges of (out_degree[w] + dis[next_node]). \n\nWait, but in this case, the next_node would be u (since the edge is w \u2192 u). \n\nWait, but the minimal days for w would be the minimum over all its outgoing edges of (out_degree[w] + dis[next_node]). \n\nSo for each outgoing edge of w (in the original graph), which is to some node x, the contribution would be (out_degree[w] + dis[x]). \n\nTherefore, the minimal dis[w] is the minimum over all x (neighbors of w) of (out_degree[w] + dis[x]). \n\nBut in the code, the code is processing edges in the reversed graph (i.e., edges coming into u from w in the original graph), and for each such w, it's trying to compute dis[w] as deg[w] (out_degree of w) plus dis[u]. \n\nWait, but that would only consider the edge w \u2192 u. \n\nSo, the code is not considering all outgoing edges of w, but only those edges that point to u. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a dynamic programming approach where the dis array is computed in reverse order. \n\nWait, the code uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's using Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nThe dis array is initialized to a large value except for dis[n] =0. \n\nThe priority queue starts with (0, n). \n\nThen, for each node u processed (the one with the smallest dis[u]), it looks at all predecessors w in the original graph (since we're using the reversed graph's edges). \n\nFor each such w, the code wants to compute dis[w] as deg[w] + dis[u]. \n\nBut why? \n\nPerhaps the idea is that the minimal days for w is the minimal between its current dis value and (deg[w] + dis[u]). \n\nWait, but how does this account for all possible paths from w? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal days for each node by considering all possible paths that go through u. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is that the minimal days for w is the minimal over all its outgoing edges (to x) of (deg[w] + dis[x]). \n\nBut since deg[w] is fixed, this is equivalent to deg[w] + (minimal dis[x] among all x reachable from w). \n\nTherefore, to compute dis[w], we need to know the minimal dis[x] among all outgoing edges of w. \n\nThe code's approach is to process nodes in order of their dis value (using a priority queue), and for each predecessor w of u (in the original graph), it can update dis[w] as deg[w] + dis[u], provided that this is better than the current dis[w]. \n\nWait, but this would only consider the path through u. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the minimal dis[x] for w's outgoing edges is the minimal dis among all its neighbors, and by processing nodes in order of increasing dis, we can ensure that when we process u, we have the minimal dis[u], so that when we compute dis[w] as deg[w] + dis[u], it's the minimal possible. \n\nWait, but this would only account for the path through u. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using a greedy approach where the minimal dis for w is the minimal (deg[w] + dis[x]) over all x in the outgoing edges of w. \n\nTo compute this, we can process nodes in order of their dis value. \n\nFor each node u, when we process it, we can look at all its predecessors w (in the original graph) and see if using the edge w\u2192u gives a better dis[w]. \n\nThe minimal dis for w would be the minimum between its current dis and (deg[w] + dis[u]). \n\nWait, but that's only considering the path through u. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the minimal dis for w is the minimal over all its outgoing edges. \n\nSuppose that for each outgoing edge of w to x, the dis[w] can be computed as deg[w] + dis[x]. \n\nThe minimal dis[w] is the minimum of all such possibilities. \n\nTherefore, to compute dis[w], we need to know the minimal dis[x] among all x reachable from w. \n\nThe code's approach is to process nodes in order of their dis value (so that when we process u, we have the minimal dis[u] so far), and for each predecessor w of u (in the original graph), we can consider the possibility of taking the edge w\u2192u, which would give a dis[w] of deg[w] + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the code is accumulating the minimal possible dis[w] by considering all possible edges from w to x, and whenever a better x (with smaller dis[x]) is found, it updates dis[w]. \n\nThe deg[w] is the out-degree of w, which is fixed. \n\nThe code uses a priority queue to process nodes in order of their dis value. \n\nThe condition in the TODO is probably checking whether the current edge (w\u2192u) can contribute to a better dis[w]. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for each predecessor w of u (in the original graph). \n\nThe code wants to compute dis[w] as deg[w] + dis[u], but only if this is better than the current dis[w]. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be whether dis[w] > (deg[w] + dis[u]). \n\nWait, but in the code, the dis array is initialized to 1e9, so when we first process u (with dis[u] =0), for each predecessor w of u, the code can set dis[w] to deg[w] + 0. \n\nThen, when processing other nodes, it can update dis[w] further. \n\nThe code's condition is missing, so the TODO is to check if the new dis[w] (deg[w] + dis[u]) is better than the current dis[w]. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be: \n\nif (dis[w] > (deg[w] + dis[u])) \n\nthen update dis[w] and push to the queue. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are a bit different. Let me see:\n\nIn the code's loop:\n\nfor each i in gi.head[u], the current edge is from v to u in the original graph (since the reversed graph's edge is v \u2192 u). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the code's loop is over the reversed graph's edges for node u. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = gi.head[u]; i; i = gi.nex[i]) {\n\n    int v = gi.to[i]; \n\n}\n\nWait, the 'v' here is the destination of the reversed edge. \n\nThe reversed edge is from u to v in the reversed graph. \n\nWhich corresponds to an original edge from v to u. \n\nTherefore, the predecessor in the original graph is v, and the edge is v \u2192 u. \n\nWait, no. The original edge is from v to u. \n\nSo, the code is processing all nodes v that have an edge to u in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, for each such v, the code is considering the edge v \u2192 u. \n\nThe code wants to compute dis[v] (the minimal days for v) as deg[v] (out-degree of v) + dis[u]. \n\nWait, yes. Because for node v, one of its outgoing edges is to u. \n\nThe minimal days for v would be the minimal over all its outgoing edges of (deg[v] + dis[next_node]). \n\nSo, for the edge v\u2192u, the contribution is deg[v] + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the code is considering this possibility and updating dis[v] if this is better than the current dis[v]. \n\nTherefore, the condition should be whether dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u]). \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nthen update dis[v] and push to the queue. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'v' here is the node that has an edge to u. \n\nWait, the code's variable v is the destination of the reversed edge, which is the node that in the original graph has an edge to u. \n\nSo the current node being processed is u (the one popped from the priority queue), and the code is looking at all nodes v that can reach u via an edge. \n\nThe code is trying to compute dis[v] based on dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the condition is whether the current dis[v] is greater than (deg[v] + dis[u]). \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nthen set dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u], and push to the queue. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'v' is the predecessor node (the one with edge to u). \n\nTherefore, the code's loop is for each v (predecessor of u in the original graph), and the code is trying to compute dis[v] as deg[v] + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the condition is whether this new value is better than the current dis[v]. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nthen proceed to update. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'dis[v]' is the current value, and the new candidate is deg[v] + dis[u]. \n\nSo the condition is whether the new candidate is better (smaller) than the current dis[v]. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nBut wait, the code also has a deg[v]-- after that. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor each edge in the reversed graph's adjacency list of u (i.e., for each v that has an edge to u in the original graph):\n\n    v = gi.to[i]\n\n    if (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) {\n\n        dis[v] = deg[v] + dis[u]\n\n        q.push( ... )\n\n    }\n\n    deg[v]--;\n\nWait, why is deg[v] being decremented here? \n\nAh, perhaps the deg array is being used to track the number of edges remaining to process for each node. \n\nWait, the deg array in the code is initialized as the out-degree of each node. \n\nIn the code's solve function, for each edge in the reversed graph (i.e., each predecessor v of u in the original graph), after processing the edge, the code decrements deg[v]. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is part of a topological sort approach. \n\nWait, maybe the code is using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, but combined with Dijkstra's. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] here is being used to track the number of edges remaining to process for node v. \n\nWait, perhaps the deg array here is not the out-degree anymore, but something else. \n\nWait, the code's deg array is initialized as the out-degree of each node. \n\nIn the main function, for each edge u\u2192v, deg[u] is incremented. \n\nSo deg[u] is the out-degree of u. \n\nIn the solve function, for each edge in the reversed graph (i.e., for each predecessor v of u in the original graph), the code is decrementing deg[v]. \n\nWait, that would be decrementing the out-degree of v. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is part of a BFS-like approach where we process edges once all dependencies are met. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] here is being used to track the number of edges that have been processed for node v. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a BFS approach where each node v can only be processed once all its outgoing edges have been considered. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] is being used to count the number of edges that have been processed for v's outgoing edges. \n\nWait, I'm not sure. \n\nBut the code's current structure is that after checking the condition, it decrements deg[v]. \n\nPerhaps the deg array here is being used to track the number of edges remaining to process for each node. \n\nWait, maybe the code is using a priority queue to process nodes in order of their dis value, and for each node u, it processes all incoming edges (from predecessors v) and updates their dis[v] if possible. \n\nThe deg[v] is being decremented each time an edge is processed, but I'm not sure why. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] is the number of edges that need to be considered for node v. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a topological order approach. \n\nAlternatively, the decrementing of deg[v] is not necessary and might be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of edges that have been processed for each node. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the deg array here is being used to track the number of edges that are still available for each node. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too complicated. Let me refocus on the problem. \n\nThe correct condition for the TODO is to check whether the new candidate dis[v] (which is deg[v] + dis[u]) is better than the current dis[v]. \n\nTherefore, the code should have:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nThen, the code proceeds to update dis[v] and push to the queue. \n\nThe deg[v]-- is part of the code's existing structure, but perhaps it's not needed. \n\nWait, but in the code, after the if statement, the code does deg[v]--; \n\nWait, why is that? \n\nMaybe the deg array here is being used to track the number of edges that have been processed for each node. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deg array is being used to track the number of edges that are still unprocessed for each node. \n\nWait, the code's deg array is initialized as the out-degree of each node. \n\nIn the solve function, for each edge in the reversed graph (i.e., each predecessor v of u in the original graph), the code is decrementing deg[v]. \n\nWait, but the deg[v] is the out-degree of v. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using the deg array to track the number of edges that have been considered for each node. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a BFS-like approach where each node can only be processed once all its incoming edges have been considered. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] is being used to track the number of edges that have been processed for node v's outgoing edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the deg array to track the number of edges remaining to process for each node. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a BFS approach where each node's dis is only finalized once all its incoming edges have been processed. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the deg[v] is being decremented to track the number of edges that have been processed for node v's outgoing edges. \n\nWait, the code's loop is processing edges from v to u in the original graph. \n\nThe deg[v] is the out-degree of v. \n\nEach time an edge from v to u is processed, the code is decrementing deg[v]. \n\nPerhaps this is to track how many edges of v have been processed. \n\nWait, but the code is processing all edges of v (as predecessors of u), but this might not be the right way. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the deg array to track the number of edges remaining to process for each node. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a topological sort approach where nodes are processed in order of their dis value, and for each node u, we process all incoming edges (from v to u) and update the dis[v] accordingly. \n\nThe deg[v] is being decremented each time an edge from v to u is processed. \n\nOnce deg[v] reaches zero, it means all edges from v have been processed, and then we can finalize the dis[v]. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's deg array is not being used correctly here, and the decrement is a mistake. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints and the code's structure, perhaps the correct condition is simply checking whether the new dis[v] is better, and the deg[v]-- is part of the code's logic. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nSo the code should be filled with that condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to replace the TODO with that condition. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are:\n\nThe current node is u (the one popped from the priority queue). \n\nThe loop is over the reversed graph's edges for u, so each edge corresponds to a predecessor v of u in the original graph. \n\nThe code is trying to compute dis[v] as deg[v] (out-degree of v) + dis[u]. \n\nTherefore, the condition is whether this new value is better than the current dis[v]. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is:\n\nif (dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ndis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif(dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nThen, the rest of the code proceeds. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the condition inside the if statement. \n\nSo the final answer is to write that condition. \n\nThus, the code should have:\n\nif(dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])) \n\nSo the missing code is \"dis[v] > (deg[v] + dis[u])\"."
