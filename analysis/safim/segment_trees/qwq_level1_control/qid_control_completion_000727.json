Wait, but what about the else part? The else would handle everything else. The else part is currently set to x=4, which is correct for Division 4 (rating \u22641399). So the third condition (for Division 3) needs to cover 1400 to 1599. So the else if statement should be: else if (arr[i] >=1400 && arr[i] <=1599). Then x is set to 3. That way, if the rating is in that range, it picks Division 3. \n\nLet me double-check the ranges. Division 4 is anything below 1400. So if the first three conditions are checked in order, then the else would indeed catch all the rest, which are <=1399. So the missing code in the else if condition is \"arr[i] >=1400 && arr[i] <=1599\". Wait, but maybe I can write it as arr[i] between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. That's exactly the condition needed here. So the line should be else if(arr[i] >=1400 && arr[i] <=1599). Then the else will take care of the rest. I think that's all. Let me see the sample inputs given in the notes. For example, the sixth test case with 1679 should be Division 2, which the code would catch in the second condition. The fifth test case is 1400, which would hit the third condition (Division 3).",
