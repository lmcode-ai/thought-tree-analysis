The problem says each statement is i, j, x, meaning a_i OR a_j = x. And I need the lex smallest array. Lex smallest means that the first differing element should be as small as possible. So, for each position, we want the smallest possible value that doesn't violate any constraints. Hmm, the constraints are OR conditions between pairs. So for each pair (i,j), the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. First, I need to model the constraints properly. Let me think of each a_i as a binary number. The OR constraints can be thought of as upper and lower bounds on the bits of a_i and a_j. Wait, for a_i | a_j = x, each bit in x must be set if either a_i or a_j has that bit set. So, for each bit in x, if the bit is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit.",

Now, the lex smallest array is the one where the first element is as small as possible, then the second, etc. So, for each a_i, we want to set it as small as possible, but considering all constraints and the previous choices. Hmm, perhaps the way to model this is to track for each a_i the bits that must be set, and the bits that can be set. Let me think of each a_i as a set of bits. The minimal possible a_i is the minimal number that satisfies all constraints. The constraints for a_i are: For each constraint (i,j,x):\n\n- For each bit not in x: a_i's bit must be 0.\n\n- For each bit in x: either a_i has the bit set, or a_j has it set (or both).",

So, for each a_i in order from 1 to n:\n\n   Determine the minimal possible value for a_i, given the constraints involving it and the already chosen values of a_1 to a_{i-1}. But how to compute this? Let me think of the constraints involving a_i. For each constraint (i,j,x), the OR of a_i and a_j must be x. Suppose we are processing a_i now, and a_j has already been processed (if j < i). Then, the value of a_j is fixed, so the constraint (i,j,x) requires that a_i | a_j = x. So, a_i must be equal to (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, for a constraint (i,j,x):\n\nIf j has already been processed (j < i), then a_j is fixed. So, the constraint requires that a_i must be such that (a_i | a_j) = x. \n\nSo, a_i must be equal to (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits). Wait, perhaps more precisely, a_i must be a subset of x (since a_i | a_j can't have bits outside x). Also, the OR must be exactly x, so the bits in x not set in a_j must be set in a_i. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a_j is fixed. Then, the constraint (i,j,x) requires that a_i | a_j = x. So, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. Therefore, a_i must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. a_i | a_j = x \u2192 the OR can't exceed x, so a_i must be a subset of x (since a_j is a subset of x as well, because any bit not in x must be 0 in both a_i and a_j). Wait, actually, the bits not in x must be 0 in both a_i and a_j. So, a_i and a_j are subsets of x. So, the first condition is that a_i must be a subset of x. \n\nSecond, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. So, the bits in x that are not set in a_j must be set in a_i. Because, if a bit is set in x but not in a_j, then it must be set in a_i to get the OR to x. So, for a fixed a_j, the a_i must be exactly (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits that are in x). Wait, no, more precisely, a_i must be exactly (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's bits that are in x). Wait, perhaps the minimal a_i would be (x & ~a_j).",

Because, as explained earlier, the bits not set in a_j must be set in a_i to reach x. So, this gives a_i's value as (x & ~a_j). However, there might be multiple such constraints. For example, if there are two constraints (i,j1,x1) and (i,j2,x2), then a_i must satisfy both (a_i | a_j1 = x1) and (a_i | a_j2 = x2). So, the a_i must be the intersection of the required values from each constraint. Wait, but how?\n\n      Let me think: \n\n      Suppose there are two constraints (i,j1,x1) and (i,j2,x2). The first requires a_i must be (x1 & ~a_j1). The second requires a_i must be (x2 & ~a_j2). So, a_i must be equal to both of those values. Therefore, (x1 & ~a_j1) must equal (x2 & ~a_j2). If they are not equal, then there is no solution, but the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable. So, in our case, we can assume that all constraints are compatible. So, for all constraints involving a_i and already processed variables, the required a_i must be the same.",

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to model for each a_i the minimal possible value, considering all constraints. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0. For each bit from highest to lowest (29 downto 0): For this bit, we can decide whether to set it in any a_i such that all constraints are satisfied. To do this, we can first check all constraints that require this bit to be set in at least one of the variables.",

But how to handle overlapping constraints? For example, suppose two constraints (i,j,x) and (i,k,x) both require the bit to be set. Then, for the first constraint, we might set it in j (if j > i), and for the second, set it in k (if k > i). This way, the bit is set in both j and k, but that's okay. The key is that for each constraint, at least one variable has the bit set. This approach should satisfy all the constraints for the bits set in x.",

So, the code for each constraint in the bit's list is:\n\nif ( (a[i] & (1 << b)) == 0 && (a[j] & (1 << b)) == 0 )\n\nthen set the bit in the higher index. This way, each constraint is checked, and if neither has the bit set, we set it in the higher index. This should ensure that for all constraints involving this bit, at least one of the variables has the bit set. Now, after processing all bits, the array a will satisfy all the OR constraints. Now, we need to ensure that the array is lex smallest. Because for each bit, we set the bit in the higher index when possible, this should minimize the earlier elements. For example, between two variables i and j (i < j), setting the bit in j leaves i as small as possible. Thus, this approach should give the lex smallest array. Now, let's test this with the sample input. Sample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first sample's input is:\n\nn=4, q=3\n\nThe statements are:\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 (i=0, j=1, x=3)\n\n2 3 0 \u2192 (i=1, j=2, x=0)\n\n3 4 2 \u2192 (i=2, j=3, x=2) Wait, but the sample's first note lists possible arrays like [2,1,0,0]. Wait, perhaps the actual input is different. But regardless, the algorithm should work. Now, let's see for the first constraint (i=0, j=1, x=3 (binary 11)): Processing bit 1 (the second bit, since 3 is 11): Initially, a[0] and a[1] are 0. Neither has bit 1 set. The higher index is 1 (since j=1 is higher than i=0). So, set bit 1 in a[1].",

In this case, the second constraint (i=1, j=2, x=0) requires that all bits in a[1] and a[2] are 0. But the first constraint requires that a[0] | a[1] = 3, so a[1] must be at least 3. This is a contradiction, but the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable. So, perhaps my example is invalid. Wait, perhaps the sample input is different. The sample's first note says that one of the valid arrays is [2,1,0,0]. Let me see what constraints that array would satisfy. Suppose the constraints are: For example, the first constraint could be (1,2,3):\n\na[0] is 2 (10), a[1] is 1 (01). OR is 11 (3), which matches. The second constraint (2,3,0):\n\na[1] is 1, a[2] is 0 \u2192 OR is 1, which doesn't match 0. Hmm, so perhaps my example is not correct. Maybe the second constraint is (2,3, 0) would require a[1] | a[2] =0 \u2192 both must be 0. But in the sample array, a[1] is 1, so that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. The sample's first note lists [2,1,0,0] as a valid array. Perhaps the constraints are different. Maybe the second constraint is (3,4, 0), which would be a[2] and a[3], which are 0 and 0 \u2192 OR is 0. Ah, perhaps the second constraint is between indices 3 and 4 (0-based 2 and 3). So, in that case, the first constraint (1,2,3) \u2192 a[0] | a[1] =3. Second constraint (3,4,0) \u2192 a[2] | a[3] =0. Third constraint (something else). In that case, the algorithm would handle the first constraint by setting a[1] to 3 (bits 1 and 0). The second constraint requires that a[2] and a[3] are 0.",

So, the algorithm as described would not handle those constraints. So, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Hmm, so I need to think of another way. Alternative Idea:\n\nEach a_i can be represented as a bitmask. The constraints are that for each (i,j,x), a_i | a_j = x. The minimal array is the lex smallest possible.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the lexicographically smallest array a that satisfies all the given OR statements. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says each statement is i, j, x, meaning a_i OR a_j = x. And I need the lex smallest array. Lex smallest means that the first differing element should be as small as possible. So, for each position, we want the smallest possible value that doesn't violate any constraints.\n\nHmm, the constraints are OR conditions between pairs. So for each pair (i,j), the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\nFirst, I need to model the constraints properly. Let me think of each a_i as a binary number. The OR constraints can be thought of as upper and lower bounds on the bits of a_i and a_j. \n\nWait, for a_i | a_j = x, each bit in x must be set if either a_i or a_j has that bit set. So, for each bit in x, if the bit is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit. Because if either had a 1, the OR would be 1. So that's a crucial point. \n\nSo for any bit that is 0 in x, both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit. That's a hard constraint. \n\nFor bits set in x, at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit set. But since we want the lex smallest array, perhaps we can set bits as low as possible unless forced otherwise.\n\nThe lex smallest array would prefer smaller numbers earlier. So, for each position, we want the minimal possible value, but considering all constraints.\n\nHmm, how do I model this?\n\nMaybe for each a_i, we can track the bits that must be set, and the bits that can be set or not. But since the constraints are between pairs, it's a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each a_i the minimal possible bits that must be set, and the maximal possible bits that can be set. Wait, but the OR constraints can impose both lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, let's think of each a_i as a number. Let me consider each bit from the highest to the lowest (since lex order is determined by the first differing element, but bits higher up affect the value more). Wait, actually, lex order is based on the array elements from first to last. So for lex smallest, we need the first element as small as possible, then the second, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to determine for each a_i the minimal possible value, considering all constraints, and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the constraints as follows:\n\nFor each statement (i,j,x):\n\n- a_i | a_j must equal x.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- For all bits where x has a 0, both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit.\n\n- For bits where x has a 1, at least one of a_i or a_j must have 1 in that bit.\n\nSo, for each bit position b (from 0 to 29, since x is less than 2^30), we can process the constraints.\n\nBut how do we model this for all the variables?\n\nAlternatively, for each a_i, we can track the bits that must be set, and the bits that can be set. But since the constraints are between pairs, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each a_i the minimal possible value, given all constraints. To do this, we can model the constraints as follows:\n\nEach a_i must be at least the OR of all the constraints that require it to have certain bits set. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps we can track for each a_i the bits that must be set, and the bits that can be set.\n\nAlternatively, for each a_i, the bits that must be set are those that are required by some constraint. Let me think:\n\nSuppose there is a constraint (i,j,x). For each bit in x that is set, at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit set. So, if all other constraints don't require that bit to be set in a_i, then perhaps we can choose to set it in a_j instead, to keep a_i as small as possible.\n\nBut since we want lex smallest array, perhaps for the earliest indices, we want to minimize their values, so we need to set bits as low as possible unless forced.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to model for each a_i the lower and upper bounds of their possible values.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible a_i is the OR of all the constraints that require a_i to have certain bits. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by graph-based approaches:\n\nEach constraint (i,j,x) imposes that a_i | a_j = x. Let me think of this as:\n\n- For each bit in x that is 0, both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit.\n\n- For each bit in x that is 1, at least one of a_i or a_j must have 1 in that bit.\n\nSo, for each bit b:\n\nIf x has bit b set to 0, then both a_i and a_j must have 0 in that bit.\n\nIf x has bit b set to 1, then at least one of a_i or a_j must have 1 in that bit.\n\nSo, for each bit, we can model the constraints for all variables.\n\nLet me think of each bit separately. Let's process each bit from the highest to the lowest (since higher bits have higher priority in the lex order? Wait, no, lex order is based on the array elements from first to last. So, for lex smallest, we need the first element as small as possible, then the second, etc. So, for each element, we want to set its bits as low as possible, but considering all constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each bit, we can decide whether it can be set in a_i or not, but ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nThen, for each bit from the highest (like 29 down to 0), decide for each a_i whether to set that bit, but only if necessary to satisfy the constraints.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each bit b, starting from the highest (since higher bits contribute more to the value, so setting them later allows us to minimize the lex order?), we can decide whether to set the bit in a_i or not, but ensuring that all constraints are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nThe lex smallest array is the one where the first element is as small as possible, then the second, etc. So, for each position i from 1 to n, we want to set a_i as small as possible, given the constraints and the previous choices.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, for each a_i, the minimal possible value is the OR of all the constraints that involve it. Wait, not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for each constraint (i,j,x), the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. So, the OR can't be less than x, but also can't be more. Wait, no, the OR is exactly x. So, the OR must equal x. So, the OR can't be more than x, but also can't be less. Wait, the OR is exactly x. So, the OR must be exactly x. So, the constraints are that a_i | a_j = x. \n\nSo, for each such constraint, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\nHmm, so for each such constraint, the bits set in x must be exactly the union of the bits set in a_i and a_j. \n\nSo, for each bit in x, at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit set. \n\nFor bits not in x, neither can have that bit set. \n\nSo, the constraints can be broken down into:\n\nFor each constraint (i,j,x):\n\n- For all bits not set in x: a_i's bit and a_j's bit must both be 0.\n\n- For all bits set in x: at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit set.\n\nSo, the first part (bits not in x) gives us hard constraints that a_i and a_j can't have those bits set. \n\nThe second part (bits in x) gives us that at least one of them must have the bit set. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to setting the bits of each a_i such that all these constraints are met, and the array is lex smallest.\n\nNow, the lex smallest array is the one where the first element is as small as possible, then the second, etc. So, for each a_i, we want to set it as small as possible, but considering all constraints and the previous choices.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to track for each a_i the bits that must be set, and the bits that can be set. \n\nLet me think of each a_i as a set of bits. The minimal possible a_i is the minimal number that satisfies all constraints. \n\nThe constraints for a_i are:\n\nFor each constraint (i,j,x):\n\n- For each bit not in x: a_i's bit must be 0.\n\n- For each bit in x: either a_i has the bit set, or a_j has it set (or both).\n\nSo, for each a_i, the bits that are required to be set are those bits where in some constraint (i,j,x), the bit is set in x, and in all other constraints involving i and that bit, it's required that a_i must have the bit set. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each bit b:\n\nIf there exists a constraint (i,j,x) where x has bit b set, then either a_i or a_j must have bit b set. \n\nBut for a_i, the bit can be set or not, as long as in every constraint involving it and that bit, at least one of the variables has it set.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal way to set the bits is to set a bit in a_i only if it's required by some constraint where the other variable can't have it set. \n\nAlternatively, for each bit b, we can track for each a_i whether it must have that bit set, or can have it set, or must not have it.\n\nWait, let's think of the constraints for each bit:\n\nFor a given bit b:\n\nAll constraints (i,j,x) where x has bit b set. \n\nFor each such constraint, at least one of a_i or a_j must have bit b set. \n\nAdditionally, for any constraint (i,j,x) where x does not have bit b set, neither a_i nor a_j can have bit b set. \n\nSo, for each bit b, the variables involved in constraints where x has bit b set must have at least one of them set in that bit. \n\nBut variables not involved in any such constraints can have that bit set or not, but since we want lex smallest, we would prefer not to set it unless necessary.\n\nWait, but variables not involved in any constraints for bit b can have that bit set or not, but since the lex order is to minimize the array, we would prefer to not set it unless required.\n\nHmm, so for each bit b, the variables involved in constraints with x having that bit must have at least one of them set. \n\nThe minimal way to satisfy this is to set the bit in as few variables as possible, preferably the ones that come later in the array (since earlier variables are prioritized for being as small as possible). \n\nWait, but since we want lex smallest, for the earliest variables, we want to set their bits as low as possible. So, for a given bit b, if there are multiple variables involved in constraints requiring that bit, we can choose to set it in the latest possible variable, so that the earlier variables can stay as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each bit b, we can process the variables in order from first to last, and decide whether to set the bit in a_i only if necessary.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to process each bit from the highest to the lowest (since higher bits contribute more to the value, so setting them later allows us to minimize the lex order). For each bit, we decide for each a_i whether to set it, considering the constraints and the previous decisions.\n\nAlternatively, here's an algorithm idea:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nFor each bit from the highest (29) down to 0:\n\n   For this bit, check all constraints that involve this bit (i.e., where x has this bit set).\n\n   For each such constraint (i,j,x), the bit must be set in at least one of a_i or a_j.\n\n   Now, to satisfy this, we can choose to set the bit in a_i or a_j, but in a way that keeps the array lex smallest.\n\n   To do this, for each such constraint, if neither a_i nor a_j has the bit set yet, we need to set it in at least one of them. \n\n   To minimize lex order, we want to set it in the later index (since earlier indices are already as small as possible). \n\nWait, but how to track this?\n\nAlternatively, for each bit b, we can track for each variable whether it can have the bit set or not, and then decide the minimal way.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by greedy algorithms:\n\nFor each bit from highest to lowest (since higher bits have higher priority in the value, so setting them later allows us to minimize the lex order):\n\n   For this bit, we need to decide for each a_i whether to set it, but ensuring that all constraints involving this bit are satisfied.\n\n   The constraints for this bit are all the constraints (i,j,x) where x has this bit set. \n\n   For each such constraint, at least one of a_i or a_j must have the bit set.\n\n   To satisfy all these constraints, we can set the bit in some variables, but in a way that the lex order is minimized.\n\n   To minimize lex order, we want to set the bit as late as possible. \n\n   So, for each such constraint (i,j,x), if neither a_i nor a_j has the bit set yet, we can choose to set it in the variable with the higher index (so that the earlier variables remain as small as possible).\n\nWait, but how to do this systematically?\n\nAlternatively, for each bit b:\n\n   We can first collect all the constraints that require this bit to be set in at least one of the variables in the pair.\n\n   Then, for each such pair (i,j), if neither a_i nor a_j has the bit set yet, we need to set it in at least one of them. \n\n   To choose which one, we can set it in the variable with the higher index, so that the earlier variables can stay as small as possible.\n\n   However, this might not cover all cases, because there could be multiple constraints involving the same variables.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to model for each bit b:\n\n   The variables involved in any constraint with this bit must have at least one of them set. \n\n   To minimize the lex order, we can set the bit in the latest possible variable in each such group.\n\nAlternatively, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nFor each bit from 29 down to 0:\n\n   Let's process this bit.\n\n   For all constraints (i,j,x) where the bit is set in x:\n\n      The current a_i and a_j may already have this bit set. If not, then at least one of them must be set.\n\n   So, for this bit, we need to ensure that for every such constraint, at least one of a_i or a_j has the bit set.\n\n   To do this, we can iterate over all variables and see which ones can have the bit set without violating previous constraints (i.e., bits already set in lower positions).\n\n   Wait, perhaps the way to do this is:\n\n   For the current bit b:\n\n      For all variables i from 1 to n:\n\n         If there exists any constraint (i,j,x) where x has bit b set, and neither a_i nor a_j has bit b set yet, then we need to set the bit in at least one of them.\n\n      To choose which variables to set, we can greedily set the bit in the latest possible variables first, so that earlier variables can stay as small as possible.\n\n      Alternatively, for each such constraint (i,j,x), if neither has the bit set, we can set it in the variable with the higher index (j if j > i, else i). \n\n      But this might not be sufficient, because there could be overlapping constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to model for each bit, the variables that must have the bit set. \n\nWait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach a_i can be thought of as a set of bits. The constraints are that for each (i,j,x), the union of a_i and a_j's bits must exactly equal the bits of x. \n\nSo, for each bit in x, it must be present in at least one of a_i or a_j. \n\nFor bits not in x, they must be absent in both.\n\nSo, the minimal array is the one where each a_i is as small as possible, but still satisfies all constraints.\n\nTo find the lex smallest array, we can process each a_i in order from first to last, and for each, set its bits as low as possible, but ensuring that all constraints involving it are satisfied.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the fact that lex order is determined by the first element, then the second, etc. So, for each a_i, we want to set it as small as possible, given the constraints and the previous choices for a_1 to a_{i-1}.\n\nSo, for each a_i in order from 1 to n:\n\n   Determine the minimal possible value for a_i, given the constraints involving it and the already chosen values of a_1 to a_{i-1}.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the constraints involving a_i. For each constraint (i,j,x), the OR of a_i and a_j must be x. \n\nSuppose we are processing a_i now, and a_j has already been processed (if j < i). Then, the value of a_j is fixed, so the constraint (i,j,x) requires that a_i | a_j = x. \n\nSo, a_i must be equal to (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a constraint (i,j,x):\n\nIf j has already been processed (j < i), then a_j is fixed. So, the constraint requires that a_i must be such that (a_i | a_j) = x. \n\nSo, a_i must be equal to (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits). Wait, perhaps more precisely, a_i must be a subset of x (since a_i | a_j can't have bits outside x). Also, the OR must be exactly x, so the bits in x not set in a_j must be set in a_i. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a_j is fixed. Then, the constraint (i,j,x) requires that a_i | a_j = x. \n\nSo, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\nTherefore, a_i must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. a_i | a_j = x \u2192 the OR can't exceed x, so a_i must be a subset of x (since a_j is a subset of x as well, because any bit not in x must be 0 in both a_i and a_j). \n\nWait, actually, the bits not in x must be 0 in both a_i and a_j. So, a_i and a_j are subsets of x. \n\nSo, the first condition is that a_i must be a subset of x. \n\nSecond, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\nSo, the bits in x that are not set in a_j must be set in a_i. \n\nBecause, if a bit is set in x but not in a_j, then it must be set in a_i to get the OR to x. \n\nSo, for a fixed a_j, the a_i must be exactly (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's existing bits that are in x). Wait, no, more precisely, a_i must be exactly (x & ~a_j) | (a_i's bits that are in x). Wait, perhaps the minimal a_i would be (x & ~a_j). Because that's the minimal possible a_i that, when ORed with a_j, gives x. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a_j is fixed. Then, to get a_i | a_j = x, the a_i must have all the bits in x that are not set in a_j. The other bits (those set in a_j) can be 0 or 1, but since we want the minimal a_i, we should set them to 0. \n\nSo, the minimal a_i in this case is (x & ~a_j). \n\nBut this is only for the constraints where j has already been processed. \n\nHowever, there might be other constraints involving a_i and other variables that haven't been processed yet. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model for each a_i the minimal possible value that satisfies all constraints involving it and the variables processed so far. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nProcess the variables in order from 1 to n (since we want lex smallest, so earlier variables are fixed first).\n\nFor each a_i in order:\n\n   For all constraints involving a_i and a_j where j < i (already processed):\n\n      The constraint (i,j,x) requires that a_i | a_j = x. \n\n      Since a_j is already fixed, this gives a_i must be exactly (x & ~a_j). \n\n      Because, as explained earlier, the bits not set in a_j must be set in a_i to reach x. \n\n      So, this gives a_i's value as (x & ~a_j). \n\n      However, there might be multiple such constraints. \n\n      For example, if there are two constraints (i,j1,x1) and (i,j2,x2), then a_i must satisfy both (a_i | a_j1 = x1) and (a_i | a_j2 = x2). \n\n      So, the a_i must be the intersection of the required values from each constraint. \n\n      Wait, but how?\n\n      Let me think: \n\n      Suppose there are two constraints (i,j1,x1) and (i,j2,x2). \n\n      The first requires a_i must be (x1 & ~a_j1). \n\n      The second requires a_i must be (x2 & ~a_j2). \n\n      So, a_i must be equal to both of those values. \n\n      Therefore, (x1 & ~a_j1) must equal (x2 & ~a_j2). \n\n      If they are not equal, then there is no solution, but the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable. \n\n      So, in our case, we can assume that all constraints are compatible. \n\n      So, for all constraints involving a_i and already processed variables, the required a_i must be the same. \n\n      So, when processing a_i, we can collect all the constraints where j < i, and compute the required a_i from each, and they must all agree. \n\n      The a_i is then set to that value. \n\n      However, there might also be constraints where j > i (not yet processed). Those can be handled later. \n\n   Additionally, there may be constraints involving a_i and variables j > i (not yet processed). \n\n   For those, we can't determine a_i's value yet, but we can track the constraints and ensure that when those variables are processed, their values will satisfy the constraints with a_i. \n\nWait, but how to handle the constraints where both variables are unprocessed (i and j are both > current index). \n\nHmm, this seems tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to handle this is to track for each a_i the minimal possible value that satisfies all constraints involving it and already processed variables, and also track the constraints that involve unprocessed variables. \n\nBut this might get complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's another idea inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach constraint (i,j,x) imposes that a_i must be a subset of x, and a_j must also be a subset of x. \n\nAdditionally, the OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\nSo, for each a_i, the value must be a subset of x for all constraints involving it. \n\nMoreover, for each bit in x, if it's not set in a_i, then it must be set in the other variable in the constraint. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal array can be constructed by setting each a_i to the OR of all the constraints that require it to have certain bits. \n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each a_i, the minimal possible value is the OR of all the constraints that involve it and require it to have certain bits. \n\nWait, perhaps for each a_i, the minimal value is the OR of all x's from constraints where a_i is part of the pair and the other variable's value is known. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by bitmask constraints:\n\nWe can represent for each a_i the lower and upper bounds of its possible value. \n\nThe lower bound is the minimal possible value, and the upper bound is the maximal possible. \n\nInitially, all a_i can be 0, but subject to constraints. \n\nFor each constraint (i,j,x):\n\n   The OR of a_i and a_j must be exactly x. \n\n   So, the lower bound for a_i is (x & ~a_j) if a_j is fixed. \n\n   But since variables are processed in order, perhaps we can track for each a_i the required bits. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nFor each bit from highest to lowest (starting from 29 down to 0):\n\n   For this bit, we need to decide whether to set it in any a_i such that all constraints involving this bit are satisfied. \n\n   For each constraint (i,j,x) where x has this bit set:\n\n      If neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set yet, then at least one of them must be set. \n\n      To minimize the lex order, we want to set it in the variable with the higher index (so that earlier variables can stay as small as possible). \n\n      So, for each such pair (i,j), if neither has the bit set, we set it in the variable with the higher index. \n\n      However, this might not be sufficient because there could be multiple constraints involving the same variables. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach can work. Let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose we have a constraint (i=1, j=2, x=3 (binary 11)). \n\nInitially, both a1 and a2 are 0. \n\nProcessing bit 1 (the second bit, since 3 is 11 in binary):\n\n   For this bit (bit 1), the constraint requires that at least one of a1 or a2 has it set. \n\n   Since neither has it set yet, we choose to set it in the higher index (2). \n\n   So, set a2's bit 1 to 1. \n\nThen, processing bit 0 (the first bit):\n\n   The constraint requires that at least one of a1 or a2 has it set. \n\n   Currently, a2 has bit 1 set but not bit 0. \n\n   So, neither has bit 0 set. \n\n   So, we set it in the higher index (2). \n\n   Now, a2 is 3 (binary 11). \n\n   The OR of a1 (0) and a2 (3) is 3, which matches x. \n\nThis works. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are two constraints (1,2,3) and (1,3,3). \n\nProcessing bit 1:\n\n   For (1,2,3), set bit in 2. \n\n   For (1,3,3), set bit in 3. \n\nProcessing bit 0:\n\n   For (1,2,3), set bit in 2. \n\n   For (1,3,3), set bit in 3. \n\nSo, a2 and a3 have bit 0 and 1 set. \n\nThen, a1 can stay 0. \n\nThe OR of a1 and a2 is 3, and a1 and a3 is 3. \n\nThis works. \n\nThis seems promising. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nFor each bit from highest (29) down to 0:\n\n   For all constraints (i,j,x) where x has this bit set:\n\n      if neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set yet:\n\n          set the bit in the variable with the higher index (i or j). \n\n          (if i and j are the same, but the problem says i and j can be same? Wait, the input says 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 n. So, they can be the same. But in that case, the constraint is a_i | a_i = x \u2192 a_i must be exactly x. So, if i=j, then x must be a_i. So, in that case, the bit must be set in a_i if x has it set. \n\n          So, in the case where i == j, then for each bit in x, a_i must have it set. \n\n          So, in that case, when processing the bit, we must set it in a_i. \n\n          So, in the algorithm, when i == j, then we must set the bit in a_i. \n\n          So, in the general case, for a constraint (i,j,x):\n\n              if i == j:\n\n                  then a_i must have exactly the bits of x. \n\n                  So, for each bit in x, set it in a_i. \n\n              else:\n\n                  if neither has the bit set yet, set it in the higher index. \n\n          So, the algorithm would need to handle the case when i == j. \n\nHmm, so the steps would be:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0.\n\nProcess each bit from highest to lowest (29 downto 0):\n\n   For each constraint (i,j,x) in the list of constraints:\n\n      if (x & (1 << b)) == 0:\n\n          // this bit must be 0 in both a_i and a_j. \n\n          // but since we are processing bits in order, and we are setting bits only when necessary, \n\n          // perhaps this is already handled by not setting the bit. \n\n          // but need to ensure that neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set. \n\n          // Wait, but how? Because if in previous steps, a_i or a_j had this bit set, that would violate the constraint. \n\n          // So, this is a problem. \n\n          // Oh wait, this is a constraint that requires that the bit is 0 in both a_i and a_j. \n\n          // So, if during processing of this bit, either a_i or a_j has it set, then it's invalid. \n\n          // But the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable, so this can't happen. \n\n          // So, perhaps we can ignore this part, since the constraints are guaranteed to be satisfiable. \n\n          // But how to handle this in the algorithm?\n\n          // Hmm, this is a problem. \n\n          // Because for bits not set in x, the a_i and a_j must have 0 in those bits. \n\n          // So, if during processing of other bits, we set a bit that is not allowed, then it would violate the constraint. \n\n          // So, the algorithm must ensure that for any bit not in x, neither a_i nor a_j has it set. \n\n          // But how?\n\n          // This complicates things. \n\n          // So, perhaps the algorithm needs to track for each a_i the bits that are allowed. \n\n          // Alternatively, perhaps the constraints for bits not in x can be handled by ensuring that whenever a bit is set in a_i or a_j, it must be present in all x's of the constraints involving them. \n\n          // This seems difficult. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The current approach only handles the bits that are set in x, but the constraints also require that for bits not set in x, the variables must not have those bits set. \n\nSo, the algorithm as described would not handle those constraints. \n\nSo, perhaps the approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to think of another way. \n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nEach a_i can be represented as a bitmask. \n\nThe constraints are that for each (i,j,x), a_i | a_j = x. \n\nThe minimal array is the lex smallest possible. \n\nTo satisfy all constraints, for each bit b:\n\n   For all constraints (i,j,x) where x has bit b set, at least one of a_i or a_j must have bit b set. \n\n   For all constraints (i,j,x) where x does not have bit b set, neither a_i nor a_j can have bit b set. \n\nSo, the bits not in any x's must be 0 in all a_i. \n\nWait, no. For a bit b not present in any x of any constraint involving a_i and a_j, then the constraints don't impose anything on that bit for those variables. \n\nWait, but for any pair (i,j) not involved in any constraint with a particular bit, they can have that bit set or not, but since we want lex smallest, we would prefer not to set it. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to model for each a_i the minimal possible value, considering all constraints. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0. \n\nFor each bit from highest to lowest (29 downto 0):\n\n   For this bit, we can decide whether to set it in any a_i such that all constraints are satisfied. \n\n   To do this, we can first check all constraints that require this bit to be set in at least one of the variables. \n\n   For each such constraint (i,j,x) where x has this bit set:\n\n      if neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set yet, then we must set it in at least one of them. \n\n      To minimize the lex order, we want to set it in the variable with the higher index. \n\n      So, for each such pair (i,j), if neither has the bit set, we set it in the higher index. \n\n   Additionally, for any constraints where the bit is not set in x, we must ensure that neither a_i nor a_j has the bit set. \n\n   But how to handle that? \n\n   Since we are processing bits in order from highest to lowest, and we are only setting bits when necessary, the bits not required by any constraint will remain 0. \n\n   So, the only problem is when a constraint requires that a bit is not set, but another constraint allows it. \n\n   Wait, but the constraints for bits not in x require that the bit is 0 in both variables. \n\n   So, if any constraint (i,j,x) has this bit not set in x, then a_i and a_j must not have this bit set. \n\n   So, if during processing of this bit, any of those variables have the bit set, that would violate the constraint. \n\n   So, this suggests that the algorithm must first process all constraints for the bit and ensure that the bit is not set in any variables involved in constraints where the bit is not in x. \n\n   But this seems impossible to track. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the current approach doesn't handle the constraints where the bit is not set in x. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to first process all constraints and for each bit, track the variables that must have it set or not. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nThe sample's first case has statements like (1,2,3), (2,3,0), etc. \n\nWait, the sample's first note lists possible arrays. \n\nThe key is that for each bit, the variables involved in constraints requiring that bit must have at least one of them set. \n\nTo minimize the array lex order, we want to set the bit in the latest possible variable. \n\nSo, for each bit, we can process all constraints involving that bit and decide which variables to set the bit in. \n\nThe algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0. \n\nFor each bit from highest to lowest (29 downto 0):\n\n   Create a list of all constraints where x has this bit set. \n\n   For each such constraint (i,j,x):\n\n      if neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set yet:\n\n          mark the higher index (i or j) to have this bit set. \n\n          (if i == j, then set it in that variable)\n\n   Then, for all variables marked in this step, set the bit. \n\nThis way, for each bit, we set it in the latest possible variables, ensuring that the earlier variables are as small as possible. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping constraints? \n\nFor example, suppose two constraints (i,j,x) and (i,k,x) both require the bit to be set. \n\nThen, for the first constraint, we might set it in j (if j > i), and for the second, set it in k (if k > i). \n\nThis way, the bit is set in both j and k, but that's okay. \n\nThe key is that for each constraint, at least one variable has the bit set. \n\nThis approach should satisfy all the constraints for the bits set in x. \n\nFor the bits not set in any x of the constraints involving a pair, those bits must be 0 in both variables. \n\nBut how to ensure that? \n\nAh, right, because those bits are not processed in any of the bit steps. \n\nWait, for a bit b that is not set in any x of any constraint involving a pair (i,j), then the constraints for those pairs require that neither a_i nor a_j has bit b set. \n\nSo, since we are not processing that bit (since it's not in any x of any constraint), the variables will remain 0 in that bit, which satisfies the constraints. \n\nSo, this approach handles both cases. \n\nThe only thing left is to handle the case where a constraint (i,j,x) has a bit not set in x, but some other constraint involving i or j allows that bit. \n\nWait, no. Because for any bit not in x, the constraints (i,j,x) require that neither a_i nor a_j has that bit set. \n\nSo, if any other constraint allows that bit to be set, then it would violate the first constraint. \n\nBut the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable, so this can't happen. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is safe. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize all a_i to 0. \n\nFor each bit from highest (29) down to 0:\n\n   For this bit, collect all constraints where x has this bit set. \n\n   For each such constraint (i,j,x):\n\n      if neither a_i nor a_j has this bit set yet:\n\n          choose the higher index between i and j (or either if they are equal), and set the bit in that variable. \n\n   After processing all constraints for this bit, the variables chosen will have the bit set. \n\nThis way, for each constraint (i,j,x) with this bit set in x, at least one of a_i or a_j has the bit set. \n\nThis should satisfy all the OR constraints. \n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently. \n\nThe problem has n up to 1e5 and q up to 2e5. \n\nProcessing each bit from 0 to 29 (30 bits) and for each bit, processing all q constraints would be O(30*q) which is acceptable (6e6 operations). \n\nWait, but for each bit, we have to process all constraints. \n\nWait, but for each constraint, we can pre-process which bits are set in x. \n\nAlternatively, for each constraint, we can store it in a list for each bit that is set in x. \n\nThis way, for each bit b, we can have a list of constraints that involve that bit. \n\nThis way, during processing of bit b, we can iterate over only the constraints that have that bit set. \n\nThis would reduce the total operations to O(30 * q), which is manageable. \n\nSo, the steps for implementation:\n\n- Preprocess all constraints, and for each bit b, store the list of constraints where x has bit b set. \n\n- Initialize an array a of size n, all 0. \n\n- For each bit from 29 downto 0:\n\n   Get the list of constraints for this bit. \n\n   For each constraint in the list:\n\n      i and j are 1-based indices. \n\n      Convert to 0-based (since arrays are 0-based in C#). \n\n      Check if a[i] has bit b set OR a[j] has bit b set. \n\n      If neither has it set:\n\n          decide which to set. \n\n          if i == j:\n\n              set the bit in a[i]. \n\n          else:\n\n              if j > i: set in j. \n\n              else: set in i. \n\n          (Wait, the higher index between i and j (0-based or 1-based? The problem says 1-based input. So when converting to 0-based, the indices are 0-based. So, for example, if the input is i=2 and j=3, then in 0-based they are 1 and 2, so j is higher. \n\n          So, the higher index is max(i,j). \n\n          So, the code would be:\n\n          int higher = (i > j) ? i : j;\n\n          set the bit in a[higher]. \n\n      So, for each such case, set the bit in the higher index. \n\n   However, this may have overlapping constraints. For example, two constraints involving the same pair may require the same bit. \n\n   But since we process all constraints for the bit, and for each constraint that hasn't been satisfied yet, we set the bit in the higher index, this should work. \n\nWait, but when processing a constraint, if the higher index was already set by a previous constraint in the same bit iteration, then this constraint is already satisfied. \n\nSo, the code for each constraint in the bit's list is:\n\nif ( (a[i] & (1 << b)) == 0 && (a[j] & (1 << b)) == 0 )\n\nthen set the bit in the higher index. \n\nThis way, each constraint is checked, and if neither has the bit set, we set it in the higher index. \n\nThis should ensure that for all constraints involving this bit, at least one of the variables has the bit set. \n\nNow, after processing all bits, the array a will satisfy all the OR constraints. \n\nNow, we need to ensure that the array is lex smallest. \n\nBecause for each bit, we set the bit in the higher index when possible, this should minimize the earlier elements. \n\nFor example, between two variables i and j (i < j), setting the bit in j leaves i as small as possible. \n\nThus, this approach should give the lex smallest array. \n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first sample's input is:\n\nn=4, q=3\n\nThe statements are:\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 (i=0, j=1, x=3)\n\n2 3 0 \u2192 (i=1, j=2, x=0)\n\n3 4 2 \u2192 (i=2, j=3, x=2)\n\nWait, but the sample's first note lists possible arrays like [2,1,0,0]. \n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is different. \n\nBut regardless, the algorithm should work. \n\nNow, let's see for the first constraint (i=0, j=1, x=3 (binary 11)):\n\nProcessing bit 1 (the second bit, since 3 is 11):\n\nInitially, a[0] and a[1] are 0. \n\nNeither has bit 1 set. \n\nThe higher index is 1 (since j=1 is higher than i=0). \n\nSo, set bit 1 in a[1]. \n\nThen, processing bit 0 (the first bit):\n\nNeither a[0] nor a[1] has bit 0 set. \n\nSet in higher index (1). \n\nNow, a[1] is 3 (binary 11). \n\nThe second constraint (i=1, j=2, x=0):\n\nx is 0, so this is a constraint that requires both a[1] and a[2] to have 0 in all bits. \n\nBut since a[1] is already 3, this is impossible. \n\nWait, this suggests a problem. \n\nAh, right! The second constraint (i=2, j=3, x=0) would require that a[1] | a[2] = 0. \n\nBut a[1] is already 3, so this is impossible. \n\nWait, this indicates that my approach is missing something. \n\nWait, the second constraint (i=2, j=3, x=0) would require that both a[1] and a[2] have 0 in all bits. \n\nBut in the first constraint, a[1] is set to 3. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nSo, the algorithm would fail here. \n\nAh, so the problem is that the algorithm only handles the bits set in x, but the constraints for bits not set in x must also be considered. \n\nIn this case, the second constraint (i=1, j=2, x=0) requires that all bits in a[1] and a[2] are 0. \n\nBut the first constraint requires that a[0] | a[1] = 3, so a[1] must be at least 3. \n\nThis is a contradiction, but the problem states that all constraints are satisfiable. \n\nSo, perhaps my example is invalid. \n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. \n\nThe sample's first note says that one of the valid arrays is [2,1,0,0]. \n\nLet me see what constraints that array would satisfy. \n\nSuppose the constraints are:\n\nFor example, the first constraint could be (1,2,3):\n\na[0] is 2 (10), a[1] is 1 (01). OR is 11 (3), which matches. \n\nThe second constraint (2,3,0):\n\na[1] is 1, a[2] is 0 \u2192 OR is 1, which doesn't match 0. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my example is not correct. \n\nMaybe the second constraint is (2,3, 0) would require a[1] | a[2] =0 \u2192 both must be 0. \n\nBut in the sample array, a[1] is 1, so that's not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. \n\nThe sample's first note lists [2,1,0,0] as a valid array. \n\nPerhaps the constraints are different. \n\nMaybe the second constraint is (3,4, 0), which would be a[2] and a[3], which are 0 and 0 \u2192 OR is 0. \n\nAh, perhaps the second constraint is between indices 3 and 4 (0-based 2 and 3). \n\nSo, in that case, the first constraint (1,2,3) \u2192 a[0] | a[1] =3. \n\nSecond constraint (3,4,0) \u2192 a[2] | a[3] =0. \n\nThird constraint (something else). \n\nIn that case, the algorithm would handle the first constraint by setting a[1] to 3 (bits 1 and 0). \n\nThe second constraint requires that a[2] and a[3] are 0. \n\nSo, during processing of bit 0 and 1, the second constraint would require that neither a[2] nor a[3] have those bits set. \n\nBut since the algorithm only processes bits set in x, the second constraint's x is 0, so no bits are processed for it. \n\nThus, the algorithm would not set any bits for those variables, so they remain 0. \n\nThus, the first constraint is satisfied (a[0] and a[1] are 0 and 3 \u2192 OR is 3). \n\nThe second constraint is satisfied (0 and 0 \u2192 OR 0). \n\nSo, the algorithm would work. \n\nBut how does the algorithm handle the second constraint's requirement that a[1] and a[2] must not have any bits set? \n\nWait, the second constraint is between indices 2 and 3 (0-based), so it's (i=2, j=3, x=0). \n\nThe x is 0, so for all bits, the constraint requires that neither a[2] nor a[3] have those bits set. \n\nThus, during processing of any bit b, if any of the variables a[2] or a[3] have that bit set, it would violate the constraint. \n\nBut the algorithm only sets bits for constraints where x has the bit set. \n\nSo, for the second constraint (x=0), no bits are processed. \n\nThus, the variables a[2] and a[3] remain 0, which is correct. \n\nThe first constraint's variables are a[0] and a[1]. \n\nThe algorithm sets a[1] to 3 (bits 0 and 1). \n\nThus, the first constraint is satisfied. \n\nSo, the algorithm works in this case. \n\nThe problem is that the algorithm doesn't handle the constraints where x has 0 bits. \n\nBut those constraints are handled by the fact that the variables involved cannot have any bits set. \n\nSince the algorithm only sets bits when required by a constraint with x having that bit set, the variables in constraints with x=0 will remain 0, which is correct. \n\nThus, the algorithm should work. \n\nNow, the implementation steps:\n\nFirst, read n and q. \n\nThen read q constraints, storing each as (i, j, x). \n\nThen, for each bit from 0 to 29, we need to collect all constraints where x has that bit set. \n\nWe can create an array of lists, say constraintsPerBit[30], where each entry is a list of constraints (i,j,x) where the bit is set in x. \n\nThen, initialize the a array to all 0. \n\nThen, for each bit from 29 downto 0:\n\n   Get the list of constraints for this bit. \n\n   For each constraint in the list:\n\n      i and j are 1-based, so convert to 0-based. \n\n      current_i = i-1, current_j = j-1. \n\n      check if (a[current_i] & (1 << b)) == 0 and (a[current_j] & (1 << b)) == 0. \n\n      if so:\n\n          decide which to set. \n\n          if current_i == current_j:\n\n              set the bit in a[current_i]. \n\n          else:\n\n              if current_j > current_i:\n\n                  set in current_j. \n\n              else:\n\n                  set in current_i. \n\n          So, the higher index is max(current_i, current_j). \n\n          So:\n\n          int higher = Math.Max(current_i, current_j);\n\n          a[higher] |= (1 << b); \n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, the code in C#:\n\nLooking at the provided code, the MainD function is the one to implement. \n\nThe code currently has some incomplete parts. \n\nThe problem is to fill in the missing code in MainD. \n\nThe existing code in MainD:\n\nvar n = arr0[0];\n\nvar qc = arr0[1];\n\nvar allCons = Enumerable.Range(0, n).Select(_ => new List<ConD>()).ToArray();\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < qc; i++) {\n\n    var qr = ReadIntArr();\n\n    var l = qr[0] - 1;\n\n    var r = qr[1] - 1;\n\n    var c = new ConD {\n\n        L = Math.Min(l, r),\n\n        R = Math.Max(l, r),\n\n        Value = qr[2],\n\n        Rest = qr[2],\n\n    };\n\n    allCons[c.L].Add(c);\n\n    allCons[c.R].Add(c);\n\n}\n\nThen, there's some code that is incomplete. \n\nWait, the existing code seems to be trying a different approach, perhaps involving bitwise AND and OR constraints. \n\nBut the user's problem requires the OR constraints. \n\nThe existing code in MainD is probably incorrect and needs to be replaced with the correct approach. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nThe code provided has a MainD function that is incomplete. \n\nThe task is to complete MainD to solve the problem. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to implement the algorithm I described. \n\nThus, the code for MainD should be:\n\nRead n and q. \n\nRead all the constraints. \n\nPreprocess the constraints into a list per bit. \n\nThen, process each bit from highest to lowest, and set the bits as described. \n\nFinally, output the array. \n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nprivate static void MainD()\n\n{\n\n    var arr0 = ReadIntArr();\n\n    var n = arr0[0];\n\n    var q = arr0[1];\n\n    // Read all constraints and group by bit.\n\n    var constraintsPerBit = new List<(int i, int j, int x)>[30];\n\n    for (int b = 0; b < 30; b++) constraintsPerBit[b] = new List<(int, int, int)>();\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++)\n\n    {\n\n        var qr = ReadIntArr();\n\n        int i1 = qr[0] - 1; // 0-based\n\n        int j1 = qr[1] - 1;\n\n        int x = qr[2];\n\n        for (int b = 0; b < 30; b++)\n\n        {\n\n            if ((x & (1 << b)) != 0)\n\n            {\n\n                constraintsPerBit[b].Add( (i1, j1, x) );\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    var a = new int[n];\n\n    for (int b = 29;
