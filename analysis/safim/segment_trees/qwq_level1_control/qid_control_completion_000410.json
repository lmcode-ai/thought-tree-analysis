Let's think about the movement of the pointer. Each forward move (operation 1) increases the current element and moves right. Each backward move (operation 2) decreases the current and moves left. The pointer starts at position 0 and must end there. So, the total number of steps to the right must equal the steps to the left? Not exactly, but maybe the path must form a kind of walk that returns to the start. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the path of the pointer. Let's think of the pointer's movement as a sequence of steps. Each time you do an operation 1, you move right, and each operation 2 moves left. The total displacement must be zero since you end where you started. But each step's direction affects the elements. Wait, but each operation also modifies the array.

Then, the code can check this. In the code provided, the loop is iterating over the array, adding each element to 'sum', and checking some condition. The 'sum' variable is the cumulative sum up to the current index. The code currently has a 'flag' that is set if some condition is met. The code then outputs NO if flag is set or sum !=0. So the condition in the loop is probably checking whether the cumulative sum ever becomes negative. Wait, in the code, the 'sum' is the cumulative sum of the array elements.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the condition that will determine whether the given array can be formed through the allowed operations. Let me think through the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that we start with all zeros and a pointer at the first element. The operations are either moving forward (increasing current by 1 and moving next) or moving backward (decreasing current by 1 and moving previous). But in the end, the pointer must be back at the first element. \n\nHmm, the key here is to model the possible sequences of operations and see what constraints the array must satisfy. Let's think about the movement of the pointer. Each forward move (operation 1) increases the current element and moves right. Each backward move (operation 2) decreases the current and moves left. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0 and must end there. So, the total number of steps to the right must equal the steps to the left? Not exactly, but maybe the path must form a kind of walk that returns to the start. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the path of the pointer. Let's think of the pointer's movement as a sequence of steps. Each time you do an operation 1, you move right, and each operation 2 moves left. The total displacement must be zero since you end where you started. But each step's direction affects the elements.\n\nWait, but each operation also modifies the array. So the array's elements are built up by these operations. Let me think of the process as building the array through these steps. \n\nLet me consider the net effect on each element. For example, every time the pointer moves forward over an element, it might contribute to its value. But when moving backward, it subtracts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the array's differences can be analyzed. Let's think of the required conditions. \n\nSuppose we track the path of the pointer. Let's model the path as a sequence of positions. Each time you perform an operation 1, you go to the next position, and operation 2 takes you back. The path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are determined by how many times each position was incremented minus the number of times it was decremented. \n\nWait, each time you pass through a position via a forward step, you add 1 to it. But when you move backward, you subtract 1. So for each position i, the value a[i] is equal to (number of times you moved forward through it) minus (number of times you moved backward through it). \n\nHmm, but how do the steps contribute? Let me think of each step as moving from position j to j+1 (operation 1) or j to j-1 (operation 2). Each such step affects the current position before moving. \n\nWait, the operation 1: you are at position j, you add 1 to a[j], then move to j+1. \n\nOperation 2: you are at position j, subtract 1 from a[j], then move to j-1. \n\nSo each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current cell before moving. Each backward move subtracts 1 from current before moving back. \n\nThe total for a cell is the number of times you did a forward step from it minus the number of backward steps into it? Or maybe the net of all the times you were there in forward steps and backward steps. \n\nAlternatively, the value of a[i] is equal to (the number of times you entered i via a forward step) minus (the number of times you exited via a backward step). Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think step by step. \n\nSuppose the pointer is at position i. If you do a forward step, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. So that's one increment to a[i]. \n\nIf you are at position i and do a backward step (so you must have come from i+1?), you subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1. \n\nSo each time you are at position i, any forward step adds 1, and any backward step subtracts 1. \n\nThe total a[i] is the number of times you did a forward step from i minus the number of backward steps from i. \n\nBut how do these steps relate to the path? \n\nThe path is a sequence of positions starting at 0 and ending at 0. Let's model the path as a sequence of moves. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. \n\nEach time you move forward, you are at position j, then move to j+1. Each backward step is from j to j-1. \n\nThe total number of times you are at position i is equal to the number of times you entered it via a forward step plus the number of times you entered via a backward step. \n\nWait, but each time you are at position i, you can choose to go forward or backward (unless at the ends). \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the differences between consecutive elements. Let me think of the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the path's movement. Let's consider the path as a sequence of steps. The pointer starts at 0 and must return to 0. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. But each step is either +1 or -1 in position. So the total number of forward steps must equal the number of backward steps. \n\nWait, the total number of steps to the right (forward) must equal the steps to the left (backward), because the net displacement is zero. \n\nBut how does this relate to the array's values? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times you passed through them in a forward direction versus backward. \n\nWait, for each position i (except the first and last?), the number of times you entered via forward steps must equal the number of times you exited via backward steps plus some difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy certain parity conditions. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem by considering the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me think of the process as building up the array through the operations. \n\nLet me consider the path of the pointer. Let's imagine that the path is a sequence of moves. Each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current cell. Each time you move backward, subtract 1. \n\nThe total for each cell is the number of forward steps from it minus the number of backward steps from it. \n\nNow, the path starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me think of the path as a walk that starts and ends at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of positions: p_0, p_1, ..., p_k, where p_0 = 0 and p_k = 0. \n\nEach step from p_i to p_{i+1} is either +1 or -1. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times it was exited via a forward step (i to i+1) is equal to the number of times the path went from i to i+1. Similarly, the number of backward steps from i is the number of times the path went from i to i-1. \n\nThe value a[i] is equal to (number of forward steps from i) minus (number of backward steps from i). \n\nHmm, so for each position i, a[i] = (forward_count[i] - backward_count[i]). \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the difference between consecutive elements. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me consider the differences between a[i] and a[i-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the parity of the elements. \n\nWait, let me think of the path. Each time you move forward, you add 1 to the current cell. Each backward step subtracts 1 from the current cell. \n\nThe total for each cell is the net of these operations. \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. Let me think of the path as a series of moves. \n\nLet me consider the cumulative effect. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a series of moves. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nLet me think of the total number of times you pass through each cell. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all a[i] must be zero? Because every time you do a forward step, you add 1, and a backward step subtracts 1. But each forward step is followed by a move, and each backward step is preceded by a move. \n\nWait, the total sum of all a[i] would be equal to the total number of forward steps minus the total number of backward steps. \n\nBecause each forward step adds 1 to a cell, and each backward step subtracts 1 from a cell. \n\nBut the total number of forward steps must equal the number of backward steps, because the path starts and ends at 0. \n\nWait, the total displacement is zero. The number of forward steps (each +1) minus backward steps (each -1) must equal zero. So forward_steps = backward_steps. \n\nTherefore, the total sum of a[i] must be (forward_steps - backward_steps) = 0. \n\nSo the first condition is that the sum of all elements must be zero. \n\nBut in the code provided, there is a 'sum' variable that is being accumulated. The code checks if sum !=0, then outputs NO. So that's already part of the code. \n\nBut in the problem's sample input, maybe there's more. \n\nWait, the code currently has a loop where for each i, it adds a[i] to sum. Then, inside the loop, there's a condition that if some condition is true, set flag=1 and break. \n\nThe code then checks if flag is 1 OR sum !=0, then output NO. \n\nSo the flag is set when some condition is met during the loop, which would trigger a NO even if the sum is zero. \n\nSo the problem requires more conditions than just the sum being zero. \n\nWhat other conditions must be met? \n\nLet me think of the path. The pointer can't go beyond the array's bounds. So when moving forward, you can't go past the last element. Similarly for backward steps. \n\nBut the problem allows any number of operations, but the array must be formed. \n\nAnother thought: the path must be such that whenever you are at position i, you can only move forward if you are not at the last position, and backward if not at first. \n\nBut how does this affect the array's structure? \n\nPerhaps the key is to model the required conditions on the array's elements. Let me think of the path's movement and how the a[i] values are built. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk that starts and ends at 0. Let me model the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose we track the current position and the accumulated steps. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the differences between adjacent elements. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me consider the differences between a[i] and a[i-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the parity of the elements must alternate in some way. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path's movement. Each time you move forward, you are contributing to the current cell. \n\nWait, here's an idea: the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum (from the start up to each position) must not drop below certain values. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me model the required conditions for the array. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me think of the required conditions. \n\nLet me consider the following approach: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. To reach position i, you must have moved forward some number of times. \n\nBut when moving backward, you can decrease the current cell. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required path's constraints. \n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem by considering the required path's \"balance\". \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the required path's \"height\". \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1] + something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences between consecutive elements must be non-negative in some way. \n\nWait, let me think of the process in terms of the path. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of steps. Let me think of the path as a series of moves. \n\nEach time you move forward, you add 1 to the current cell. \n\nEach time you move backward, you subtract 1 from the current cell. \n\nThe total for each cell is the number of times you moved forward from it minus the number of times you moved backward from it. \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me consider the path as a walk. Let me model the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose we have the array a. Let me think of the path's movement. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of times we move forward from position i as F[i], and the number of times we move backward from position i as B[i]. \n\nThen, a[i] = F[i] - B[i]. \n\nThe total number of forward steps must equal the total backward steps, since the path starts and ends at 0. \n\nAlso, for each position except the first and last, the number of times you enter must equal the number of times you exit. \n\nWait, for position i (not 0 or n-1), the number of times you enter via forward steps (from i-1) plus the number of times you enter via backward steps (from i+1) must equal the number of times you exit via forward steps (to i+1) plus the number of times you exit via backward steps (to i-1). \n\nHmm, this might be getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem by considering the path's movement and the required conditions on the array. \n\nLet me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nSuppose we start at 0. \n\nEvery time we move forward, we add 1 to the current cell and move to the next. \n\nEvery time we move backward, subtract 1 and move to previous. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nNow, the array a must be the result of all these operations. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions for the array. \n\nSuppose I process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me think of the required \"balance\" at each step. \n\nSuppose I track the current position and the number of steps taken. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum up to each position (starting from the first) must not be negative. Wait, perhaps not exactly. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose the path is a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nThe array's elements are determined by the net number of times each position was incremented over decremented. \n\nNow, the key insight might be that the array must satisfy that the difference between consecutive elements must be non-negative when moving forward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of (a[i] + a[i-1]) or something similar must be non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nLet me consider the required path. The path can be represented as a series of moves. \n\nEach time you move forward, you are at position i, add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. \n\nEach backward move subtracts 1 from a[i], then move to i-1. \n\nThe total for a[i] is (number of forward steps from i) minus (number of backward steps from i). \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose I track the current position and the number of steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by some similar problems: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the sum of all elements is zero (which is already checked in the code). \n\nAdditionally, the following must hold: \n\nFor all positions i from 1 to n-1, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. \n\nWait, why? Let me think. \n\nSuppose you are at position i-1. To get to position i, you have to move forward, which increases a[i-1] by 1. \n\nBut if you want to go back, you have to subtract from a[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the difference between a[i] and a[i-1] must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample input. \n\nIn the note, the second test case's example array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive elements: \n\n2 to -1 is -3, which is negative. \n\n-1 to -1 is 0, then -1 to 0 is +1. \n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cumulative sum must not drop below zero? \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a series of steps. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are the net increments/decrements. \n\nNow, the key idea is that whenever you move backward, you have to have previously moved forward to that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of a[0..i] must be non-negative? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nLet me consider the path's movement. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nSuppose I model the problem by considering the required path's \"balance\". \n\nLet me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me track the current position and the number of steps taken. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose you have to move forward to reach position i. Each time you move forward from i-1, you add 1 to a[i-1]. \n\nBut to get back to previous positions, you have to subtract from a[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must be such that the differences between consecutive elements are non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the first element. \n\nSuppose the first element a[0] is the number of times you moved forward from it minus the number of times you moved backward from it. \n\nBut since you start at 0, you can only move forward from 0 (unless you immediately move back, but that would require moving backward from 0, which is impossible). \n\nWait, the first position can only have forward steps, except when you return to it at the end. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the elements are non-negative except for the last one? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nThe sample input 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe process in the note shows that the pointer moves forward and backward in such a way that the elements can have negative values. \n\nHmm, so the array can have negative values. \n\nAnother idea: Let me model the problem by considering the path's movement and the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose the path is a walk that starts and ends at 0. \n\nLet me consider the difference between the number of forward steps and backward steps at each position. \n\nThe array a[i] = F[i] - B[i], where F[i] is the number of forward steps from i, and B[i] is the number of backward steps from i. \n\nNow, the total number of forward steps must equal the total backward steps. \n\nAlso, for each position except the first and last, the number of times you enter must equal the number of times you exit. \n\nWait, for position i (not 0 or n-1), the number of times you enter via forward steps (from i-1) plus the number of times you enter via backward steps (from i+1) must equal the number of times you exit via forward steps (to i+1) plus the number of times you exit via backward steps (to i-1). \n\nBut F[i] is the number of times you exit via forward steps (since each forward step from i is an exit to i+1). \n\nSimilarly, B[i] is the number of times you exit via backward steps (exit to i-1). \n\nThe number of times you enter via forward steps is F[i-1], since each forward step from i-1 leads to i. \n\nThe number of times you enter via backward steps is B[i+1], since each backward step from i+1 leads to i. \n\nSo for position i (not 0 or n-1), the total entries must equal the total exits. \n\nSo: \n\nF[i-1] + B[i+1] = F[i] + B[i] \n\nBut since a[i] = F[i] - B[i], rearranged: \n\nF[i] = a[i] + B[i] \n\nSubstituting into the equation: \n\nF[i-1] + B[i+1] = (a[i] + B[i]) + B[i] \n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the path's movement and the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me track the current position and the required steps. \n\nSuppose I start at position 0. \n\nEvery time I move forward, I add 1 to the current cell and move to the next. \n\nEvery time I move backward, subtract 1 from current and move to previous. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nThe array a must be the result of all these operations. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me model the required conditions on the array. \n\nSuppose I process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me think of the required \"balance\" at each step. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote the current position as pos. \n\nThe total steps taken so far. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum of the elements up to each position (starting from the first) must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose I track the current position. \n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. \n\nSuppose I model the path as a series of moves. \n\nLet me think of the path's \"height\" as the current position. \n\nThe path starts at 0, ends at 0. \n\nThe array's elements are the net increments/decrements. \n\nNow, the key idea is that the path must never go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nBut how does this relate to the array's elements? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the value a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose you have to move forward to reach position i. Each time you move forward from i-1, you add 1 to a[i-1]. \n\nBut to get back to previous positions, you have to subtract from a[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the array must satisfy that the differences between consecutive elements are non-positive. \n\nWait, let me see the sample input 2's array: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe differences between consecutive elements are: \n\n2 to -1: -3 \n\n-1 to -1: 0 \n\n-1 to 0: +1 \n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cumulative sum of the array up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the cumulative sum. \n\nSuppose the cumulative sum after each element is S_i = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]. \n\nIn the sample input 2, the cumulative sums are: \n\n2 \u2192 2+(-1)=1 \u2192 1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 0+0=0. \n\nSo all cumulative sums are non-negative. \n\nHmm, that's interesting. \n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 1, 0. \n\nWhich is okay. \n\nAnother example: [3, -2, -1]. \n\nCumulative sums: 3, 1, 0. \n\nOkay. \n\nWhat about an array that is invalid? \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2]. \n\nSum is 3, which is not zero \u2192 invalid. \n\nAnother example: [0, 1]. \n\nSum is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nAnother example: [2, -3, 1]. Sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, -1, 0 \u2192 the second cumulative sum is negative. So this array would be invalid. \n\nSo perhaps the condition is that the cumulative sum must never be negative at any point. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum here is the sum of the array elements up to that point. \n\nWait, but in the problem's first sample note, the first test case's array might have a cumulative sum that goes negative. \n\nWait, the first test case's note says that in the first test case, the array can be obtained but the pointer isn't on the first element. So the array is valid except for the pointer condition. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the pointer ends at the first element. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative sum must be non-negative, and also the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the array's cumulative sum up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nThen, the code can check this. \n\nIn the code provided, the loop is iterating over the array, adding each element to 'sum', and checking some condition. \n\nThe 'sum' variable is the cumulative sum up to the current index. \n\nThe code currently has a 'flag' that is set if some condition is met. \n\nThe code then outputs NO if flag is set or sum !=0. \n\nSo the condition in the loop is probably checking whether the cumulative sum ever becomes negative. \n\nWait, in the code, the 'sum' is the cumulative sum of the array elements. \n\nWait, but the problem's array can have negative elements. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum of the array elements up to each position must be non-negative? \n\nWait, in the sample input 2's array, the cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. All non-negative. \n\nAnother example where the cumulative sum is negative would be invalid. \n\nSo the condition is: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nAND \n\nThe cumulative sum of the array elements from the first to the i-th must be non-negative for all i from 0 to n-1. \n\nWait, but the array can have negative elements. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum must not drop below zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the path. \n\nSuppose the cumulative sum is the number of times you have moved forward minus backward steps up to that point. \n\nWait, no. The cumulative sum of the array elements is (sum_{i=0 to k} a[i]) = (F_total - B_total) up to that point? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i is equal to the net number of steps taken to the right minus left steps up to that point. \n\nHmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be non-negative because otherwise, you can't have enough forward steps to reach that position. \n\nWait, let me think of the path. \n\nSuppose you are at position i. To reach there, you must have taken more forward steps than backward steps. \n\nThe cumulative sum up to i is the net steps taken to reach that position. \n\nWait, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i is equal to the net steps taken to reach that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be equal to the current position. \n\nWait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be equal to the number of times you've been at that position. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the path's movement. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of moves. Let me track the current position. \n\nThe current position starts at 0. \n\nEach forward step increases the current position by 1. \n\nEach backward step decreases it by 1. \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nThe array a[i] is the number of times you were at position i and did a forward step minus the number of times you were there and did a backward step. \n\nWait, but each time you are at position i, you can choose to move forward or backward (if possible). \n\nThe total a[i] is (number of forward steps from i) minus (number of backward steps from i). \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk. \n\nThe key idea is that the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose the cumulative sum up to position i is S_i = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]. \n\nThis S_i must be >=0 for all i. \n\nBecause, to reach position i, you must have taken more forward steps than backward steps up to that point. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum S_i represents the net steps taken to reach position i. \n\nWait, the current position after processing up to i would be equal to the cumulative sum of the array up to i? \n\nHmm, maybe not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be equal to the current position after processing up to that point. \n\nWait, let me think of the path. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of steps. \n\nThe current position after each step is tracked. \n\nThe array's elements are the net increments/decrements. \n\nThe cumulative sum of the array up to position i is the net number of times you've added 1 to that position minus subtracted. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative sum of the array up to position i must be non-negative because otherwise, you can't have enough forward steps to reach that position. \n\nWait, let me think of an example where the cumulative sum is negative. \n\nSuppose the array is [1, -2]. \n\nSum is -1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nAnother example: [2, -3, 1]. Sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, -1, 0. \n\nThe second cumulative sum is -1, which is negative. \n\nThis array would be invalid. \n\nSo the condition is that all cumulative sums must be non-negative. \n\nSo the code needs to check two things: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. All cumulative sums (prefix sums) are non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the last condition? \n\nWait, the cumulative sum must also be non-negative at every step. \n\nSo in the code, the loop is iterating through the array, accumulating the sum. \n\nThe 'flag' is set if the sum becomes negative. \n\nSo the condition in the loop should be: if (sum < 0), then set flag to 1. \n\nBecause if the cumulative sum ever becomes negative, it's impossible. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (sum < 0) { flag = 1; break; } \n\nThen, after the loop, if flag is set or sum !=0 \u2192 output NO. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'sum' variable is being accumulated as the sum of the array elements. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the cumulative sum of the array elements up to each position must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but the array's elements are the a[i], so the cumulative sum is exactly the sum of the first i+1 elements. \n\nSo the code's current loop is adding each a[i] to 'sum', and checking if sum <0. \n\nYes! \n\nSo the missing condition is: \n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 set flag to 1. \n\nSo in the code's loop: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    sum += a[i]; \n\n    if (sum <0) { \n\n        flag=1; \n\n        break; \n\n    } \n\n    ... \n\n} \n\nThen, after the loop, if flag is set or sum !=0 \u2192 output NO. \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the 'sum' is being accumulated as the sum of the array elements. \n\nSo the code's current setup is correct except for the condition in the loop. \n\nThe code's current loop has: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    sum += a[i]; \n\n    if( /* condition */ ) { \n\n        flag=1; \n\n        break; \n\n    } \n\n    if (sum ==0) { \n\n        check=1; \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nWait, but the 'check' variable is not used anywhere. \n\nAh, perhaps the code's author intended to check something else, but the correct condition is to check if the cumulative sum ever becomes negative. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nSo the code inside the loop's condition should be: \n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 set flag to 1. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    sum += a[i]; \n\n    if (sum <0) { \n\n        flag=1; \n\n        break; \n\n    } \n\n    ... \n\n} \n\nThen, after the loop, if flag is set (meaning sum went negative) or the total sum is not zero \u2192 output NO. \n\nWait, but the total sum is already being tracked. \n\nWait, the code's 'sum' variable is the total sum of the array. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the loop is adding each a[i] to 'sum', so after the loop, sum is the total sum of the array. \n\nSo the code's current setup is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is the condition in the loop's if statement: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nThus, the code's missing part is the condition in the if statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in is: \n\nsum < 0 \n\nSo the code inside the loop's if statement is: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    sum += a[i]; \n\n    if (sum <0) { \n\n        flag=1; \n\n        break; \n\n    } \n\n    ... \n\n} \n\nThus, the missing code is \"sum <0\". \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the 'sum' is being added each a[i], so the cumulative sum up to i is stored in 'sum' after each iteration. \n\nTherefore, the condition is correct. \n\nSo the code's missing part is the condition in the if statement: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nSo the code to fill in is \"sum <0\". \n\nTherefore, the correct code to insert is: \n\nsum < 0 \n\nSo the code inside the loop's if statement is: \n\nif (sum <0) \n\nThus, the missing code is \"sum <0\". \n\nNow, looking back at the problem's sample input 2: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 2, 1, 0, 0. All non-negative \u2192 allowed. \n\nAnother test case where the cumulative sum is negative would be rejected. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nThe code also checks that the total sum is zero. \n\nSo the final conditions are: \n\n- The total sum must be zero. \n\n- All prefix sums must be non-negative. \n\nHence, the missing code is \"sum <0\"."
