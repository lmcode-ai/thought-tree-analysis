Hmm, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must hold:\n\n- The robot's starting column y must be >=0 (obviously, since it's given). Wait, the robot's starting position is (x,y). To reach (0,0), it must move left y times (so y must be >=0, which it is) and up x times (so x must be >=0, which it is). But the problem is whether those moves can be done in a way that all robots can move in those directions at each step. So, for the robot to move left y times, each time the minimal column of all robots must be >=1 before each left move. Similarly, for moving up x times, each time the minimal row of all robots must be >=1 before each up move. Wait, but the order of moves matters. For example, if the robot moves up first, then the other robots' positions may allow for left moves. Alternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe robot's starting column y must be <= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all robots can also move left). Wait, no. Wait, the minimal column is the smallest column among all robots. To move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So, the robot's column can be any value as long as the minimal column is >=1. Wait, perhaps the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1. So, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. So, for the robot to move left once, the minimal column must be >=1. After moving left, the minimal column becomes (min_col -1). So, to move left again, the new minimal column must be >=1 again. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two robots: one at (0,1) and another at (0,3). The target is (0,0). The robot at (0,1) can reach (0,0) by moving left once. But to do that, all robots must be able to move left. The second robot is at column 3, so moving left is okay.",

So the minimal steps would be moving left y times and up x times, but the order must be such that all robots can move in those directions at each step. Alternatively, the robot can take any path, but the directions must be allowed. Hmm, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's starting column y must be >= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all robots can also move left). Wait, no. Wait, the minimal column is the smallest column among all robots. To move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So the robot's column can be anything as long as the minimal column is >=1. Wait, perhaps the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1. So, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. So, the robot's column must be >=1, but also, all other robots must be in columns >=1. Similarly, to move up, the minimal row of all robots must be >=1. Therefore, for the robot to move left once, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. After moving left, the minimal column decreases by 1. So, to move left again, the new minimal column must be >=1 again.",

Wait, but the order of moves must be such that when moving up, the minimal row is sufficient. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the robot is at (x,y), and the minimal row of all robots is R_min >=x.\n\nThen, to move up x times, each time the minimal row must be >=1 before the move. The first up move requires that the minimal row is >=1. The second requires that after first move, the minimal row is (R_min -1) >=1 \u2192 R_min >=2. Continuing, after x moves, the initial R_min must be >=x. So yes, the initial R_min must be >=x.\n\nSimilarly for columns. Therefore, the conditions are sufficient. So, the algorithm can be: For each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n2. Else, for each robot:\n\n   a. Let (x,y) be its position. b. Compute the minimal row among all robots (min_row). c. Compute the minimal column among all robots (min_col). d. Check if (min_row >=x) and (min_col >=y). e. If any robot satisfies this, output YES. 3. If none do, output NO. Wait, that's a possible approach. Let me test this with the examples. First example from the note:\n\nFirst test case: suppose the robot is at (0,1). The minimal column is 1 (since that's the only robot?), so min_col =1. y=1. So min_col >= y \u2192 1 >=1 \u2192 yes. min_row is 0 (since x is 0). So min_row (0) >=x (0) \u2192 yes. So conditions are met. So output YES. Which matches the note.

So min_col (1) <2 \u2192 so the second robot's condition is not met. So neither can reach (0,0). So the answer is NO. That would be a case like the second test case. So the algorithm would work here. Another example from the note: third test case, where moving left is sufficient. Suppose robot is at (0,2), and other robots are at columns >=2. The minimal column is 2. So for the robot at (0,2), min_col (2) >=2 \u2192 yes. So conditions met. Fourth test case: already has a robot at (0,0), so output YES. Fifth test case: the note says a sequence of moves like up, left, up. Wait, perhaps the robot starts at (2,1). To reach (0,0), needs to move up twice and left once. The minimal row must be >=2 (the robot's x is 2). Suppose other robots are at rows >=2. So min_row is 2. So 2 >=2 \u2192 yes. The minimal column is 1 (the robot's column). So min_col (1) >=1 \u2192 yes. So conditions are met. So the algorithm would output YES. The sixth test case: the note says that trying to move any robot to the upper left causes another to explode. Suppose there are two robots: one at (0,1) and another at (1,0). The minimal row is 0 (from first robot), minimal column is 0 (from second robot). For the first robot (0,1):\n\nx=0, so min_row (0) >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ny=1. min_col is 0 <1 \u2192 so condition fails. For the second robot (1,0):\n\nx=1. min_row is 0 <1 \u2192 condition fails. y=0. min_col is 0 >=0 \u2192 yes. So neither can satisfy both conditions. So the answer is NO, which matches the note. So this algorithm seems to work. Therefore, the steps are: For each test case:\n\n- Check if any robot is at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n- Else, compute the minimal row (min_row) and minimal column (min_col) among all robots.\n\n- For each robot (x,y):\n\n   if (x <= min_row) and (y <= min_col) \u2192 then this robot can reach (0,0). So output YES.\n\n- If none do, output NO. Wait, wait, the conditions are min_row >=x and min_col >=y. Because the minimal row must be at least the robot's x (so that when moving up x times, the minimal row is sufficient). Wait, the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for the robot's row x, the minimal row must be <=x. Because the minimal row is the smallest row of all robots. So if the minimal row is less than x, then there exists a robot in a row less than x. So when moving up, that robot would have to move up, but if the minimal row is already less than x, then the minimal row is already less than x, so the robot's x is larger than the minimal row. So the minimal row can't be >=x unless all robots are in rows >=x.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the conditions. The minimal row among all robots is the smallest row any robot is in. For the robot at (x,y) to be able to move up x times, the minimal row must be >=x? No, that can't be.",

So when moving up, that robot would have to move up, but if it's already in row 0, then moving up would cause it to explode. Wait, the minimal row is the smallest row of all robots. To move up, all robots must be in rows >=1. So the minimal row must be >=1 before the move. To move up x times, the initial minimal row must be >=x. Because each up move reduces the minimal row by 1. So after x moves, the minimal row would be (initial_min_row -x). To allow all x moves, the initial_min_row must be >=x.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose initial_min_row is R. To move up once, R must be >=1. After moving up, the new minimal row is R-1. To move up again, the new minimal row must be >=1 \u2192 R-1 >=1 \u2192 R >=2. Continuing, after x moves, the initial R must be >=x. So yes, the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nSimilarly for columns. So the conditions are:\n\nFor a robot at (x,y):\n\nmin_row >=x and min_col >=y. So the algorithm is correct. Now, how to implement this in the given code. The current code is trying to find some variables x1,y1 and x2,y2, but that's not the right approach. We need to:\n\n1. For each test case:\n\n   a. Read n and m (the code uses 'r' for m). b. Read the grid. c. Check if any cell (0,0) is 'R'. If yes, output YES. d. Else, compute min_row and min_col among all robots. e. For each robot's position (x,y), check if min_row >=x and min_col >=y. If any such robot exists, output YES. f. Else, output NO. So the code needs to be rewritten to do this. Now, let's see the current code's structure. The code reads n and r (m is r here). Then reads n lines of strings. Then, in the first loop, it's trying to find x1,y1 as the first 'R' encountered. Then, in the second loop, it's trying to find x2,y2 as the first 'R' in column-major order. Then, it checks if x1 ==x2 and y1 ==y2. That's not correct. We need to:\n\n- Find all the robot positions. - Check if any is at (0,0). - Compute min_row and min_col.\n\n- Check for any robot (x,y) whether min_row >=x and min_col >=y. So, let's think of the code steps. First, in the code:\n\nAfter reading n and r (m is r), read the grid into a array of strings. Then, collect all the robot positions. So, first, we can loop through all rows and columns to find all 'R's. We can have a list of coordinates (x,y) for each 'R'. Then:\n\nCheck if any of them is (0,0). If yes, output YES. Else:\n\nCompute min_row as the minimum x among all robots. Compute min_col as the minimum y among all robots. Then, for each (x,y) in the list of robots:\n\n   if (x <= min_row) \u2192 no, wait, no. Wait, min_row is the minimum x of all robots. So for any robot, its x is >= min_row. Because min_row is the smallest x.\n\nWait, min_row is the minimum of all x's. So for any robot's x, x >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x is only possible if min_row ==x, and x is the smallest. Wait, this is a problem. Because the condition requires that min_row (the minimal row) is >=x. But since min_row is the minimal row, it is the smallest x among all robots. So for any robot's x, x >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x == min_row. So the condition min_row >=x is equivalent to x == min_row. Wait, this can't be right. So there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me re-express:\n\nThe minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row x is >= min_row. The condition for the robot to be able to move up x times is that the initial minimal row must be >=x. But since min_row is the minimal row, which is <= all x's, this can only be true if min_row >=x \u2192 which requires that min_row >=x and min_row <=x (since it's the minimal). So this is only possible if min_row ==x and x is the minimal row. So the condition can only be true if the robot's x is equal to the minimal row. Wait, this is a problem. So my earlier reasoning was wrong. Hmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Let me re-express the problem. The minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row is >= min_row. To move up x times (where x is the robot's current row), the minimal row must be >=x? But since min_row is the smallest row, which is <= all x's, this can only be true if min_row >=x \u2192 which requires that min_row ==x and x is the minimal row. So the only robot that can possibly satisfy this condition is the one(s) at the minimal row. Wait, this is a problem. So my earlier approach is wrong. Hmm, this means I need to re-express the conditions. Let me think again. The robot's row is x.",

Each up move requires that all robots are in rows >=1 before the move. The first up move requires that the minimal row is >=1. The second up move requires that after the first move, the minimal row is >=1 again (i.e., the new minimal row after first move is (min_row -1) must be >=1 \u2192 min_row >=2. Continuing, after x moves, the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nBecause each move reduces the minimal row by 1. So the initial minimal row must be >=x. But the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for the robot's x to be such that the initial minimal row is >=x \u2192 but since the minimal row is the smallest row, this can only be true if the minimal row is >=x and also the minimal row is <= all other rows. This is only possible if the minimal row is exactly the robot's x, and all other robots are in rows >=x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two robots: one at row 2 (x=2) and another at row 3 (x=3). The minimal row is 2. So for the first robot (x=2), the condition is min_row (2) >=x (2) \u2192 yes. So it can move up twice. The second robot (x=3) has min_row (2) <3 \u2192 so can't move up 3 times. So the first robot can move up twice to reach row 0. So the condition is correct. Another example: robot at row 3, and another at row 1. The minimal row is 1. So for the first robot (x=3), the condition is 1 >=3 \u2192 no. So can't move up 3 times. So the condition is correct. So the condition is that the minimal row must be >= the robot's x. But since the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots, this can only be true if the robot's x is <= the minimal row? No, because the minimal row is the smallest. So the robot's x must be >= the minimal row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if the robot's x is equal to the minimal row. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row is >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x <= min_row. But since x >= min_row, this requires x == min_row. So the condition can only be true for robots that are at the minimal row. Ah! So this is a key insight. So the condition for the row is that the robot's row x must be equal to the minimal row (min_row). Because min_row is the smallest row, so for any robot, x >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x == min_row. So the row condition is that the robot is at the minimal row.",

So perhaps the code's other parts are correct except for the TODO. But given the problem's correct solution requires a different approach, I think the user's code is completely wrong and needs to be rewritten. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code's TODO is the only missing part, and the rest is correct. Wait, looking back at the code:\n\nThe first loop is:\n\nfor(i=0;i<n;i++) {\n\n   a[i]=sc.next();\n\n   char ch[]=a[i].toCharArray();\n\n   if(flag==0)\n\n   {\n\n      for(j=0;j<r;j++)\n\n      {\n\n         if( /* TODO */ )\n\n         {\n\n             x1=i;\n\n             y1=j;\n\n             flag=1;\n\n             break;\n\n         }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThis loop is trying to find the first 'R' in row-major order. So the condition is 'if (ch[j] == 'R')'. Then, the second loop:\n\nflag=0;\n\nfor(i=0;i<r;i++) // looping over columns (since r is m)\n\n{\n\n   for(j=0;j<n;j++) // looping over rows?\n\n   {\n\n      char ch[]=a[j].toCharArray();\n\n      if(ch[i] == 'R') // checking column i of row j.\n\n      {\n\n          x2=j;\n\n          y2=i;\n\n          flag=1;\n\n          break;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   if(flag==1)\n\n      break;\n\n}\n\nThis loop is trying to find the first 'R' in column-major order. So for each column i (from 0 to m-1), it checks each row j (from 0 to n-1) to see if the cell (j,i) is 'R'. The first such cell found sets x2,y2 to (j,i), and breaks. Then, the code checks if x1 ==x2 and y1 ==y2. So this is checking whether the first 'R' in row-major order is the same as the first 'R' in column-major order.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code so that it correctly solves the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe problem is about robots on a grid. The goal is to determine if we can move at least one robot to the upper left corner (which is position (0,0) I assume) without any robot exploding. A robot explodes if it moves outside the field. All robots move simultaneously with each command, so their paths have to be planned carefully.\n\nThe input gives test cases. For each case, we have n rows and m columns. Each cell is E or R. We need to output YES or NO based on whether it's possible.\n\nLooking at the code provided, it's incomplete. The main part reads the inputs, then tries to find some coordinates x1,y1 and x2,y2. But the code in the first loop has a TODO where we need to check for an R. Let me see what the code is trying to do.\n\nIn the first loop over the rows (i from 0 to n-1), for each row, it converts the string to a char array. Then, if flag is 0 (meaning we haven't found the first R yet?), it loops through the columns (j from 0 to r-1, where r is m? Wait, the variables are named n and r here. Wait, in the code, the second variable read is 'r' but the problem says m is the columns. Oh right, looking back: the code has \"int n=sc.nextInt(); int r=sc.nextInt();\". So the code uses 'r' for columns (since m was in the problem). So m is stored in variable r here. So the code's variables are n rows, r columns.\n\nThe first loop is trying to find the first robot's position (x1,y1). The code inside the TODO is supposed to check if the current cell is 'R'. So the condition should be if(ch[j] == 'R'). Because ch is the char array of the current row (a[i].toCharArray()), so ch[j] is the j-th column in row i. So when that's true, set x1 and y1 to i and j, set flag to 1, break. But wait, the code is looking for the first R in the first row? Or the first R in any row? Because the flag is set to 0 initially, and once any R is found, it breaks. But the code's logic here might not be correct. Because the code is trying to find the first R in the first row? Or the first R in the entire grid? Let me see.\n\nWait, the outer loop is over each row. For each row, it checks each column. The flag starts at 0. So the first time a 'R' is found in any row, it sets x1 and y1 to that position, and breaks out of the inner loop. Then, since flag is set, the next rows won't check. So x1,y1 is the first R encountered in row-major order. But why are they doing this? Maybe the code is trying to track the first robot's position and the last robot's position? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, after that, there's another loop that loops over i from 0 to r-1 (columns), and j from 0 to n-1 (rows). It's looking for a 'R' in column i, row j. When found, it sets x2 and y2 to j and i, and breaks. So this is finding the first R in column-major order? Or the first R in the last column? Not sure. The code's logic here is a bit confusing.\n\nThen, the code checks if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2. If so, output YES, else NO. That can't be right. Because the problem requires that at least one robot can reach the top-left without any explosions. The current code's logic is only checking if the first robot (x1,y1) is the same as some other robot (x2,y2), which probably isn't the right approach.\n\nHmm, so the existing code is probably incorrect. The problem is to determine if there exists a sequence of moves such that at least one robot reaches (0,0), and during all moves, no robot steps outside the grid.\n\nThe approach here is probably to check for all robots' possible positions after some moves, and see if any can reach (0,0) without any of them going out of bounds in any step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move it there through a series of commands, while ensuring that all other robots don't go out of bounds in any of those steps.\n\nWait, but since all robots move at the same time, each command affects all robots. So the path for each robot must be such that, for every command given, none of the robots would step outside the grid when moving in that direction.\n\nSo the key is to find a set of commands (sequence of directions) such that:\n\n- After applying all commands, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\n- For every command in the sequence, when all robots move in that direction, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nAdditionally, the commands can be in any order and any number, but each step must be safe (no explosions).\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? Since the number of steps can be arbitrary, perhaps we can model the possible positions of each robot after each possible command, but since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), maybe we can find a way to check all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the constraints for a robot to reach (0,0):\n\nSuppose a robot is at (x,y). To reach (0,0), it must be able to move left (decreasing column) and up (decreasing row). But each move must be such that all robots can move in that direction without going out of bounds.\n\nWait, but the direction is chosen each time for all robots. So for example, if we choose to move left, all robots must be able to move left (i.e., their current column must be at least 1). Similarly for other directions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: is there a sequence of directions (each direction is one of up, down, left, right) such that:\n\n- After applying all these directions in order, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\n- For each direction in the sequence, when all robots move in that direction, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nMoreover, the sequence can be of any length (including zero, but then the robot must already be at (0,0)).\n\nHmm, but how do we check this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: there exists a set of directions (possibly multiple steps) such that:\n\n- For each direction in the sequence, all robots can move in that direction (i.e., moving in that direction doesn't take any robot out of the grid).\n\n- After applying all those directions, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\nThe key is to find such a sequence.\n\nBut considering all possible sequences is computationally intensive, but since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), perhaps we can model this with BFS or some state tracking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find for each robot whether it can reach (0,0) under the constraints that all other robots can also move in the same directions without exploding.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of commands, so perhaps the key is to find for each robot, whether there exists a path to (0,0) such that in every step of that path, all robots can move in the direction chosen for that step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible that:\n\n- The robot's starting position (x,y) can reach (0,0) via some path of moves (each move direction chosen such that all robots can move in that direction without exploding).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible that:\n\n- The robot's initial position allows it to reach (0,0) through some combination of moves, and for each of those moves, all other robots can also move in that direction without going out of the grid.\n\nWait, but the direction is chosen each time for all robots. So for each step in the path, the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction (i.e., for direction 'left', all robots must be in columns >=1, etc.)\n\nTherefore, for a robot to reach (0,0), there must exist a sequence of directions where:\n\n- Each direction in the sequence is such that all robots can move in that direction (i.e., no robot would go out of bounds when moving in that direction).\n\n- After applying all those directions, the robot is at (0,0).\n\nMoreover, at least one such robot exists.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is to check for each robot whether there exists a path to (0,0) such that for each step in the path, the direction chosen allows all robots to move without exploding.\n\nBut how do we check this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThe robot can reach (0,0) only if:\n\n- The robot's starting position (x,y) can reach (0,0) through some path of moves, and for each direction in that path, all robots can move in that direction (i.e., for each direction in the path, when moving in that direction, every robot's current position allows them to move in that direction without going out of the grid).\n\nWait, but the path is a sequence of directions. Each direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction. So for each direction in the sequence, when all robots move in that direction, none of them go out of the grid.\n\nTherefore, for a robot to reach (0,0), there must exist a sequence of directions (d1, d2, ..., dk) such that:\n\n1. For each direction di in the sequence, when all robots move in di, none of them go out of the grid.\n\n2. After applying all directions, the robot is at (0,0).\n\nAdditionally, the sequence can be of any length (including zero, if the robot is already at (0,0)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for any robot whether such a sequence exists.\n\nNow, how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps for each robot, we can check if there exists a path to (0,0) such that for each step in the path, the direction chosen allows all robots to move in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints can be broken down into:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), the following must hold:\n\n- The robot's starting position (x,y) must be such that it can reach (0,0) via some path of moves (without considering other robots), but also, for each step in that path, the direction must be such that all other robots can also move in that direction.\n\nWait, but the direction is the same for all robots. So the direction must be chosen such that all robots can move in that direction. So for each direction in the path, all robots must be able to move in that direction.\n\nTherefore, the path must consist of directions that are \"safe\" for all robots at that step.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe key is that for any direction chosen, all robots must be able to move in that direction. So, for a direction to be chosen, all robots must be in positions where moving in that direction doesn't take them out of the grid.\n\nTherefore, for each possible direction, we can check if all robots can move in that direction. If yes, then that direction is allowed. Then, after moving, the robots' positions are updated. We can model this as a state transition problem, where each state is the set of robot positions, and transitions are the allowed directions.\n\nThe goal is to reach a state where at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\nBut since the number of robots can be up to (5*5)=25 (since n and m are up to 5), the state space might be too big. Wait, but the problem says that each test case has at least one robot, but the number of robots can be up to 25. So the state would be the positions of all robots, which is 25 coordinates. That's way too big for BFS.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think of the problem differently.\n\nSuppose we want to get a particular robot to (0,0). Let's say robot A is at (x,y). To get it to (0,0), we need to move it left (y steps) and up (x steps). But each move must be in a direction that all robots can move in.\n\nSo, for robot A to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1 (so they can move left). Similarly, to move up, all robots must be in rows >=1 (so they can move up). So, for each step in the path towards (0,0), the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction.\n\nWait, but the path can be any sequence of directions. So perhaps the robot can take a path that first moves up, then left, etc., but each direction must be allowed at that step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions for robot A to reach (0,0) are:\n\n- The robot's starting row x must be <= the minimum row of all robots (so that when moving up, other robots can also move up without going below row 0? Wait, no. Wait, moving up reduces the row number. So to move up, the robot must be in row >=1. So for all robots to move up, all must be in rows >=1. So for robot A to move up, all other robots must also be in rows >=1. So, for robot A to move up, the minimal row among all robots must be >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each direction, the minimal and maximal positions of the robots must allow that direction.\n\nFor example, to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column among all robots must be >=1.\n\nSimilarly, to move right, all must be in columns <= m-1 (since moving right increases column by 1, so column must be < m).\n\nTo move up, all must be in rows >=1.\n\nTo move down, all must be in rows <=n-1.\n\nTherefore, for any direction to be chosen, the robots' current positions must satisfy the constraints for that direction.\n\nSo, the problem can be modeled as a state where the positions of all robots are known, and transitions are possible directions that are allowed (i.e., all robots can move in that direction). The goal is to reach a state where any robot is at (0,0).\n\nBut since the number of robots can be up to 25, the state space is too big. However, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that the robots' positions must satisfy certain conditions for the desired robot to reach (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible that:\n\n- The robot's starting position (x,y) can reach (0,0) through some path of moves, and for each step in that path, the direction chosen must be such that all other robots can also move in that direction.\n\nWait, but how do we model this without considering all other robots?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions for a robot to reach (0,0) are:\n\n1. The robot's starting position (x,y) must be such that it can reach (0,0) by moving only left and up (since moving down or right would take it away from the target). So, the robot must be able to move left y times and up x times, but in any order, as long as the directions are allowed.\n\n2. Additionally, for each of those moves (left and up), the other robots must also be able to move in those directions without exploding.\n\nWait, but the other robots can be anywhere. So perhaps the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1, and can move up only if all are in rows >=1.\n\nHmm, so for the robot to move left once, all robots must be in columns >=1. Similarly for moving up, all must be in rows >=1.\n\nTherefore, the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1. So, the minimal column among all robots must be >=1.\n\nSimilarly, to move up, the minimal row must be >=1.\n\nSo, for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must be possible:\n\nThe robot's path to (0,0) must consist of a series of left and up moves, such that:\n\n- For each left move in the path, all robots are in columns >=1 at that step.\n\n- For each up move in the path, all robots are in rows >=1 at that step.\n\nMoreover, the path must be such that the robot can reach (0,0) through those moves.\n\nWait, but the path can have other directions as well, but those directions must be allowed. However, moving down or right would take the robot away from the target, so probably the optimal path would only use left and up moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps required are moving left y times and up x times, but in any order, provided that the directions are allowed at each step.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must hold:\n\n- The robot's starting column y must be >=0 (obviously, since it's given).\n\nWait, the robot's starting position is (x,y). To reach (0,0), it must move left y times (so y must be >=0, which it is) and up x times (so x must be >=0, which it is).\n\nBut the problem is whether those moves can be done in a way that all robots can move in those directions at each step.\n\nSo, for the robot to move left y times, each time the minimal column of all robots must be >=1 before each left move.\n\nSimilarly, for moving up x times, each time the minimal row of all robots must be >=1 before each up move.\n\nWait, but the order of moves matters. For example, if the robot moves up first, then the other robots' positions may allow for left moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe robot's starting column y must be <= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all robots can also move left). Wait, no. Wait, the minimal column is the smallest column among all robots. To move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So, the robot's column can be any value as long as the minimal column is >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1. So, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. So, for the robot to move left once, the minimal column must be >=1. After moving left, the minimal column becomes (min_col -1). So, to move left again, the new minimal column must be >=1 again.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are two robots: one at (0,1) and another at (0,3). The target is (0,0). The robot at (0,1) can reach (0,0) by moving left once. But to do that, all robots must be able to move left. The second robot is at column 3, so moving left is okay. The first is at column 1, so moving left would take it to 0, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the move is possible. So the first robot can reach (0,0).\n\nAnother example: two robots at (0,2) and (0,0). The second robot is already at the target, so the answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: robot at (1,1), and another at (0,0). The second is already there, so answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: robot at (2,3), and another at (0,0). The second is already there, so answer is YES.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in each test case, there is at least one robot. So if any robot is already at (0,0), the answer is YES.\n\nSo first, check if any robot is already at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the other cases.\n\nLet me think of the first test case in the note:\n\nFirst test case: input is such that after moving left, a robot reaches (0,0). So the robot must have been at (0,1). So when moving left, all robots must be able to move left. So all robots must be in columns >=1. So if there are other robots, they must also be in columns >=1. So in that case, moving left is allowed, and the robot reaches (0,0).\n\nAnother example: second test case where any command causes a robot to explode. Suppose there's a robot at (0,0), but the problem says there's at least one robot. Wait, no, the second test case's note says that if you try any command, at least one robot explodes. So perhaps there are robots in positions that can't move in any direction without some exploding. Like, a robot at (0,0) can't move up or left, so any command that requires moving in those directions would cause it to explode. But if there are other robots that can't move in other directions either. For example, if there's a robot at (0,0) and another at (0,1). Then, moving left would cause the first robot to explode (since it's already at column 0). So any command except right or down would cause some robot to explode. But moving right would require all robots to be able to move right. The first robot is at column 0, so moving right would take it to 1, which is okay. The second is at 1, so moving right would take to 2, which is okay if m is at least 3. But if m is 2, then moving right from column 1 would take to 2, which is allowed if m is 2? Wait, columns are 0-based? Or 1-based?\n\nAssuming the grid is 0-based, then for a robot at column m-1, moving right would take it to m, which is outside. So in that case, moving right would cause explosion.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's grid is 0-based. So the upper left corner is (0,0).\n\nNow, back to the code. The current code is trying to find x1,y1 as the first robot encountered in row-major order, and x2,y2 as the first robot encountered in column-major order. Then, it checks if they are the same. That can't be correct. Because the code's logic is flawed.\n\nThe correct approach would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n2. Else, check for each robot whether it can reach (0,0) through some sequence of moves where each move direction is allowed (i.e., all robots can move in that direction without exploding).\n\nIf any robot can do this, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each robot, can it reach (0,0) under the constraints that every move direction chosen must be such that all robots can move in that direction.\n\nNow, how to model this?\n\nPerhaps for a given robot, the path to (0,0) must consist of a series of left and up moves (since moving down or right would take it away from the target). So the minimal steps would be moving left y times and up x times, but the order must be such that all robots can move in those directions at each step.\n\nAlternatively, the robot can take any path, but the directions must be allowed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's starting column y must be >= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all robots can also move left). Wait, no. Wait, the minimal column is the smallest column among all robots. To move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So the robot's column can be anything as long as the minimal column is >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the robot can only move left if all robots are in columns >=1. So, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. So, the robot's column must be >=1, but also, all other robots must be in columns >=1.\n\nSimilarly, to move up, the minimal row of all robots must be >=1.\n\nTherefore, for the robot to move left once, the minimal column of all robots must be >=1. After moving left, the minimal column decreases by 1. So, to move left again, the new minimal column must be >=1 again.\n\nWait, but after moving left once, the minimal column could be 0 (if a robot was at column 1 and moves to 0). So then, further left moves would not be possible.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe the problem can be approached by considering that for a robot to reach (0,0), the following must hold:\n\nThe robot's starting position (x,y) must satisfy:\n\n- The robot can reach (0,0) by moving only left and up, and during each such move, all robots can move in that direction.\n\nSo, the path is a sequence of left and up moves, such that:\n\nAt each step before moving left, all robots are in columns >=1.\n\nAt each step before moving up, all robots are in rows >=1.\n\nAdditionally, the robot's path must consist of exactly y left moves and x up moves, in any order, but such that the above conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the order of moves matters. For example, moving up first may allow more left moves later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe robot's starting column y must be <= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all can move left). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the minimal column among all robots must be <= the robot's column. Because if another robot is in a column less than the robot's, then when moving left, that robot would have to move to a column less than the robot's new column. But the minimal column is the smallest column of all robots. So, for the robot to move left, the minimal column must be >=1. So the robot's column can be anything as long as the minimal column is >=1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to perform a sequence of moves (each direction allowed) such that:\n\n- The robot's path reduces its row to 0 and column to 0.\n\n- The sequence of moves must allow all robots to move in each direction chosen.\n\nSo, the robot's path can be any combination of left and up moves, but the order must be such that the directions are allowed at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal conditions are:\n\nThe robot's starting column y must be <= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all can move left). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if another robot is at column 0, then moving left would cause it to explode. So that's not allowed. So the minimal column must be >=1 for a left move to be possible.\n\nWait, the minimal column is the smallest column among all robots. So, to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So, the robot's column can be anything as long as the minimal column is >=1.\n\nTherefore, to move left once, the minimal column must be >=1. After moving left, the minimal column becomes (min_col -1). So, to move left again, the new minimal column must be >=1 again, i.e., the previous minimal column must have been >=2.\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe the problem can be approached by considering that for the robot to reach (0,0), the following must be true:\n\nThe robot's starting position (x,y) must satisfy:\n\n- The robot can reach (0,0) by moving left y times and up x times, and during each of those moves, all robots can move in that direction.\n\nBut how to check this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must hold:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0):\n\n1. The robot's starting column y must be >= the minimal column of all robots (so that when moving left, all can move left). Wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the minimal column among all robots must be <= the robot's column. Because if another robot is in a column less than the robot's, then when moving left, that robot would have to move to a column less than the robot's new column. But the minimal column is the smallest column of all robots. So, to move left, all robots must be in columns >=1. So the minimal column must be >=1. So the robot's column can be anything as long as the minimal column is >=1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for the robot to move left y times, the minimal column of all robots must be at least 1, then after each left move, the minimal column decreases by 1. So after k left moves, the minimal column must have been at least k+1 initially.\n\nWait, let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the robot is at (0,3), and there are other robots at (0,2) and (0,1). The minimal column is 1. To move left once, the minimal column is 1, so it's allowed. After moving left, the minimal column becomes 0 (since the robot at column 1 moves to 0). So further left moves are not possible. So the robot can only move left once, but needs to move 3 times. So this is impossible.\n\nSo in this case, the robot can't reach (0,0).\n\nAnother example: robot at (0,3), and other robots at (0,4) and (0,5). The minimal column is 3. So to move left once, the minimal column is 3 >=1, so allowed. After moving left, the minimal column is 2. Then again, move left again (now minimal is 2, so allowed). Then again, minimal is 1. Then again, minimal is 0. So after 3 left moves, the robot reaches 0. But the third move would require the minimal column to be 1 (before the move). So the third move is allowed (since before the third move, the minimal column is 1). After the third move, the minimal is 0, but that's after the move.\n\nSo in this case, the robot can move left 3 times, reaching (0,0).\n\nSo the conditions are that the minimal column of all robots must be at least the number of left moves needed (y) for the robot. Because each left move reduces the minimal column by 1. So initial minimal column must be >= y.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the robot needs to move left y times. The minimal column of all robots must be at least y. Because each left move reduces the minimal column by 1. So after y moves, the minimal column would be (initial_min_col - y). To allow all y moves, the initial_min_col must be >= y. Because after each step k (from 0 to y-1), the minimal column before the move is (initial_min_col -k) must be >=1. So:\n\ninitial_min_col -k >=1 for all k from 0 to y-1.\n\nThe most restrictive is when k = y-1: initial_min_col - (y-1) >=1 \u2192 initial_min_col >= y.\n\nSo yes, the initial minimal column must be >= y.\n\nSimilarly, for the up moves:\n\nThe robot needs to move up x times (from row x to 0). The minimal row of all robots must be >=x.\n\nBecause each up move reduces the minimal row by 1. So initial_min_row >=x.\n\nSo the conditions for the robot to reach (0,0) are:\n\n1. The robot's starting column y must be such that the minimal column of all robots is >= y.\n\n2. The robot's starting row x must be such that the minimal row of all robots is >=x.\n\nIf both conditions are met, then the robot can move left y times and up x times in any order (but the order must allow the directions to be chosen when possible).\n\nWait, but the order of moves must be such that when moving up, the minimal row is sufficient.\n\nWait, the minimal row must be >= the number of up moves needed (x). So the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\nFor a robot at (x,y):\n\n- The minimal column among all robots must be >= y.\n\n- The minimal row among all robots must be >=x.\n\nIf both are true, then the robot can reach (0,0) by moving left y times and up x times, in any order, as long as the directions are chosen when possible.\n\nWait, but the order of moves must be such that when moving up, the minimal row is sufficient.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the robot is at (x,y), and the minimal row of all robots is R_min >=x.\n\nThen, to move up x times, each time the minimal row must be >=1 before the move.\n\nThe first up move requires that the minimal row is >=1.\n\nThe second requires that after first move, the minimal row is (R_min -1) >=1 \u2192 R_min >=2.\n\nContinuing, after x moves, the initial R_min must be >=x.\n\nSo yes, the initial R_min must be >=x.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are sufficient.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n2. Else, for each robot:\n\n   a. Let (x,y) be its position.\n\n   b. Compute the minimal row among all robots (min_row).\n\n   c. Compute the minimal column among all robots (min_col).\n\n   d. Check if (min_row >=x) and (min_col >=y).\n\n   e. If any robot satisfies this, output YES.\n\n3. If none do, output NO.\n\nWait, that's a possible approach. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example from the note:\n\nFirst test case: suppose the robot is at (0,1). The minimal column is 1 (since that's the only robot?), so min_col =1. y=1. So min_col >= y \u2192 1 >=1 \u2192 yes. min_row is 0 (since x is 0). So min_row (0) >=x (0) \u2192 yes. So conditions are met. So output YES. Which matches the note.\n\nSecond test case: any command causes explosion. Suppose there are two robots: one at (0,0) (but the problem says there is at least one robot, but the note says in the second test case, trying any command causes explosion. Wait, maybe the second test case has robots that can't move anywhere without exploding. For example, two robots at (0,0) and (0,1). Then, to move left, the first robot would explode. To move right, the second is at column 1, so if m is 2, then moving right would take it to 2 which is outside (assuming 0-based). So moving right would cause explosion. Moving up/down would also cause the first robot to explode. So any command would cause at least one robot to explode. So the conditions for any robot would not be met. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the robots are at (0,0) and (0,1). The first robot is already at (0,0), so the first condition (any robot at (0,0)) is met, so output YES. But the note says the second test case outputs NO. Wait, this is conflicting. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the second test case.\n\nWait the note says: \"in the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\" So the second test case must not have any robot already at (0,0). So perhaps the robots are at (0,0) is not present. Let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose the second test case has two robots at (0,0) is not present. Let's say robots are at (0,1) and (0,0) is not there. Wait, but the problem says each test case has at least one robot. Let me think of a case where no robot is at (0,0), and for all robots, the conditions are not met.\n\nExample: two robots at (0,1) and (0,2). The minimal column is 1. For the first robot (0,1), y=1. min_col is 1, so 1 >=1 \u2192 yes. min_row is 0, which is >=0 \u2192 yes. So the conditions are met. So the first robot can reach (0,0). So the answer would be YES. But that's not the case in the second test case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the second test case has robots in positions that can't satisfy the conditions. Let's think of a case where all robots are in positions where their required conditions are not met.\n\nSuppose there are two robots: one at (1,1) and another at (0,2). The minimal row is 0 (from the second robot's row 0). The first robot's x is 1. So min_row (0) is less than x (1). So the first robot can't move up 1 time because the minimal row is 0 <1. So the first robot's condition is not met. The second robot is at (0,2). Its x is 0, so min_row (0) >=0 \u2192 yes. Its y is 2. The minimal column is 1 (from first robot's column 1). So min_col (1) <2 \u2192 so the second robot's condition is not met. So neither can reach (0,0). So the answer is NO. That would be a case like the second test case.\n\nSo the algorithm would work here.\n\nAnother example from the note: third test case, where moving left is sufficient. Suppose robot is at (0,2), and other robots are at columns >=2. The minimal column is 2. So for the robot at (0,2), min_col (2) >=2 \u2192 yes. So conditions met.\n\nFourth test case: already has a robot at (0,0), so output YES.\n\nFifth test case: the note says a sequence of moves like up, left, up. Wait, perhaps the robot starts at (2,1). To reach (0,0), needs to move up twice and left once. The minimal row must be >=2 (the robot's x is 2). Suppose other robots are at rows >=2. So min_row is 2. So 2 >=2 \u2192 yes. The minimal column is 1 (the robot's column). So min_col (1) >=1 \u2192 yes. So conditions are met. So the algorithm would output YES.\n\nThe sixth test case: the note says that trying to move any robot to the upper left causes another to explode. Suppose there are two robots: one at (0,1) and another at (1,0). The minimal row is 0 (from first robot), minimal column is 0 (from second robot). \n\nFor the first robot (0,1):\n\nx=0, so min_row (0) >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ny=1. min_col is 0 <1 \u2192 so condition fails.\n\nFor the second robot (1,0):\n\nx=1. min_row is 0 <1 \u2192 condition fails.\n\ny=0. min_col is 0 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo neither can satisfy both conditions. So the answer is NO, which matches the note.\n\nSo this algorithm seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check if any robot is at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n- Else, compute the minimal row (min_row) and minimal column (min_col) among all robots.\n\n- For each robot (x,y):\n\n   if (x <= min_row) and (y <= min_col) \u2192 then this robot can reach (0,0). So output YES.\n\n- If none do, output NO.\n\nWait, wait, the conditions are min_row >=x and min_col >=y. Because the minimal row must be at least the robot's x (so that when moving up x times, the minimal row is sufficient).\n\nWait, the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for the robot's row x, the minimal row must be <=x. Because the minimal row is the smallest row of all robots. So if the minimal row is less than x, then there exists a robot in a row less than x. So when moving up, that robot would have to move up, but if the minimal row is already less than x, then the minimal row is already less than x, so the robot's x is larger than the minimal row. So the minimal row can't be >=x unless all robots are in rows >=x.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the conditions.\n\nThe minimal row among all robots is the smallest row any robot is in. For the robot at (x,y) to be able to move up x times, the minimal row must be >=x? No, that can't be. Because if the minimal row is less than x, then there is a robot in a row less than x. So when moving up, that robot would have to move up, but if it's already in row 0, then moving up would cause it to explode.\n\nWait, the minimal row is the smallest row of all robots. To move up, all robots must be in rows >=1. So the minimal row must be >=1 before the move.\n\nTo move up x times, the initial minimal row must be >=x. Because each up move reduces the minimal row by 1. So after x moves, the minimal row would be (initial_min_row -x). To allow all x moves, the initial_min_row must be >=x.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose initial_min_row is R. To move up once, R must be >=1.\n\nAfter moving up, the new minimal row is R-1.\n\nTo move up again, the new minimal row must be >=1 \u2192 R-1 >=1 \u2192 R >=2.\n\nContinuing, after x moves, the initial R must be >=x.\n\nSo yes, the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nFor a robot at (x,y):\n\nmin_row >=x and min_col >=y.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nThe current code is trying to find some variables x1,y1 and x2,y2, but that's not the right approach. We need to:\n\n1. For each test case:\n\n   a. Read n and m (the code uses 'r' for m).\n\n   b. Read the grid.\n\n   c. Check if any cell (0,0) is 'R'. If yes, output YES.\n\n   d. Else, compute min_row and min_col among all robots.\n\n   e. For each robot's position (x,y), check if min_row >=x and min_col >=y. If any such robot exists, output YES.\n\n   f. Else, output NO.\n\nSo the code needs to be rewritten to do this.\n\nNow, let's see the current code's structure.\n\nThe code reads n and r (m is r here). Then reads n lines of strings.\n\nThen, in the first loop, it's trying to find x1,y1 as the first 'R' encountered. Then, in the second loop, it's trying to find x2,y2 as the first 'R' in column-major order. Then, it checks if x1 ==x2 and y1 ==y2. That's not correct.\n\nWe need to:\n\n- Find all the robot positions.\n\n- Check if any is at (0,0).\n\n- Compute min_row and min_col.\n\n- Check for any robot (x,y) whether min_row >=x and min_col >=y.\n\nSo, let's think of the code steps.\n\nFirst, in the code:\n\nAfter reading n and r (m is r), read the grid into a array of strings.\n\nThen, collect all the robot positions.\n\nSo, first, we can loop through all rows and columns to find all 'R's.\n\nWe can have a list of coordinates (x,y) for each 'R'.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if any of them is (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute min_row as the minimum x among all robots.\n\nCompute min_col as the minimum y among all robots.\n\nThen, for each (x,y) in the list of robots:\n\n   if (x <= min_row) \u2192 no, wait, no. Wait, min_row is the minimum x of all robots. So for any robot, its x is >= min_row. Because min_row is the smallest x.\n\nWait, min_row is the minimum of all x's. So for any robot's x, x >= min_row.\n\nSo the condition min_row >=x is only possible if min_row ==x, and x is the smallest.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because the condition requires that min_row (the minimal row) is >=x. But since min_row is the minimal row, it is the smallest x among all robots. So for any robot's x, x >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x == min_row.\n\nSo the condition min_row >=x is equivalent to x == min_row.\n\nWait, this can't be right. So there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row x is >= min_row.\n\nThe condition for the robot to be able to move up x times is that the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nBut since min_row is the minimal row, which is <= all x's, this can only be true if min_row >=x \u2192 which requires that min_row >=x and min_row <=x (since it's the minimal). So this is only possible if min_row ==x and x is the minimal row.\n\nSo the condition can only be true if the robot's x is equal to the minimal row.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row is >= min_row.\n\nTo move up x times (where x is the robot's current row), the minimal row must be >=x?\n\nBut since min_row is the smallest row, which is <= all x's, this can only be true if min_row >=x \u2192 which requires that min_row ==x and x is the minimal row.\n\nSo the only robot that can possibly satisfy this condition is the one(s) at the minimal row.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, this means I need to re-express the conditions.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe robot's row is x. To move up x times, the robot must be able to move up x times, but each move must be allowed (i.e., all robots can move up).\n\nEach up move requires that all robots are in rows >=1 before the move.\n\nThe first up move requires that the minimal row is >=1.\n\nThe second up move requires that after the first move, the minimal row is >=1 again (i.e., the new minimal row after first move is (min_row -1) must be >=1 \u2192 min_row >=2.\n\nContinuing, after x moves, the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nBecause each move reduces the minimal row by 1.\n\nSo the initial minimal row must be >=x.\n\nBut the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for the robot's x to be such that the initial minimal row is >=x \u2192 but since the minimal row is the smallest row, this can only be true if the minimal row is >=x and also the minimal row is <= all other rows.\n\nThis is only possible if the minimal row is exactly the robot's x, and all other robots are in rows >=x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are two robots: one at row 2 (x=2) and another at row 3 (x=3). The minimal row is 2. So for the first robot (x=2), the condition is min_row (2) >=x (2) \u2192 yes. So it can move up twice.\n\nThe second robot (x=3) has min_row (2) <3 \u2192 so can't move up 3 times.\n\nSo the first robot can move up twice to reach row 0.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nAnother example: robot at row 3, and another at row 1. The minimal row is 1. So for the first robot (x=3), the condition is 1 >=3 \u2192 no. So can't move up 3 times.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nSo the condition is that the minimal row must be >= the robot's x.\n\nBut since the minimal row is the smallest row among all robots, this can only be true if the robot's x is <= the minimal row? No, because the minimal row is the smallest. So the robot's x must be >= the minimal row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if the robot's x is equal to the minimal row.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe minimal row is the smallest row among all robots. So for any robot, its row is >= min_row.\n\nSo the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x <= min_row. But since x >= min_row, this requires x == min_row.\n\nSo the condition can only be true for robots that are at the minimal row.\n\nAh! So this is a key insight.\n\nSo the condition for the row is that the robot's row x must be equal to the minimal row (min_row).\n\nBecause min_row is the smallest row, so for any robot, x >= min_row. So the condition min_row >=x can only be true if x == min_row.\n\nSo the row condition is that the robot is at the minimal row.\n\nSimilarly for the column condition: the robot's column y must be equal to the minimal column (min_col).\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nThe robot must be at the minimal row and minimal column.\n\nBecause:\n\n- To move up x times (where x is the robot's row), the minimal row must be >=x \u2192 but since the minimal row is the smallest row, this requires x == min_row.\n\n- To move left y times (where y is the robot's column), the minimal column must be >=y \u2192 similarly, y must be equal to the minimal column.\n\nSo the only robots that can possibly reach (0,0) are those that are at the minimal row and minimal column.\n\nFurthermore, for such a robot:\n\n- The minimal row must be equal to the robot's x (so that moving up x times is possible).\n\n- The minimal column must be equal to the robot's y (so that moving left y times is possible).\n\nWait, but the minimal row is the robot's x (since it's at the minimal row). So the minimal row is x. So to move up x times, the initial minimal row (x) must be >=x \u2192 yes.\n\nSimilarly for the column.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nThe robot must be at (min_row, min_col).\n\nThen, the minimal row must be >=x (which is min_row, so yes).\n\nThe minimal column must be >=y (which is min_col, so yes).\n\nSo the only possible candidates are the robots located at the minimal row and minimal column.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is at (0,0). If yes, output YES.\n\n2. Else:\n\n   a. Find the minimal row (min_row) and minimal column (min_col) among all robots.\n\n   b. Check if there exists a robot at (min_row, min_col).\n\n   c. If such a robot exists, then:\n\n      i. Check if min_row == min_row (which is always true) and min_col == min_col (also always true).\n\n      So, the robot can move up min_row times and left min_col times.\n\n      Thus, it can reach (0,0).\n\n      So output YES.\n\n   d. Else, output NO.\n\nWait, this is a much simpler condition.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nIf any robot is at (0,0) \u2192 YES.\n\nElse:\n\nFind min_row and min_col.\n\nCheck if there is a robot at (min_row, min_col). If yes \u2192 YES.\n\nElse \u2192 NO.\n\nBecause only those robots can possibly reach (0,0).\n\nLet me test this with previous examples.\n\nFirst test case: robot at (0,1). min_row is 0, min_col is 1. The robot is at (0,1), which is (min_row, min_col). So output YES.\n\nSecond test case (where no robot is at (0,0) and no robot is at (min_row, min_col)):\n\nSuppose robots are at (1,1) and (0,2). min_row is 0 (from the second robot's row 0). min_col is 1 (from first robot's column 1). The robot at (0,2) has column 2, which is larger than min_col (1). The robot at (1,1) is at (1,1), which is not (0,1). So there is no robot at (min_row, min_col) (0,1). So output NO.\n\nThird test case: robot at (0,2), and other robots at columns >=2. min_col is 2. min_row is 0. So the robot at (0,2) is at (min_row, min_col) \u2192 YES.\n\nFourth test case: robot at (0,0) \u2192 YES.\n\nFifth test case: suppose the robot is at (2,1). min_row is 2 (if other robots are at higher rows). min_col is 1. So the robot is at (min_row, min_col) \u2192 YES.\n\nSixth test case: robots at (0,1) and (1,0). min_row is 0, min_col is 0. The robot at (0,1) is not at (0,0). The robot at (1,0) is at (1,0), which is not (0,0). So there is no robot at (min_row, min_col) (0,0). So output NO.\n\nThis matches the examples.\n\nSo the correct algorithm is:\n\nCheck if any robot is at (0,0). If yes \u2192 YES.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute min_row and min_col.\n\nCheck if there is a robot at (min_row, min_col). If yes \u2192 YES.\n\nElse \u2192 NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nThe current code is trying to find some variables, but we need to:\n\n- Collect all robot positions.\n\n- Check if any is (0,0).\n\n- Find min_row and min_col.\n\n- Check if any robot is at (min_row, min_col).\n\nSo let's rewrite the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, in the code:\n\nAfter reading the grid, we can loop through all cells to collect robot positions.\n\nSo:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = sc.nextInt(); // the code uses 'r' for m, but let's use m here for clarity.\n\nWait, in the code, the second variable is stored in 'r', so m is 'r'.\n\nSo:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, read the grid:\n\nString a[] = new String[n];\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n   a[i] = sc.next();\n\n}\n\nThen, collect all robot positions:\n\nList<int[]> robots = new ArrayList<>();\n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n   for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n\n      if (a[i].charAt(j) == 'R') {\n\n          robots.add(new int[]{i,j});\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThen:\n\n// Check if any robot is at (0,0):\n\nboolean hasZeroZero = false;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n   if (pos[0] ==0 && pos[1]==0) {\n\n      hasZeroZero = true;\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nif (hasZeroZero) {\n\n   System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n   continue;\n\n}\n\n// Else, compute min_row and min_col:\n\nint min_row = n; // Initialize to a large value\n\nint min_col = m;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n   if (pos[0] < min_row) min_row = pos[0];\n\n   if (pos[1] < min_col) min_col = pos[1];\n\n}\n\n// Check if any robot is at (min_row, min_col):\n\nboolean hasMin = false;\n\nfor (int[] pos : robots) {\n\n   if (pos[0] == min_row && pos[1] == min_col) {\n\n      hasMin = true;\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nif (hasMin) {\n\n   System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n} else {\n\n   System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n}\n\nThis would be the correct code.\n\nNow, the original code has variables x1,y1 and x2,y2, which are not needed. The code needs to be rewritten to do this.\n\nThe original code's first loop is trying to find the first robot's position, but that's not needed. The second loop is also not needed.\n\nSo the code needs to be modified to collect all robot positions, then perform the checks as above.\n\nNow, the user's code has the following lines with a TODO:\n\nIn the first loop over the rows:\n\nfor(j=0;j<r;j++) {\n\n   if(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n\n   {\n\n      x1=i;\n\n      y1=j;\n\n      flag=1;\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThe TODO is to check if the current cell is 'R'. So the condition should be:\n\nif (ch[j] == 'R')\n\nBut the code's logic here is to find the first 'R' in row-major order and store it in x1,y1. But this is not needed for the correct solution.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user's code has a TODO in that condition. So the first part of the code's missing code is to check if the current cell is 'R'.\n\nSo the first missing code is:\n\nif (ch[j] == 'R')\n\nBut the rest of the code is incorrect. However, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. The problem is that the rest of the code is incorrect, but the user's code may require only the TODO part to be filled, but the rest of the code is wrong. However, the user's instruction says to output the missing code so that the program will run correctly. So perhaps the code is supposed to be fixed by completing the TODO and adjusting other parts.\n\nBut given the user's instruction, perhaps the code's TODO is the only missing part, but the rest of the code is incorrect. However, the user's code's logic is completely wrong, so it's impossible to fix it by just filling the TODO. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that the code's logic is correct except for the TODO part, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is trying to find the first and last robot's positions, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is trying to find the leftmost and topmost robot, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is trying to find the first robot and the last robot in some way, but the code's variables x1,y1 and x2,y2 are not used correctly.\n\nThe current code's final check is if x1 ==x2 and y1 ==y2 \u2192 which would mean that the first and second robot are the same, but that's not the correct condition.\n\nGiven that the user's code is incorrect and the problem requires a correct solution, but the user's instruction says to output only the missing code (the TODO part), perhaps the code's TODO is the only missing part, and the rest of the code is correct. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to find the minimal row and column, and the first part is trying to find the first robot's position, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's first loop is trying to find the first robot's position (x1,y1), and the second loop is trying to find the last robot's position (x2,y2), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's second loop is trying to find the rightmost robot's position, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct answer for the missing code is to fill the TODO with 'ch[j] == 'R''.\n\nBut the rest of the code is incorrect. However, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. So perhaps the code's other parts are correct except for the TODO.\n\nBut given the problem's correct solution requires a different approach, I think the user's code is completely wrong and needs to be rewritten. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code's TODO is the only missing part, and the rest is correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nThe first loop is:\n\nfor(i=0;i<n;i++) {\n\n   a[i]=sc.next();\n\n   char ch[]=a[i].toCharArray();\n\n   if(flag==0)\n\n   {\n\n      for(j=0;j<r;j++)\n\n      {\n\n         if( /* TODO */ )\n\n         {\n\n             x1=i;\n\n             y1=j;\n\n             flag=1;\n\n             break;\n\n         }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThis loop is trying to find the first 'R' in row-major order. So the condition is 'if (ch[j] == 'R')'.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nflag=0;\n\nfor(i=0;i<r;i++) // looping over columns (since r is m)\n\n{\n\n   for(j=0;j<n;j++) // looping over rows?\n\n   {\n\n      char ch[]=a[j].toCharArray();\n\n      if(ch[i] == 'R') // checking column i of row j.\n\n      {\n\n          x2=j;\n\n          y2=i;\n\n          flag=1;\n\n          break;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   if(flag==1)\n\n      break;\n\n}\n\nThis loop is trying to find the first 'R' in column-major order. So for each column i (from 0 to m-1), it checks each row j (from 0 to n-1) to see if the cell (j,i) is 'R'. The first such cell found sets x2,y2 to (j,i), and breaks.\n\nThen, the code checks if x1 ==x2 and y1 ==y2. So this is checking whether the first 'R' in row-major order is the same as the first 'R' in column-major order. Which would only be true if that 'R' is the first in both orders, which is possible only if it's the first in the first row and first column.\n\nBut this is not the correct condition for the problem.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code (the TODO part), so the answer is to fill the TODO with 'ch[j] == 'R''.\n\nBut the rest of the code is incorrect. However, the user might have intended that the code is correct except for the missing condition.\n\nBut given the problem's correct solution requires a different approach, I think the user's code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. But according to the problem's instructions, I must output only the missing code.\n\nThe missing code is the condition in the TODO, which is checking if the current cell is 'R'. So the code should be:\n\nif (ch[j] == 'R')\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nch[j] == 'R'\n\nBut the user's code has other errors, but the instruction says to output only the missing code.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is:\n\nch[j] == 'R'\n\nSo the answer is to output that condition."
