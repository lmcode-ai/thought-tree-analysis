Suppose the final string has a segment S of non-W characters. Each stamp application can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The key is that the entire segment must be achievable by some combination of these operations. Let me think of the possible sequences that can be formed. Let me consider that each stamp can be applied anywhere, and can choose the direction (RB or BR). The operations can be applied in any order and any positions. The initial state is all W. The final state is the target string. The problem is to determine whether the target can be formed. Let me think of the following: Each time you apply a stamp, you choose two adjacent cells and set them to either RB or BR. The final colors of the cells are the result of all these operations.",

So the code can be written as: \n\nif (s.length() ==0) \u2192 valid. \n\nelse if (s.length() %2 ==0) \u2192 valid. \n\nelse \u2192 check first and last. So in code: \n\nif (s.length() ==0) { continue; } \n\nelse if (s.length() %2 ==0) { continue; } \n\nelse { \n\nif (s.charAt(0) ! = s.charAt(s.length()-1)) \u2192 return no. \n\n} But since the code is inside the for loop, the code must be written as a single condition. Alternatively, the condition inside the if statement should be the validity condition. So the code inside the for loop would be: \n\nif ( (s.length() ==0) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==0) ) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==1) && (s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) ) ) \n\nthen continue. Else \u2192 print NO. So the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (s.length() ==0 || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1))) So the code should have this condition in the if statement. Thus, the missing code is: \n\ns.length() ==0 || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) So the code inside the for loop would be:\n\nfor(String s:ar) {\n\n    if( (s.length() ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) ) {\n\n        // valid, continue\n\n    } else {\n\n        System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n        continue in;\n\n    }\n\n} Thus, the missing code is the condition inside the if statement.",

So for the entire segment, there must exist a way to choose for each position i the last stamp that covers it, such that: \n\n- For each stamp covering positions i and i+1, the colors at i and i+1 are set to either RB or BR. \n\n- The final colors of all positions are as desired. This seems like a system of constraints. Let me think of the sequence as a series of colors. For each position i from 0 to m-1 (where m is the length of the segment), the color must be either R or B. We need to choose for each position i whether it was the first or second element of a stamp's pair.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the condition for the string segments between W's to determine if the given picture is possible. Let's think about the problem again. The stamp can only apply to two neighboring cells, turning them into either RB or BR. Each application affects exactly two cells. So any non-white segment (since W's are considered as already stamped over or not, but the problem says initial state is all white, so the W's in the final string could be cells that were never stamped on, or were stamped an even number of times maybe? Hmm, but each stamp changes the color of the cells. Wait, actually, each time you stamp, the two cells under it are recolored. So if a cell is stamped multiple times, its color depends on the number of times it was under the stamp. For example, if a cell is part of two stamps, each time it's either R or B, so maybe the parity matters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that every pair of consecutive non-W characters must form a valid pattern. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. Let me think of the constraints.\n\nThe problem requires that the final string can be achieved by any number of stamp applications. Let's consider the non-W parts. Since the stamp can be applied anywhere, but each application affects two adjacent cells. So any sequence of non-W characters must be such that they can be built by overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, but the stamps can be applied in any order and overlapping. Hmm, perhaps the key is that in the final string, any two consecutive non-W characters must form either RB or BR, or maybe some other condition. Wait, no, because each stamp can be applied multiple times. For example, if you have a segment like RBR, maybe that's possible. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: the target is B R B B W. The segments between W's are \"BRBB\". Wait, but splitting on W gives [\"BRBB\"], right? The code splits the string into parts separated by W. So for each such part, we need to check some condition.\n\nWait the code currently splits the string into parts by splitting on \"W\", so for example, \"BRBWB\" would split into [\"BRB\", \"B\"], but maybe that's not the right approach. Wait, no, the split on \"W\" would split the string into the parts that are between the W's. So if the string is \"BRBWB\", splitting on W would give [\"BRB\", \"B\"], but the actual segments between W's are \"BRB\" (before the first W), then after the W comes \"B\", but since the split is on W, the parts after are the non-W sequences between the W's. So any occurrence of W in the string splits the string into those segments. Each of those segments must be checkable for validity.\n\nThe problem is that each of these segments (non-W parts) must be possible to form via the stamps. Since the stamps can only affect two adjacent cells, each of these segments must be such that they can be formed by some combination of overlapping stamps. \n\nHmm, perhaps each segment must have even length? Because each stamp affects two cells. Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the first test case's final string is BRBBW. The non-W part is BRBB, which is length 4. That's even. Another example given in note 5: the target is BRB. That's length 3, which is odd. Wait, but in note 5, the example is \"BRB\" which is length 3. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait the fifth test case's example: the target is \"BRB\". Let me see the steps:\n\nStart with WWW. Then stamp the last two to get WRB. Then stamp the first two (positions 0 and 1?), turning them into BR. So the result is BRB. So the length is 3, which is odd. So the length can be odd. So the even length idea is not correct.\n\nHmm, so maybe the key is that in each segment (non-W parts), the colors must alternate in a way that allows them to be formed by overlapping stamps. Let me think of the possible patterns.\n\nEach stamp application can create either RB or BR in two adjacent cells. But when you apply multiple stamps, overlapping can change things. Let me think of the possible sequences.\n\nSuppose a segment is of length 1. Then it's impossible, because you can't stamp a single cell. So any segment of length 1 (like \"R\" or \"B\") would be invalid. So that's one condition: all non-W segments must have length >=2? Wait no, because in the seventh test case, the answer is \"YES\" when the string is all W's. So the empty segments (from splitting on W) are okay. Wait, but if a segment is of length 1, like \"R\", then that can't be formed because you can't stamp a single cell. So any segment of length 1 would be invalid, leading to \"NO\".\n\nSo first condition: all non-W segments must have even length? Wait no, the example in note 5 has a segment of length 3 (BRB). Wait that's 3, which is odd. So that can't be. Wait in note 5's example, the target is \"BRB\", which is length 3. So that's allowed. So the length can be odd. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nLet me think of the possible sequences. Each stamp affects two cells. So each application contributes to two cells. But overlapping can allow for longer sequences. Let me think of the possible patterns.\n\nSuppose the segment is \"RB\". That can be formed by a single stamp (either way). So that's okay.\n\nIf the segment is \"BR\", that's also okay, since you can stamp in the other direction.\n\nWhat about \"RR\"? Let's see. To get two R's, how? Each stamp must have one R and one B. So to get two R's adjacent, perhaps you can stamp in a way that overlaps. Let's see:\n\nSuppose you have two overlapping stamps. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the initial is WWW. Let's stamp positions 0 and 1 as BR. Then the string is BRW. Then stamp positions 1 and 2 as RB. So the second stamp would turn position 1 (B) into R, and position 2 (W) into B. So the result is B (from first stamp's R?), wait no. Wait the first stamp on 0-1 gives B and R? Or R and B? Wait the stamp can be either BR or RB. Let me clarify:\n\nEach stamp can be applied as either RB or BR. So when you apply a stamp on positions i and i+1, you can choose to set them to RB or BR. \n\nSo for the first example, to get \"BRB B W\", the steps were:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), but maybe the example's steps are a bit different. \n\nBack to the RR case. Suppose we want two R's. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we first stamp positions 0-1 as BR (so they become B and R). Then stamp positions 0-1 again as BR. The first application gives B and R. The second application would set them to B and R again? Wait no, because each stamp changes the colors. Wait, each time you stamp, the two cells are set to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous state. So each stamp overwrites the two cells. \n\nAh, right! So each stamp application completely changes the two cells to either RB or BR. So overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors. \n\nSo for example, to get RR, perhaps:\n\nFirst stamp positions 0-1 as BR (so B and R). Then stamp positions 0-1 again as RB (so R and B). Wait that would set them to R and B. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nHmm, maybe it's impossible to have two R's in a row. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the desired segment is \"RR\". To get that, the two cells must be set to R and R. But each stamp can only set them to either RB or BR. So the only way to have two R's is if they are not part of any stamp? But that's impossible because they are non-W. So \"RR\" is impossible. So any occurrence of two same colors in a row (other than WB or BW, but WB is allowed as part of a stamp?) Wait no, WB would be part of a stamp only if the stamp was applied before, but WB is not a possible stamp's result. Wait the stamp can only produce RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must be either RB or BR. Wait, but overlapping stamps can lead to other combinations?\n\nWait, no. Because each stamp overwrites the two cells. So for example, if you have two overlapping stamps:\n\nSuppose you first stamp positions 0-1 as RB (so R and B). Then stamp positions 1-2 as BR (so B and R). The result would be R (from first stamp's R), then B (from first stamp's B, but then overwritten by the second stamp's B?), wait no. Wait the second stamp affects positions 1 and 2. The first stamp's position 1 was B. The second stamp on positions 1-2 would set them to B and R (if using BR) or R and B (if using RB). \n\nWait, let's think step by step:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 cells 0: R, 1: B.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 cells 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R. So the sequence is R B R. So the middle B is from the first stamp, but then overwritten by the second stamp's first part (B). Wait no, the second stamp's first part (position 1) is set to B (since BR is the stamp). So after the second stamp, the cells are:\n\n0: R (unchanged from first stamp)\n\n1: B (from second stamp's first part)\n\n2: R (from second stamp's second part)\n\nSo the sequence is R B R. So the two R's are separated by a B. So that's allowed. \n\nHmm, so the key is that in the final string, any two consecutive non-W characters must form either RB or BR. Because each stamp application can only set two adjacent cells to one of those two options, and overlapping stamps can't create other combinations. Wait, but in the example of R B R, the middle B is between two R's. Wait, but the two R's are not adjacent. So the consecutive pairs are R-B and B-R, which are allowed. \n\nWait, so the entire non-W segment must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to one of those two options, and any overlapping stamps would have to maintain that. \n\nWait, but how does that work when overlapping? Let me think of the example in note 5: the target is BRB. Let's see the consecutive pairs:\n\nB and R \u2192 BR (allowed)\n\nR and B \u2192 RB (allowed). So the pairs are okay. So the entire sequence is allowed. \n\nAnother example: the first test case's non-W part is BRBB. Wait, the example's target is B R B B W. The non-W part is BRBB. Let's look at the consecutive pairs:\n\nB and R \u2192 BR (okay)\n\nR and B \u2192 RB (okay)\n\nB and B \u2192 BB \u2192 which is not allowed. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is B R B B W. Wait, that would have two B's in a row. So according to this logic, that would be invalid. But the problem says that this is a valid example. So my reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, the example in the problem's first case: the final string is B R B B W. The non-W part is BRBB. The consecutive pairs are BR, RB, BB. The last pair BB is invalid. But according to the problem's example, this is a valid case. So my previous idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so that approach is wrong. So I need to think differently. \n\nLet me re-examine the example given in the problem's first case. The final string is B R B B W. The steps were:\n\nStart with WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), they become RB. So the string is W W W R B. \n\nThen stamp on 0-1 (positions 0 and 1) as BR \u2192 so they become B and R. Now the string is B R W R B W? Wait maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me see the example's explanation:\n\nThe first step is WWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB underlined (positions 3-4?), so the result is W W W R B W? Wait the example's first step is \"WW\" followed by RB underlined, so maybe the stamp was applied to the last two cells (positions 3 and 4?), making the string become \"WW\" + RB + W \u2192 so the string is \"WWRBW\".\n\nThen the next step is applying the stamp as BR on the first two cells (positions 0 and 1), turning them into B and R. So the string becomes BR followed by R B W \u2192 so the first two are BR, then the third is W (from previous step's third character?), but then the fourth and fifth are R and B. Wait, perhaps the example's steps are a bit different. \n\nThe final result after the third step is B R R B W \u2192 no, the example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at the example's steps again. \n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), they become RB \u2192 so the string is W W W R B W (but n is 5, so maybe the last W is not there? Wait the example's target is length 5: B R B B W? Wait the example's target is \"B R B B W\" (5 characters?), but the first step's result is \"WW\" followed by RB and then W \u2192 so the first step's result is \"WWRBW\" (5 characters). Then the second step applies the stamp on the first two (positions 0 and 1) as BR \u2192 so they become B and R. So the string becomes BR followed by R B W \u2192 but the third character was W, so after the stamp on 0-1, the third character remains W. Wait, but the second step's result is B R R B W? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second step's stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (the third and fourth characters?), but I'm getting lost. \n\nThe key point is that in the final string, there are two B's in a row. So according to my previous idea, that would be invalid, but the problem says it's a valid case. So my previous approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to think of another way. Let's think of the problem differently. Each stamp application affects two cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The order and overlapping of these stamps can lead to any combination, but perhaps the key is that the entire sequence must be such that every pair of adjacent non-W cells must form a valid pair (RB or BR) except possibly for the first and last characters? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must form a pattern where the colors alternate between R and B, but with possible W's in between. But the example with two B's in a row contradicts that. \n\nWait, in the first example's final string, the two B's are at positions 2 and 3 (assuming 0-based). Let's see their neighboring stamps. Maybe those two B's were part of different stamps. For instance, the first B could be from a stamp's first part (like the B in BR), and the second B could be from the second part of another stamp (like the B in RB). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the entire non-W segment, the colors must alternate between R and B, but starting with either R or B. Because each stamp adds a pair of R and B. So overlapping stamps can create sequences like R B R B, etc. But how does that allow two B's in a row?\n\nWait, maybe the two B's are allowed if they are part of overlapping stamps. Let me think of the example's BRBB. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first B is from a stamp's B (as in BR), then the next R is from another stamp's R (as in BR), then the next B is from a stamp's B (as in RB), and the last B is from another stamp's B (as in RB). Wait, but how would that lead to two B's in a row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two B's are part of a stamp's second position and another's first. For example, if you have a stamp applied as RB on positions 1-2, then another stamp applied as BR on positions 2-3. The first stamp would set positions 1 to R and 2 to B. The second stamp would set position 2 to B and 3 to R. Wait, but then position 2 would be B (from first stamp) then overwritten to B again (from second stamp's first part). So the sequence would be ... B (position 1?), then R (position 2?), no, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the example's BRBB. Let's see how that could be formed:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is applied on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 so B and R.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 so R (position 1) becomes B, and position 2 becomes R. Now the sequence is B B R.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 so R becomes R and B? Wait, no. Wait the stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. So after that, the sequence would be B B R B. So the first two B's are from the first two stamps. \n\nWait, but then the first two B's are adjacent. So that's allowed. So the two B's are allowed. \n\nHmm, so the key is that the entire sequence can have any combination as long as each pair of adjacent cells in the final string can be part of some stamp's application. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to one of those two options, and overlapping stamps can't create other pairs. \n\nWait in the example's BRBB, the last two B's are adjacent, which is BB. That's not allowed. So that contradicts this idea. \n\nHmm, so I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem's constraints again. \n\nThe problem allows applying the stamp multiple times. Each application can choose either RB or BR for the two cells. So each time you apply the stamp, you can choose the direction. \n\nThe key is that the final string must be achievable through any number of such operations. \n\nLet me think of the possible properties of the final string. \n\nSuppose the final string has a segment of non-W characters. Let's call this segment S. \n\nEach time you apply a stamp, you can choose any two adjacent cells in the entire row, and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe initial state is all W. So the final string must be achievable by a series of such operations. \n\nNow, the question is: what constraints must S satisfy?\n\nLet me think of the parity of the number of R and B in the segment. \n\nEach stamp application adds one R and one B. So each application contributes +1 R and +1 B. \n\nBut overlapping applications can overwrite previous colors. \n\nHmm, but the total number of R and B in the final segment must be equal? Because each stamp adds one R and one B, but overlapping can subtract. \n\nWait, no. For example, if you apply a stamp twice on the same two cells, the first time sets them to RB, the second time could set them to BR, so the total R and B would be 1 each again. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of R and B in the segment must have the same parity? \n\nWait, let's see. Each stamp application changes two cells. Each application adds one R and one B (if the previous was WW), but if they were already colored, it could change their counts. \n\nHmm, perhaps the total number of R and B in the segment must be equal? \n\nWait in the first example's segment BRBB (B, R, B, B), the count of B is 3, R is 1. So total R and B are not equal. So that idea is wrong. \n\nHmm, so that's not the case. \n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as each stamp application can flip the colors of two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but each stamp application completely sets the two cells to either RB or BR. So the previous colors don't matter. \n\nSo the final colors of the segment must be achievable by some combination of these operations. \n\nLet me think of the segment as a sequence of R and B. \n\nSuppose the segment is of length m. \n\nEach stamp can be applied anywhere in the segment (or overlapping with other parts). \n\nThe key is that the entire sequence can be built by a series of such operations. \n\nLet me think of the possible sequences. \n\nSuppose the segment is of length 1: then it's impossible (since you can't apply a stamp to a single cell). So any segment of length 1 \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nIf the segment is of length 2: it must be either RB or BR \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nFor length 3: Let's see. \n\nSuppose the desired sequence is RBR. \n\nHow can this be formed?\n\nFirst, apply a stamp on positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W (assuming third is W, but in this case, the third is part of the segment). Wait, maybe the third is part of the segment. Let me think of the three cells as needing to be RBR. \n\nFirst, apply stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThen apply stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 so position 1 becomes B, position 2 becomes R. \n\nThe result is R (from first stamp's R), B (overwritten to B?), wait no. Wait the first stamp on 0-1 gives R and B. The second stamp on 1-2 sets position 1 to B (from BR's first part) and position 2 to R. So the sequence is R B R \u2192 which is RBR. So that works. \n\nAnother example: the first example's segment BRBB (length 4). Let's see:\n\nB R B B. \n\nHow to form this?\n\nMaybe:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes R (no?), wait:\n\nWait first stamp on 0-1 gives B and R. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) as RB \u2192 so position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. \n\nNow the sequence is B (from first stamp's B), R (overwritten to R?), then B. \n\nWait the first two are B and R (from first stamp). The second stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) would set them to R and B. So after that, the first three are B (position 0), R (position 1), B (position 2). \n\nThen a third stamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 so position 2 becomes R, position 3 becomes B. \n\nNow the sequence is B R B B \u2192 which matches the example. \n\nSo the two B's at the end are allowed. \n\nHmm, so the key is that the entire sequence can be built by overlapping stamps, but the consecutive pairs can be anything as long as each pair is part of some stamp's application. \n\nWait, but in the example's BRBB, the last two B's are adjacent. How did that happen? \n\nThe third stamp was applied on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 so position 2 (previously B) becomes R, and position 3 becomes B. Wait, no, that would make position 2 R and 3 B. So the sequence after that would be B R B R B? No, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait let me retrace:\n\nAfter first two stamps, the first three are B R B (positions 0,1,2). \n\nThen applying a stamp on 2-3 (positions 2 and 3) as RB \u2192 so position 2 becomes R, position 3 becomes B. \n\nSo the sequence becomes B R (positions 0-1), then R (position 2), B (position 3). So the full sequence is B R R B? No, that's not the case. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the entire segment, the colors must alternate between R and B, but with possible overlaps. \n\nWait in the example's BRBB, the sequence is B R B B. The last two B's are consecutive. So that breaks the alternation. \n\nHmm, so that approach is not correct. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of possible transitions. \n\nEach stamp application can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nSuppose I have a segment S. To form S, every pair of adjacent cells in S must be part of at least one stamp's application. \n\nWait, but how does that work? \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nWait, for example, the sequence BRBB can be partitioned as BR and RB? \n\nBR is the first two, then RB is the next two (positions 1-2 and 2-3). \n\nWait the first two are BR (B and R), then the next two (positions 1-2: R and B) \u2192 which is RB. Then the last two (positions 2-3: B and B) \u2192 which is BB, which is invalid. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sequence can be built by overlapping stamps such that every position is covered by at least one stamp. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must have an even number of characters? \n\nWait the first example's segment is length 4 (even), the note 5's example is length 3 (odd). \n\nSo that's not the case. \n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think of the problem from another angle. \n\nSuppose the final string has a segment S of non-W characters. \n\nEach stamp application can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. \n\nThe key is that the entire segment must be achievable by some combination of these operations. \n\nLet me think of the possible sequences that can be formed. \n\nLet me consider that each stamp can be applied anywhere, and can choose the direction (RB or BR). \n\nThe operations can be applied in any order and any positions. \n\nThe initial state is all W. \n\nThe final state is the target string. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether the target can be formed. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nEach time you apply a stamp, you choose two adjacent cells and set them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe final colors of the cells are the result of all these operations. \n\nThe key is that for each cell in the non-W segment, it must have been set by an odd number of stamps (since each stamp changes its color). \n\nWait, no. Because each stamp overwrites the cell's color completely. So the final color of a cell depends on the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nAh! That's an important point. \n\nEach time a cell is under a stamp, its color is set to either R or B, depending on the stamp's direction and its position in the stamp. \n\nSo the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. \n\nTherefore, for a cell to be R or B, it must have been the last stamp's R or B in its position. \n\nSo, for the entire segment S (non-W), each cell must be covered by at least one stamp (since they are not W). \n\nMoreover, the sequence must be such that there exists a set of overlapping stamps (each covering two adjacent cells) such that the final colors are as desired. \n\nHmm, this is still vague. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters in the segment must be either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but in the first example's segment BRBB, the last two are BB, which is not allowed. \n\nBut the example is valid. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, maybe the consecutive pairs don't have to be RB or BR, but the entire sequence can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, let's think of the first example's segment BRBB. \n\nThe sequence is B R B B. \n\nLet me see how this can be formed by overlapping stamps. \n\nSuppose the first stamp is applied on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSecond stamp on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 as BB? No, can't do that. \n\nWait, the third stamp must be either RB or BR. \n\nSo third stamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nWait, then the third and fourth positions (assuming 0-based) would be B and R. \n\nWait, let's track step by step:\n\nInitial: all W \u2192 W W W W W (for the first example's 5 cells). \n\nFirst stamp on positions 3-4 (the last two) as RB \u2192 so they become R B. The string is now W W W R B. \n\nSecond stamp on positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. So the string becomes B R W R B. \n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 (positions 2 and 3) as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSo after third stamp, positions 2 and 3 are set to B and R. \n\nThe resulting string is B R B R B. \n\nHmm, that's not the desired BRBB. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThen the string after third stamp would be B R (positions 0-1), then position 2 is W (from previous step?), no. \n\nWait, after the second stamp, the string is B R W R B. \n\nThen applying a stamp on positions 2-3 (W and R) as BR \u2192 so position 2 becomes B, position 3 becomes R. \n\nSo the string becomes B R B R B. \n\nHmm, still not the desired B R B B. \n\nWait maybe another approach. \n\nSuppose the third stamp is applied on positions 1-2 (R and W) as BR \u2192 so position 1 becomes B, position 2 becomes R. \n\nThen the string after second stamp was B R W R B. \n\nAfter third stamp on 1-2: \n\nposition 1 is set to B (from BR's first part), position 2 to R. \n\nSo the string becomes B (position 0), B (position 1), R (position 2), R (position 3), B (position4). \n\nSo the first four characters are B B R R \u2192 not the desired BRBB. \n\nHmm, I'm not getting the example's desired result. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is B R B B W. Let's see how to get that. \n\nLet me try:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 3-4 (R B) \u2192 W W W R B. \n\nSecond stamp on 0-1 (B R) \u2192 B R W R B. \n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 (W and R) as RB \u2192 so position 2 becomes R, position3 becomes B. \n\nNow the string is B R R B B. \n\nThat's B R R B B. The first two are B R (okay), then R R (invalid). \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, third stamp on positions 1-2 (R and W) as BR \u2192 so position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R. \n\nThen the string becomes B B R R B. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nWait maybe the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (W and R) as BR \u2192 so position2 becomes B, position3 becomes R. \n\nThen the string is B R B R B. \n\nHmm, not the desired B R B B. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's final string is B R B B W. Let's see:\n\nThe fourth character is B. \n\nSuppose the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (W and R) as BR \u2192 so position2 becomes B, position3 becomes R. \n\nThen the string after second stamp was B R W R B. \n\nAfter third stamp on 2-3: \n\nposition2 is B, position3 is R \u2192 so the string is B R B R B. \n\nThen a fourth stamp on positions 3-4 (R and B) as BR \u2192 so position3 becomes B, position4 becomes R. \n\nNow the string is B R B B R. Not helpful. \n\nHmm, I'm not able to get the example's desired result. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the example's steps. \n\nThe example's explanation says:\n\nThe first step is WWWWW \u2192 WW followed by RB underlined (positions 3-4?), resulting in WWRBW. \n\nSecond step: applying the stamp as BR on the first two (positions 0-1) \u2192 so they become B and R. So the string becomes BR followed by R B W \u2192 but the third character was W, so after the second step, it's B R R B W. \n\nWait, then the third step is applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (R and R) \u2192 but that's two R's. \n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied to any two adjacent cells, even if they are not W. \n\nSo in the third step, they apply the stamp on positions 1-2 (R and R) as RB or BR. \n\nSuppose they choose BR for that stamp. \n\nThen positions 1 and 2 become B and R. \n\nSo the string after third step is B (position0), B (position1), R (position2), B (position3), W (position4). \n\nSo the first four characters are B B R B \u2192 not the desired B R B B. \n\nHmm, I'm really confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: \n\nEach non-W segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. \n\nEach stamp covers two cells. \n\nThe final colors of the segment must be such that every cell is covered by at least one stamp (since they are not W). \n\nMoreover, the sequence must be such that there exists a way to choose directions (RB or BR) for each stamp such that the final colors match. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence must alternate between R and B, but allowing for some flexibility. \n\nWait, in the first example's segment BRBB, the sequence is B R B B. \n\nThe first three characters are B R B \u2192 alternating. The last B breaks it. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must have an even number of transitions between R and B. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAnother idea: the entire sequence must be such that the first and last characters are the same, or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, the number of R's and B's must be equal? \n\nIn the first example's segment BRBB (B, R, B, B), there are 3 B's and 1 R \u2192 not equal. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: \n\nEach stamp application can be considered as a pair of colors (either RB or BR) applied to two adjacent cells. \n\nThe final colors of the segment are the result of all these pairs overlapping. \n\nThe key is that for each position in the segment, the final color must be the last color set by any stamp covering it. \n\nSo, for the entire segment, there must exist a set of overlapping pairs (each being RB or BR) such that their combined effect results in the desired sequence. \n\nThis seems too vague. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the sequence must not have three consecutive same colors. \n\nWait in the first example's segment BRBB has two B's at the end. So that's allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB, BR, or WW (but WW is not part of the non-W segment). \n\nWait, but the non-W segments are split by W's, so the segments themselves don't have W's. \n\nSo the consecutive pairs in the segment must be either RB or BR. \n\nWait, but the first example's segment has B R B B \u2192 the last two are BB, which is invalid. \n\nBut the example is valid. So this can't be the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the entire sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the sequence B R B B can be partitioned as B R (BR), then R B (RB), then B B (invalid). \n\nNo, that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, overlapping pairs: \n\nThe first two are BR (B and R), the next two are RB (R and B), and the last two are BB (invalid). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps such that every position is covered by at least one stamp, and the final colors are the result of the last stamp covering each position. \n\nSo for example, in the first example's segment BRBB: \n\nSuppose the first stamp covers positions 0-1 (B R), the second covers 1-2 (R B), and the third covers 2-3 (B B) \u2192 but the third can't be BB. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, the third stamp covers 2-3 as BR \u2192 so B and R. \n\nThen the final sequence would be B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern in the test cases. \n\nThe problem's notes say that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is NO. \n\nSo any segment of length 1 is invalid. \n\nAnother note says that the seventh test case is all W's \u2192 answer is YES. \n\nThe fifth test case's example is BRB (length 3). \n\nThe sixth test case's example is RBR (length 3). \n\nWait, the sixth test case's example is \"RBRB\" \u2192 no, the note says sixth case's example is \"WWW\" \u2192 no, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nThe fifth test case's example is \"BRB\" (length 3). \n\nSo for length 3, it's possible. \n\nSo the length can be odd. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the entire sequence must have an even number of transitions between R and B. \n\nWait, transitions between consecutive characters. \n\nFor example, in BRBB: \n\nB to R \u2192 transition. \n\nR to B \u2192 transition. \n\nB to B \u2192 no transition. \n\nTotal transitions: 2 \u2192 even. \n\nIn the fifth example's BRB (length 3): \n\nB to R \u2192 transition. \n\nR to B \u2192 transition. \n\nTotal transitions: 2 \u2192 even. \n\nThe first example's segment has two transitions. \n\nThe example with two B's in a row has two transitions. \n\nHmm, but what about a sequence like RBR (transitions: R-B (transition), B-R (transition) \u2192 total 2 \u2192 even). \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nWhat about a sequence like RBBR (length 4): \n\nR-B (transition), B-B (no), B-R (transition). Total transitions: 2 \u2192 even. \n\nBut the sequence has BB in the middle. \n\nHmm, but can that be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nThird stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, 3 becomes R. \n\nThe sequence would be R B B R \u2192 which has transitions at R-B, B-B (no), B-R (transition). So transitions count is 2. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo the transitions must be even? \n\nBut what about a sequence like RBRB (length 4): transitions between each pair \u2192 3 transitions (odd). \n\nWait R-B (1), B-R (2), R-B (3) \u2192 total 3 transitions (odd). \n\nIs that possible? \n\nLet's see: \n\nFirst stamp on 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSecond on 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nThird on 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, 3 becomes B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B \u2192 transitions between each pair \u2192 3 transitions (odd). \n\nBut according to the transitions count idea, this would be invalid. But the sequence can be formed. \n\nHmm, so that idea is also wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence must be such that it can be written as a series of overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the sequence BRBB can be written as BR followed by RB followed by BB? No. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence can be formed by overlapping stamps such that every position is covered by at least one stamp, and the final colors are the last stamp's contribution. \n\nPerhaps the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last characters. \n\nNo, the first example's segment has two B's at the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as a graph where each state is the current colors of the segment, and transitions are applying a stamp. But this is not feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following: \n\nEach stamp application can be represented as choosing a position i and a direction (RB or BR). \n\nThe final colors must be the result of all these choices. \n\nThe key is that for each position in the segment, the last stamp that covers it must set it to its final color. \n\nSo for the entire segment, there must exist a way to choose for each position i the last stamp that covers it, such that: \n\n- For each stamp covering positions i and i+1, the colors at i and i+1 are set to either RB or BR. \n\n- The final colors of all positions are as desired. \n\nThis seems like a system of constraints. \n\nLet me think of the sequence as a series of colors. \n\nFor each position i from 0 to m-1 (where m is the length of the segment), the color must be either R or B. \n\nWe need to choose for each position i whether it was the first or second element of a stamp's pair. \n\nFor example, suppose the segment is B R B B. \n\nPosition 0 is B \u2192 it must be the first element of a stamp (BR) or the second element of a stamp (RB). \n\nIf it's the first element of a BR stamp, then position 1 must be R. \n\nWhich it is. \n\nPosition 1 is R \u2192 it could be the second element of a BR stamp (position 0-1) or the first element of an RB stamp (position 1-2). \n\nPosition 2 is B \u2192 it could be the second element of an RB stamp (position 1-2) or the first element of a BR stamp (position 2-3). \n\nPosition 3 is B \u2192 it must be the second element of a BR stamp (position 2-3) or the first element of a RB stamp (but there's no position 4). \n\nWait, since it's the last position, it can only be the second element of a stamp covering positions 2-3. \n\nSo for position 3 to be B, the stamp covering 2-3 must be BR (so position 2 is B and 3 is R?) No, wait: \n\nIf the stamp on 2-3 is BR \u2192 then position 2 is B, position3 is R. \n\nBut the desired is B at position3. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the stamp on 2-3 is RB \u2192 then position2 is R and position3 is B. \n\nSo that would set position3 to B. \n\nSo for position3 to be B, the stamp on 2-3 must be RB. \n\nSo let's see: \n\nStamp on 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThe final colors would be: \n\nPosition0: B (from first stamp's first part). \n\nPosition1: R (from first stamp's second part, then overwritten by second stamp's first part (R) \u2192 no, the second stamp on 1-2 as RB would set position1 to R (first part of RB?), or R is the first part? \n\nWait, the stamp on 1-2 as RB would set position1 to R and position2 to B. \n\nSo after first stamp (0-1: BR \u2192 B R), then second stamp (1-2: RB \u2192 R B). \n\nPosition0 remains B. \n\nPosition1 is set to R (from first stamp), then overwritten to R (from second stamp's first part \u2192 same value). \n\nPosition2 is set to B (from second stamp's second part). \n\nThen third stamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 position2 becomes R, position3 becomes B. \n\nSo the final sequence is B (0), R (1), R (2), B (3). \n\nWhich is B R R B \u2192 not the desired B R B B. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, third stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThen position3 would be R. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the conditions. \n\nThe problem's code currently splits the string into segments separated by W. For each segment, we need to check some condition. \n\nThe code's current loop is: \n\nfor each segment in ar (the split by W):\n\n   if (some condition) \u2192 else print NO. \n\nSo the condition must be something that each segment must satisfy. \n\nThe problem's examples suggest that segments of length 1 are invalid. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment is length 3 (BRB) \u2192 valid. \n\nThe first example's segment is length 4 (BRBB) \u2192 valid. \n\nThe note's second, third, fourth test cases have segments of length 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the first condition is that the length of the segment must be at least 2. \n\nBut what else? \n\nAnother observation: in any valid segment, the first and last characters must be the same? \n\nIn the first example's segment BRBB \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same. \n\nThe fifth test case's BRB \u2192 first B, last B \u2192 same. \n\nThe example with RBR (length 3) \u2192 first R, last R \u2192 same. \n\nThe example with RBRB (length 4) \u2192 first R, last B \u2192 different \u2192 but can that be valid? \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nRBRB \u2192 first R, last B. \n\nCan this be formed? \n\nYes: \n\nStamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nStamp 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, 3 becomes R. \n\nWait, that gives R B B R \u2192 not RBRB. \n\nAlternatively: \n\nStamp 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence would be B R B R \u2192 which is BRBR. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe first and last characters must be the same. \n\nIn the first example's segment, they are B and B \u2192 same. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment is B and B \u2192 same. \n\nThe RBR example's first and last are R and R \u2192 same. \n\nThe RBRB example's first and last are R and B \u2192 different \u2192 so it would be invalid. \n\nBut can that sequence be formed? \n\nSuppose the desired sequence is R B R B (length 4). \n\nFirst stamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSecond stamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nThird stamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B \u2192 which matches. \n\nThe first and last are R and B \u2192 different. \n\nSo this would violate the first and last being same condition. \n\nBut the sequence can be formed. \n\nSo that condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the number of R's and B's must have the same parity. \n\nIn the first example's segment: 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 total 4 (even). \n\nR and B counts: 1 and 3 \u2192 difference is 2. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment has 1 R and 2 B's \u2192 difference 1. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of R and B must be even? \n\nIn the first example's segment: 1+3=4 \u2192 even. \n\nFifth test case: 1+2=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 but it's valid. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last pair. \n\nNo, the first example's segment has BB at the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the first example's segment BRBB can be partitioned as BR, RB, BB \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the first two are BR, the next two are RB (positions 1-2 and 2-3). \n\nWait positions 1-2 are R and B \u2192 RB. \n\nPositions 2-3 are B and B \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps where each new stamp overlaps with the previous one by one cell. \n\nFor example, the first example's segment: \n\nStamp 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait the third stamp on 2-3 as RB would set them to R and B. \n\nSo the sequence would be B R B B \u2192 yes! \n\nAh! \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFirst stamp on 0-1: BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSecond stamp on 1-2: RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThird stamp on 2-3: RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the third stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position2 to R and position3 to B. \n\nSo after third stamp, the sequence is B (0), R (1), R (2), B (3). \n\nNo, that's not the desired B R B B. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, third stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThen position3 would be R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, third stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 B and R. \n\nThen the sequence is B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern in the conditions that the code needs to check. \n\nThe code currently splits the string into segments separated by W. \n\nFor each segment, we need to check some condition. \n\nThe problem's examples suggest that segments of length 1 are invalid. \n\nOther examples with lengths 3 and 4 are valid. \n\nSo the first condition is that the length of the segment must be even or odd? \n\nNo, the fifth test case has length 3 (odd) and is valid. \n\nThe first example's segment is length 4 (even) and valid. \n\nSo length can be even or odd. \n\nAnother observation: in any valid segment, the first and last characters must be the same. \n\nIn the first example's segment: B and B \u2192 same. \n\nFifth test case's segment: B and B \u2192 same. \n\nThe example with RBR (length 3): R and R \u2192 same. \n\nThe example with RBRB (length 4): R and B \u2192 different \u2192 but can that be formed? \n\nIf the sequence is R B R B \u2192 first and last are R and B \u2192 different. \n\nBut can this be formed? \n\nYes: \n\nStamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B \u2192 which matches. \n\nSo first and last are different \u2192 this is allowed. \n\nSo that condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the entire sequence must be such that it can be written as a series of overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the first example's segment BRBB can be written as BR followed by RB followed by BB \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence can be formed by overlapping stamps such that each new stamp overlaps with the previous one by one cell. \n\nFor example, the first example's segment: \n\nBR (0-1), then RB (1-2), then BB (2-3) \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, except for the first and last pair. \n\nNo, the first example's last two are BB. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the entire sequence is a palindrome? \n\nNo, the first example's segment is B R B B \u2192 not a palindrome. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the sequence must have an even number of characters, or if it's odd, the middle character can be anything. \n\nNo, the fifth test case has length 3 (odd) and is valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the sequence must alternate between R and B, but with possible overlaps. \n\nWait, the first example's segment is B R B B \u2192 the first three alternate, but the last two are B's. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the sequence can be formed by a series of stamps such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nBut the first example's segment has BB at the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nEach stamp application can be considered as choosing a position i and a direction (RB or BR). \n\nThe final color of each position is determined by the last stamp that covers it. \n\nSo for the entire segment, the sequence must be such that there exists a way to choose for each position i the last stamp that covers it, such that: \n\n- For each position i, it is covered by at least one stamp. \n\n- For each stamp covering positions j and j+1, the colors at j and j+1 are either RB or BR. \n\n- The final colors of all positions are as desired. \n\nThis is a system of constraints. \n\nTo model this, perhaps the sequence must satisfy that for every pair of consecutive characters, they can be part of some stamp's pair. \n\nBut this is not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the first example's segment BRBB can be partitioned as BR (0-1), RB (1-2), and BB (2-3) \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, except for the first and last pair. \n\nNo, the first example's last pair is BB. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the sequence has no three consecutive same colors. \n\nThe first example's segment has two B's at the end \u2192 allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the sequence must be such that the colors alternate between R and B, but with the possibility of having two consecutive same colors if they are the result of overlapping stamps. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nPerhaps the sequence must be such that the number of R's and B's differ by at most one. \n\nIn the first example's segment: 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 difference 2 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the sequence can be formed by a series of stamps such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nBut the first example's segment has BB at the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code's current structure. \n\nThe code splits the string into segments separated by W. \n\nFor each segment, it checks some condition. \n\nThe condition must be that the segment is empty (allowed), or has even length? \n\nWait the fifth test case's segment has length 3 (odd) and is valid. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nThe condition must be that the segment has even length or odd length? \n\nNo, both are allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the segment has length 0 (all W's) or the length is at least 2 and the first and last characters are the same. \n\nIn the first example's segment: B and B \u2192 same \u2192 valid. \n\nFifth test case's segment: B and B \u2192 same \u2192 valid. \n\nThe example with RBRB (length 4) has first R and last B \u2192 different \u2192 invalid. \n\nBut earlier I thought that could be formed. \n\nWait, if the first and last are different, then the condition would reject it. \n\nBut in the example I thought of earlier (RBRB), the first and last are different. \n\nIf the condition requires first and last to be same, then that sequence would be rejected. \n\nBut can it be formed? \n\nLet me try again: \n\nDesired sequence: R B R B. \n\nFirst stamp 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSecond stamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, 2 becomes R. \n\nThird stamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B \u2192 which matches. \n\nThe first and last are R and B \u2192 different. \n\nSo the condition requiring first and last to be same would reject this valid case. \n\nSo that's not the condition. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the segment has even length or the length is odd and the first and last characters are the same. \n\nIn the first example's segment (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nFifth test case (length 3 odd, first and last B \u2192 same \u2192 okay). \n\nThe RBRB example (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nThe example with RBR (length 3, first and last R \u2192 same \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBRB (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBR (length 3, first and last R \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBB (length 3, first R and last B \u2192 different \u2192 invalid). \n\nSo this condition would work. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis. \n\nThe first example's segment is length 4 even \u2192 okay. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment is length 3 (odd) and first and last are same \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment of length 3 with first and last different \u2192 invalid. \n\nA segment of length 5 with first and last same \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment of length 5 with first and last different \u2192 invalid. \n\nThis seems to fit the examples. \n\nLet me see the first example's segment: B R B B \u2192 length 4 even \u2192 okay. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment: B R B \u2192 length 3, first and last B \u2192 okay. \n\nThe example with RBRB (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like R B R B (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like R B B \u2192 length 3, first R and last B \u2192 different \u2192 invalid. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the condition for each segment is: \n\nif the segment length is 0 \u2192 allowed. \n\nelse: \n\nif the length is even \u2192 allowed. \n\nor the length is odd and the first and last characters are the same \u2192 allowed. \n\nOtherwise, not allowed. \n\nThis would explain the examples. \n\nLet me test this with the first example's segment: length 4 even \u2192 allowed. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment: length 3, first and last B \u2192 allowed. \n\nA segment of length 1 \u2192 not even and first and last are same (since length 1) but length is 1 \u2192 not allowed. \n\nA segment of length 3 with first and last same \u2192 allowed. \n\nA segment of length 3 with first and last different \u2192 not allowed. \n\nA segment of length 5 with first and last same \u2192 allowed. \n\nA segment of length 5 with first and last different \u2192 not allowed. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the condition for each segment is: \n\nif the segment length is 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\nif length is even \u2192 okay. \n\nelse (length is odd): first and last characters must be the same. \n\nSo the code should check for each segment s: \n\nif s.length() ==0 \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\nif s.length() %2 ==0 \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\ns.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1) \u2192 okay. \n\nOtherwise, no. \n\nThis seems to be the condition. \n\nLet me see the first example's segment: length 4 even \u2192 okay. \n\nThe fifth test case's segment: length 3, first and last B \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like RBR (length 3, first and last R \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBB (length 3, first R and last B \u2192 not okay \u2192 returns NO). \n\nA segment like RBRB (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBRB (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBRB (length 4 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like RBR (length 3, first and last R \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like B (length 1 \u2192 no). \n\nA segment like BB (length 2 even \u2192 okay). \n\nA segment like BBB (length 3, first and last B \u2192 okay). \n\nYes, this seems to work. \n\nSo the code should check for each segment s: \n\nif s is empty \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\nif length is even \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\nif first and last characters are the same \u2192 okay. \n\nelse \u2192 no. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nfor each segment s in ar: \n\nif s.length() ==0 \u2192 continue (okay). \n\nelse: \n\nif (s.length() %2 ==0) \u2192 okay. \n\nelse: \n\nif (s.charAt(0) != s.charAt(s.length()-1)) \u2192 then return no. \n\nElse okay. \n\nSo the code's loop should check this. \n\nNow, the code's current loop is: \n\nfor(String s:ar) \n\n{ \n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) \u2192 \n\nelse \u2192 print NO. \n\n} \n\nSo the condition inside the if should be the condition that the segment is valid. \n\nThe code should return \"NO\" if any segment is invalid. \n\nSo the condition inside the if should be the negation of the invalid condition. \n\nWait, the code is structured as: \n\nfor each segment s: \n\nif (condition) \u2192 do nothing (valid). \n\nelse \u2192 print NO and break. \n\nSo the condition inside the if should be the condition that the segment is valid. \n\nSo the code should check for each segment s: \n\nif (s is valid) \u2192 continue. \n\nelse \u2192 print NO. \n\nSo the condition inside the if is the validity condition. \n\nThe validity condition is: \n\nif s is empty \u2192 valid. \n\nelse: \n\nif length even \u2192 valid. \n\nelse: \n\nfirst and last characters are same \u2192 valid. \n\nSo the code for the condition would be: \n\nif (s.length() ==0 || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 !=0 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1))) \n\nBut wait, the third condition is when length is odd and first and last are same. \n\nSo combining: \n\nvalid = (s.length() ==0) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==0) ) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==1) && (s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) ) \n\nBut the first case (s.length() ==0) is already covered by the first condition. \n\nSo the code can be written as: \n\nif (s.length() ==0) \u2192 valid. \n\nelse if (s.length() %2 ==0) \u2192 valid. \n\nelse \u2192 check first and last. \n\nSo in code: \n\nif (s.length() ==0) { continue; } \n\nelse if (s.length() %2 ==0) { continue; } \n\nelse { \n\nif (s.charAt(0) != s.charAt(s.length()-1)) \u2192 return no. \n\n} \n\nBut since the code is inside the for loop, the code must be written as a single condition. \n\nAlternatively, the condition inside the if statement should be the validity condition. \n\nSo the code inside the for loop would be: \n\nif ( (s.length() ==0) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==0) ) || \n\n( (s.length() %2 ==1) && (s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) ) ) \n\nthen continue. \n\nElse \u2192 print NO. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is: \n\nif (s.length() ==0 || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1))) \n\nSo the code should have this condition in the if statement. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ns.length() ==0 || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1))\n\nSo the code inside the for loop would be:\n\nfor(String s:ar) {\n\n    if( (s.length() ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==0) || (s.length() %2 ==1 && s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(s.length()-1)) ) {\n\n        // valid, continue\n\n    } else {\n\n        System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n        continue in;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is the condition inside the if statement."
