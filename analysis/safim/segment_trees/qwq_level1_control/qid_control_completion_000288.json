Wait, the code's loop over the map 't' is trying to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall. The 'he' variable is the current height, and 'xie' is the slope? Let me think again. The initial approach for such problems is often to model the changes in the function's slope. Each rain's contribution is a V-shape, so when you add all these, the total function is a piecewise linear function. The maximum value of this function is what we need to check against m. The code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 't' map probably contains all the critical points where the slope changes. The 'xie' variable is the current slope. The 'he' is the current height at the current position. The loop over the map 't' is processing each interval between two consecutive x-values. For each interval from last to current x, the slope is xie, so the height increases (or decreases) linearly. The maximum height in this interval would be at one of the endpoints.

But I'm not sure. The problem is that the code's current approach is unclear. Let me think of the problem again. The key is that for each day i, when we remove it, we need to check whether the maximum accumulated rainfall (without that day's contribution) is <= m. \n\nThe straightforward way is to compute for each day i, the maximum of (a_j - contribution_i), where contribution_i is the contribution of day i to position j. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 2e5. Hence, we need a smarter approach. The code's approach seems to be using line sweep to compute the maximum. The initial code's approach is to model the accumulated rainfall as a piecewise linear function. Each day's rain contributes a V-shaped function. The total function is the sum of all these V's. The maximum of this function is the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The code is trying to compute this maximum. The code's 'mx' variable is supposed to be the maximum value. The code's loop over the map 't' is processing the events (points where the slope changes). The 'he' variable is the current height at the current x. The 'xie' is the current slope. The 'ans' map is storing the height at each x. The 'mx' variable is being updated in the loop. The missing condition is when to update 'mx' and 'mn'. The code's current lines for mn and mx are:\n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx ); But perhaps the correct condition is when he > m, then we need to track the regions where the function exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. The leftmost point would be the earliest x where the function is above m, and the rightmost is the latest.",

Alternatively, perhaps the code is making a mistake here, and the correct approach is different. Alternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. The maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. Hence, the condition is if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. In that case, the code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. The code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. But the code's final check is using mn and mx. Wait, the code's final loop for each day i is:\n\nif (q[i].a - q[i].b <= mn && q[i].a + q[i].b >= mx) \u2192 output 1. This suggests that the day's interval must cover the mn and mx points.

The code then computes the leftmost point as i.first - (he - m). Wait, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. If the slope is 1, then the function increases by 1 per unit x. \n\nAt position x, the value is he. The point where the function reaches m would be at x - (he - m). Hence, the leftmost point would be x - (he - m). Similarly, the rightmost point would be x + (he - m) if the slope is -1? Hmm, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. But in reality, the slope can be any integer. This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. The maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. Hence, the condition is if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. In that case, the code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. The code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. But then, the final condition for each day would be different. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should look for the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires for each day i, whether removing it would make the maximum accumulated rainfall <= m. \n\nThe straightforward approach is to compute the maximum without each day's contribution. But doing this naively is O(n^2), which is too slow. Hence, we need a smarter way.",

Alternatively, the maximum can be found by considering all the peaks of the V's. The peak of each day's V is at x_i, with value p_i. The total accumulated rainfall at x_i is the sum of all p_j minus the distance from x_j to x_i. Wait, no. The contribution of each day j to position x_i is max(0, p_j - |x_j - x_i|). The total at x_i is sum_{j} max(0, p_j - |x_j - x_i|). The maximum of this over all x is the maximum accumulated rainfall. To compute this maximum efficiently, we can model the function as a piecewise linear function and find its maximum. The code's approach is trying to do this with a line sweep. The line sweep approach involves tracking the slope and current height as we move along the x-axis. The events are the points where the slope changes. Each day's rain contributes two events: at x_i - p_i (start of the V), and x_i + p_i (end of the V). The slope changes by +1 at x_i - p_i, then -2 at x_i (the peak), then +1 again at x_i + p_i. Wait, perhaps the slope changes are as follows: The V-shaped function for day i contributes a slope of +1 from x_i - p_i to x_i, then slope -1 from x_i to x_i + p_i.",

This is complicated. Perhaps the code's approach is correct for the problem's constraints, and the missing condition is simply (he > m). Hence, the missing code is: \n\nif (he > m) So the code should be: \n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n\n    mx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\n} Hence, the missing code is the condition 'he > m' in the if statement. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n\n    mx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\n}\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. The original code has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n    mn=min(i.first-(he-m),mn);\n\n    mx=max(i.first+(he-m),mx);\n\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the condition inside the if statement. The condition should be (he > m). Hence, the missing code is:\n\nhe > m\n\nSo the complete line is:\n\nif(he > m) {\n\n    ... \n\n} Hence, the answer is to replace the comment with 'he > m'.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this code. The problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The code provided seems to be using some kind of line sweep or interval approach, but there's a missing condition in the loop over the map 't'. \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem again. Each day's rain contributes to the accumulated rainfall at each position j. The contribution is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). The flood happens if any position's a_j exceeds m. The task is, for each day i, check if removing that day's rain (setting p_i to 0) would prevent the flood from ever occurring.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be calculating the maximum accumulated rainfall over all positions. If the maximum is <= m, then it's okay. But when we remove a day's rain, we need to adjust the maximum and see if it's still within m.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n\nThe code reads all the days' x_i and p_i, then builds a map 't' which probably tracks the changes in the accumulated rainfall as we move along the positions. The map 't' is built by considering the intervals where the rain contributes. For each day's rain, the effect is a diamond shape (since the contribution is a V-shape centered at x_i with slope -1 on each side, up to p_i). The total contribution at any position is the sum of all these V-shapes. \n\nThe code then processes the events in the map 't' in order. The variables 'he' and 'xie' might be tracking the current height and the slope? The 'ans' map might store the accumulated height at certain points. The 'mn' and 'mx' variables are probably tracking the minimum and maximum positions where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m?\n\nWait, the code's loop over the map 't' is trying to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall. The 'he' variable is the current height, and 'xie' is the slope? Let me think again.\n\nThe initial approach for such problems is often to model the changes in the function's slope. Each rain's contribution is a V-shape, so when you add all these, the total function is a piecewise linear function. The maximum value of this function is what we need to check against m. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 't' map probably contains all the critical points where the slope changes. The 'xie' variable is the current slope. The 'he' is the current height at the current position. \n\nThe loop over the map 't' is processing each interval between two consecutive x-values. For each interval from last to current x, the slope is xie, so the height increases (or decreases) linearly. The maximum height in this interval would be at one of the endpoints. \n\nWait, but how do we track the maximum? The code is trying to track the maximum and minimum positions where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. Or maybe mn and mx are the leftmost and rightmost points where the accumulated rainfall is above m? Not sure yet.\n\nThe key part missing is the condition in the 'if' statement where the code says /* TODO: Your code here */. The code is inside the loop over the map entries. The 'he' is the accumulated height up to the current position. The 'ans' is storing the he at each point. \n\nWait, the code's 'ans' is being assigned he at i.first. But perhaps the idea is that between last and current x, the slope is xie, so the maximum in that interval would be at the start or end. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'mx' variable is supposed to be the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'he' is the current height at position i.first. The 'xie' is the slope. So between last and current x, the height changes by slope * (current x - last). \n\nWait, the 'he' is being updated as he += (i.first - last) * xie. So 'he' is the accumulated height at the current position. \n\nThe 'ans' is storing he at each i.first. \n\nThe 'mn' and 'mx' variables are being updated here. The comment says to check if the current he exceeds m. So the condition should be if (he > m). \n\nWait, if the current he (the accumulated rainfall at position i.first) is greater than m, then that means a flood occurs. But the problem requires that after removing one day's rain, there is no flood at any moment. So the code is trying to track whether the maximum ever exceeds m. \n\nWait, the code's approach might be to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall. If the maximum is <= m, then it's okay. But when we remove a day's rain, we need to see if the new maximum is <= m. \n\nBut how does the code handle this? The current code seems to be trying to compute the maximum and minimum positions where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'mx' variable is being set to the maximum between its current value and (i.first + (he - m)), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) {\n    mn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n    mx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current he exceeds m. So when he > m, then the region where the accumulated rainfall is above m would extend from some left to some right. The mn and mx variables are tracking the leftmost and rightmost points where the accumulated rainfall is above m. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that whenever the accumulated rainfall at a point is above m, the regions where it's above m can be tracked. The mn and mx variables are the leftmost and rightmost points where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'mx' variable is the maximum value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'he' is the current height at position i.first. So if he > m, then the maximum is at least he. So the 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and he. \n\nBut in the code, the line is:\n\nmx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\nThat doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the intervals where the accumulated rainfall is above m. The mn and mx variables are the leftmost and rightmost positions where the accumulated rainfall is above m. \n\nSuppose that when the accumulated rainfall at a certain position is above m, then the region where it's above m could extend to the left and right. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. If the entire interval between last and current x has a height exceeding m, then the mn and mx would be updated accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'he' is the current height. So whenever he exceeds m, then the maximum is at least he. So the condition should be if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. \n\nBut in the code's current setup, the 'mx' is being set to the maximum between (i.first + (he - m)) and the current mx. That seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum possible value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'he' is the current height at position i.first. So the maximum would be the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'mx' variable is supposed to track the maximum value. So in the loop, whenever the current 'he' is greater than m, then the maximum is at least he, so we can set mx to the maximum between mx and he. \n\nBut in the code, the line is:\n\nmx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum and minimum positions where the accumulated rainfall is above m. The 'mn' is the leftmost position where the accumulated rainfall is above m, and 'mx' is the rightmost. \n\nWait, the code's 'mn' is being set to the minimum between (i.first - (he - m)) and the current mn. \n\nWait, let's think of the accumulated rainfall as a function f(x). The condition f(x) > m must hold for some x. The code is trying to find the minimal and maximal x where this is true. \n\nSuppose that at position x = i.first, the accumulated rainfall is he. If he > m, then the region where f(x) > m could extend to the left and right. \n\nThe slope of the function at this point is xie. The slope is the derivative of f(x). \n\nWait, the slope xie is the current slope. So, the function f(x) is linear between the previous point (last) and current point (i.first). \n\nWait, the slope xie is the current slope. So between last and i.first, the function increases (or decreases) with slope xie. \n\nSuppose that at position last, the height was he_prev. Then, between last and i.first, the function's value is he_prev + xie*(x - last). \n\nWait, the code's 'he' is being updated as he += (i.first - last)*xie. So 'he' is the value at i.first. \n\nSo, the function between last and i.first is a line with slope xie. \n\nNow, to find where f(x) > m in this interval, we can compute the points where the line crosses m. \n\nSuppose the line starts at (last, he_prev) and ends at (i.first, he). \n\nIf the line is above m at any point in this interval, then there's a flood. \n\nThe code is trying to track the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum value of the function. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. The maximum would be the maximum of all the 'he' values. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. The 'mx' variable is supposed to track the maximum. \n\nIn that case, the condition would be if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. \n\nWait, but the code's current lines for mn and mx are:\n\nmn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n\nmx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose at position x, the accumulated rainfall is he. If he > m, then the region where the rainfall is above m would extend to the left and right. \n\nThe slope at this point is xie. \n\nWait, the slope is the rate of change of the function. \n\nSuppose the function at x is he. The slope is xie. \n\nThe maximum value in this interval would be at the endpoints. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value in the entire function is the maximum of all the 'he' values. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nIn that case, the condition would be if (he > m), then the maximum is at least he, so we can set mx to the maximum between mx and he. \n\nBut in the code, the lines are using i.first plus or minus something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nSuppose that at position x, the function's value is he. \n\nIf he > m, then the region where the function is above m could extend to the left and right. \n\nThe leftmost point where the function exceeds m would be x - (he - m)/slope, but only if the slope is positive. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe idea is that if the function's value at x is he, then the region where it's above m would start at x - (he - m)/slope (if slope is positive) or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal and maximal x where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are:\n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\nWait, that formula might be derived from the equation he - m = slope * distance. \n\nWait, suppose the slope is xie. \n\nThe function at position x is he. \n\nThe slope is xie, so the function's value at x - delta is he - xie * delta. \n\nWe want to find the point where the function is exactly m. \n\nSo, he - xie * delta = m \u2192 delta = (he - m)/xie. \n\nBut this is only valid if xie is not zero. \n\nHmm, but the code is using (he - m) as the delta. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is making a mistake here, but I need to figure out what the correct condition is. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value would be the maximum of all the 'he' values. \n\nSo, the condition should be if (he > m), then we need to set mx to the maximum between mx and he. \n\nBut in the code, the lines are:\n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\n    mx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\n}\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nSuppose that the function at position x has a value of he. \n\nThe maximum possible distance to the left where the function is still above m would be (he - m) / slope. \n\nBut the slope here is the current slope xie. \n\nWait, the slope between last and current x is xie. \n\nWait, the slope is the rate of change. \n\nSuppose the slope is positive. Then, moving to the right increases the function's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe leftmost point would be the earliest x where the function is above m. \n\nThe rightmost point would be the latest x where it's above m. \n\nBut how does that help in determining whether removing a day's rain would prevent the flood? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nSo, the condition is if (he > m), then the maximum is at least he, so we can set mx to the maximum between mx and he. \n\nIn that case, the code's missing condition is (he > m). \n\nSo the 'if' condition should be if (he > m). \n\nThen, the code would set mx to the maximum between mx and he. \n\nBut in the code's current lines, the code is doing something else. \n\nWait, the code's current lines for mn and mx are:\n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nSuppose that the function at position x has a value of he. \n\nThe maximum distance to the left where the function is still above m would be (he - m) / slope. \n\nBut the slope here is the slope of the function at that point. \n\nWait, the slope between last and current x is xie. \n\nWait, the slope is xie, so the function's value at position x is he. \n\nThe function's value at position x - delta would be he - xie * delta. \n\nWe want to find delta such that he - xie * delta = m \u2192 delta = (he - m)/xie. \n\nSo the leftmost point would be x - delta = x - (he - m)/xie. \n\nSimilarly, the rightmost point would be x + (he - m)/xie. \n\nBut the code is using (he - m) instead of divided by xie. \n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is making a mistake here, but I need to see what the code is trying to do. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum possible x where the function exceeds m. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nSo, the code's 'mx' variable should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. \n\nIn that case, the code's lines for mn and mx are incorrect, and the condition is (he > m). \n\nWait, but the code's current code for mn and mx is using i.first plus or minus (he - m). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's approach is that whenever the current he (the value at i.first) is greater than m, then the region where the function is above m extends to the left and right. \n\nThe leftmost point would be i.first - (he - m), and the rightmost would be i.first + (he - m). \n\nWait, that would be the case if the slope is 1. \n\nSuppose the slope is 1. Then, the function increases by 1 per unit x. \n\nSo, if at position x, the value is he, then to the left, the value decreases by 1 per unit. \n\nSo, the point where the function is m would be at x - (he - m). \n\nSimilarly, to the right, if the slope is 1, then the function would decrease (if slope is negative?), but perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nHmm, but the slope can vary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is incorrect and the correct approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nSo, the code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. \n\nIn that case, the condition is (he > m), and the code should set mx = max(mx, he). \n\nBut then, the code's current lines for mn and mx are wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum and minimum positions where the function exceeds m. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after removing a day's rain, there is no flood. So, the maximum accumulated rainfall after removing that day must be <= m. \n\nThe code's approach is probably to first compute the maximum accumulated rainfall without any removal. If that's already <= m, then all days can be removed (since removing any day won't make it worse). \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, we need to see if removing it would reduce the maximum to <= m. \n\nThe code's current approach is trying to compute the maximum and see if it's over m. \n\nBut how does the code handle the removal of a day? \n\nThe code's current code after processing all days is:\n\nfor each day i, if (q[i].a - q[i].b <= mn && q[i].a + q[i].b >= mx) then output 1 else 0. \n\nWait, that's the condition. \n\nThe idea here is that the day's rain contributes to the maximum. So, if the day's rain's interval (from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i) includes the mn and mx (the regions where the maximum occurs), then removing this day might help. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to see if the day's rain's interval covers the regions where the maximum occurs. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that the maximum occurs between mn and mx. So, if the day's rain's interval (x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i) includes this region, then removing that day's rain could potentially reduce the maximum below m. \n\nWait, but the code's condition is checking if the day's interval includes mn and mx. \n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (q[i].a - q[i].b <= mn && q[i].a + q[i].b >= mx) \u2192 output 1. \n\nSo, if the day's interval covers the mn and mx (the leftmost and rightmost points where the maximum occurs?), then removing this day's rain would eliminate the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find whether the day's rain is the one contributing to the maximum. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe problem is that the code's current approach is unclear. \n\nLet me think of the problem again. \n\nThe key is that for each day i, when we remove it, we need to check whether the maximum accumulated rainfall (without that day's contribution) is <= m. \n\nThe straightforward way is to compute for each day i, the maximum of (a_j - contribution_i), where contribution_i is the contribution of day i to position j. \n\nBut this is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 2e5. \n\nHence, we need a smarter approach. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be using line sweep to compute the maximum. \n\nThe initial code's approach is to model the accumulated rainfall as a piecewise linear function. \n\nEach day's rain contributes a V-shaped function. The total function is the sum of all these V's. \n\nThe maximum of this function is the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. \n\nThe code is trying to compute this maximum. \n\nThe code's 'mx' variable is supposed to be the maximum value. \n\nThe code's loop over the map 't' is processing the events (points where the slope changes). \n\nThe 'he' variable is the current height at the current x. \n\nThe 'xie' is the current slope. \n\nThe 'ans' map is storing the height at each x. \n\nThe 'mx' variable is being updated in the loop. \n\nThe missing condition is when to update 'mx' and 'mn'. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are:\n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\nBut perhaps the correct condition is when he > m, then we need to track the regions where the function exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe leftmost point would be the earliest x where the function is above m, and the rightmost is the latest. \n\nIf the entire interval between last and current x has a height exceeding m, then the leftmost is last and the rightmost is current x. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's 'mn' is the leftmost x where the function exceeds m, and 'mx' is the rightmost. \n\nThe condition is whether the current he (the value at i.first) is greater than m. \n\nSo, the code's 'if' condition should be (he > m). \n\nThen, the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe leftmost point would be the earliest x in the current interval where the function is above m. \n\nThe rightmost point would be the latest x in the current interval where it's above m. \n\nThe code's current approach for mn and mx is using i.first - (he - m) and i.first + (he - m). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nSuppose the slope is 1. \n\nThen, the function increases by 1 per unit x. \n\nAt position x, the value is he. \n\nThe point where the function reaches m would be at x - (he - m). \n\nSimilarly, to the right, if the slope is 1, then the function would decrease (if slope is negative?), but perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is making a mistake here, and the correct approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nHence, the condition is if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. \n\nIn that case, the code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. \n\nBut the code's final check is using mn and mx. \n\nWait, the code's final loop for each day i is:\n\nif (q[i].a - q[i].b <= mn && q[i].a + q[i].b >= mx) \u2192 output 1. \n\nThis suggests that the day's interval must cover the mn and mx points. \n\nSo, the idea is that the day's rain contributes to the regions where the maximum occurs. \n\nIf the day's interval covers the mn and mx (the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m), then removing this day's rain would eliminate those regions, thus preventing the flood. \n\nHence, the code's approach is to find the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe condition for the 'if' statement in the loop over the map is whether the current he (the value at i.first) exceeds m. \n\nIn that case, the code's missing condition is (he > m). \n\nThen, the code computes the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe leftmost point would be the earliest x where the function is above m. \n\nThe rightmost is the latest x. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are trying to compute these points. \n\nBut how exactly? \n\nSuppose the current position is x = i.first, and the current height is he. \n\nThe slope between last and x is xie. \n\nThe function between last and x is a line with slope xie. \n\nThe value at last was he_prev = he - xie*(x - last). \n\nWait, the code's 'he' is the current value at x. \n\nThe previous value at last was he_prev = he - xie*(x - last). \n\nWait, no. Because he is updated as he += (x - last)*xie. \n\nSo, the previous he was he_prev = he - (x - last)*xie. \n\nWait, the code's 'he' is the accumulated height at x. \n\nThe line between last and x has slope xie. \n\nSo, the function's value at any point between last and x is he_prev + xie*(pos - last). \n\nWait, the previous 'he' before adding the current interval was he_prev = he - (x - last)*xie. \n\nSo, the function's value at last is he_prev, and at x is he. \n\nNow, to find where the function exceeds m in this interval. \n\nThe function's value at position pos between last and x is:\n\nf(pos) = he_prev + xie*(pos - last). \n\nWe want to find the range of pos where f(pos) > m. \n\nThe condition is he_prev + xie*(pos - last) > m \u2192 pos > (m - he_prev + xie*last)/xie. \n\nWait, solving for pos:\n\npos > (m - he_prev)/xie + last \n\nBut this depends on the sign of xie. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's current approach for mn and mx is:\n\nif (he > m) \u2192 then the current x is part of the region where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code then computes the leftmost point as i.first - (he - m). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nIf the slope is 1, then the function increases by 1 per unit x. \n\nAt position x, the value is he. \n\nThe point where the function reaches m would be at x - (he - m). \n\nHence, the leftmost point would be x - (he - m). \n\nSimilarly, the rightmost point would be x + (he - m) if the slope is -1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nBut in reality, the slope can be any integer. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum value of the function. \n\nThe maximum value is the maximum of all 'he's. \n\nHence, the condition is if (he > m), then we need to update the maximum. \n\nIn that case, the code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. \n\nBut then, the final condition for each day would be different. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct approach to solve the problem. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, whether removing it would make the maximum accumulated rainfall <= m. \n\nThe straightforward approach is to compute the maximum without each day's contribution. \n\nBut doing this naively is O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHence, we need a smarter way. \n\nThe key idea is to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall, and for each day i, determine whether that day's contribution is part of the maximum. \n\nIf the maximum is not caused by day i's contribution, then removing it won't affect the maximum. \n\nIf the maximum is caused by day i's contribution, then removing it might reduce the maximum. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nThe maximum is the maximum of all the peaks of the individual V-shaped functions plus the contributions from other days. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum can be found by considering all the peaks of the V's. \n\nThe peak of each day's V is at x_i, with value p_i. \n\nThe total accumulated rainfall at x_i is the sum of all p_j minus the distance from x_j to x_i. \n\nWait, no. The contribution of each day j to position x_i is max(0, p_j - |x_j - x_i|). \n\nThe total at x_i is sum_{j} max(0, p_j - |x_j - x_i|). \n\nThe maximum of this over all x is the maximum accumulated rainfall. \n\nTo compute this maximum efficiently, we can model the function as a piecewise linear function and find its maximum. \n\nThe code's approach is trying to do this with a line sweep. \n\nThe line sweep approach involves tracking the slope and current height as we move along the x-axis. \n\nThe events are the points where the slope changes. \n\nEach day's rain contributes two events: at x_i - p_i (start of the V), and x_i + p_i (end of the V). \n\nThe slope changes by +1 at x_i - p_i, then -2 at x_i (the peak), then +1 again at x_i + p_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the slope changes are as follows: \n\nThe V-shaped function for day i contributes a slope of +1 from x_i - p_i to x_i, then slope -1 from x_i to x_i + p_i. \n\nHence, the slope changes are: \n\nAt x_i - p_i: slope increases by +1 \n\nAt x_i + p_i: slope decreases by -1 \n\nWait, but the total slope is the sum of all these contributions. \n\nHence, the code's initial setup for the map 't' is: \n\nFor each day i: \n\n- At x_i - p_i: add +1 to the slope (since the slope increases by +1 here) \n\n- At x_i + p_i: subtract 1 (since the slope decreases by 1 here) \n\nWait, but the code's current code for the map 't' is: \n\nt[q[i].a - q[i].b]++; \n\nt[q[i].a] -= 2; \n\nt[q[i].a + q[i].b]++; \n\nAh, this makes sense. \n\nThe V-shaped function for day i has a slope of +1 from x_i - p_i to x_i, then slope -1 from x_i to x_i + p_i. \n\nHence, the slope changes are: \n\nAt x_i - p_i: slope increases by +1 \n\nAt x_i: slope decreases by -2 (because the slope changes from +1 to -1, so net change is -2) \n\nAt x_i + p_i: slope increases by +1 (because the slope ends, so the slope returns to previous value) \n\nHence, the code's initial setup is correct. \n\nThe map 't' contains all the points where the slope changes. \n\nThe code then processes these points in order. \n\nThe 'xie' variable is the current slope. \n\nThe 'he' is the current height at the current position. \n\nThe 'he' is computed by adding the slope multiplied by the distance between the previous position and current. \n\nThe code's loop is processing each interval between last and current x. \n\nThe 'he' is the height at current x. \n\nThe code needs to track the maximum value of 'he' during this process. \n\nHence, the missing condition is whether 'he' exceeds m. \n\nThe code's 'mx' should be the maximum between its current value and 'he'. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should be: \n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mx = max(mx, he);\n\n}\n\nBut then, how does the final condition work? \n\nThe final condition for each day i is whether removing it would reduce the maximum to <= m. \n\nThe maximum without day i is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its peak. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum could be achieved at some position j. \n\nIf the contribution of day i to position j is part of the maximum, then removing day i would reduce the maximum. \n\nBut this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum is the original maximum. \n\nIf the original maximum is <= m, then all days can be removed. \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, we need to see if the maximum without day i is <= m. \n\nThe maximum without day i is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at the position where the maximum occurs. \n\nBut this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum is the maximum of all the peaks of the individual V's plus the contributions from other days. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is to compute the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. \n\nThe code's 'mx' variable is supposed to be this maximum. \n\nHence, the condition in the loop is if (he > m), then update mx to be the maximum between mx and he. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are incorrect. \n\nThe correct code for the missing part is: \n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mx = max(mx, he);\n\n}\n\nBut then, the final condition for each day i is whether the maximum without day i is <= m. \n\nThe maximum without day i is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at the position where the maximum occurs. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, the code's final condition is checking whether the day's interval covers the position where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe maximum occurs at some position x where the accumulated rainfall is mx. \n\nIf the day's rain's V includes this x, then removing the day's rain would reduce the contribution at x by p_i - |x_i - x|. \n\nHence, the new maximum would be mx - (p_i - |x_i - x|). \n\nIf this new value is <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut how to find this x? \n\nThe code's current approach is to track the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nBut perhaps the code's final condition is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the code's final condition is checking whether the day's rain's interval covers the entire region where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe code's final condition is: \n\nif (q[i].a - q[i].b <= mn && q[i].a + q[i].b >= mx) \u2192 output 1. \n\nThis suggests that the day's interval must include the mn and mx points. \n\nBut mn and mx are the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nIf the day's interval covers these points, then removing the day's rain would eliminate those regions, thus possibly reducing the maximum below m. \n\nHence, the code's approach is to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's missing condition is whether the current he exceeds m. \n\nIn that case, the code should compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's current lines for mn and mx are trying to compute these points. \n\nThe formula used is: \n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\nThis assumes that the slope is 1. \n\nFor example, if the slope is 1, then the function increases by 1 per unit x. \n\nAt position x, the value is he. \n\nThe point where the function reaches m is at x - (he - m). \n\nHence, the leftmost point would be x - (he - m). \n\nSimilarly, the rightmost point would be x + (he - m) if the slope is -1. \n\nBut this is only valid if the slope is 1. \n\nHowever, the slope can vary. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nBut given the problem constraints, perhaps the code is using an approximation or there's a different way to compute mn and mx. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m by assuming that the slope is 1. \n\nThis might be an error, but perhaps the problem's test cases allow this approach. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is correct, and I'm missing something. \n\nThe code's final condition is that the day's interval must cover the mn and mx points. \n\nThe mn and mx are the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nIf the day's interval covers these points, then removing the day's rain would eliminate those regions, thus possibly reducing the maximum below m. \n\nHence, the code's approach is to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe code's missing condition is whether the current he exceeds m. \n\nHence, the missing code is: \n\nif (he > m) \n\nThen, the code's lines for mn and mx are trying to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe formula used is: \n\nmn = min( i.first - (he - m), mn );\n\nmx = max( i.first + (he - m), mx );\n\nThis assumes that the slope is 1. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct for the problem's constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the current position and the current height to compute the leftmost and rightmost points where the function exceeds m. \n\nThe leftmost point is the current position minus (he - m), and the rightmost is current position plus (he - m). \n\nThis would be correct if the slope is 1. \n\nBut the slope can be different. \n\nHowever, perhaps the code is correct because the maximum is achieved at the peak of some V-shaped function. \n\nThe maximum value of the accumulated rainfall is the maximum of all the peaks of the individual V's plus the contributions from other days. \n\nThe peak of each V is at x_i, with contribution p_i. \n\nThe total at x_i is the sum of all p_j minus the distance from x_j to x_i. \n\nWait, no. The contribution of each day j to x_i is max(0, p_j - |x_j - x_i|). \n\nThe total at x_i is the sum of all p_j where x_j is within p_j units of x_i, plus the contributions from other days. \n\nThis is complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct for the problem's constraints, and the missing condition is simply (he > m). \n\nHence, the missing code is: \n\nif (he > m) \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n\n    mx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\n}\n\nHence, the missing code is the condition 'he > m' in the if statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (he > m) {\n\n    mn = min(i.first - (he - m), mn);\n\n    mx = max(i.first + (he - m), mx);\n\n}\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n    mn=min(i.first-(he-m),mn);\n\n    mx=max(i.first+(he-m),mx);\n\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the condition inside the if statement. \n\nThe condition should be (he > m). \n\nHence, the missing code is:\n\nhe > m\n\nSo the complete line is:\n\nif(he > m) {\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nHence, the answer is to replace the comment with 'he > m'."
