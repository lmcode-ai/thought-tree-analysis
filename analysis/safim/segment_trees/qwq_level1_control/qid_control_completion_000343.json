The square's side length is the maximum possible. The code provided has a structure where for each test case, depending on some condition, it outputs either (n+1)/2 or n/2. Hmm, so the code is trying to decide between those two values based on some condition. My job is to find what that condition is.\n\nWait, the output is the maximum square side. Let me think about the examples given. For n=5, the answer is 3. Let's see: (5+1)/2 is 3, which matches. So in that case, the condition would be true, leading to that output. Another example: if n=1, the answer is 1. (1+1)/2 is 1, so again the first case. What about n=2? The blocks are 1 and 1. The maximum square would be 1x1, so (2)/2 is 1, same as (2+1)/2 is 1.5 floored? Wait, no, the code outputs (n+1)/2 as an integer. Wait, the code uses int((n+1)/2) which for n=2 would be (3)/2 = 1.5, but cast to int, so 1. So same as n/2. Wait, but in the first case, when the condition is true, it uses (n+1)/2, else n/2. So maybe the condition is whether the total area is sufficient for a square of side s, where s is the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible s is either floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2), but depends on some other condition. Wait, maybe the formula for the maximum s is the floor of the square root of the total area? No, that might not be straightforward. Let me think differently.\n\nThe square's side length s must satisfy that the total area of the blocks used is at least s^2. Since each block contributes its length (since height is 1). The total area from all blocks up to n is the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. We need to find the largest s such that s^2 \u2264 sum_{i=1}^n ceil(i/2).\n\nWait, but the problem allows not using all blocks. So maybe the maximum s is the largest integer where s^2 \u2264 the maximum possible sum achievable by selecting some subset of the blocks. But since the blocks can be arranged in any way (as long as they form a square of s x s), perhaps the optimal is to use as many blocks as possible to reach the maximum possible sum, so the maximum s is the largest s where s^2 \u2264 total sum. Because using all blocks would give the maximum possible area. So the problem reduces to compute the total sum S of all ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then find the largest s where s^2 \u2264 S. Then the answer is floor(sqrt(S)).\n\nWait, but the code given is using either (n+1)/2 or n/2. So perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me compute the sum S for some n.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor n=1: ceil(1/2) =1 \u2192 sum is 1. s^2 must be \u22641 \u2192 s=1. Which is (1+1)/2=1.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2 \u2192 s=1. (2/2=1).\n\nn=3: sum is 1+1+2=4 \u2192 s=2. (3+1)/2=2. So that's correct.\n\nn=4: sum is 1+1+2+2=6 \u2192 s=2 (since 2\u00b2=4 \u22646, 3\u00b2=9>6). But (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 cast to int gives 2. So that's okay. So the code would output 2 here, which is correct.\n\nn=5: sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9 \u2192 s=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3 = 12 \u2192 s=3 (3\u00b2=9 \u226412, 4\u00b2=16>12). (6+1)/2 is 3.5 \u2192 3. So code would output 3. Correct.\n\nn=7: sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3+4 \u2192 sum is 16 \u2192 s=4. (7+1)/2 is 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, so for n=4, the code would output (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2, which is correct. So the code's condition must be such that when the sum is exactly a square, then it uses the higher value. Wait, but how does the code's logic work here?\n\nWait the code's current structure is: if (some condition) then output (n+1)/2 else n/2. Let's see for n=4, the correct answer is 2. (n+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 cast to int is 2. So the code would output that regardless of the condition. Wait, but in the code, the first case is int((n+1)/2). Wait, in C++, when you cast a float to int, it truncates. Wait, but (n+1)/2 for n=4 is (5)/2 = 2.5 \u2192 but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be 2.5? Wait no, in C++, (n+1)/2 when n is an integer. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the code, n is a ll (long long). So (n+1)/2 is computed as integer division. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 =5/2=2.5 \u2192 but in integer division, it would be 2. So the code's first case would output 2, same as the second case. So the condition must be such that when the sum allows s = (n+1)/2, then choose that, else n/2. Wait, but how does that relate to the sum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum s is floor( (n)/2 ) when n is even, and ceil(n/2) when n is odd? Wait, but for n=4, that would be 2, which is correct. For n=5, 3. For n=6, 3 (since 6/2 is 3). Wait, but for n=6, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3 = 12 \u2192 sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. So that's correct. Hmm, but how does that relate to the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to n is equal to floor(n*(n+2)/4). Let me check that formula.\n\nLet me compute for n=1: 1*(3)/4 = 0.75 \u2192 floor is 0.75 \u2192 no, but the sum is 1. Hmm, maybe another formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the sequence of ceil(i/2). For i from 1 to n:\n\nceil(i/2) is equal to (i+1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. So the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4, etc.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as the sum for k from 1 to m of 2k terms, except possibly the last term if n is odd.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me think of the terms as pairs. For each k, the terms for i=2k-1 and i=2k are both k. So each pair contributes 2k. The number of such pairs up to n is floor(n/2). The remaining term (if n is odd) is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nsum_{k=1 to n/2} 2k \u2192 which is 2*( (n/2)(n/2 +1)/2 ) = (n/2)(n/2 +1)\n\nIf n is odd:\n\nsum_{k=1 to (n-1)/2} 2k + ( (n+1)/2 )\n\nThe first part is 2*( ( (n-1)/2 )*( (n-1)/2 +1 ) /2 ) \u2192 ( (n-1)/2 )*( (n+1)/2 )\n\nThen adding the last term (n+1)/2 gives total:\n\n[ (n-1)(n+1)/4 ] + (n+1)/2 = (n\u00b2-1)/4 + (2n+2)/4 \u2192 (n\u00b2 -1 + 2n +2)/4 \u2192 (n\u00b2 +2n +1)/4 \u2192 (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nWait, so for n odd:\n\nS(n) = (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nFor even n:\n\nLet me compute for even n=2m:\n\nsum is m*(m+1). Because (n/2 is m, so m*(m+1).\n\nWait let me check with n=4 (even):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2 =6. m=2 \u2192 2*3=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6 even: 1+1+2+2+3+3 =12 \u2192 m=3 \u2192 3*4=12 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor n=5 (odd):\n\nsum is 1+1+2+2+3 =9 \u2192 (5+1)^2 /4 \u2192 36/4=9 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3 (odd): (3+1)^2/4 =16/4=4 \u2192 correct (sum is 1+1+2=4).\n\nn=1 (odd): (2)^2/4=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nS(n) = (n^2 + 2n +1)/4 when n is odd \u2192 (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nWhen even: S(n) = (n/2)*(n/2 +1) \u2192 m*(m+1) where m =n/2.\n\nAlternatively, for even n=2m:\n\nS(n) = m(m+1) = (2m^2 + 2m)/2 \u2192 but perhaps better to write as m(m+1).\n\nNow, the maximum s is the largest integer such that s^2 \u2264 S(n).\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns_max = floor( sqrt( m(m+1) ) ), where m =n/2.\n\nFor odd n:\n\ns_max = floor( sqrt( (n+1)^2 /4 ) ) \u2192 since (n+1)^2 /4 is a perfect square when n is odd. Because (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 squared. So sqrt( (n+1)^2/4 ) is exactly (n+1)/2. So for odd n, s_max is exactly (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. For odd n, the sum S(n) is exactly ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is exactly (n+1)/2. Because s squared equals the sum. So in that case, the square can be exactly formed.\n\nFor even n, the sum is m*(m+1), where m =n/2. So m*(m+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. The square of m is m\u00b2, and (m+1)^2 is m\u00b2+2m+1. So m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. The square root of m(m+1) is between m and m+1. So the floor would be m. Because m(m+1) < (m+1)^2 \u2192 sqrt is less than m+1, so floor is m. Wait, let's see:\n\nTake m=2 (n=4): m*(m+1)=6 \u2192 sqrt(6) ~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2, which is m.\n\nm=3 (n=6): 3*4=12 \u2192 sqrt(12) ~3.464 \u2192 floor 3 = m.\n\nYes, so for even n, the maximum s is m =n/2.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nThe maximum s is:\n\nif n is odd \u2192 (n+1)/2,\n\nif even \u2192 n/2.\n\nWait, but wait! Let me check for even n=2:\n\nsum is 1+1=2 \u2192 s_max is 1 (since 1^2=1 \u22642, 2^2=4>2). Which is 2/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is exactly (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. So the code's current structure is trying to choose between (n+1)/2 and n/2. But how does the condition work here?\n\nWait the code's current code is:\n\nif ( /* condition */ ) then output (n+1)/2 else n/2.\n\nBut according to the analysis, when n is odd, we should choose (n+1)/2, else n/2. So the condition should be whether n is odd. So the code's condition should be (n % 2 ==1). Then, the code would output (n+1)/2 when n is odd, else n/2. Which would be correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the code:\n\nThe code uses:\n\ncout << int( (n+1)/2 ) << \"\\n\";\n\nWait, but (n+1)/2 for even n would be a float, but since n is an integer, (n+1)/2 when n is even would be a half-integer. But in C++, when you do integer division with /, (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (even +1)/2 \u2192 for example, n=4 \u2192 5/2 is 2.5, but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be 2.5? Wait no, in C++, when you have integer division, 5/2 is 2. So (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (even +1)/2 \u2192 which is a float, but in the code, the variable n is a ll, so (n+1) is an integer, divided by 2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is a fractional number, but when cast to int, it truncates. Wait, but in the code, the first output is written as int( (n+1)/2 ). Wait, but (n+1)/2 is a double? Or is it integer division?\n\nWait, the code is written as:\n\ncout << int( (n+1)/2 ) << \"\\n\";\n\nWait, but n is a long long. So (n+1) is a long long, divided by 2. So if n is even, (n+1) is odd, so (n+1)/2 is a float. But in C++, when you do (n+1)/2 with integer division, it would be integer division. Wait, no, the code is written as (n+1)/2, but since n is a ll, adding 1 and dividing by 2 would be integer division. Wait, no, in C++, if both operands are integers, the division is integer. So (n+1)/2 is integer division. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 =5/2=2 (integer division truncates). So the code's first case would output 2, which is correct. So the code's first case is exactly (n+1)/2 when n is odd, but when n is even, (n+1)/2 is (even+1)/2 \u2192 which is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 which truncates to k. So for even n, the first case would output n/2 (since (n even \u2192 n=2k \u2192 (2k+1)/2 is k.05 \u2192 but integer division gives k). Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait for even n=2:\n\n(n+1)/2 \u2192 3/2 =1 (integer division). Which is same as n/2 (2/2=1). So in that case, the code would output 1 in either case. So the condition is redundant here. Wait, but the code's first case is (n+1)/2, which for even n would give n/2 rounded down. Wait, but for even n, the correct answer is n/2. So the code's first case would give the same as the else case. So the condition must be whether n is odd. Because when n is odd, the first case gives (n+1)/2, which is correct, and when even, the else case gives n/2, which is correct. So the condition should be (n is odd). So the code's if condition should be (n % 2 == 1). \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the if statement is (n % 2 == 1). \n\nWait, let me check with n=5 (odd). The condition is true, so output (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct. For n=4 (even), the else case gives 4/2=2 \u2192 correct. For n=6 even, 6/2=3 \u2192 correct. For n=7 (odd), (7+1)/2=4 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes, that seems to work. So the code's if condition should be (n % 2 == 1). \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"n % 2 == 1\"."
