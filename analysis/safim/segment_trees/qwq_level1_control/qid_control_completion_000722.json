Original code's structure:\n\nif c <=1399: Div4\nelif # TODO:\n    print Div3\nelif 1600 <= c <=1899: Div2\nelse: Div1\n\nSo the TODO needs to be the condition for Division3.

So that's the missing part. Let me make sure the order is correct. Because after checking Div4 (<=1399), the next check is for Div3 (1400-1599).
