Let me think about the minimal total energy. Wait, perhaps the minimal total energy is the minimum between two possible scenarios. Let me think of the optimal path. The optimal strategy would involve using portals to minimize the total steps. Let me think of the minimal paths for both. Let me consider the standard approach without portals first.

Let me think of the example given in the note. In the first test case, the example's answer is 15. Let me see how that comes from the code's formulas. Suppose n=7 and m=5 (since Megan moves to (7,3) which is in a 7x5 grid?), but the example's explanation might not give exact n and m. Wait the note says Megan moves to (7,3), so maybe n is 7 and m is 5? Let me see the example's total: 15. Let's see which formula would give that. If n=7 and m=5, then (m + 2n -2) would be 5 + 14 -2 = 17. The other formula (n + 2m -2) is 7 + 10-2=15. So that's the correct one here.

So the condition should be (m >n). So the code's if condition is (m >n), then output (m + 2n -2), else output (n + 2m -2). Wait, but let me think of another case where n and m are equal. For example, n=2, m=2. Then the minimal total would be? The formula would choose the else part (since m is not greater than n). So n + 2m -2 = 2 +4-2=4. Let's see what the actual minimal is. Stanley's path from (1,1) to (2,2): normally 2 steps (right then down, or down then right). Megan's path from (2,1) to (1,2): also 2 steps. So total 4, which matches the formula. So that's correct. Another test case: n=1, m=1. Then output is 0, which is correct. Another case: n=1, m=5. Then since n=1 < m=5, the else condition is taken. The formula would be 1 + 2*5 -2 = 1+10-2=9. Let's see:\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,5). Since n=1, he just moves right 4 times: 4 steps. Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, lower-left is (1,1)), and needs to go to (1,5). So same path. But wait Megan's path is from (n,1) which is (1,1) to (1, m) which is (1,5). So both are moving along the same row. But since Megan leaves portals in every cell she visits, so when she moves, she leaves portals. So perhaps they can use portals to teleport. Wait, but in this case, since they are moving along the same row, maybe they can just walk, but the total would be 4 (Stanley) +4 (Megan) =8, but the formula gives 9. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, in the case n=1 and m=5, the code's else formula gives 1 + 2*5 -2 = 1+10-2=9. But the actual minimal total would be 8? Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the formula is correct. Let me think again. Wait, in this scenario, Stanley and Megan both need to go from (1,1) to (1,5). Wait no, Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1), and her destination is (1, m) which is (1,5). So both are going from (1,1) to (1,5). So their paths are the same. So the total energy would be 4 (each moving 4 steps) for a total of 8. But the formula gives 9. So that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement. Wait, Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1, m). So when n=1, Megan's start is (1,1), and destination is (1, m). So same as Stanley's path. So they can move together. But how does the formula work here? Wait the formula for n=1 and m=5 would be (n + 2m -2) = 1 + 10 -2 =9. But the actual minimal is 8. So that suggests that the formula is wrong. Which means my previous reasoning is incorrect. Hmm, so perhaps I need to re-examine the problem. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the minimal path isn't just the sum of their individual paths. Because they can use portals. Let me think of the scenario where n=1 and m=5. Stanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,5).",

Alternatively, the minimal total is the minimum between (m + 2*(n-1)) and (n + 2*(m-1)), but I'm not sure. Wait, looking back at the code's current structure, the two options are (m + 2n -2) and (n + 2m -2). Let me see what those formulas represent. Let me compute for the case n=1, m=5:\n\nFirst formula (m + 2n -2) =5 + 2*1 -2 =5+2-2=5. Second formula (n + 2m -2)=1 + 10-2=9. So the first formula would give 5, which is better than the 8 I thought earlier. So perhaps my previous analysis was wrong. Wait, how can the total be 5? Hmm, perhaps in that case, Megan can set up portals in such a way that they can teleport. Let me think of the scenario where n=1 and m=5. Stanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,5).

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - (something) ), but I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is derived by considering that one of them can teleport once, thereby saving steps. Let me think of the general case. Suppose we have to choose between two options:\n\nOption 1: The total is m + 2n -2. Option 2: The total is n + 2m -2. We need to choose whichever is smaller between the two.",

So the condition is whether m>n.\n\nIn the case where m>n, the first formula is better, else the second. Let me see for n=5 and m=3 (m <n):\n\nThe second formula gives 5+6-2=9, which is better than the first formula (3+10-2=11). So correct. Another case: n=3, m=4 (m>n):\n\nFirst formula:4 +6-2=8, second gives 3+8-2=9. So first is better. So the condition is correct. Another case: n=2, m=2. Both formulas give 2+4-2=4 and 2+4-2=4. So it doesn't matter which is chosen. The code would choose the else (since m is not greater than n), but the result is same. So the condition is correct. Therefore, the missing code is (m > n). So the code's if condition should be (m > n). Thus, the answer is to replace the TODO with (m > n).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the correct condition for the if statement in the given C++ code. The problem is about finding the minimal total energy for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations using portals. Let me think through the problem again.\n\nThe key points from the problem statement are:\n\n- The store is an n x m grid.\n- Both can move to adjacent cells with 1 power each step.\n- Portals are left in every cell Megan visits. So whenever either of them is on a cell with a portal, they can teleport to any other portal for 1 power.\n- The goal is to find the minimal total energy for both to reach their destinations.\n\nThe code provided has a structure where it checks some condition and then outputs either (m + 2n -2) or (n + 2m -2). The else part chooses the other formula. The base case when n*m is 1 (i.e., 1x1 grid) outputs 0, which makes sense because they are already at the destination.\n\nHmm, so the problem is to determine which of the two expressions is smaller, depending on some condition. Wait, maybe the condition is which of the two expressions is better? Let me think about the minimal total energy.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total energy is the minimum between two possible scenarios. Let me think of the optimal path.\n\nThe optimal strategy would involve using portals to minimize the total steps. Let me think of the minimal paths for both.\n\nLet me consider the standard approach without portals first. The minimal steps for Stanley from (1,1) to (n,m) is (n-1)+(m-1) steps. Similarly for Megan from (n,1) to (1,m), same distance. But with portals, they can teleport, so maybe they can share portals to reduce the total.\n\nWait, Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So whenever Megan moves through a cell, that cell gets a portal. So the portals are available as Megan moves. So the order of their movements might matter, but the problem says they can choose the time they move, so they can coordinate their paths to use the portals optimally.\n\nThe problem requires the minimal total energy for both. So perhaps the minimal total is the sum of their individual minimal paths, but using portals to reduce the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is the sum of their paths minus some overlapping steps where they can use portals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by considering that the best way is to have one of them use the portals created by the other. Let me think of the example given in the note.\n\nIn the first test case, the example's answer is 15. Let me see how that comes from the code's formulas. Suppose n=7 and m=5 (since Megan moves to (7,3) which is in a 7x5 grid?), but the example's explanation might not give exact n and m. Wait the note says Megan moves to (7,3), so maybe n is 7 and m is 5? Let me see the example's total: 15. Let's see which formula would give that.\n\nIf n=7 and m=5, then (m + 2n -2) would be 5 + 14 -2 = 17. The other formula (n + 2m -2) is 7 + 10-2=15. So that's the correct one here. So in that case, the code would choose the else branch, which gives 15. So the condition must have been false in that case.\n\nSo the condition in the if statement must decide between the two options. The code's structure is: if (condition) then output (m + 2n -2), else (n + 2m -2). So the condition must be whether m + 2n -2 is smaller than the other, or vice versa?\n\nWait, but the example shows that when n is larger than m, perhaps the else is better. Let me see:\n\nIn the example, n=7, m=5. So m is smaller than n. The correct formula was the else part (n + 2m -2). So when m is smaller than n, the else is better. Wait, but maybe the condition is whether m is greater than n? Let me see.\n\nSuppose the condition is (m <= n). Then in the example, since m=5 <7, the condition would be false, so the else is taken, which is correct. Let me test another scenario.\n\nSuppose n=3 and m=4. Then m is larger than n. Then the if condition (if m <=n would be false, so else is taken. The else formula would be 3 + 2*4 -2 = 3+8-2=9. The other formula would be 4 + 6-2=8. Wait, but in this case, if m is larger than n, then the first formula (m + 2n -2) would be better. So in that case, the code would choose the if branch when m>n, and else when m<=n.\n\nWait, so the condition should be if (m > n) then choose the first formula, else the second. Because when m is greater than n, the first formula (m + 2n -2) would be better, and when m is less than or equal to n, the second is better.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nCase 1: n=7, m=5 (m <n). The correct formula is n + 2m -2 =7+10-2=15, which is correct. So when m <n, the else is taken (so the condition is false).\n\nCase 2: n=3, m=4 (m>n). Then the first formula (m + 2n -2) is 4 +6-2=8. The other formula would be 3+8-2=9. So the first is better, so the condition should be true here, leading to the first formula.\n\nSo the condition should be if (m >n) then first formula, else second. So the code's if condition should be (m >n). Let me see.\n\nIn the code's current structure, the if statement is:\n\nif( /* condition */ ) then first formula, else second.\n\nSo the condition should be (m >n). So the code's if condition is (m >n), then output (m + 2n -2), else output (n + 2m -2).\n\nWait, but let me think of another case where n and m are equal. For example, n=2, m=2. Then the minimal total would be?\n\nThe formula would choose the else part (since m is not greater than n). So n + 2m -2 = 2 +4-2=4. Let's see what the actual minimal is.\n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (2,2): normally 2 steps (right then down, or down then right). Megan's path from (2,1) to (1,2): also 2 steps. So total 4, which matches the formula. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Then output is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. Then since n=1 < m=5, the else condition is taken. The formula would be 1 + 2*5 -2 = 1+10-2=9. Let's see:\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,5). Since n=1, he just moves right 4 times: 4 steps. Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, lower-left is (1,1)), and needs to go to (1,5). So same path. But wait Megan's path is from (n,1) which is (1,1) to (1, m) which is (1,5). So both are moving along the same row. But since Megan leaves portals in every cell she visits, so when she moves, she leaves portals. So perhaps they can use portals to teleport.\n\nWait, but in this case, since they are moving along the same row, maybe they can just walk, but the total would be 4 (Stanley) +4 (Megan) =8, but the formula gives 9. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the case n=1 and m=5, the code's else formula gives 1 + 2*5 -2 = 1+10-2=9. But the actual minimal total would be 8? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in this scenario, Stanley and Megan both need to go from (1,1) to (1,5). Wait no, Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1), and her destination is (1, m) which is (1,5). So both are going from (1,1) to (1,5). So their paths are the same. So the total energy would be 4 (each moving 4 steps) for a total of 8. But the formula gives 9. So that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1, m). So when n=1, Megan's start is (1,1), and destination is (1, m). So same as Stanley's path. So they can move together. But how does the formula work here?\n\nWait the formula for n=1 and m=5 would be (n + 2m -2) = 1 + 10 -2 =9. But the actual minimal is 8. So that suggests that the formula is wrong. Which means my previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal path isn't just the sum of their individual paths. Because they can use portals. Let me think of the scenario where n=1 and m=5.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,5). Megan starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,5). So they can both just walk, taking 4 steps each, total 8. But according to the formula, it's 9. So discrepancy here. So perhaps the formula is not correct, which suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to think differently. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe key is that Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So whenever Megan moves through a cell, that cell has a portal. So the portals are available as Megan moves. So the optimal path would involve them using the portals to minimize their total steps.\n\nThe minimal total energy is the sum of their individual minimal paths, but using the portals optimally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the Manhattan distance of both paths plus some adjustment for the portals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the maximum of the two Manhattan distances plus something. Or maybe the minimal total is the sum of their Manhattan distances minus some overlapping steps where they can use portals.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be found by considering that once Megan has placed portals along her path, Stanley can use those to teleport, and vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total is (Manhattan distance of Stanley) + (Manhattan distance of Megan) minus the minimal steps saved by using portals.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the sum of their individual minimal paths minus the minimal possible overlap where they can use portals. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the minimal between two options: either Stanley uses Megan's portals, or Megan uses Stanley's portals, but since Megan leaves portals in all her path, perhaps the best is to have one of them take a path that allows the other to teleport.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is the minimum between ( (S's distance) + (M's distance) ) and ( (S's distance + M's distance) - (some value) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) ) minus the minimal possible steps saved by using portals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m -2) - (something)), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as the minimal total being the sum of their individual minimal paths minus the minimal steps saved by using the portals optimally.\n\nThe portals can be used to teleport between any two portal cells. So the best scenario is when they can teleport to minimize their paths.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she creates a portal in a cell that allows both to teleport to reduce their path.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be found by considering that the best way is to have one of them reach a certain point early so that the other can teleport.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the minimum between (m + 2*(n-1)) and (n + 2*(m-1)), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the code's current structure, the two options are (m + 2n -2) and (n + 2m -2). Let me see what those formulas represent.\n\nLet me compute for the case n=1, m=5:\n\nFirst formula (m + 2n -2) =5 + 2*1 -2 =5+2-2=5.\n\nSecond formula (n + 2m -2)=1 + 10-2=9.\n\nSo the first formula would give 5, which is better than the 8 I thought earlier. So perhaps my previous analysis was wrong.\n\nWait, how can the total be 5?\n\nHmm, perhaps in that case, Megan can set up portals in such a way that they can teleport.\n\nLet me think of the scenario where n=1 and m=5.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,5). Megan starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,5).\n\nWait, Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). So she can just move right 4 steps. Each step she takes leaves a portal. So after moving, the cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) all have portals.\n\nSo once Megan has placed all portals along her path, then both can use the portals.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is the same as Stanley's. So when Megan moves to (1,2), that cell gets a portal. So when Stanley is at (1,1), he can teleport to (1,2) for 1 unit, then to (1,3) for another, etc. So Stanley's path could be teleporting all the way.\n\nWait, but Megan has to move to each cell first. So Megan's path is moving step by step, so the portals are available as she moves. So the earliest Stanley can use a portal in (1,2) is after Megan has visited it.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal path is:\n\nMegan moves to (1,5) first, leaving portals along the way. Then Stanley can teleport all the way.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). So she can move right 4 steps, taking 4 steps. Each step adds a portal. So after her first step, (1,2) has a portal. So when Megan is at (1,2), Stanley can teleport there from (1,1) using 1 unit. But Megan's movement is sequential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is when Megan moves in such a way that the portals are placed early enough for Stanley to use them.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal total for n=1 and m=5:\n\nMegan's path is 4 steps (right 4 times). So she uses 4 energy. Stanley can use the portals as they are created.\n\nSuppose Megan moves first. She moves to (1,2) (step 1, energy 1). Then Stanley can teleport to (1,2) using 1 energy. Then Megan moves to (1,3) (step 2, energy 2). Stanley can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1). And so on. But this way, each step Megan takes allows Stanley to teleport, but the total energy would be Megan's 4 steps plus Stanley's 4 teleports (each 1), totaling 8. But the first formula gives 5, which is less. So perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe Megan can move in a way that allows both to teleport more efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps Megan can move to (1,5) in 4 steps (cost 4). Then Stanley can teleport directly from (1,1) to (1,5) once all portals are there. But when can he do that?\n\nThe portals are placed as Megan moves. So when Megan reaches (1,5), all the cells along the path have portals. So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,5) in 1 step. So Stanley's path would be 1 unit (teleport). So total energy would be Megan's 4 steps + Stanley's 1 teleport = 5, which matches the first formula (m + 2n -2 =5 + 2*1 -2 =5). So that's correct.\n\nAh, right! So in this case, the minimal total is indeed 5. So my initial thought that it was 8 was wrong because I didn't consider that Stanley can teleport once Megan has placed all the portals.\n\nSo the formula (m + 2n -2) gives 5 here, which is correct. So the condition must choose that formula when m >n. Because in this case, m=5>1=n, so the condition (m>n) would be true, so the first formula is chosen, which gives the correct 5.\n\nSo the condition in the code should be if (m >n) then choose the first formula, else the second.\n\nSo the code's if condition should be (m >n). So the code's TODO is to check if m is greater than n.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is (m > n). So the if statement becomes:\n\nif (m > n) then print (m + 2n -2), else print (n + 2m -2).\n\nSo the code's TODO line should be replaced with (m > n).\n\nTesting another case where n=5 and m=3 (so m <n). The else formula would be n + 2m -2 =5 +6-2=9. Let's see:\n\nMegan's path is from (5,1) to (1,3). The minimal steps for Megan without portals would be 4 (up 4 steps and right 2 steps?), but with portals, perhaps they can do better.\n\nAlternatively, the formula gives 9. Let's see:\n\nMegan's path: she can move up to (1,1), then right to (1,3). That's 4 steps up and 2 right? Wait, no, from (5,1) to (1,3):\n\nThe Manhattan distance is (5-1) + (3-1) =4+2=6 steps. But with portals, perhaps they can do better.\n\nSuppose Megan moves up to (1,1) (4 steps). Then right to (1,3) (2 steps). Total 6 steps. Then Stanley's path from (1,1) to (5,3). The Manhattan distance is 4+2=6. But with portals, he can teleport.\n\nWait, Megan's path leaves portals along her path. So when she reaches (1,1), that cell has a portal. Then when she moves to (1,2), that also has a portal, etc.\n\nSo Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) once Megan has been there. So Stanley's path could be:\n\nMove to (1,1) (already there), then teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then move down to (5,3). The distance down is 4 steps. So total for Stanley: 1 +4 =5. Megan's path is 6 steps. Total 6+5=11, but the formula gives 9. Hmm, discrepancy again.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, Megan could take a different path to set up portals that allow both to save steps.\n\nSuppose Megan goes to (1,1) first (4 steps). Then she goes to (5,3) via some path, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is indeed 9. Let me see the formula's result.\n\nThe formula for n=5, m=3 (since m <n, else is taken: 5 + 2*3 -2 =5+6-2=9.\n\nHow can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nMegan's path: she can go to (1,1) (4 steps up). Then she can go to (1,3) (2 steps right). Total 6 steps.\n\nStanley's path: he starts at (1,1). He can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then move down to (5,3) (4 steps). Total 5 steps. So total 6+5=11. Not 9.\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Megan can choose a path that allows both to use portals more efficiently.\n\nSuppose Megan takes a path that goes through some central point where both can teleport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal path is when they meet at a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering that the minimal total is (n + m -1) + (n + m -1) - (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from the minimal path when they use the portals optimally, such that one of them can teleport to the other's path.\n\nWait, let me think of the formula (n + 2m -2) when m is smaller than n.\n\nIn the case n=5, m=3, the formula gives 5+6-2=9. Let me see how that could be possible.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she creates a portal at (1,3) early on, allowing Stanley to teleport there quickly.\n\nWait, Megan starts at (5,1). Suppose she moves up to (1,1) (4 steps). Then she moves right to (1,3) (2 steps). Total 6 steps.\n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (cost 1). Then he needs to go to (5,3). That's 4 steps down. So total for Stanley is 1+4=5. Total 6+5=11. Not 9.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Megan can take a different path. Let's say Megan goes to (5,3) first, but that's her destination? No, Megan's destination is (1,3). Wait, Megan's destination is (1, m) which is (1,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe Megan can move in a way that allows both to use portals more effectively.\n\nSuppose Megan moves right first. Starting at (5,1), she moves right to (5,2) (step 1), then to (5,3) (step 2), then up to (1,3) (4 steps). Total steps: 2+4=6. So same as before.\n\nStanley can teleport to (5,2) once Megan is there. Wait, but Megan's path includes (5,2) and (5,3). So when Megan is at (5,2), that cell has a portal. So Stanley can go from (1,1) to (5,2) via teleport (cost 1), then move down to (5,3) (1 step), then up to (1,3) (4 steps). Wait, but that's more steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal path is when they use the portals in a way that reduces their paths more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from the minimal between (m + 2n -2) and (n + 2m -2), whichever is smaller. So the condition is to choose whichever is smaller between the two.\n\nWait, let's see for n=5 and m=3:\n\nm + 2n -2 =3 +10-2=11.\n\nn + 2m -2=5+6-2=9. So the second is better, so the code chooses the else, which is correct.\n\nIn the case where n=5 and m=3, the formula gives 9, but my manual calculation gave 11. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better path where they can share portals more effectively.\n\nSuppose Megan takes a path that allows Stanley to teleport to an intermediate point, then both can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal total as the sum of their individual minimal paths minus the minimal steps saved by using portals.\n\nThe minimal steps without any portals would be (n+m-2) for each, so total 2*(n+m-2). But with portals, they can save some steps.\n\nThe formula (n + 2m -2) is (n + 2m -2) = (n + m -2) + m. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from the following reasoning:\n\nThe minimal total is the minimum between ( (m-1) + (n-1) + (n + m -2) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - (something) ), but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is derived by considering that one of them can teleport once, thereby saving steps.\n\nLet me think of the general case.\n\nSuppose we have to choose between two options:\n\nOption 1: The total is m + 2n -2.\n\nOption 2: The total is n + 2m -2.\n\nWe need to choose whichever is smaller between the two.\n\nWait, the code's structure is that it chooses the first formula when m>n, else the second. So the condition is whether m>n.\n\nIn the case where m>n, the first formula is better, else the second.\n\nLet me see for n=5 and m=3 (m <n):\n\nThe second formula gives 5+6-2=9, which is better than the first formula (3+10-2=11). So correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=4 (m>n):\n\nFirst formula:4 +6-2=8, second gives 3+8-2=9. So first is better. So the condition is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Both formulas give 2+4-2=4 and 2+4-2=4. So it doesn't matter which is chosen. The code would choose the else (since m is not greater than n), but the result is same.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is (m > n).\n\nSo the code's if condition should be (m > n).\n\nThus, the answer is to replace the TODO with (m > n)."
