The code provided has a method Solve that takes an integer n (the rating). The existing conditions are for Division 1 and Division 2. The Division 3 condition is where the TODO is, and the else covers Division 4. Let me look at the divisions again:\n\nDivision 1: rating >= 1900\nDivision 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\nDivision 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\nDivision 4: rating <= 1399 So the current code for Division 2's else if checks if n is <=1899 and >=1600. That's correct. Now, the Division 3 condition should check if the rating is between 1400 and 1599 inclusive. So the else if for Division 3's TODO should be (n >=1400 && n <=1599).
