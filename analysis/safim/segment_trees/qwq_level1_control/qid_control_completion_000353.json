So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the lengths of all n blocks, then finding the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. Then the answer is floor of the square root of the sum. But how do I compute the sum efficiently? First, let's compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Let's see:\n\nThe length for the i-th block is ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2). Let me think: For even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i, it's (i+1)/2. So the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc. So for each pair of numbers, like 1 and 2, their sum is 1+1=2. Then 3 and 4 sum to 2+2=4, etc. Let's see:\n\nThe sum for the first m pairs (each pair is two numbers) would be:\n\nEach pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes (k) + (k) = 2k. Wait, wait, let's see :\n\nWait for i=1: ceil(1/2)=1, i=2: 1, so sum is 2 for the first two terms. Then i=3: 2, i=4:2, sum is 4. i=5:3, i=6:3, sum 6. So each pair (terms 2k-1 and 2k) contributes k*2. So for m pairs (total of 2m terms), the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k. Wait, no, wait for m pairs, each pair's sum is 2k where k is the pair number. Wait first pair (1 and 2) is k=1, sum 2*1. Second pair (3,4) is k=2, sum 2*2. So the total for m pairs is 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). Then, if n is even, then there are n/2 pairs, so the total sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1).",

Wait let me see :\n\nWait for n even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2 =2.5 \u2192 in integer division, 2.5 becomes 2. So m would be 2, which is n/2. So that's correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem correctly. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n rectangular blocks. Each block i has a length of ceil(i/2) and height 1. The square must be formed without rotating the blocks, so the blocks are placed such that their 1-unit height contributes to the square's height. Wait, no, actually, the square's side is both length and height. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the square's side length is s. So the area of the square is s^2. The total area of the blocks used must be at least s^2. Because each block's area is 1 (height) multiplied by its length (ceil(i/2)), so each block contributes ceil(i/2) to the total area. The sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be >= s^2. But since we can choose any subset of the blocks, we need to maximize s such that the sum of the lengths of some subset of the blocks is at least s^2. But since we want the maximum s possible, perhaps the optimal is to take all blocks and see what's the maximum s where the total area is >= s\u00b2. Because using all blocks would give the maximum possible area, so the maximum s is the largest integer where the sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if using all blocks gives a total area S, then the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 S. So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the lengths of all n blocks, then finding the largest s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. Then the answer is floor of the square root of the sum. But how do I compute the sum efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Let's see:\n\nThe length for the i-th block is ceil(i/2). Let's find a formula for the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2).\n\nLet me think: For even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i, it's (i+1)/2. So the sequence is 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc. So for each pair of numbers, like 1 and 2, their sum is 1+1=2. Then 3 and 4 sum to 2+2=4, etc. Let's see:\n\nThe sum for the first m pairs (each pair is two numbers) would be:\n\nEach pair (2k-1, 2k) contributes (k) + (k) = 2k. Wait, wait, let's see:\n\nWait for i=1: ceil(1/2)=1, i=2: 1, so sum is 2 for the first two terms. Then i=3: 2, i=4:2, sum is 4. i=5:3, i=6:3, sum 6. So each pair (terms 2k-1 and 2k) contributes k*2. So for m pairs (total of 2m terms), the sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k. Wait, no, wait for m pairs, each pair's sum is 2k where k is the pair number. Wait first pair (1 and 2) is k=1, sum 2*1. Second pair (3,4) is k=2, sum 2*2. So the total for m pairs is 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). \n\nThen, if n is even, then there are n/2 pairs, so the total sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). \n\nIf n is odd, then there are (n-1)/2 pairs, plus the last term (the nth term, which is the first element of the next pair). The last term is ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2. So the total sum would be [( (n-1)/2 ) * ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) ] + ( (n+1)/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nLet m = (n-1)/2. Then the sum is m*(m+1) + (m+1) = m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Since m = (n-1)/2, m+1 = (n+1)/2. So the total sum is [(n+1)/2]^2. \n\nWait, let me check with n=5. For n=5, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3 = 9. According to the formula for odd n: (5+1)/2 squared is 3\u00b2=9. Correct. For even n=4: (4/2)*(4/2 +1) = 2*3=6. The actual sum is 1+1+2+2 =6. Correct. For n=3: (3+1)/2 squared is (2)^2=4? Wait n=3, the sum is 1+1+2 =4. Yes. So the formula works.\n\nSo the total sum S(n) is:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 +1)\n\nif n is odd: [(n+1)/2]^2\n\nAlternatively, since for even n, n/2 is an integer, and for odd n, (n+1)/2 is an integer. So we can write S(n) as floor((n+1)/2)^2 ?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nWait for even n=4: (4+1)/2 is 2.5, floor is 2. 2 squared is 4, but the actual sum is 6. Hmm, that's not right. So that approach is wrong. So better to split into cases.\n\nAlternatively, note that for any n, ceil(n/2) is equal to (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. So the formula can be written as S(n) = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 ==1 ? 0 : 1 )) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to find a general formula. Let me see:\n\nWait for even n: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) \n\nFor odd n: S(n) = [(n+1)/2]^2 \n\nWait, let me see for n=5 (odd): (5+1)/2 =3, squared is 9. Correct. For n=6 even: 6/2=3, 3*4=12. Let's compute the sum for n=6: 1+1+2+2+3+3 = 12. Correct. \n\nSo the formula can be written as:\n\nS(n) = ( (n div 2) + (n mod 2) ) * ( (n div 2) + 1 )\n\nWait let me see:\n\nWait n div 2 is floor(n/2). For even n, n mod 2 is 0, so (n/2 +0) * (n/2 +1) \u2192 same as before. For odd n, n mod 2 is 1, so ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) * ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) \u2192 ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Exactly. So yes, that formula works. So S(n) = ( (n//2) + (n%2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 )\n\nAlternatively, since (n//2) is floor(n/2), adding n%2 (which is 1 for odd, 0 for even) gives ceil(n/2). Wait, no, for even n, ceil(n/2) is n/2. So (n//2) + (n%2) would be (n/2) +0 for even, which is correct. For odd n, (n//2) is (n-1)/2, plus 1 gives (n+1)/2. So yes, so S(n) = ceil(n/2) * (ceil(n/2) + (n mod 2 ==0 ? 1 : 0) )? Not sure, but the formula S(n) = ( (n//2) + (n%2) ) * ( (n//2) +1 ) is correct.\n\nWait let me re-express S(n) as:\n\nLet m = ceil(n/2). Then for even n, m = n/2, and the sum is m*(m+1). For odd n, m = (n+1)/2, and the sum is m^2. Wait, so the sum can be written as m*(m + (n even ? 1 : 0) ). Hmm, but perhaps it's better to see that for even n, the sum is m*(m+1), and for odd n, it's m\u00b2. So m is ceil(n/2). So S(n) = m*(m + (n even ? 1 : 0) )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to write S(n) as m*(m + (n mod 2 ==0)) ?\n\nWait for even n, m = n/2, so m*(m +1) \u2192 yes. For odd n, m = (n+1)/2, so m*(m +0) \u2192 m\u00b2. So yes, that works. So S(n) = m*(m + (n even ? 1 : 0) )\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to compute m = ceil(n/2), then:\n\nif n is even, then S(n) = m*(m+1)\n\nif n is odd, S(n) = m\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since m = ceil(n/2), then:\n\nS(n) = m * (m + (n % 2 ==0 ? 1 : 0) )\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nWait for even n:\n\nm = n/2 \u2192 S = m*(m+1)\n\nfor odd n:\n\nm = (n+1)/2 \u2192 S = m*m\n\nSo in code, perhaps:\n\nint m = (n +1)/2; // because for even n, (n+1)/2 is (even +1)/2, which is not integer. Wait no, for even n, n is even, so n=2k \u2192 (2k+1)/2 is k + 0.5 \u2192 but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k.0.5 \u2192 but in Java, integer division would be (n+1)/2 \u2192 (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k when using integer division. Wait, no, let me think in code terms.\n\nWait in Java, if n is even, say n=4, then (n+1)/2 is 5/2 =2.5 \u2192 but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be 2. So m would be (n+1)/2 \u2192 but for even n, that gives m = (n/2) + 0.5 floored? Hmm, perhaps better to compute m as (n+1)/2 when using integer division. Wait let me see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2 =2.5 \u2192 in integer division, 2.5 becomes 2. So m would be 2, which is n/2. So that's correct.\n\nWait for n=5 (odd):\n\n(5+1)/2 =3 \u2192 which is (5+1)/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo m = (n +1)/2 when using integer division? Wait no, in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is even would be (even +1)/2 \u2192 for n=4, (5)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 but in integer division, it's 2. So m is indeed ceil(n/2). Because ceil(4/2)=2, which is correct. For n=5, ceil(5/2)=3, which is correct. So m = (n +1)/2 when using integer division (since in Java, dividing integers truncates towards zero). Wait, (n+1)/2 in integer division gives exactly ceil(n/2). Let me confirm:\n\nYes, because for even n: n=2k \u2192 (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k.5 \u2192 integer division gives k. So ceil(2k/2)=k, which matches.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1 \u2192 (2k+2)/2 =k+1 \u2192 ceil((2k+1)/2)=k+1. So yes, m = (n+1)/2 in integer division gives the correct m = ceil(n/2).\n\nSo m = (n +1)/2 when using integer division. Wait, but in code, (n+1)/2 is integer division. So m = (n+1)/2 in Java.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nn=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2 \u2192 5/2=2.5 \u2192 in Java, 5/2 is 2. So m=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5 \u21926/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo m is (n+1)/2 in integer division. So m = (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but then for even n, m is (n/2) + 0.5 floored? Wait no, but the formula for S(n) is:\n\nif n is even, S(n) = m*(m-1 +1) \u2192 m*(m) ?\n\nWait no, wait when n is even, m is (n+1)/2. Wait for n even, m is (n/2) + 0.5? Wait no, for even n=4, m is (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 but in integer division, it's 2. So m is n/2. So for even n, m is exactly n/2. Wait, but (n+1)/2 when n is even is (even +1)/2 \u2192 which is (even)/2 + 0.5 \u2192 but in integer division, it truncates. So for even n, m is (n)/2. So m is indeed ceil(n/2).\n\nWait, perhaps m is exactly ceil(n/2). So m = (n +1)/2 when using integer division. So m is correct.\n\nSo now, the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even \u2192 S = m * (m +1) ?\n\nWait no, for even n, m is n/2. So m*(m+1) \u2192 yes. For example, n=4, m=2 \u2192 2*3=6, which is correct.\n\nFor odd n, m is (n+1)/2 \u2192 so m squared. For n=5, m=3 \u2192 3\u00b2=9, correct.\n\nSo the formula for S(n) is:\n\nS(n) = m * (m + (n % 2 ==0 ? 1 : 0) )\n\nAlternatively, S(n) = m * (m + (n even ? 1 : 0) )\n\nSo in code, m is (n+1)/2 (integer division). Then:\n\nif (n % 2 ==0) then S = m * (m+1)\n\nelse S = m * m.\n\nAlternatively, S = m * (m + (n%2 ==0 ? 1 :0) )\n\nSo in code, perhaps:\n\nlong m = (n +1)/2;\n\nlong sum = m * (m + (n%2 ==0 ? 1 :0));\n\nWait let's test:\n\nn=4 even:\n\nm = (4+1)/2 =2 (since 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2 in integer division). Wait wait, wait, no, in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is 4 is (5)/2 \u2192 2.5 \u2192 but integer division gives 2. So m is 2. Then, since even, sum is 2*(2+1) =6. Correct.\n\nn=5 odd:\n\nm = (5+1)/2 =3 \u2192 sum is 3*3=9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1. Then m is (2)/2=1. Since n is odd (1%2 !=0), sum is 1*1=1. Which is correct (only block 1, length 1).\n\nAnother test case n=2 even:\n\nm = (3)/2 \u21921.5 \u21921. So sum is 1*(2) \u2192 2. Which is 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is computed as above.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n). The maximum s is the integer part of the square root of S(n). So s = floor( sqrt(S) )\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Compute m = (n+1)/2 (integer division).\n\n3. Compute S(n) as m*(m + (n even ? 1 :0) )\n\n4. Compute the maximum s where s^2 <= S. So s is the integer part of sqrt(S).\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating S(n) and then taking the floor of its square root.\n\nNow, the code in the problem's template has some code that's incomplete. Let's look at the code given:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class A_The_Ultimate_Square {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args){\r\n        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        int t=sc.nextInt();\r\n        while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\r\n            int n = sc.nextInt();\r\n            long s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 + 1;\r\n            // some commented code\r\n            System.out.println(s);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWait, the while loop's condition is missing. The original code probably had while(t-- >0), but the user put a TODO there. So first, the loop should be while(t-->0) or similar.\n\nThen, the code inside the loop:\n\nThe variable s is computed as n%2==0 ? n/2 : n/2 +1. Wait, that's exactly m. Because m is (n+1)/2. Let me see:\n\nFor even n: n/2 is (n/2). (n+1)/2 would be (even +1)/2 \u2192 but in integer division, (n+1)/2 is (n/2) + 0.5 floored \u2192 n/2. So yes, m is n/2 when even. So the code's s is m. But then, the code is outputting s, which is m. But that's not correct. Because the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S) ), not m. So the code is wrong here.\n\nThe original code's s variable is m, but the code is printing s, which is m, but that's not the correct answer. For example, in the sample input where n=5, the sum is 9, so sqrt(9)=3, so the answer is 3. Which matches m (3). But in another case, say n=6 (even):\n\nsum is m*(m+1) where m=3 (since (6+1)/2 is 3.5 \u2192 3 in integer division). So m=3, sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. So the answer is 3. But m is 3, so the code would output 3, which is correct here. Wait, but let's see another example.\n\nSuppose n=7 (odd). Then m = (7+1)/2 \u2192 4 (since 8/2 is 4). So sum is m squared \u2192 16. sqrt(16)=4 \u2192 correct. So code would output m=4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6 even. The code would output m=3, which is correct. What about n=8 even?\n\nm = (8+1)/2 \u2192 4.5 \u2192 4. So sum is 4*5=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor is 4. So code outputs 4, which is correct.\n\nHmm, so in these cases, the code's current output (printing m) gives the correct answer. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, let's see for n=3 (odd):\n\nsum is m^2 = 2^2? Wait no, n=3 is odd. m is (3+1)/2 = 2. So sum is 2^2 =4. sqrt(4)=2 \u2192 correct. The code would output m=2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's think of a case where the maximum s is less than m. Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=2. Then m is (2+1)/2 \u21921.5 \u21921. The sum is 1*(1+1)=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 floor is 1. So code outputs 1, correct.\n\nAnother case: n=7, sum is 16 \u2192 s=4, which is m. So that's okay.\n\nWait, what about n=9 (odd):\n\nm = (9+1)/2 =5 \u2192 sum is 5^2=25 \u2192 s=5. Correct.\n\nHmm, so in all these cases, the maximum s is exactly m. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, let's see for n=6, sum is 12. m is 3. 3^2 is 9 \u226412, and 4^2 is 16>12. So s is 3, which is m. So yes.\n\nWait, but what if the sum is m*(m+1) (for even n), then the maximum s is floor( sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Since m*(m+1) is between m\u00b2 and (m+1)^2. So sqrt(m*(m+1)) is between m and m+1, so floor is m. So for even n, the maximum s is m. For odd n, the sum is m\u00b2, so sqrt is exactly m, so s is m. So in all cases, the maximum s is m. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, for even n, sum is m*(m+1). Let me see m*(m+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. The square of m is m\u00b2, and (m+1)^2 is m\u00b2 + 2m +1. The product m(m+1) is m\u00b2 +m. So m\u00b2 +m is less than (m+1)^2 (since m\u00b2 +m < m\u00b2 + 2m +1 when m>0). So the square root of m(m+1) is between m and m+1, so floor is m. So yes, the maximum s is m.\n\nFor odd n, the sum is m\u00b2, so sqrt is exactly m, so s is m. So in all cases, the maximum s is m. So the code is correct?\n\nWait, but the sample input given in the problem says when n=5 (the example), the answer is 3, which is m. So the code would output that. So the code is correct?\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's template has a commented part which was perhaps an initial approach, but the current code is just outputting m. So why is that?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input includes a case where n=5, which gives m=3, and the answer is 3. So that's correct. Another test case: let's think of n=7, sum is 25 \u2192 s=5, which is m. So the code works.\n\nWait, but what about n=1? The sum is 1, so s=1. m is (1+1)/2 =1 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, so the code is correct? Then why was the problem given? Because the code in the problem's template is correct? But the user says that the code has missing lines to be filled in. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code has:\n\nlong s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 + 1;\n\nThen, it prints s. So that's exactly m. So according to our analysis, this is correct. But why is the code in the problem's template like that? Because perhaps the user's initial code was wrong, but the correct code is indeed to output m. But the problem's sample input's second case (n=5) gives 3, which is correct. So why is the code correct?\n\nWait, but let me think of another case. Let's take n=6. The sum is 3*4=12. The maximum s is 3, which is m. Correct. What about n=8?\n\nm is (8+1)/2 \u21924.5 \u21924. So m=4. The sum is 4*5=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=10 even. m= (10+1)/2 \u21925.5 \u21925. So sum is 5*6=30. sqrt(30) is ~5.47 \u2192 floor 5. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the code is correct. Then why is the problem presented here? Because perhaps the user's code was wrong, but the correct code is indeed to output m. But the problem's code has some commented lines which perhaps were part of an incorrect approach.\n\nWait, the problem's code has:\n\nlong s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 + 1;\n\nThen, the code prints s. So that's correct. So the code is already correct? But the problem says \"Complete the code in java to solve this programming problem\".\n\nWait, perhaps the loop condition is missing. The while loop's condition is \"while(/* TODO: Your code here */)\".\n\nSo the first thing to fix is the loop condition. The loop should run t times. So the loop should be while(t-- >0). So that's the first missing part.\n\nThe rest of the code is correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, the code computes s as m, which is correct. So the code is correct except for the loop condition.\n\nWait, but let me check the code again. The code's first line after reading t is:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\nSo the loop is not set up. So the user needs to replace the TODO with t-- >0, or similar.\n\nSo the missing code is in the while loop's condition. The rest of the code is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem's code has a commented part:\n\n// long ar = n*(n+1) + s;\n\n// for(int i=(int)s; i>0; i--){\n//     if(i*i<=ar){\n//         System.out.println(i);\n//         break;\n//     }\n// }\n\nWhich is perhaps an incorrect approach. But the current code after that is:\n\nSystem.out.println(s);\n\nSo the code is correct except for the loop condition.\n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the loop condition. The user needs to replace the TODO with t-- >0.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\". The missing code is the loop condition. So the correct code for the while loop is while(t-->0). So the user should replace the comment with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in the while loop's condition as t-->0.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"output only the missing code\". So the user's code has a while loop with the condition missing. The correct code for the condition is t-- >0. So the missing code is \"t-- > 0\".\n\nAlternatively, \"t-- >0\" or \"t-- > 0\" (with space). But in Java, the syntax is while(t-->0) or while(t-- >0). Wait, the operator precedence: the -- has higher precedence than >, so t-- is evaluated first, then compared to 0. So the correct condition is while(t-->0) \u2192 which is equivalent to (t-- >0). Wait, no, the syntax for while loops requires an expression. The correct way to loop t times is to have while(t-->0). Because:\n\nInitially, t is the number of test cases. The loop runs as long as the expression evaluates to true. The expression t-- >0: first, the value of t is checked. If it is >0, then the condition is true, and then t is decremented. So the first iteration: t is 5 (for example), so 5>0 \u2192 true, then t becomes 4. Next iteration, t is 4, etc. So the loop runs exactly t times.\n\nAlternatively, while(t>0) and then t-- inside the loop. But the standard way is to write while(t-->0).\n\nSo the missing code is \"t-->0\".\n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the while loop's condition is \"t-->0\".\n\nHence, the missing code is \"t-->0\".\n\nSo the user's code has the while loop's condition missing, and that's the only part to fill. The rest of the code is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The code as written, after fixing the loop condition, would work?\n\nYes. Because the code computes m as (n%2==0 ? n/2 : n/2 +1 ), which is exactly m = (n+1)/2 (since for even n, n/2 is (n+1)/2 - 0.5 floored, but in integer division, (n+1)/2 for even n is n/2. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2 in integer division, which is n/2. For odd n=5: (5+1)/2 is 3 \u2192 which is (5/2) +1 \u2192 2+1=3. So yes, the code's s variable is m. And since the maximum s is m, the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the loop condition. So the answer is to replace the TODO with \"t-->0\"."
