The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices any number of times. Hmm, looking at the code provided. The code starts by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the array. There are variables even1, even2, odd1, odd2 initialized. Then in the loop over the array elements, for each element, if the index is even (i%2 ==0), it checks if the element is odd or even and sets odd1 or even1 accordingly.

The idea is that for all elements to have the same parity, the parities of the even and odd indices must be compatible. Each operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices (even 0-based)) flips the parity of those elements. Similarly, type 2 flips the even indices (odd 0-based). Suppose we perform x operations of type 1 and y of type 2. The parity of an element at even index (0-based) is original_parity + x (mod 2). The parity of an element at odd index (0-based) is original_parity + y (mod 2). We want all elements to have the same parity. Let's see:\n\nFor all elements to be even:\n\nEach even index element must be even: (a_i + x) mod 2 == 0. Each odd index element must be even: (a_j + y) mod 2 ==0. Similarly for all odd. Alternatively, the parity of all elements must be the same. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we want all elements to have parity P (0 for even, 1 for odd).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this C++ code for the problem. The problem is about determining if we can make all elements of an array have the same parity (all even or all odd) using two types of operations. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices any number of times.\n\nHmm, looking at the code provided. The code starts by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the array. There are variables even1, even2, odd1, odd2 initialized. Then in the loop over the array elements, for each element, if the index is even (i%2 ==0), it checks if the element is odd or even and sets odd1 or even1 accordingly. For the else part (odd indices), there's a TODO where I need to fill in the condition.\n\nWait, the variables even1 and odd1 probably track the parity of elements at even indices (since i starts at 0, so even indices are 0,2,4 etc). Similarly, even2 and odd2 would be for the odd indices (1,3,5...). \n\nThe current code for the even indices (i even) checks if the element is odd or even, and sets odd1 or even1. But the way it's written, if there's at least one odd and one even in the even indices, then odd1 and even1 would both be 1. Similarly for the odd indices. \n\nThe logic after that is: if even1 and odd1 are both set (meaning the even indices have both even and odd elements), then output NO. Similarly if even2 and odd2 are both set (the odd indices have mixed parity), then also NO. Else YES. \n\nWait, but why? Let me think. The idea is that for the entire array to have all same parity, the operations must adjust the parities such that all elements become even or all odd. \n\nEach operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices) flips the parity of those elements. Similarly, type 2 flips even indices. \n\nSo, the key is to see if we can choose the number of times to perform each operation such that after those operations, all elements have the same parity. \n\nAlternatively, the parity of each element can be adjusted by the number of times their respective operations are applied. For example, an element at an even index (like position 0) is affected by type 2 operations (since even indices are 0,2,4... wait, wait, the problem says even indices are 2,4,6? Wait the problem's first operation is adding 1 to elements with odd indices. Wait the problem's description says:\n\nFirst operation: add 1 to every element with an odd index. So indices 1,3,5 etc (since in the problem's notation, a_1 is first element, which would be index 0 in 0-based arrays). Wait, the problem uses 1-based indices. So in code, when the code uses i starting from 0, the even indices (0-based) correspond to the 1-based's odd indices? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait the problem's first operation is adding 1 to elements with odd indices (like a_1, a_3, etc in 1-based). So in 0-based terms, those are the even indices (0,2,4...). Wait no, 1-based index 1 is 0-based index 0. So the first operation affects the 0-based indices 0,2,4 etc (since those are the 1-based odd indices). The second operation adds 1 to even indices (1-based 2,4,6 etc), which are 0-based indices 1,3,5 etc. \n\nSo in the code, for even indices (0-based i even), they are part of the first operation (since they are 1-based odd indices). The code's current setup for even indices (i even) is tracking whether the elements at even indices (0-based) have mixed parity. \n\nThe code's variables even1 and odd1 track the parity of the even indices (0-based). For example, if any even index element is odd, then odd1 is 1. If any is even, even1 is 1. So if both are set, that means the even indices have both even and odd elements. \n\nSimilarly, for the odd indices (0-based i is odd), which are the even indices in 1-based (so affected by the second operation). The code's else clause (for i odd) is where the TODO is. The code there should check if the element is odd or even and set odd2 or even2. \n\nSo the missing condition is checking if t (the current element) is odd. So the code should be:\n\nif(t % 2 == 1) then set odd2 =1 else even2=1. \n\nWait, the code for the else part (i is odd, so part of the even indices in 1-based, so affected by the second operation) would be:\n\nif (t is odd) then odd2 =1 else even2=0? Wait, but the code's variables even2 and odd2 are initialized to 0. So for each element in the odd indices (i is odd in 0-based), we check if it's odd or even. If it's odd, set odd2 to 1, else even2 to 1. \n\nSo the condition is (t % 2 ==1). So the code should be:\n\nif(t % 2 ==1) odd2 =1; else even2=1;\n\nSo the missing part is \"t % 2 == 1\".\n\nSo the code in the else block (for i odd) would be:\n\nif (t % 2 == 1) { odd2 = 1; } else { even2 = 1; }\n\nSo the TODO line is \"t % 2 == 1\".\n\nNow, the rest of the code's logic: after collecting even1, odd1 (for even indices) and even2, odd2 (for odd indices), the code checks if even1 and odd1 are both set (meaning even indices have mixed parity), then output NO. Similarly if even2 and odd2 are both set (the odd indices have mixed parity), then also NO. Else, output YES.\n\nWait, but why does that logic work?\n\nHmm, let's think. The idea is that for all elements to have the same parity, the parities of the even and odd indices must be compatible. \n\nEach operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices (even 0-based)) flips the parity of those elements. Similarly, type 2 flips the even indices (odd 0-based). \n\nSuppose we perform x operations of type 1 and y of type 2. \n\nThe parity of an element at even index (0-based) is original_parity + x (mod 2). \n\nThe parity of an element at odd index (0-based) is original_parity + y (mod 2). \n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's see:\n\nFor all elements to be even:\n\nEach even index element must be even: (a_i + x) mod 2 == 0.\n\nEach odd index element must be even: (a_j + y) mod 2 ==0.\n\nSimilarly for all odd.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of all elements must be the same. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we want all elements to have parity P (0 for even, 1 for odd). \n\nFor even indices (0-based):\n\noriginal_parity_i + x \u2261 P mod 2.\n\nFor odd indices (0-based):\n\noriginal_parity_j + y \u2261 P mod 2.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that these equations hold for all elements. \n\nBut for this to be possible, all elements at even indices must have the same (original_parity_i + x) mod 2. So the original parities of even indices must all be congruent mod 2. Because x is the same for all even indices. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the x is the number of type 1 operations. Each such operation adds 1 to all even indices (0-based). So the total added to each even index is x. So their parity changes by x mod 2. \n\nSo for all even indices, their original parity plus x must be equal to P. \n\nSo for all even indices, (original_parity_i + x) mod 2 = P. \n\nWhich implies that all original_parity_i must be congruent mod 2. Because x is fixed. \n\nSimilarly, for all odd indices, (original_p_j + y) mod 2 = P. \n\nSo all original_p_j must be congruent mod 2. \n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements in even indices have the same parity, and all elements in odd indices have the same parity. \n\nBecause if that's the case, then we can choose x and y such that:\n\nFor even indices: original_parity_even (all same) + x \u2261 P mod 2.\n\nFor odd indices: original_parity_odd (all same) + y \u2261 P mod 2.\n\nWe can choose x and y accordingly. \n\nIf either the even indices have mixed parities, or the odd indices have mixed parities, then it's impossible. \n\nAh! So the code's logic is correct. Because even1 and odd1 track whether the even indices (0-based) have both even and odd elements. If even1 and odd1 are both 1, that means there are even and odd elements in even indices, so they can't all be made to the same parity. Similarly for the odd indices. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nSo the missing part is indeed the condition for the else clause (i is odd, so checking the element's parity and setting even2 or odd2). \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nelse {\n    if(t % 2 == 1) odd2 = 1;\n    else even2 = 1;\n}\n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"t % 2 == 1\"."
