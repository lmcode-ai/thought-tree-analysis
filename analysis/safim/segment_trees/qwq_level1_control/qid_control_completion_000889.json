Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the previous character in the segment to check for alternation. Hmm, perhaps the current code's approach is not the best, and we need to rewrite it. Alternatively, let's think of how to fit the required conditions into the existing code structure. The existing code's loop is:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    if B, set ok1 to true.\n\n    else if R, set ok2 to true. if current is W or end of string:\n\n        then check some condition based on ok1 and ok2.\n\n        reset ok1 and ok2. So, the code is processing each segment between W's (or start/end). For each such segment (non-W part), the code checks whether it's valid. The variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment. The problem is that the code needs to check for each segment:\n\n- The segment must have at least two characters (so length >=2).\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B.\n\n- Also, there must be only one such segment (so that all non-W are in one block).

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first check the first three conditions (all non-W in one block, length >=2, and consecutive different). But given the existing code's structure, perhaps the best way is to implement the first approach (finding first and last, then checking the block).

The user's original code has a different structure, so perhaps this is not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the original code's TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) == false || (count <2) ) But how to track count? The original code's loop doesn't track count, so this approach won't work. Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct conditions again. The correct conditions are:\n\nAll non-W must form a single contiguous block. Within this block:\n\n- No two consecutive same characters.\n\n- Length >=2. So, the code can be written as follows:\n\nCheck first and last non-W indices. Check that between first and last, all are non-W.\n\nCheck length >=2. Check consecutive characters alternate. The original code's structure doesn't do this, but the user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code. The existing code's loop is processing each segment between W's. For each such segment, it must be valid (length >=2, alternating), and there must be only one such segment. The code's current variables ok1 and ok2 track whether B or R are present in the current segment. The code's loop ends a segment when a W is encountered or end of string. The missing condition in the TODO is probably checking whether the current segment is valid (length >=2, and has both B and R, and no consecutive same). But how to track the length? Perhaps the code can track the length of the current segment by incrementing a counter. Let me try adding a 'length' variable: Modify the code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    int length =0;\n\n    bool first_segment = true;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == 'B'){\n\n            ok1 = true;\n\n            length++;\n\n        } else if(s[i] == 'R'){\n\n            ok2 = true; length++;\n\n        } else { // W\n\n            // process the segment.\n\n            if(length >0){\n\n                if( (length <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                if( !first_segment ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                first_segment = false;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1 = false; ok2 = false;\n\n            length =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check the last segment.\n\n    if(length >0){\n\n        if ( (length <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        } if( !first_segment ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n} Wait, but this code is different from the original structure.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the first approach and the code that checks first and last indices. The correct code would be:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    int first =-1, last =-1;\n\n    for(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] ! = 'W'){\n\n            if(first ==-1) first =i;\n\n            last =i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if(first ==-1){\n\n        cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    // check between first and last. for(int i=first; i <= last; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == 'W'){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if(last - first +1 <2){\n\n        cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    for(int i=first; i < last; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == s[i+1]){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThis code correctly implements the conditions. But the user's original code has a different structure. The problem requires to fill in the missing code in the existing code. The existing code's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){ if(s[i] is B \u2192 ok1 = true.\n\n    else if R \u2192 ok2 = true. if (i is end or W):\n\n        if (condition) \u2192 output NO.\n\n        reset ok1 and ok2.\n\n} The variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment. The missing condition in the TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) == false || (current_length <2) ) But current_length is not tracked. Thus, the code can't be completed in the existing structure without adding variables. Given that the user's code's structure is fixed, perhaps the correct answer is to fill in the missing condition as:\n\nif ( (ok1 == ok2) || ( (ok1 || ok2) && (count <2) ) ) But since count isn't tracked, this won't work.",

The problem is that the code must check for each segment:\n\n- The segment has at least two characters. - The characters alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Also, there is only one such segment. But how to do that with the existing variables? Alternatively, perhaps the code can track the previous character in the current segment, and check for alternation. Let me try to adjust the existing code. The existing code's loop:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n    else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n    if (i ==n-1 || s[i] == 'W') {\n\n        // check conditions here.\n\n        // then reset ok1 and ok2.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment. But to check the alternation, we need to track the previous character in the segment. So perhaps we can add a variable 'prev' to track the previous character in the current segment. Let me try modifying the code: Add variables:\n\nchar prev = 'W'; // or some default. int current_length =0;\n\nbool first_in_segment = true;\n\nThen, inside the loop:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    if s[i] is not W:\n\n        current_length++;\n\n        if (first_in_segment) {\n\n            prev = s[i];\n\n            first_in_segment = false;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if (prev == s[i]) { // consecutive same \u2192 invalid.\n\n                // set a flag to NO.\n\n            }\n\n            prev = s[i];\n\n        }\n\n        // set ok1 and ok2 as before.\n\n    else:\n\n        // process the segment. if (current_length >0) {\n\n            if (current_length <2 \u2192 invalid.\n\n            // also check if the segment has alternated.\n\n            // but how?\n\n            // perhaps track the alternation via the 'prev' and first character.\n\n            // but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the code can track for each segment:\n\n- The first character. - The second character must be different, etc. But this requires more variables. Alternatively, perhaps the code can track the previous character in the current segment and check for alternation. Let me try to adjust the existing code with these variables. Modified code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    char prev = 'W'; // previous character in current segment.\n\n    bool first_in_segment = true;\n\n    bool valid = true;\n\n    int segment_count =0;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] ! = 'W'){\n\n            if(first_in_segment){\n\n                prev = s[i];\n\n                first_in_segment = false;\n\n            } else {\n\n                if(s[i] == prev){\n\n                    valid = false; // consecutive same \u2192 invalid.\n\n                }\n\n                prev = s[i];\n\n            }\n\n            if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n            else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // end of segment. if (!first_in_segment) { // there was a segment.\n\n                segment_count++;\n\n                if (segment_count >1) {\n\n                    valid = false;\n\n                }\n\n                if (ok1 == ok2) { // both must be true?\n\n                    // no, because if the segment has only B's or R's \u2192 but that's already checked via consecutive.\n\n                    // but if the segment has only B's or R's, then the consecutive check would have failed.\n\n                }\n\n                // check length >=2.\n\n                if ( (i - start_of_segment) <2 ) \u2192 but how to track start?\n\n                // this is getting too complicated.\n\n                // perhaps need to track the start and end of the segment.\n\n                // maybe this approach is not feasible.\n\n            }\n\n            // reset variables. first_in_segment = true;\n\n            ok1 = false;\n\n            ok2 = false;\n\n            prev = 'W';\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // after loop, check the last segment. // ... \n\n    // then decide based on valid and segment_count.\n\n    // this is getting too involved. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not manageable within the existing code structure.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells. Each stamp can be either RB or BR, and each application changes both cells to those colors. The key is to check if the given string can be achieved through any number of such stamp applications, starting from all white.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves checking some constraints on the string. Let me think about the conditions that must be met for the answer to be \"YES\".\n\nFirst, note that every stamp affects two adjacent cells. So, any non-white cell must be part of at least one such pair. Also, since each stamp can be applied multiple times, overlapping is allowed. But the final colors depend on the cumulative effect of all stamps applied over those positions.\n\nWait, but each time you stamp, you set both cells to either R and B or B and R. So, each cell's color is determined by the last stamp that affected it. Because each stamp overwrites the previous colors. Oh right! Because each stamp application changes both cells under it. So the order of stamps matters, but perhaps the final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that covered it. Because any prior stamps on that cell would have been overwritten.\n\nTherefore, for each cell, its color must be part of a pair from the last stamp that covered it. So, the problem reduces to checking if the string can be partitioned into overlapping or non-overlapping pairs such that each pair is either RB or BR, and the rest are W. Wait, but overlapping is allowed because a cell can be part of multiple stamps, but the last one determines its color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for sequences where non-W characters must form certain patterns. Let me think of possible invalid cases.\n\nFor example, if there's a single R or B not part of a pair. Like \"R\" alone would be impossible because you can't stamp a single cell. Similarly, \"B\" alone is impossible. So any occurrence of a single R or B (not part of a pair) would make it impossible.\n\nWait, but the stamp can be applied multiple times. Wait, but each stamp must cover two cells. So, for instance, if the final string has a single R, that would mean that the last stamp that affected that R must have been part of a pair. But if it's the only R, then the other cell in that pair must be B. But then the other cell would have to be B. So if there's an isolated R, that's impossible.\n\nSo the first condition is that all non-W characters must form pairs in some way. Let me think of the string as a sequence where every non-W must be part of a pair (either R and B or B and R) in some overlapping regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the transitions between the characters. Let me think of the string and see what constraints must hold.\n\nAnother idea: Let's process the string and track the possible states. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the colors must form a pattern where every non-W must be part of a pair. Let me think of the string as needing to have all non-W regions form sequences that can be built by overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to check that the non-W parts of the string form a valid sequence where every R and B must alternate in some way, but considering that each pair can be either RB or BR. Also, any W must be either at the start/end or between two valid pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by looking for invalid patterns. Let's see some examples from the problem's notes:\n\nThe second, third, and fourth test cases where the answer is \"NO\" are when the string has a single non-W character. So like \"R\", \"B\", or \"RB\" but maybe not in a way that can be formed. Wait, \"RB\" would be possible with one stamp. So the problem's note says that for the second, third, and fourth test cases, it's not possible to stamp a single cell. So those cases must have a single cell (n=1) with R or B, which is impossible. So for n=1, any non-W is impossible.\n\nAnother example: the fifth test case is \"BRB\" (maybe?), which can be formed by two stamps. Let me see the example given in the problem's note for the fifth case: the input is \"WRRB\" (or maybe \"BRB\"?) Wait, the example given in the note for the fifth test case is:\n\nThe fifth test case's example: the input is \"WRRB\" (maybe?), but the steps are WWW \u2192 WRB (stamp at positions 1-2?), then applying a stamp at 0-1 to get BRB. So the final string is BRB. So that's possible.\n\nHmm, so the key is to find a way to model the constraints.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem by checking that the non-W parts of the string must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W characters must be either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last characters. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must satisfy that any two consecutive non-W characters must form either RB or BR. Because each stamp can only create such a pair, and overlapping stamps can affect adjacent regions.\n\nWait, but overlapping stamps can create longer sequences. For example, if you have three cells, and you stamp the first two as RB, then stamp the second and third as BR, the result would be R (from first stamp), then B (from first) and R (from second), then B (from second). So the sequence would be R B R B. Wait, but each stamp overwrites the previous. Wait, no, the second stamp on positions 1-2 would set those to B and R (if using BR) or R and B (if using RB). Wait, the first stamp on 0-1 gives R and B. Then a stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) would set them to either RB or BR. Let's say we choose BR. Then position 1 becomes B (from first stamp) then B (from second?), no, wait: the second stamp would set position 1 and 2 to B and R (if using BR). So after first stamp: positions 0: R, 1: B. Then second stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) as BR: so position 1 becomes B (from the stamp's B?), and position 2 becomes R. So the sequence would be R B R. Wait, but the second stamp's first element is B (position 1) and second is R (position 2). So the result after two stamps would be R (0), B (1 from first stamp, then B again?), no, the second stamp overwrites position 1. So after first stamp, positions 0 and 1 are R and B. Then the second stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) as BR would set position 1 to B and 2 to R. So the final sequence is R B R. But that's three characters. The problem is that the middle B is from the first stamp, but the second stamp overwrites position 1 to B again. So that's okay. But the sequence R B R would have consecutive B and R, which is allowed as part of a pair. Wait, but the B and R are adjacent here. So the pair between 1 and 2 is B and R, which is allowed (as BR). So that's okay.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the key is that in the final string, every non-W must be part of a pair with its neighbor. So for any position i, if s[i] is not W, then either the next or previous character must form a valid pair with it. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have any occurrence of two identical non-W characters in a row. Because each stamp can only create a pair of R and B. So two Rs in a row would be impossible unless they are part of overlapping stamps. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the desired string is \"RR\". Can this be achieved?\n\nLet's see. To get RR, the last stamp on positions 0-1 must have been either RB or BR. But neither of those would result in RR. So it's impossible. So two Rs in a row is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, two Bs in a row would also be invalid. So any occurrence of two same non-W characters in a row is invalid. So that's a key condition.\n\nWait, but what about three in a row? Like \"RBR\" \u2014 that's okay. Because each adjacent pair is RB and BR, which are valid.\n\nSo the first condition is that there are no two consecutive non-W characters that are the same. So, for all i from 0 to n-2, if s[i] and s[i+1] are both non-W, then they must be different (either RB or BR).\n\nAdditionally, we also need to handle the cases where there are single non-W characters. For example, if the string is \"R\", then it's impossible (since you can't stamp a single cell). Similarly, \"B\" is impossible. So any occurrence of a single non-W (i.e., surrounded by W or at the ends) must be part of a pair that extends beyond, but that's not possible. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"BRB\", then the middle B is part of both the first pair (B and R) and the second pair (R and B). But in the final string, the middle R is part of both pairs. But the problem is that each stamp must be applied to two cells. So for a single non-W in the middle, like \"W R W\", that's impossible because the R would have to be part of a pair with either the left or right W, but those would have to be turned into B or R, but then the other cell would not be W anymore. So \"WRW\" is impossible.\n\nSo another condition is that any non-W character must be part of at least one pair with a neighbor. So, for example, if a non-W is at the start, then the next character must also be non-W and different. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo putting this all together, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string cannot have two consecutive same non-W characters. So for any i, if s[i] and s[i+1] are both non-W, they must be different.\n\n2. Any non-W character must be part of a pair with at least one neighbor. So, for example, if the first character is non-W, then the second must also be non-W and different. Similarly, the last character must have a previous non-W.\n\nWait, but what about a single non-W in the middle? Like \"W R W\". Then the R is between two Ws. But to get that R, the stamp must have been applied to positions 1 and 2 (so the R is part of a pair with the next W, but that would turn the next W into B or R. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the desired string is \"WRW\". To get the R in the middle, the last stamp must have been applied to positions 0-1 or 1-2.\n\nIf applied to 0-1 as RB: then position 0 becomes R, 1 becomes B. But then the middle is B, not R. So that's not helpful.\n\nIf applied to 1-2 as BR: then position 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R. But then the middle is B, not R. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe applying a stamp to 0-1 as BR (so B and R), then another stamp to 1-2 as RB (R and B). Let's see:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1: B and R. So the string becomes BRW.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as RB: so position 1 becomes R, 2 becomes B. Now the string is B R B. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, so it's impossible to have a single R in the middle. So the conditions must also ensure that all non-W characters are in a contiguous block where the first and last are part of a pair with their neighbors.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire non-W part must form a sequence where every non-W is part of a pair with at least one neighbor. So the non-W parts can't be isolated.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- No two same non-W in a row.\n\n- All non-W must form a single contiguous block (so that the first and last non-W have a neighbor in the non-W block).\n\nWait, but maybe not necessarily a single block. For example, \"BRB\" is okay. But \"BRWB\" would have a W in between, which breaks the block. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"BRWB\". The W in the third position is white, so the B at position 3 is part of a pair with the next cell (if any). But the B at position 3 would need to have a neighbor (position 2 is W, so that can't form a pair. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the non-W parts must form a single contiguous block. Because otherwise, there would be a non-W separated by a W, which can't form a pair with its neighbor.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n1. The entire string must be all W, or:\n\n2. The non-W characters form a contiguous block (i.e., there are no W between any two non-W characters).\n\n3. Within this block, no two consecutive characters are the same (so they alternate between R and B).\n\n4. The length of the non-W block must be at least 2 (since you can't have a single non-W).\n\nWait, but the fourth condition is covered by the first three. Because if the non-W block is length 1, then it's a single non-W, which can't form a pair with anything. So the block must be at least length 2, and the first and last characters must be part of a pair with their neighbors.\n\nWait, but the first and last characters in the block must have a neighbor in the block. So the block can't be of length 1. So the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W characters form a contiguous block (so no W in between).\n\n- The block has even or odd length? Wait, no, the length can be any as long as consecutive are alternating.\n\nWait, the block can be of any length as long as consecutive are different. For example, \"RB\" is okay (length 2), \"RBR\" (length 3) is okay, \"RBRB\" (4) is okay, etc.\n\nWait, but the length can be any as long as the consecutive are alternating. So the length can be even or odd. For example, \"RBR\" is allowed (3 characters). The first and second are R and B, then B and R. So that's okay.\n\nSo the key conditions are:\n\n1. The non-W characters form a contiguous block (no W in between).\n\n2. In this block, every two consecutive characters are different (so they alternate between R and B).\n\n3. The block's length is at least 2 (so no single non-W).\n\nAdditionally, if the entire string is all W, then it's allowed (since zero stamps are used).\n\nSo how do we check these conditions in code?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFirst, check if the entire string is all W: then output YES.\n\nElse:\n\n- Find the first and last occurrence of non-W characters. Let's call them start and end.\n\n- Check that between start and end, there are no W's. So from start to end, all characters are non-W.\n\n- Check that in the substring s[start..end], every consecutive pair is different (R and B or B and R).\n\n- Also, the length of this substring must be at least 2.\n\nIf all these are true, then YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the non-W block is of length 1? Then the third condition (length >=2) would fail, so it's NO.\n\nSo that covers the cases like single R or B.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\nThe code loops through each character, tracking ok1 and ok2 (maybe whether B or R has been seen?), but the current code's logic is incomplete.\n\nThe current code's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n    if(s[i]=='B')ok1=true;\n\n    else if(s[i]=='R')ok2=true;\n\n    if(i==n-1 || s[i]=='W'){\n\n        if( /* TODO */ ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";return;\n\n        }\n\n        ok1=false;ok2=false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is to track when we are in a non-W segment. The variables ok1 and ok2 might be tracking whether B or R has been seen in the current segment. But the code is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check for the conditions where after a W, there are some inconsistencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to check that between W's, the segments of non-W are valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process the string in segments separated by W's. Because whenever a W is encountered (or the end of the string), it checks some condition.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true when B or R is found in the current segment. Then, when a W is found (or end), it checks if the current segment is valid.\n\nThe problem is that the current code's logic is incomplete. The TODO is where the condition is missing.\n\nThe idea might be that each non-W segment must be a valid block (as per the conditions above). So for each segment between W's (or start/end), we need to check that it's a valid block.\n\nSo, for each such segment (non-W part):\n\n- It must be at least length 2.\n\n- All consecutive characters must alternate between R and B.\n\n- Also, the entire non-W parts must form a single contiguous block. Wait, but if there are multiple non-W segments separated by W's, then that's invalid. So the code must also check that there is at most one such segment.\n\nWait, that's another condition: the entire string can have at most one non-W segment. Because if there are two non-W segments separated by W's, then that's invalid.\n\nSo the code must first check that all non-W characters are in a single contiguous block. So the first and last non-W must form a single block with no W in between.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n1. Check that all non-W are in a single block (i.e., there are no W between first and last non-W).\n\n2. The block must have length >=2.\n\n3. The characters in the block alternate between R and B.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and last indices where s[i] is not W. Let's call them first and last. If there are no non-W, then it's okay (all W).\n\nElse:\n\n- Check that from first to last, all characters are non-W. So for all i between first and last, s[i] is not W.\n\n- Check that the length (last - first +1) is at least 2.\n\n- Check that in the substring s[first..last], every consecutive pair is different.\n\nAdditionally, if there are any non-W outside of first to last, that would mean there are multiple segments, so it's invalid.\n\nWait, but first and last are the first and last non-W, so between them there can't be any W. Because if there was a W in between, then the first non-W would be before that W, and the last non-W would be after, so the first and last would not be adjacent. So the first and last must form a contiguous block.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the string is \"BRWBR\", then the first non-W is 0, last is 4. But between them is a W at position 2, so the non-W parts are two separate segments. So first and last would be 0 and 4, but the middle W breaks the block. So in this case, the first and last are not part of a contiguous block. So the code must check that between first and last, there are no W's.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCompute first and last:\n\nInitialize first = -1, last = -1.\n\nLoop through the string:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] != 'W') {\n\n        if (first == -1) first =i;\n\n        last =i;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, if first ==-1 (all W's), then output YES.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck that between first and last, all characters are non-W.\n\nfor (int i=first; i <= last; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n        // invalid, so return NO\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen check the length (last - first +1) >=2.\n\nThen check the consecutive pairs in the substring.\n\nfor (int i=first; i < last; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == s[i+1]) {\n\n        // invalid, return NO\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nIf all these pass, then YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to implement these steps.\n\nNow, looking back at the given code's structure, the current code is trying to process the string in segments separated by W's. The variables ok1 and ok2 track whether B or R have been seen in the current segment. The loop breaks when a W is found (or end of string), and then checks some condition.\n\nThe current code's approach is to process each segment between W's. For each such segment (non-W part), it must be a valid block. But since the entire non-W must form a single block, any segment (other than one) would invalidate the answer.\n\nSo the code's approach is to check for each segment (non-W parts between W's) whether they are valid, and also ensure that there is only one such segment.\n\nWait, but the code's current variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true when B or R is found in the current segment. Then, when a W is encountered (or end), it checks some condition.\n\nThe idea might be that each segment must be a valid block (alternating R and B, length >=2, etc.), and also that there is only one such segment.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nThe loop goes through each character. For each segment (non-W parts between W's), the code checks whether the segment is valid.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 track whether B or R have been found in the current segment. But perhaps the code is trying to check that the segment has both B and R? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check that in each segment, the colors alternate properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the previous character in the segment to check for alternation.\n\nHmm, perhaps the current code's approach is not the best, and we need to rewrite it.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of how to fit the required conditions into the existing code structure.\n\nThe existing code's loop is:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    if B, set ok1 to true.\n\n    else if R, set ok2 to true.\n\n    if current is W or end of string:\n\n        then check some condition based on ok1 and ok2.\n\n        reset ok1 and ok2.\n\nSo, the code is processing each segment between W's (or start/end). For each such segment (non-W part), the code checks whether it's valid.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe problem is that the code needs to check for each segment:\n\n- The segment must have at least two characters (so length >=2).\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B.\n\n- Also, there must be only one such segment (so that all non-W are in one block).\n\nSo, the code's current approach may not capture all these conditions, but perhaps can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nThe code's loop is processing each segment (non-W parts between W's). For each such segment, the code must check:\n\n1. The segment's length is at least 2.\n\n2. The characters alternate between R and B.\n\n3. There is only one such segment (so that all non-W are in one block).\n\nBut how to track the number of segments?\n\nAlternatively, the code can track the number of non-W segments. If it's more than one, then answer is NO.\n\nAdditionally, for each segment, check the other conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize a flag for whether there are multiple segments.\n\nAlso, for each segment, check its validity.\n\nLet me think of how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first check the first three conditions (all non-W in one block, length >=2, and consecutive different).\n\nBut given the existing code's structure, perhaps the best way is to implement the first approach (finding first and last, then checking the block).\n\nBut how to do that in the existing code's structure?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's current approach.\n\nThe code's loop is processing each segment (non-W parts between W's). For each such segment, the code checks some condition.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true when B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nAt the end of the segment (when a W is found or end of string), the code checks if the segment is valid.\n\nThe current code's TODO is in the condition inside the if statement.\n\nThe code's current logic is:\n\nfor each segment (non-W parts between W's):\n\n    check if the segment is invalid, and if so, output NO.\n\nSo, the code must check for each segment:\n\n- The segment's length must be at least 2.\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B.\n\n- Also, there must be only one such segment.\n\nBut how to track the number of segments?\n\nPerhaps the code can track the count of segments. If count exceeds 1, then output NO.\n\nAlternatively, the code can first check if there are multiple segments (i.e., more than one non-W segment separated by W's). If so, then output NO.\n\nBut integrating that into the existing code may be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's current variables.\n\nThe code's variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true when B or R are found in the current segment. So, for a segment to be valid, it must have at least one B and one R? Not necessarily. For example, a segment of \"RB\" has both, but \"BR\" also has both. But a segment of \"RBR\" has both as well. But a segment of \"RR\" is invalid (same consecutive), but that's already checked by the consecutive condition.\n\nWait, but the code's current variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if any B or R is present. So, for a segment with only R's (invalid), but that can't happen because the consecutive check would fail.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's current approach is trying to check that in each segment, there are both B and R? But that's not necessary. For example, a segment of \"RB\" has both, but a segment of \"BRB\" also has both. But a segment of \"BR\" also has both. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but a segment of \"B\" (length 1) would have ok1 = true, but that's invalid. So the code's condition must check that the segment's length is at least 2, and that the characters alternate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is:\n\nif (the segment has length <2) \u2192 invalid.\n\nOR\n\nif the segment has both B and R, but the consecutive characters are same \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, but how to track the consecutive characters?\n\nThe current code's approach may not be sufficient, so perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's current structure and see what the missing condition could be.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    if B \u2192 ok1 = true.\n\n    else if R \u2192 ok2 = true.\n\n    if current is W or end of string:\n\n        if (some condition based on ok1 and ok2) \u2192 output NO.\n\n        reset ok1 and ok2.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 track whether B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe problem is that the code needs to check for each segment:\n\n- The segment's length is at least 2.\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Also, there is only one such segment.\n\nBut how to track the length of the current segment?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code can track the length of the current segment. Let's see:\n\nModify the code to track the length of the current segment (non-W):\n\nInitialize a variable 'current_length' to 0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\n    if s[i] is not W:\n\n        current_length++;\n\n        ok1 = (s[i] == 'B');\n\n        ok2 = (s[i] == 'R');\n\n    else:\n\n        // process the segment (if current_length >0)\n\n        if (current_length <2) \u2192 invalid.\n\n        else check if the segment is valid (alternating).\n\n        Also, track the number of segments.\n\n        reset variables.\n\nWait, but this requires more variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track the previous character in the segment to check for alternation.\n\nLet me think of modifying the code's loop to track the previous character in the current segment.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nprev_char = 'W' (or some invalid value).\n\ncurrent_segment_length =0;\n\nsegment_count =0;\n\nvalid = true;\n\nThen, for each character:\n\n    if s[i] is W:\n\n        if current_segment_length >0:\n\n            // end of a segment.\n\n            segment_count++;\n\n            if (current_segment_length <2) \u2192 invalid.\n\n            // also check if the previous characters alternated.\n\n            // but how?\n\n            // perhaps track the previous character in the segment.\n\n            // but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first find the first and last non-W, then check the block between them.\n\nLet me try to code that approach.\n\nThe code can be written as follows:\n\nvoid sloth() {\n\n    int n; cin >>n;\n\n    string s; cin>>s;\n\n    int first = -1, last =-1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] != 'W') {\n\n            if (first ==-1) first =i;\n\n            last =i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (first ==-1) { // all W \u2192 yes\n\n        cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    // check that all between first and last are non-W.\n\n    for (int i=first; i <= last; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == 'W') {\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check length >=2.\n\n    if (last - first +1 <2) {\n\n        cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    // check consecutive characters alternate.\n\n    for (int i=first; i < last; i++) {\n\n        if (s[i] == s[i+1]) {\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThis code would handle all the conditions.\n\nBut the problem is that the original code's structure is different. The user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nLooking back at the original code:\n\nThe code has a loop over each character, tracking ok1 and ok2 (whether B or R is present in the current segment). Then, when a W is encountered (or end of string), it checks some condition.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true when B or R is found in the current segment.\n\nThe code's current approach is to process each segment (non-W parts between W's) and check some condition based on ok1 and ok2.\n\nThe problem is that the code must check for each segment:\n\n- The segment has at least two characters.\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Also, there is only one such segment.\n\nBut how to do that with the existing variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track the previous character in the current segment, and check for alternation.\n\nLet me try to adjust the existing code.\n\nThe existing code's loop:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n    else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n    if (i ==n-1 || s[i] == 'W') {\n\n        // check conditions here.\n\n        // then reset ok1 and ok2.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nBut to check the alternation, we need to track the previous character in the segment.\n\nSo perhaps we can add a variable 'prev' to track the previous character in the current segment.\n\nLet me try modifying the code:\n\nAdd variables:\n\nchar prev = 'W'; // or some default.\n\nint current_length =0;\n\nbool first_in_segment = true;\n\nThen, inside the loop:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    if s[i] is not W:\n\n        current_length++;\n\n        if (first_in_segment) {\n\n            prev = s[i];\n\n            first_in_segment = false;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if (prev == s[i]) { // consecutive same \u2192 invalid.\n\n                // set a flag to NO.\n\n            }\n\n            prev = s[i];\n\n        }\n\n        // set ok1 and ok2 as before.\n\n    else:\n\n        // process the segment.\n\n        if (current_length >0) {\n\n            if (current_length <2 \u2192 invalid.\n\n            // also check if the segment has alternated.\n\n            // but how?\n\n            // perhaps track the alternation via the 'prev' and first character.\n\n            // but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track for each segment:\n\n- The first character.\n\n- The second character must be different, etc.\n\nBut this requires more variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track the previous character in the current segment and check for alternation.\n\nLet me try to adjust the existing code with these variables.\n\nModified code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    char prev = 'W'; // previous character in current segment.\n\n    bool first_in_segment = true;\n\n    bool valid = true;\n\n    int segment_count =0;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n            if(first_in_segment){\n\n                prev = s[i];\n\n                first_in_segment = false;\n\n            } else {\n\n                if(s[i] == prev){\n\n                    valid = false; // consecutive same \u2192 invalid.\n\n                }\n\n                prev = s[i];\n\n            }\n\n            if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n            else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            // end of segment.\n\n            if (!first_in_segment) { // there was a segment.\n\n                segment_count++;\n\n                if (segment_count >1) {\n\n                    valid = false;\n\n                }\n\n                if (ok1 == ok2) { // both must be true?\n\n                    // no, because if the segment has only B's or R's \u2192 but that's already checked via consecutive.\n\n                    // but if the segment has only B's or R's, then the consecutive check would have failed.\n\n                }\n\n                // check length >=2.\n\n                if ( (i - start_of_segment) <2 ) \u2192 but how to track start?\n\n                // this is getting too complicated.\n\n                // perhaps need to track the start and end of the segment.\n\n                // maybe this approach is not feasible.\n\n            }\n\n            // reset variables.\n\n            first_in_segment = true;\n\n            ok1 = false;\n\n            ok2 = false;\n\n            prev = 'W';\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // after loop, check the last segment.\n\n    // ... \n\n    // then decide based on valid and segment_count.\n\n    // this is getting too involved.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not manageable within the existing code structure. The original code's structure may not be the best for this problem, so perhaps the correct way is to implement the first approach (checking first and last, etc.), but the user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nLooking back at the original code's loop:\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n    if(s[i]=='B')ok1=true;\n\n    else if(s[i]=='R')ok2=true;\n\n    if(i==n-1 || s[i]=='W'){\n\n        if(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";return;\n\n        }\n\n        ok1=false;ok2=false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment (non-W between W's or start/end).\n\nThe code is processing each segment (non-W parts between W's). For each such segment, the code must check:\n\n- The segment has at least two characters (so the length is >=2).\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- Also, there must be only one such segment.\n\nBut how to check these with the current variables?\n\nThe current code's variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment. So, for a segment to be valid, it must have at least two characters (so the length is >=2), and the characters alternate (so that there are both B and R? Not exactly, but the alternation requires that they alternate between the two).\n\nWait, but a segment of \"BRB\" has both B and R, so ok1 and ok2 are both true. A segment of \"RB\" also has both. But a segment of \"BR\" also has both. So, for a valid segment, the ok1 and ok2 must both be true, except for the case where the segment is of length 1 (but that's already invalid).\n\nWait, no. For a segment of length 2 like \"BR\", ok1 and ok2 are both true. For \"RB\", same. For a segment of length 3 like \"BRB\", also both are true.\n\nBut a segment of \"B\" (length 1) would have ok1 = true, ok2 = false \u2192 which is invalid.\n\nA segment of \"BB\" (invalid due to consecutive same) would have ok1 = true, ok2 = false \u2192 but the consecutive check would have failed.\n\nWait, but the code's current variables can't track the consecutive characters. So perhaps the code's current approach can't handle the alternation condition.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the code's current approach is not sufficient, and the correct way is to implement the first approach (checking first and last, etc.), but the user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) is false ) \u2192 meaning the segment has only B or only R \u2192 which is invalid.\n\nBut also, the length must be at least 2.\n\nWait, but how to track the length of the current segment?\n\nThe current code's loop doesn't track the length of the current segment. So perhaps the code can't be completed in this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can track the length of the current segment by counting the number of non-W characters in the current segment.\n\nLet me think of adding a variable 'count' to track the length of the current segment.\n\nModify the code:\n\nAdd a variable 'count' initialized to 0.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n        count++;\n\n        if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n        else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // process the segment.\n\n        if(count >0){\n\n            if(count <2 || (ok1 == ok2 == false) || (ok1 == ok2 == true) ? No, not sure.\n\n            Wait, the condition for the segment to be valid is:\n\n            count >=2,\n\n            and the characters alternate (so must have both B and R).\n\n            So, ok1 and ok2 must both be true.\n\n            Because if the segment has only B's or only R's, then ok1 or ok2 would be false, but that can't happen because consecutive same would have been invalid.\n\n            Wait, but if the segment has only B's, then consecutive B's would have been invalid, so the code would have already failed.\n\n            So the only valid segments are those with both B and R, and length >=2.\n\n            So the condition for the segment to be invalid is:\n\n            (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) \u2192 because if ok1 and ok2 are both true, then it's okay. If one is true and the other false, then it's invalid.\n\n            Wait, no. For example, a segment of \"BR\" has ok1 and ok2 both true \u2192 valid.\n\n            A segment of \"B\" has count 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\n            A segment of \"BB\" \u2192 count 2, but consecutive same \u2192 invalid (but the code can't catch that).\n\n            So this approach won't catch the consecutive same case.\n\n            So this approach is insufficient.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to implement the first approach (checking first and last, etc.), but the user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) == false || (ok1 == ok2) ) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to check that in each segment, there are both B and R (so ok1 and ok2 are both true), and the length is at least 2.\n\nBut the code can't track the length.\n\nAlternatively, the code can track the length by adding a variable 'count' initialized to 0.\n\nLet me try modifying the code with that:\n\nAdd 'count' variable:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    int count =0;\n\n    bool first_segment = true;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n            count++;\n\n            if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n            else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if(count >0){\n\n                // process the segment.\n\n                if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                // also check if this is the first segment.\n\n                if( !first_segment ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                first_segment = false;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1 = false; ok2 = false;\n\n            count =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // after loop, check the last segment.\n\n    if(count >0){\n\n        if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n        if( !first_segment ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nWait, but this is a different approach than the original code's structure. The user's original code has a different structure, so perhaps this is not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the original code's TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) == false || (count <2) )\n\nBut how to track count?\n\nThe original code's loop doesn't track count, so this approach won't work.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct conditions again.\n\nThe correct conditions are:\n\nAll non-W must form a single contiguous block.\n\nWithin this block:\n\n- No two consecutive same characters.\n\n- Length >=2.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nCheck first and last non-W indices.\n\nCheck that between first and last, all are non-W.\n\nCheck length >=2.\n\nCheck consecutive characters alternate.\n\nThe original code's structure doesn't do this, but the user wants us to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nThe existing code's loop is processing each segment between W's. For each such segment, it must be valid (length >=2, alternating), and there must be only one such segment.\n\nThe code's current variables ok1 and ok2 track whether B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe code's loop ends a segment when a W is encountered or end of string.\n\nThe missing condition in the TODO is probably checking whether the current segment is valid (length >=2, and has both B and R, and no consecutive same).\n\nBut how to track the length?\n\nPerhaps the code can track the length of the current segment by incrementing a counter.\n\nLet me try adding a 'length' variable:\n\nModify the code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    int length =0;\n\n    bool first_segment = true;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == 'B'){\n\n            ok1 = true;\n\n            length++;\n\n        } else if(s[i] == 'R'){\n\n            ok2 = true;\n\n            length++;\n\n        } else { // W\n\n            // process the segment.\n\n            if(length >0){\n\n                if( (length <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                if( !first_segment ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                first_segment = false;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1 = false; ok2 = false;\n\n            length =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check the last segment.\n\n    if(length >0){\n\n        if( (length <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n        if( !first_segment ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nWait, but this code is different from the original structure. The user's original code has a different structure, so perhaps this is not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the original code's TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 == ok2) || ( (ok1 || ok2) && (count <2) ) )\n\nBut without tracking count, this won't work.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to implement the first method (first and last indices) and the user's code can be modified to do that.\n\nBut the user's code's structure is different. The original code's loop is:\n\nfor each character:\n\n    update ok1 and ok2.\n\n    if current is W or end:\n\n        check condition based on ok1 and ok2.\n\n        reset.\n\nThe code's current variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe condition in the TODO must be something like:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) is false ) \u2192 meaning the segment has only B or only R \u2192 which is invalid.\n\nBut also, the length must be at least 2.\n\nBut how to track the length?\n\nPerhaps the code can track the length of the current segment by counting the number of non-W characters in the current segment.\n\nLet me add a variable 'count' initialized to 0.\n\nModified code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    int count =0;\n\n    bool first_segment = true;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n            count++;\n\n            if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n            else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if(count >0){\n\n                // segment is non-W.\n\n                if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                if( !first_segment ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                first_segment = false;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1 = false; ok2 = false;\n\n            count =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check the last segment.\n\n    if(count >0){\n\n        if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n        if( !first_segment ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThis code would check:\n\n- Each segment must have count >=2.\n\n- ok1 and ok2 must both be true (so the segment has both B and R).\n\n- Only one segment.\n\nBut this doesn't check the consecutive characters. For example, a segment like \"BRB\" is okay (count 3, ok1 and ok2 true), but a segment like \"BBR\" would have count 3, ok1 and ok2 true, but the first two are B's \u2192 which is invalid.\n\nSo this approach is insufficient.\n\nThus, the correct way is to check the consecutive characters, which requires tracking the previous character.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to implement the first approach (first and last indices) and see how to fit it into the existing code.\n\nThe original code's loop is:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    if(s[i] is B \u2192 ok1 = true.\n\n    else if R \u2192 ok2 = true.\n\n    if (i is end or W):\n\n        check condition.\n\n        reset.\n\n}\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe code can be modified to track first and last indices.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAdd variables first and last:\n\nint first =-1, last =-1;\n\nInside the loop:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n    if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n        if(first ==-1) first =i;\n\n        last =i;\n\n    }\n\n    // other code.\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, check first and last.\n\nBut the original code's loop is inside the function, so this can be done.\n\nBut the original code's loop is processing each segment, so perhaps the first and last can be tracked outside.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be modified to first find first and last, then proceed.\n\nBut the user's code's structure is to process each character in a loop, so perhaps the first and last can be tracked in that loop.\n\nLet me try:\n\nModify the code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    int first =-1, last =-1;\n\n    for(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n            if(first ==-1) first =i;\n\n            last =i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if(first ==-1){\n\n        cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    // check between first and last.\n\n    for(int i=first; i <= last; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == 'W'){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if(last - first +1 <2){\n\n        cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n        return;\n\n    }\n\n    for(int i=first; i < last; i++){\n\n        if(s[i] == s[i+1]){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\";\n\n            return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThis code would work correctly.\n\nBut the user's original code has a different structure. The problem requires to fill in the missing code in the existing code.\n\nThe existing code's structure is:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i]=='B')ok1=true;\n\n        else if(s[i]=='R')ok2=true;\n\n        if(i==n-1 || s[i]=='W'){\n\n            if(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n                cout<<\"NO\\n\";return;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1=false;ok2=false;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThe code's loop is processing each segment between W's. For each such segment, the code must check whether it is valid.\n\nThe variables ok1 and ok2 are set to true if B or R are present in the current segment.\n\nThe code's TODO is inside the condition where the segment is being processed (when a W is encountered or end).\n\nThe code must check for each segment:\n\n- The segment has length >=2.\n\n- The characters alternate between R and B (so no two same in a row).\n\n- There is only one such segment.\n\nBut how to do this with the current variables?\n\nThe length of the current segment can be tracked by a variable 'count' initialized to 0.\n\nLet me add 'count' to the code:\n\nvoid sloth(){\n\n    int n;cin>>n;\n\n    string s;cin>>s;\n\n    bool ok1=false,ok2=false;\n\n    int count =0;\n\n    bool first_segment = true;\n\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n        if(s[i] != 'W'){\n\n            count++;\n\n            if(s[i] == 'B') ok1 = true;\n\n            else if(s[i] == 'R') ok2 = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            if(count >0){\n\n                // process the segment.\n\n                if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                if( !first_segment ){\n\n                    cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n                }\n\n                first_segment = false;\n\n            }\n\n            ok1 = false; ok2 = false;\n\n            count =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // check the last segment.\n\n    if(count >0){\n\n        if( (count <2) || (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n        if( !first_segment ){\n\n            cout<<\"NO\\n\"; return;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout<<\"YES\\n\";\n\n}\n\nThis code would check the conditions:\n\n- Each segment must have count >=2.\n\n- ok1 and ok2 must both be true (so the segment has both B and R).\n\n- Only one segment.\n\nBut this doesn't check the consecutive characters. For example, a segment like \"BRB\" is okay, but \"BRR\" would have ok1 and ok2 true (since there's B and R), but the consecutive R's would make it invalid.\n\nThus, this approach is insufficient.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the problem's requirements, I think the correct approach is to implement the first method (first and last indices) and the user's code can be modified to do that. However, since the user's code's structure is different, perhaps the missing code in the TODO is:\n\nif ( (ok1 && ok2) == false || (count <2) )\n\nBut without tracking count, this won't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's current variables ok1 and ok2 are used to check that both B and R are present in the segment. So the condition is:\n\nif ( (ok1 == ok2) || (ok1 == false && ok2 == false) || (count <2) )\n\nBut without count, this can't be done.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.
