The code's current approach is building events for the start and end of the rain's influence. The events are sorted, and then processed in order. The variables a, maxn, maxn2, and t are being used.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should think of the problem differently. The code's approach is using a line sweep to track the accumulated rainfall. Each rain contributes a triangular shape. The line sweep processes events where the slope changes. The variable t is the current slope. The a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. The maximum a_j is the maximum value of a during the sweep. The code's variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a and the current position. The final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn.

The contribution at position x_i - p_i is 0. The contribution at position x_i + p_i is also 0. The contribution decreases as you move away from x_i. The condition for day i to be safe is that when you remove it, the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the maximum over all positions of (original a_j - contribution_i_j).",

The terms in the final condition are:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 \n\nx[i] + p[i] >= maxn \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn is the position of the maximum a_j, and maxn2 is something else. Alternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. Wait, the code's variables are named maxn and maxn2, which might be maximum values. The terms in the updates are:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1); The p.first is the current position. So, for each position pos = p.first, the code is considering two terms: \n\nterm1 = a - m - pos + 1 \n\nterm2 = a - m + pos - 1 The maxn2 is the maximum of term1 over all positions, and maxn is the maximum of term2 over all positions.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain (setting its p_i to 0) will prevent a flood. A flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m at any point. \n\nThe code provided seems to be using some line sweep approach. Let me look at the existing code structure. \n\nThe code reads the test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and m, then the x_i and p_i for each day. Then it's building a vector d which contains events. The events are probably related to the start and end of the rain's effect. \n\nLooking at how d is built: for each day i, they add three entries. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe first entry is {x[i] - p[i] + 1, 1}, the second {x[i] + 1, -2}, and the third {x[i] + p[i] + 1, 1}. Hmm, maybe these are points where the rain's contribution starts and ends. \n\nWait, the rain on day i contributes to positions from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i. The amount at position j is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). So the contribution is a diamond shape centered at x_i with radius p_i. \n\nThe line sweep approach is probably tracking the maximum accumulated rainfall at any point. The events in d are probably the start and end of the intervals where the rain's contribution is active. \n\nWait, the way the events are structured might be for the line sweep to track the current contribution. Let me think: \n\nEach rain's contribution can be represented as a segment from (x_i - p_i) to (x_i + p_i). The maximum contribution at any point j is the sum over all days of max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nBut tracking the maximum over all positions is tricky. The line sweep approach here might be trying to find the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall at any point. \n\nThe code's current approach is building events for the start and end of the rain's influence. The events are sorted, and then processed in order. The variables a, maxn, maxn2, and t are being used. \n\nLooking at the code's loop over the sorted events:\n\nInitially, a is 0, maxn and maxn2 are set to very low values. The loop processes each event. The line a += (p.first - las) * t; suggests that between the previous position (las) and the current position (p.first), the current contribution (t) is added over that interval. \n\nWait, t is probably the current \"slope\" or the current number of overlapping contributions? Or maybe the current rate of change? Hmm, not sure yet. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated based on some condition. The code's comments mention that a represents the current rainfall's center's accumulation, but I'm not sure. \n\nThe final check for each day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. If so, then it's a 1, else 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maxn and maxn2 are storing some thresholds that determine if removing day i's rain would help. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, when we remove it (set p_i to 0), check if the maximum accumulated rainfall ever exceeds m. \n\nThe approach here might be to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall without considering day i, and see if it's <= m. \n\nBut doing this for each day naively would be O(n^2), which is too slow given n up to 2e5. \n\nHence, the code must find a way to compute for all days in O(n log n) time. \n\nThe line sweep approach is probably precomputing the maximum possible a (accumulated rainfall) over all positions, and then for each day, determine if removing that day's contribution would reduce the maximum enough to stay under m. \n\nWait, the code's current approach might be trying to compute the maximum a (the accumulated rainfall) over all positions. Then, for each day i, the contribution of that day's rain is the maximum possible value it contributes. If that contribution is the one causing the maximum to exceed m, then removing it would help. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing some values that can be used to check for each day. \n\nLooking at the final condition for day i: \n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) then output 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn is the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) or something similar. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. Let me think through the line sweep steps. \n\nThe events in d are points where the \"slope\" of the accumulated rainfall changes. \n\nEach rain contributes a triangular shape. The line sweep processes events where the slope changes. \n\nThe variable t is the current \"slope\" of the accumulated rainfall. Wait, perhaps t is the current rate of change of the accumulated rainfall as we move along the x-axis. \n\nWait, the events are:\n\nFor a rain at x_i with p_i, the contribution starts at x_i - p_i, and ends at x_i + p_i. The contribution increases by 1 as you move towards x_i, then decreases by 1 after x_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the events are:\n\n- At position x_i - p_i, the slope increases by 1 (starting the left side of the triangle)\n- At position x_i + 1, the slope decreases by 2 (because after x_i, the slope starts decreasing)\n- At position x_i + p_i + 1, the slope increases by 1 again (ending the right side of the triangle)\n\nWait, maybe the events are structured as follows:\n\nThe rain's contribution can be represented as a piecewise linear function. The slope changes at certain points. \n\nThe first event (x_i - p_i + 1, 1) might be the start of the increasing slope. Wait, perhaps the events are the points where the slope changes. \n\nAlternatively, the events are the start and end of the intervals where the rain's contribution is active. \n\nAlternatively, the events are the points where the slope of the accumulated rainfall changes. \n\nThe variable t is the current slope. \n\nThe a variable might be the current accumulated value at the current position. \n\nWait, let me think of the line sweep as moving along the x-axis. Between two events, the slope (t) is constant, so the accumulated rainfall increases linearly. \n\nThe maximum a_j would be the maximum value of a + t*(x - current_position) over all x in the interval between events. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is tracked as we process each interval. \n\nThe code's loop is processing each event in order. For each interval between the previous event (las) and current event (p.first), the accumulated rainfall a increases by (p.first - las) * t. \n\nWait, no, the a variable is being updated as a += (p.first - las) * t. But that would be the integral over the interval, but perhaps a is the current value at the end of the interval? \n\nAlternatively, maybe a is the accumulated value at the current position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum value of a_j over all positions. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum values in some form. \n\nThe condition in the if statement is missing. The code says \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nLooking at the code's current structure, the loop over the events is processing each interval between events. \n\nThe line a += (p.first - las) * t; \n\nWait, perhaps t is the current slope. So over the interval from las to p.first, the slope is t, so the accumulated rainfall increases by t*(distance). \n\nWait, but the a variable is the current value at the end of the interval. \n\nThen, after moving to the new position (p.first), the code checks whether the maximum has been exceeded. \n\nThe if condition is missing. The code needs to check if during this interval, the accumulated rainfall ever exceeded m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum a_j. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions. To compute this, during each interval between events, the maximum could be the maximum of a (the value at the start of the interval) plus the maximum possible increase over the interval. \n\nWait, the slope t is the rate of change. So over the interval from las to current position, the a increases by t*(distance). \n\nWait, the slope t is the rate of change of a as we move along the x-axis. \n\nSo, the maximum a in the interval [las, p.first] would be a (the value at las) plus the maximum possible t*(x - las) for x in that interval. \n\nWait, but the slope t could be positive or negative. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum a in the interval is either at the start (a) or at the end (a + t*(distance)), depending on the sign of t. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum could be a + t*(distance) if t is positive, or a if t is negative. \n\nBut how does this relate to the variables maxn and maxn2? \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute maxn and maxn2, which are then used in the final check for each day. \n\nThe final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nWait, perhaps maxn is the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) over all j and i? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum contributions from the left and right sides. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. Let me think of the maximum a_j as the maximum value of the accumulated rainfall. \n\nIf the maximum a_j exceeds m, then there is a flood. \n\nThe problem requires that when we remove day i's rain, the maximum a_j (without that day's contribution) must be <= m. \n\nSo, for each day i, we need to check whether the maximum a_j (without considering day i's p_i) is <= m. \n\nThe code's approach is to precompute some values that can help determine this for each day quickly. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum contributions from the left and right sides of the rain's center. \n\nWait, the condition for day i being safe (output 1) is when p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn is the maximum (a_j - (x_i + p_i)) or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 are the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the contribution of that day's rain is the maximum possible it could have added. \n\nWait, the maximum a_j is the sum of all the contributions from each day's rain. So, when we remove day i's rain, the new maximum would be (original_max - contribution_i). \n\nIf original_max - contribution_i <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut how to compute contribution_i for each day? \n\nThe problem is that the maximum a_j could be due to multiple days' contributions. So removing one day might not reduce the maximum enough. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions of the sum of all p_k - |x_k - j| (if p_k > |x_k - j|). \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all j of the sum of all (p_k - |x_k - j|) for which p_k > |x_k - j|. \n\nThe code's line sweep approach is trying to compute this maximum. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum values in some way. \n\nLooking back at the code's loop:\n\nAfter processing each event, the code does:\n\na += (p.first - las) * t;\n\nThen, if some condition is met, it updates maxn and maxn2. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are initialized to -1e14, which is a very small number. \n\nThe code then adds the difference between a and m, adjusted by some terms. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\nHmm, perhaps these are expressions related to the maximum a_j exceeding m. \n\nThe condition for a flood is that at some position j, a_j > m. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all j of a_j. \n\nSo, if the maximum a_j exceeds m, then there is a flood. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, check whether removing that day's contribution would reduce the maximum enough. \n\nBut how does the code compute the maximum a_j? \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum a_j as it processes the events. \n\nWait, the a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum a_j is tracked as the maximum value of a during the line sweep. \n\nBut in the code, the variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated in some way. \n\nLooking at the code's final condition for day i: \n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) then output 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn is the maximum (a_j - (x_i + p_i)), and maxn2 is the maximum (a_j - (x_i - p_i)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the contribution of that day's rain is the maximum possible it could have added. \n\nWait, the maximum a_j could be the sum of all the contributions from all days. So, when you remove day i's rain, the new maximum would be (original_max - contribution_i). \n\nBut how to compute contribution_i? \n\nThe contribution of day i to the maximum a_j is the maximum (p_i - |x_i - j|) over all j. \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i (when j = x_i). \n\nSo, if the original maximum a_j is M, then after removing day i, the new maximum would be M - p_i. \n\nIf M - p_i <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut this is only true if the original maximum was exactly due to day i's contribution. \n\nOtherwise, if the maximum was due to other days, then removing day i won't help. \n\nHence, the problem requires for each day i, whether the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= m. \n\nThe code's approach must find for each day i, the maximum a_j when day i is excluded. \n\nBut doing this naively for each day is O(n^2), which is too slow. \n\nHence, the code must find a way to compute for all days in O(n) or O(n log n) time. \n\nThe line sweep approach is probably precomputing some information that allows this. \n\nLooking back at the code's variables:\n\nmaxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus some terms. \n\nThe final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nWait, perhaps the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i + p_i)) and (a_j - (x_i - p_i)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is M. \n\nThen, for day i, if the contribution of day i to the maximum M is such that M - (p_i - |x_i - j|) <= m, then removing day i would help. \n\nBut how to find this? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum possible contribution of that day to any position is p_i. \n\nHence, if the original maximum M exceeds m, then removing day i would help only if M - p_i <= m. \n\nBut this is only true if the day's contribution was exactly the excess. \n\nHence, the code must track for each day i, whether the maximum a_j without day i is <= m. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, check if the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i to the maximum point. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j when excluding day i is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i to the maximum point. \n\nBut this requires knowing which day contributed to the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using some mathematical approach to compute for each day i the maximum possible a_j when that day is excluded. \n\nLet me think differently. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, when we remove it, check if the maximum a_j (over all positions) is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j when day i is removed is equal to the original maximum a_j minus the contribution of day i to the position where the maximum occurs. \n\nBut if the original maximum was not at a position where day i contributed, then removing day i won't affect that maximum. \n\nHence, the maximum after removal could still be the same as before, so it would still exceed m. \n\nTherefore, the only way removing day i helps is if the original maximum was due to day i's contribution, and removing it reduces the maximum enough. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum after removing day i is the maximum of (original a_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. \n\nThis is difficult to compute for each i. \n\nThe line sweep approach in the code might be trying to compute for each day i, the maximum possible contribution it has to any position. \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i (at its center x_i). \n\nHence, if the original maximum a_j is M, then removing day i would reduce the maximum to at most M - p_i. \n\nSo, if M - p_i <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut this is only true if the original maximum was exactly M = p_i + other contributions. \n\nHence, this approach would not work in all cases. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j without day i is the maximum between the original maximum (excluding day i's contribution) and other maxima. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each day i, the maximum a_j that would exist if day i's rain is removed. \n\nTo do this efficiently, perhaps the code precomputes some information. \n\nLooking back at the code's final condition for day i: \n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) then output 1. \n\nWait, perhaps maxn is the maximum (a_j - (x_i + p_i)), and maxn2 is the maximum (a_j - (x_i - p_i)). \n\nWait, let me think of the terms in the maxn and maxn2 updates:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\nHmm, the terms a - m plus or minus something. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nWait, the variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus some terms. \n\nWait, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are initialized to -1e14, which is a very small number. \n\nThe code's loop processes each event, and for each interval between events, it updates a (the accumulated rainfall at the current position). \n\nThen, when the condition is met (the missing part), it updates maxn and maxn2. \n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each event in sorted order:\n\n   a += (current position - previous position) * t \n\n   if (condition):\n\n       update maxn and maxn2 \n\n   t += p.second \n\n   las = p.first \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus some terms. \n\nThe terms in the maxn and maxn2 updates are:\n\nmaxn2 = max( maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1 )\n\nmaxn = max( maxn, a - m + p.first - 1 )\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current position is within the interval where the maximum a_j exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nWait, the variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - m) in some way. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of a during the line sweep. \n\nBut how is that tracked? \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m. \n\nIf the maximum a_j exceeds m, then the maximum (a_j - m) is positive. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - m) in different ways. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the condition is whether the maximum a_j without day i is <= m. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum contributions from the left and right sides. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each day i, the maximum possible contribution that day i has to any position. \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i (at its center). \n\nHence, if the original maximum a_j is M, then removing day i would reduce the maximum to M - p_i. \n\nSo, if M - p_i <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut this is only true if the original maximum was exactly M = p_i + other contributions. \n\nHence, this approach would not work in all cases. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j without day i is the maximum between the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its peak (x_i), and other maxima. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's think of the contribution of day i to position j is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i (at j = x_i). \n\nThe maximum a_j is the sum of all contributions from all days. \n\nSo, when we remove day i, the new maximum a_j is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at the position where the original maximum was achieved. \n\nHence, if the original maximum was at position j, then the new maximum would be (original_max - (p_i - |x_i - j|)). \n\nIf this new value is <= m, then it's okay. \n\nBut to compute this for all days, we need to know for each day i, the contribution it had to the position where the maximum was achieved. \n\nThis requires knowing the position of the maximum and the contributions of each day to that position. \n\nThis seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, check whether the maximum a_j without day i is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the maximum over all positions of (a_j - contribution_i_j). \n\nThe maximum of this is the original maximum minus the minimum between the contribution_i_j at the original maximum position and the contribution of day i to that position. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j without day i is the maximum between the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its peak (x_i), and the maximum of all other positions. \n\nBut how to track this? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should look at the code's final condition again. \n\nThe condition for day i to be safe is:\n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) then output 1. \n\nWait, p[i] - x[i] is (x_i - j) when j is at x_i + p_i? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i + p_i)) and (a_j - (x_i - p_i)), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's think of the terms in the maxn and maxn2 updates:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\nThe p.first here is the current position (the event's position). \n\nSo, for each event position pos = p.first, the code is considering a (the accumulated rainfall at pos) and then:\n\nmaxn2 is the maximum between its current value and (a - m - pos + 1).\n\nmaxn is the maximum between its current value and (a - m + pos - 1).\n\nHmm, perhaps these terms are related to the maximum a_j - m at certain positions. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - m) over certain intervals. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the maximum a_j over all positions. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of a during the line sweep. \n\nBut how is that tracked? \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m. \n\nIf the maximum a_j exceeds m, then the maximum (a_j - m) is positive. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - m) in different ways. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the condition is whether the maximum a_j without day i is <= m. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum contributions from the left and right sides of each day's rain. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each day i, the maximum possible a_j that would exist if day i's rain is removed. \n\nTo do this, the code might precompute for each day i the maximum a_j that could be caused by other days. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values of (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. \n\nThe problem requires for each day i, when we remove it, check if the maximum a_j (over all positions) is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j after removing day i is the maximum over all positions of (sum_{k != i} max(0, p_k - |x_k - j|)). \n\nThe original maximum is the maximum over all positions of (sum_{k} max(0, p_k - |x_k - j|)). \n\nThe difference between the original maximum and the new maximum is at least the contribution of day i to the original maximum position. \n\nHence, if the original maximum was M, then the new maximum is at most M - contribution_i_j, where j is the position where the original maximum was achieved. \n\nSo, if M - contribution_i_j <= m, then it's okay. \n\nHence, for each day i, we need to know whether the contribution of day i to the position j (where the original maximum was) is at least (M - m). \n\nIf so, then removing day i would reduce the maximum enough. \n\nBut how to compute this for all days? \n\nThe problem is that we need to know for each day i, whether the contribution of day i to the position j (where the original maximum was) is >= (M - m). \n\nBut this requires knowing the position j where the maximum was achieved and the contribution of each day to that position. \n\nThis seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j without day i is the maximum between the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its peak (x_i), and the maximum of all other positions. \n\nHence, if the original maximum was due to day i's contribution, then removing it would reduce the maximum by p_i. \n\nSo, if the original maximum M - p_i <= m, then it's okay. \n\nOtherwise, it's not. \n\nBut this is only true if the maximum was exactly at the center of day i's rain. \n\nHence, the code might be assuming that the maximum occurs at the center of some day's rain. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum contributions from the left and right sides. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j, and then for each day i, the maximum a_j without day i is the maximum between the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its center (p_i), and the maximum of all other positions. \n\nHence, the condition would be whether the original maximum minus p_i <= m. \n\nBut this would only be true if the maximum was exactly due to day i's contribution. \n\nHence, the code's final condition might be checking whether the day's contribution is the one that caused the maximum to exceed m. \n\nThe condition in the code's final check is:\n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) then output 1. \n\nWait, p[i] - x[i] is (x_i - j) when j is at x_i + p_i? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nWait, the variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms. \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 are initialized to -1e14. \n\nThe code's loop processes each event, and for each interval between events, it updates a (the accumulated rainfall at the current position). \n\nThen, when the condition is met (the missing part), it updates maxn and maxn2. \n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each event in sorted order:\n\n   a += (current position - previous position) * t \n\n   if (condition):\n\n       update maxn and maxn2 \n\n   t += p.second \n\n   las = p.first \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms. \n\nThe terms in the maxn and maxn2 updates are:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current position is within the interval where the rain's contribution is active. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the center of a rain's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall reaches its maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. \n\nWait, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum of (a - m - pos + 1) and (a - m + pos -1). \n\nPerhaps these terms are derived from the maximum a_j - m. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is M. \n\nThen, the maximum a_j - m is M - m. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing this value. \n\nBut why the terms with p.first (the current position)? \n\nHmm, perhaps the terms are related to the position where the maximum occurs. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j over all positions. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of a during the line sweep. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms involving the current position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m over all positions. \n\nThe maximum a_j - m is the maximum between all (a - m) at each position. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing this maximum. \n\nBut why the terms with p.first? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m over all positions, but the terms are adjusted based on the position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m over all positions, but the terms are adjusted to account for the position's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j - m over all positions, and the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values in different ways. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) for positions to the left and right of the current event. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the missing condition in the loop. \n\nThe code's loop has an if statement that is missing. \n\nThe code's current line after updating a is:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    maxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\n    maxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\n}\n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a, m, and the current position (p.first). \n\nThe code's final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current position is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall reaches its maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the accumulated rainfall a exceeds m at this position. \n\nWait, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with a - m plus terms. \n\nIf the condition is whether a > m, then the code would be tracking the maximum (a - m) over all positions. \n\nBut the terms in the updates are a - m plus or minus p.first. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions, but the terms are adjusted to account for the position's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions, and the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum values in different ways. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) for positions to the left and right of the current event. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress here. \n\nPerhaps I should think of the problem differently. \n\nThe code's approach is using a line sweep to track the accumulated rainfall. \n\nEach rain contributes a triangular shape. \n\nThe line sweep processes events where the slope changes. \n\nThe variable t is the current slope. \n\nThe a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of a during the sweep. \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a and the current position. \n\nThe final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nWait, p[i] - x[i] is (x_i - j) when j is at x_i + p_i? \n\nWait, p[i] is the intensity, x_i is the center. \n\nThe maximum contribution of day i is p_i at position x_i. \n\nThe contribution at position x_i - p_i is 0. \n\nThe contribution at position x_i + p_i is also 0. \n\nThe contribution decreases as you move away from x_i. \n\nThe condition for day i to be safe is that when you remove it, the maximum a_j (without day i) is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the maximum over all positions of (original a_j - contribution_i_j). \n\nThe maximum of this is the original maximum minus the minimum between the contribution_i_j at the original maximum position and the contribution of day i to that position. \n\nHmm, but this is hard to track. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - (x_i - j)) and (a_j - (x_i + j)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nThe condition for day i to be safe is that the maximum a_j without day i is <= m. \n\nThe maximum a_j without day i is the maximum over all positions of (a_j - contribution_i_j). \n\nThe maximum of this is the original maximum minus the minimum contribution_i_j at the position where the original maximum was. \n\nHence, if the original maximum was M, then the new maximum is M - contribution_i_j. \n\nIf this is <= m, then it's okay. \n\nHence, for day i to be safe, the contribution_i_j at the position where the original maximum was must be >= (M - m). \n\nBut how to track this for all days? \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nThe maximum (a_j - m) is the maximum excess over m. \n\nIf this is <=0, then there is no flood. \n\nThe code's final condition for day i is whether the contribution of day i to the position where the maximum occurred is >= the excess. \n\nHence, the variables maxn and maxn2 might be storing the maximum excess and the position where it occurred. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. \n\nThe condition for day i is whether the contribution of day i to that position is >= the excess. \n\nHence, the code's final condition is checking whether the contribution of day i to the position where the maximum occurred is sufficient to reduce the excess below zero. \n\nThe terms in the final condition are:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 \n\nx[i] + p[i] >= maxn \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn is the position of the maximum a_j, and maxn2 is something else. \n\nAlternatively, the variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. \n\nWait, the code's variables are named maxn and maxn2, which might be maximum values. \n\nThe terms in the updates are:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - p.first + 1);\n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + p.first - 1);\n\nThe p.first is the current position. \n\nSo, for each position pos = p.first, the code is considering two terms: \n\nterm1 = a - m - pos + 1 \n\nterm2 = a - m + pos - 1 \n\nThe maxn2 is the maximum of term1 over all positions, and maxn is the maximum of term2 over all positions. \n\nWhat do these terms represent? \n\nLet me see:\n\nterm1 = (a - m) - (pos - 1) \n\nterm2 = (a - m) + (pos - 1) \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms are derived from the contribution of day i. \n\nSuppose the maximum a_j is at position j. \n\nThe contribution of day i to j is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe maximum a_j is M = sum of all contributions. \n\nThe excess is M - m. \n\nTo have the new maximum after removing day i be <= m, the contribution of day i to j must be >= excess. \n\nHence, contribution_i_j >= (M - m). \n\nThe contribution_i_j is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nSo, p_i - |x_i - j| >= (M - m). \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - (M - m). \n\nThis means that j must be within the interval [x_i - (p_i - (M - m)), x_i + (p_i - (M - m))]. \n\nBut how does this relate to the code's variables? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. \n\nThe maximum (a_j - m) is the excess. \n\nThe position where this occurs is j. \n\nThen, for day i to be safe, the contribution of day i to j must be >= excess. \n\nThe contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nHence, p_i - |x_i - j| >= excess. \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - excess. \n\nThis can be written as: \n\nj >= x_i - (p_i - excess) \n\nand \n\nj <= x_i + (p_i - excess) \n\nWhich is equivalent to: \n\nj >= (x_i - p_i) + excess \n\nand \n\nj <= (x_i + p_i) - excess \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position j where this occurs. \n\nThe excess is (a_j - m) at position j. \n\nThe condition for day i to be safe is that the contribution of day i to j is >= excess. \n\nThe contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nHence, p_i - |x_i - j| >= excess. \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - excess \n\nThis can be written as: \n\nj is in [x_i - (p_i - excess), x_i + (p_i - excess)] \n\nBut how does this relate to the code's final condition? \n\nThe code's final condition is:\n\nif (p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 && x[i] + p[i] >= maxn) \n\nWait, perhaps maxn is the position j where the maximum occurred. \n\nThen, the condition would be:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= (j - (x_i - p_i)) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are derived from the position j where the maximum occurred. \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position j. \n\nThe terms in the updates are:\n\nmaxn2 = max(maxn2, a - m - pos + 1) \n\nmaxn = max(maxn, a - m + pos - 1) \n\nSuppose the maximum occurs at position pos. \n\nThen, a - m is the excess. \n\nThe terms would be:\n\nterm1 = excess - pos + 1 \n\nterm2 = excess + pos - 1 \n\nThe maximum of term1 and term2 would be stored in maxn2 and maxn. \n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum of (a_j - m) plus and minus the position. \n\nThe maximum a_j - m is the excess. \n\nThe position j where this occurs is such that:\n\nexcess = a_j - m \n\nThe terms:\n\nterm1 = excess - j + 1 \n\nterm2 = excess + j - 1 \n\nThe maximum of term1 and term2 would be stored in maxn2 and maxn. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum of (a_j - m) + (j) and (a_j - m) - (j). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for the missing condition in the loop. \n\nThe code's loop has an if statement that is missing. \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a, m, and the current position (p.first). \n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nThe code's variables maxn and maxn2 are initialized to -1e14. \n\nThe code's loop processes each event in sorted order. \n\nThe a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nThe condition is probably whether the current position is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall reaches its maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the accumulated rainfall a exceeds m. \n\nIf the condition is whether a > m, then the code would be tracking the maximum excess. \n\nBut the terms in the updates are a - m plus or minus the position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is always true, and the code is updating maxn and maxn2 for every event. \n\nBut then why the if statement? \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current event is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe events are of three types for each day: \n\n1. Start of the left side of the rain's contribution (x_i - p_i + 1, 1) \n\n2. End of the left side and start of the right side (x_i + 1, -2) \n\n3. End of the right side (x_i + p_i + 1, 1) \n\nWait, the second event is at x_i + 1 with a delta of -2. \n\nThe first event is the start of the left side, the third is the end of the right side. \n\nThe second event is the point where the slope changes from increasing to decreasing. \n\nPerhaps the condition is whether the current event is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the center of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe center is at x_i. \n\nBut the events are at x_i - p_i +1, x_i +1, and x_i + p_i +1. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall reaches its maximum. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe third event for each day is at x_i + p_i +1, which is the end of the right side. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current event is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe third event for each day is the end of the right side. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current event is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe third event for each day is the end of the right side. \n\nBut the code's events are stored in a vector, and the loop processes all events. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is whether the current event is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall reaches its maximum. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nAlternatively, the condition is whether the current position is the point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. \n\nBut the code's variables are being updated with a - m terms. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the missing condition in the loop. \n\nThe code's loop is processing events in order. \n\nThe a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a and the current position. \n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nThe code's final condition for day i is whether p[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 and x[i] + p[i] >= maxn. \n\nThe terms maxn and maxn2 are the maximum of (a - m + pos -1) and (a - m - pos +1) over all events. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum (a_j - m) over all positions. \n\nThe maximum (a_j - m) is the maximum excess. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum of (a_j - m) plus and minus the position. \n\nThe maximum excess is the maximum of (a_j - m) over all j. \n\nThe position where this occurs is j. \n\nThen, the terms maxn and maxn2 are:\n\nmaxn = max( (a_j - m) + j -1 )\n\nmaxn2 = max( (a_j - m) - j +1 )\n\nThe maximum excess is the maximum between maxn and maxn2? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum excess is the maximum of (a_j - m) over all j. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum of (a_j - m) plus and minus the position. \n\nThe maximum excess can be derived from these variables. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position where it occurs. \n\nThe maximum (a_j - m) is the excess. \n\nThe position j where this occurs is such that:\n\nexcess = a_j - m \n\nThe terms:\n\nmaxn = excess + j -1 \n\nmaxn2 = excess - j +1 \n\nThen, solving for j:\n\nmaxn - maxn2 = (excess + j -1) - (excess - j +1) = 2j -2 \n\n=> j = (maxn - maxn2 + 2)/2 \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe final condition for day i is whether the contribution of day i to the position j (where the maximum occurred) is >= the excess. \n\nThe contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nThe excess is (a_j - m) = excess. \n\nSo, p_i - |x_i - j| >= excess \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - excess \n\nThis can be written as: \n\nj >= x_i - (p_i - excess) \n\nand \n\nj <= x_i + (p_i - excess) \n\nWhich is equivalent to: \n\nj >= (x_i - p_i) + excess \n\nand \n\nj <= (x_i + p_i) - excess \n\nHmm, the code's final condition is:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 \n\nx[i] + p[i] >= maxn \n\nWait, p[i] - x[i] is (x_i - j) when j is at x_i + p_i? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are related to the position j where the maximum occurred. \n\nThe code's final condition is checking whether the position j is within the interval [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) plus and minus the position. \n\nThe maximum excess is the maximum between maxn and maxn2? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's final condition is checking whether the contribution of day i to the position j (where the maximum occurred) is sufficient to reduce the excess to zero. \n\nThe contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nThe excess is (a_j - m). \n\nSo, the condition is p_i - |x_i - j| >= excess. \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - excess \n\nThis can be written as: \n\nj is between (x_i - (p_i - excess)) and (x_i + (p_i - excess)). \n\nThe code's final condition is:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 \n\nx[i] + p[i] >= maxn \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn2 is (x_i - (p_i - excess)) and maxn is (x_i + (p_i - excess)). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are derived from the position j and the excess. \n\nThe code's final condition is checking whether the position j is within the interval [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) and the position j. \n\nThe maximum (a_j - m) is the excess. \n\nThe position j is where this occurs. \n\nThe condition for day i to be safe is whether the contribution of day i to j is >= excess. \n\nThe contribution is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nHence, p_i - |x_i - j| >= excess \n\nRearranged: \n\n|x_i - j| <= p_i - excess \n\nThis can be written as: \n\nj >= x_i - (p_i - excess) \n\nand \n\nj <= x_i + (p_i - excess) \n\nThe code's final condition is:\n\np[i] - x[i] >= maxn2 \n\nx[i] + p[i] >= maxn \n\nHmm, perhaps maxn2 is (x_i - (p_i - excess)) and maxn is (x_i + (p_i - excess)). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the terms maxn and maxn2 are storing the maximum (a_j - m) plus and minus the position. \n\nThe maximum excess is the maximum between maxn and maxn2? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to think of the missing condition in the loop. \n\nThe code's loop is processing events in order. \n\nThe a variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nThe variables maxn and maxn2 are being updated with terms involving a and the current position. \n\nThe condition is missing. \n\nPerhaps the condition is whether the current position is the end of a rain's contribution. \n\nThe third event for each day is the end of the
