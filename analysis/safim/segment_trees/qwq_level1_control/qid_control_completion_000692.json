Similarly, arr[1][0] is even-indexed elements (i%2 ==1) with parity even, etc. So for the odd elements (i%2 ==0), their parities must all be the same. So either all are even (so arr[0][0] == count of odd elements, and arr[0][1] ==0) or all are odd (arr[0][1] == count, arr[0][0] ==0). Similarly for even elements (i%2 ==1), their parities must all be same. So the code needs to check:\n\nif ( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 && arr[0][1] == count_odds) || (arr[0][1]==0 && arr[0][0]==count_odds) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 && arr[1][1]==count_evens) || (arr[1][1]==0 && arr[1][0]==count_evens) ) ) Wait, but how to get count_odds and count_evens? The count_odds is the number of elements at odd positions (i%2 ==0 \u2192 indices 0,2,4 etc. So the count is (n+1)/2 if n is odd, or n/2 if even?",

Similarly, arr[1][0] + arr[1][1] is count_evens. So count_odds = arr[0][0] + arr[0][1]. count_evens = arr[1][0] + arr[1][1]. So the condition can be written as:\n\n// Check if all odd indices have same parity. boolean oddOk = (arr[0][0] == 0 || arr[0][1] ==0);\n\n// Check if all even indices have same parity. boolean evenOk = (arr[1][0] ==0 || arr[1][1] ==0); if (oddOk && evenOk) then yes else no. Ah! That's much simpler. Because for the odd indices, if either all are even (arr[0][1] is 0) or all are odd (arr[0][0] is 0). So the condition is (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0). Similarly for even indices. So the code can check:\n\nif ( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 || arr[1][1]==0) ) )\n\nthen ans is yes, else no. Wait, that's correct? Yes. Because for the odd indices, if all are even \u2192 arr[0][1] is 0. Or all are odd \u2192 arr[0][0] is 0. So the condition is (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0). Same for even indices. So the code's missing part is:\n\nif( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 || arr[1][1]==0) ) ) \n\nthen ans remains \"YES\", else \"NO\". Wait, but in the code, the initial ans is \"YES\", and if the condition is not met, then ans is set to \"NO\". Wait, the code currently has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) ans = \"NO\";\n\nSo the condition inside the if should be the negation of the above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out when it's possible to make all elements in the array have the same parity after any number of the given operations. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says that each operation can be done any number of times. So, each time you do an operation of type 1 (adding to odds), it's like adding 1 to each odd-indexed element. Similarly for even. But since you can do them multiple times, maybe the key is to model the possible changes modulo 2, since parity is what matters here.\n\nBecause adding 1 an even number of times would be equivalent to not adding anything (mod 2), and an odd number of times would flip the parity. Wait, but each operation affects all elements of a certain parity of their index. So, each operation's effect on the parity of each element depends on their position.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider each element's parity. Let's track how the operations can change the parities.\n\nSuppose we have two variables: the number of times we perform the odd-index operation (let's call it x) and the even-index operation (y). Each element's final parity depends on how many times it was incremented. For an element at position i (0-based or 1-based?), the problem's indices are 1-based? Wait, the problem says \"odd index\" like a1, a3, etc. So the first element is index 1 (odd), second is even, etc. So in code, if the array is 0-based, then the first element (index 0) is considered as position 1 (odd). So for code, the index in the array is i, so the actual position is i+1. So for element at array index i, if (i+1) is odd, then it's an odd index. So i%2 ==0 (since i+1 is odd when i is even). So for element at position i (0-based), if it's even index (i%2 ==0), then it's an odd position, so it's affected by the first operation. The even indices (i%2 ==1) are even positions, so affected by the second operation.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify:\n\nOriginal problem's indices are 1-based. So for the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. So in code, when stored as 0-based array, the first element (index 0) is a_1 (odd index), the second (index1) is a_2 (even index), etc.\n\nSo for each element a_i (original a_{i+1}), its position is i+1. So for the code's array, the element at index i is part of the odd indices if (i+1) is odd, which is when i is even. So for code's array, elements at even indices (0,2,4...) are odd positions, and odd indices (1,3,5...) are even positions.\n\nSo, for each element, the number of times it is incremented is:\n\nFor an element at position i (0-based):\n\nif it's in an odd position (original 1,3,5...), then it's in even indices (i even). So each time you do an operation of type 1 (add to odds), it gets +1. So total increments from type1 is x (number of times type1 is done). Similarly, for even positions (original 2,4,6...), which are the odd indices in code's array, they are affected by type2 operations (y times).\n\nWait, so for each element:\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nEach element's total added is:\n\nFor an element at an odd position (original a_1, a_3, etc. (code's even indices)), the total added is x (number of type1 operations) plus any other operations that might affect it? Wait no, the type2 operations don't affect them. So their total added is x (from type1) plus 0 from type2. Wait no, type2 adds to even indices. So for an element in an odd position (original a_1, etc.), it's only affected by type1 operations. So the total added is x.\n\nFor elements in even positions (original a_2, a_4, etc. (code's odd indices)), their added is y (number of type2 operations).\n\nWait, so each element's final value is original a_i plus x (if it's in an odd position) or y (if even). But since we only care about parity, the total added mod 2 is what matters.\n\nSo the parity of each element after x and y operations is:\n\nFor an element at an odd position (original a_1, a_3, etc.):\n\noriginal_parity (a_i %2) + x mod 2.\n\nFor even positions (a_2, a_4, etc.):\n\noriginal_parity + y mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. So, for all elements, their final parity must be equal. Let's denote the desired parity as either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). So, for all elements, their (original_parity + delta) mod2 must be equal, where delta is x for odd positions, y for even.\n\nSo, the condition is that for all elements in odd positions, (a_i_parity +x) mod2 must equal the same value, and similarly for even positions, (a_j_parity + y) mod2 must equal that same value.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of all elements must be the same. Let me think of the possible scenarios.\n\nLet me consider the parity differences between the first and second elements. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the equations.\n\nSuppose that after some x and y, all elements have the same parity. Let's say that parity is P (either 0 or 1). Then for each element in an odd position (original a_i):\n\n(a_i + x) mod2 = P.\n\nFor each element in even position (original a_j):\n\n(a_j + y) mod2 = P.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nx \u2261 (P - a_i) mod2 for all odd positions.\n\ny \u2261 (P - a_j) mod2 for all even positions.\n\nBut since all the equations for x must agree, the (P - a_i) mod2 must be the same for all odd positions. Similarly, the (P - a_j) mod2 must be the same for all even positions.\n\nSo, for all odd positions, (a_i mod2) must have the same value when subtracted from P. Let me see:\n\nSuppose all the a_i's in odd positions have parity p1, and even positions have p2.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the difference between the parities of the first and second elements must allow for some x and y to make all parities equal.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for all elements in odd positions, their (a_i +x) mod2 must be equal to each other and to the even elements' (a_j + y) mod2.\n\nWait, perhaps the parity of all elements must be the same, so the parity of (a_i +x) must equal the parity of (a_j + y) for any i (odd) and j (even).\n\nSo, (a_i +x) \u2261 (a_j + y) mod2.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (a_i - a_j) + (x - y) \u22610 mod2.\n\nBut this must hold for all i (odd) and j (even). Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of variables x and y.\n\nLet me consider the parity of the first element (odd position) and the second (even). Let's say the first has parity p1, the second p2.\n\nThen, for their parities to be equal after x and y:\n\n(p1 +x) mod2 = (p2 + y) mod2.\n\nSo, x - y \u2261 (p2 - p1) mod2.\n\nBut this must hold for all pairs of elements from odd and even positions. Wait, but perhaps the key is that all the odd elements must have the same required x mod2, and all even elements must have the same required y mod2, such that the equations are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the required x and y in terms of the desired parity P.\n\nSuppose we choose P as 0 (all even). Then:\n\nFor all odd elements (positions), (a_i +x) mod2 =0 \u2192 x \u2261 (-a_i) mod2 \u2192 x \u2261 (1 - a_i%2) mod2 if a_i is odd, etc. Wait, more precisely, x must be equal to (0 - a_i%2) mod2 for all odd elements. So all the (a_i%2) for odd elements must have the same value when subtracted from 0 mod2. So, all a_i%2 for odd elements must be the same. Because if two odd elements have different parities, then x would have to be both (0 -0) mod2 and (0-1) mod2, which is impossible. So for all odd elements, their parities must be the same. Similarly, for even elements, their (a_j%2) must all be the same, so that y can be set to (0 - a_j%2) mod2 for all even elements. Additionally, the x and y must satisfy the equation (from the first and second elements):\n\nx \u2261 (0 - a1%2) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (0 - a2%2) mod2,\n\nand also (a1%2 +x) \u2261 (a2%2 + y) mod2 \u2192 which would be 0 \u22610 mod2, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but if all the odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity, then choosing x and y accordingly would make all elements even. Similarly, if we choose P as 1 (all odd), then similar conditions must hold.\n\nWait, so the conditions for the possibility are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity, and the difference between the required x and y (for P=0 or P=1) can be satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions are that either:\n\nEither:\n\n- All the odd elements can be made to have the same parity as the even elements through some x and y, such that all become even or all become odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the difference between the parities of the first and second elements must allow for some x and y to make them equal, and similarly for all other elements.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the parity differences between the odd and even elements.\n\nSuppose that after some x and y, all elements have the same parity. Let's say that parity is P.\n\nThen for all odd elements (original a_i in odd positions):\n\n(a_i + x) mod2 = P \u2192 x \u2261 (P - a_i) mod2.\n\nSimilarly, for all even elements (a_j in even positions):\n\n(a_j + y) mod2 = P \u2192 y \u2261 (P - a_j) mod2.\n\nNow, for all odd elements, the required x must be the same. So, for all odd elements, (P - a_i) mod2 must be the same. Let's call this value X. So all (a_i mod2) must be equal to (P - X) mod2. Wait, perhaps more clearly, all a_i mod2 must be the same. Because if two a_i's in odd positions have different parities, then (P - a_i) mod2 would have to be the same for both, which would require that a_i mod2 are the same. Because suppose a_i is 0 mod2 and a_j is 1 mod2. Then (P -0) mod2 must equal (P-1) mod2 \u2192 which implies 0 \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2, which is only possible if 0 \u22611 mod2, which is false. So the a_i's in odd positions must all have the same parity. Similarly, the a_j's in even positions must all have the same parity.\n\nSo the first condition is that all elements in odd positions have the same parity, and all elements in even positions have the same parity.\n\nIf that's not the case, then it's impossible. Because otherwise, even if you choose x and y, you can't make all the odd elements have the same parity (since their original parities differ, so adding x mod2 can't make them all same unless they were same to begin with).\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So first, the parities of all odd elements must be the same, and the parities of all even elements must be the same. Otherwise, you can't even get all elements to have the same parity, because even after adding x and y, the odd elements would have (original parity +x) mod2, but if their original parities weren't the same, then adding x can't make them all the same.\n\nSo the first check is: are all the odd elements' parities the same, and all even elements' parities the same?\n\nIf that's not true, then answer is NO.\n\nAssuming that's true, then we can proceed.\n\nNow, let's suppose that all odd elements have parity p1, and all even elements have parity p2.\n\nWe need to choose x and y such that:\n\n(p1 +x) mod2 = (p2 + y) mod2 = desired parity (either 0 or 1).\n\nWait, the desired parity can be either 0 or 1. So we can choose between making all even or all odd.\n\nSo, for the desired parity P (either 0 or 1), we need:\n\nx \u2261 (P - p1) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (P - p2) mod2,\n\nand also, the equation (p1 +x) mod2 must equal (p2 + y) mod2 (since all elements must have same parity). But since P is the desired parity, this is automatically satisfied.\n\nWait, but the key is that the two equations for x and y must allow for some x and y. Since x and y can be any integers (number of operations can be any non-negative integer), their mod2 can be 0 or 1. So, for any P, we can choose x and y as needed mod2.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of operations, so x and y can be any non-negative integers. So their mod2 can be 0 or 1. So for any P, we can choose x and y such that x \u2261 (P - p1) mod2 and y \u2261 (P - p2) mod2. So the only constraint is that (p1 +x) mod2 must equal (p2 + y) mod2. But since we set both to P, that's okay.\n\nWait, but the question is whether there exists a P (either 0 or 1) such that the required x and y can be chosen such that the equations are satisfied. Since x and y can be any integers, their mod2 can be set as needed. So for any P, the required x mod2 and y mod2 can be set. So the only thing we need is that the difference between the required x and y is compatible.\n\nWait, perhaps the real condition is that either:\n\nEither (p1 + p2) is even, so that choosing P = p1 + x, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's think of the two possibilities for P (0 or 1). Let's see for each possible P whether it's possible.\n\nCase 1: Choose P =0.\n\nThen x must be (0 - p1) mod2,\n\ny must be (0 - p2) mod2.\n\nSo x mod2 = ( -p1 ) mod2,\n\ny mod2 = ( -p2 ) mod2.\n\nBut then, the parity of the even elements after adding y must be 0, so (p2 + y) mod2 =0 \u2192 which is exactly the condition.\n\nSo for this to be possible, there's no conflict here. The only thing is that x and y can be chosen as needed mod2. Since x and y can be any numbers, their mod2 can be set as required. So this is possible as long as the equations are consistent. Wait, but the equations are for x and y's mod2, so they can always be satisfied. So for P=0, the required x and y mod2 can be set. But then, the parity of the odd elements and even elements after the operations would both be 0, so they are equal. So this is possible as long as the initial parities of the odd and even groups allow this.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the required x and y must be such that the equations are compatible. Wait, but since x and y are independent variables, as long as each can be set to their required mod2, then it's okay. So for P=0, it's possible as long as the initial parities of the odd and even groups allow that. Wait, but the only condition is that the initial parities of the odd and even groups are such that when you add x and y mod2, they both reach 0. So for P=0, the required x mod2 is (0 - p1) mod2, and y mod2 is (0-p2) mod2. So that's possible. So the only thing is that the two equations can be satisfied, which they can, since x and y can be chosen freely mod2. So the only problem is whether the two groups can be adjusted to the same parity.\n\nWait, but the key is that after choosing x and y, the parity of the odd elements (p1 +x mod2) must equal the parity of the even elements (p2 + y mod2). So for P=0, that's 0=0, so okay. So for P=0, the required condition is that (p1 +x) mod2 = (p2 + y) mod2, which is enforced by setting both to 0. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly for P=1, the required x mod2 is (1-p1) mod2, and y mod2 is (1-p2) mod2. Then (p1 +x) mod2 =1, and (p2 + y) mod2 =1, so they are equal. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, as long as the initial parities of the odd and even groups are such that either:\n\nEither (p1 +x) mod2 equals (p2 + y) mod2 for some x and y (which is always possible, since x and y can be chosen to set their mod2 as needed), but wait, no. Wait, the problem is that the required x and y must be such that the equations for P=0 or P=1 can be satisfied. Wait, but for any P, the equations can be satisfied. So the only condition is that the initial parities of the odd and even groups are such that either:\n\nEither (p1 + x) mod2 equals (p2 + y) mod2 for some x and y. But since x and y can be any integers, their mod2 can be set to any value. So the only constraint is that the difference between the required x and y mod2 must allow for the equations to be compatible. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the real problem is that the two groups (odd and even) can be adjusted to have the same parity. Let me think of the difference between the two groups' parities.\n\nSuppose that the current parity of the odd group is p1, and even group p2.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that:\n\n(p1 +x) mod2 = (p2 + y) mod2.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that this holds. For example, set x =0, then y must be (p1 - p2) mod2. Or set y=0, then x must be (p2 - p1) mod2. Since x and y can be any integers, their mod2 can be set as needed. So this equation can always be satisfied. So the only condition is that the two groups have all their elements with the same parity within their group. Because if the odd group has varying parities, then even after adding x, they can't all be the same. Similarly for even group.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. All elements in odd positions have the same parity.\n\n2. All elements in even positions have the same parity.\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then it is possible. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case: [1,2,1]\n\nOriginal array is a1=1 (odd index, parity 1), a2=2 (even, parity 0), a3=1 (odd, parity1).\n\nSo the odd elements (positions 1 and 3) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same. Even elements (position2) has parity0. So conditions are met. So answer is yes. Which matches the note.\n\nSecond test case: [1,3,5]. Let's see. The array is [1,3,5]. The odd indices (positions1 and 3) have elements 1 and5 \u2192 both parity1. Even index (position2) has 3 \u2192 parity1. So even elements have parity1. So all even elements (only one here) have same parity. So conditions are met. Wait but according to the note, the second test case's answer is NO. Wait, that contradicts my conclusion. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the second test case.\n\nWait the note says for the second test case, the answer is NO. Let me see what the second test case is. The user's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nHmm, so according to my current logic, the conditions would be met, but the answer is NO. So my logic is wrong.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case is different. Let me think of an example where the conditions are met but the answer is NO.\n\nSuppose the second test case is like [1,3,5]. Let's see:\n\nOdd positions (indices 0 and 2 in 0-based array, which are positions1 and3 in 1-based):\n\nelements 1 and5 \u2192 both parity1.\n\nEven position (index1, position2) has 3 \u2192 parity1.\n\nSo all even elements (only one here) have parity1. So conditions are met. So according to my previous logic, the answer should be YES, but the note says it's NO. So my logic is wrong.\n\nHmm, so there must be another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me take the example of [1,3,5].\n\nWe need to see if we can make all elements even or all odd.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe current parities are all odd (1,1,1). So they are already all odd. So the answer should be YES. But according to the note, the second test case's answer is NO. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the second test case's input.\n\nWait, maybe the second test case is different. Let me think of another example where the conditions are met but the answer is NO.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case is [1,2,3]. Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (positions1 and3) have 1 and3 \u2192 both odd (parity1).\n\nEven index (position2) has 2 \u2192 even (parity0).\n\nSo the conditions are met (all odds have same parity, evens have same). Now, can we make all even?\n\nWe need to choose x and y such that:\n\nFor odd elements (parity1):\n\n1 +x mod2 =0 \u2192 x mod2 =1.\n\nFor even elements (parity0):\n\n0 + y mod2 =0 \u2192 y mod2=0.\n\nSo x must be odd, y even.\n\nThen, the even elements (parity0 + y mod2 \u2192 0 +0 mod2 \u21920. So all even.\n\nSo possible. So answer is YES.\n\nHmm, but the note says the second test case's answer is NO. So perhaps the second test case is different. Let me think of another scenario.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2]. So n=2.\n\nOdd elements (position1) is 1 (parity1), even (position2) is 2 (parity0).\n\nConditions are met. So can we make all even?\n\nSet x to 1 (mod2), y to 0 mod2.\n\nThen, the odd element becomes 1+1=2 (even), even stays 2 \u2192 all even. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, can we make all odd?\n\nSet x to 0 mod2 (so x even), y to 1 mod2 (so y odd).\n\nThen, odd element is 1+0=1 (odd), even is 2+1=3 (odd). So yes.\n\nSo answer is yes.\n\nHmm, so maybe the second test case in the note is different. Let me think of a case where the conditions are met but the answer is NO.\n\nSuppose the array is [1,1,2]. Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (positions1 and3) \u2192 elements 1 and2. Wait, position3 is third element (index2 in 0-based). So the third element is 2 \u2192 parity0. So the odd indices (positions1 and3) have parities 1 and0 \u2192 different. So the first condition (all odd elements have same parity) is not met. So answer is no.\n\nAnother example where conditions are met but answer is no?\n\nHmm, perhaps when the required x and y can't be chosen such that the two groups can reach the same parity.\n\nWait, let's think of the case where the odd elements have parity 0, even elements have parity 1.\n\nSuppose we want to make all even (P=0):\n\nThen x must be 0 mod2 (since 0 +x mod2 =0 \u2192 x even).\n\ny must be (0-1) mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 (so y must be odd).\n\nThen, the even elements (parity1) + y mod2 \u2192 1 +1 mod2 \u21920. So that works.\n\nSo possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the odd elements have parity 1, even have parity 0.\n\nThen to make all even (P=0):\n\nx must be 1 mod2 (so x is odd).\n\ny must be 0 mod2 (even).\n\nSo possible.\n\nHmm, so in all cases where the two groups have same parity within themselves, it's possible. So why the second test case in the note is a NO?\n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the note's second test case. Let me re-read the note.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\". For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\"\n\nSo the second test case must be a case where the two groups have same parity within themselves, but it's impossible to make all same parity.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my previous logic is missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the required x and y must be chosen such that the same x and y work for all elements. Because x is the number of times you do the odd operation, and y the even. So for example, if the odd elements have parity p1 and even p2, then to make all even, you need x \u2261 (0-p1) mod2 and y \u2261 (0-p2) mod2. But these x and y must be the same for all elements. So the x and y must be chosen such that those congruences are satisfied. But since x and y are the same for all elements, that's okay. So the problem is that the two congruences must be compatible. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the x and y are global variables. So for example, if the odd elements require x mod2 = a, and even elements require y mod2 = b, then those are the only constraints. So as long as there exists x and y such that x mod2 = a and y mod2 = b, then it's possible. Since x and y can be any integers, their mod2 can be set to any values. So the only constraints are that the a and b can be set to whatever is needed for the desired P.\n\nWait, but the desired P can be chosen. So for any P, the required a and b are (P-p1) mod2 and (P-p2) mod2. So the question is whether there exists a P (0 or 1) such that the required a and b can be set, and then the equations are satisfied. Since a and b can be anything, as long as you choose P such that the required a and b are possible (which they are), then it's possible.\n\nWait, but then why the second test case in the note is a NO?\n\nAh! Maybe I made a mistake in the initial conditions. Let me think of the second test case in the note. Let's see what the second test case could be.\n\nSuppose the second test case is [1, 2, 3]. Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (positions1 and3) have 1 and3 \u2192 both odd (parity1).\n\nEven index (position2) has 2 \u2192 even (parity0).\n\nSo conditions are met. So according to my logic, the answer should be YES. But the note says it's NO. So there's a contradiction here. So my logic must be wrong.\n\nWait, let's see what happens in this case. Let's try to make all even.\n\nWe need x mod2 = (0-1) mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 (so x must be odd).\n\ny mod2 = (0-0) mod2 \u21920 mod2 (even).\n\nSo x is odd, y even.\n\nThen, the odd elements (1 and3) after adding x (odd):\n\n1 + odd \u2192 even (since 1+1=2, etc).\n\n3 + odd \u2192 even (3+1=4).\n\nEven element (2) + y (even) \u2192 2 + even \u2192 even.\n\nSo all even. So possible. So answer should be YES. But the note says the second test case is NO. So perhaps the second test case is different.\n\nHmm, maybe the second test case is [1,3,2]. Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (positions1 and3) \u2192 elements 1 and2 \u2192 parities 1 and0 \u2192 different. So the first condition (all odd elements have same parity) is not met. So answer is NO. That would fit the note's second test case.\n\nAh, so perhaps the second test case has elements where the odd elements have different parities. So the first condition is not met, so answer is NO.\n\nSo my initial logic is correct: the conditions are that all odd elements have same parity, and all even elements have same parity. If that's true, then it's possible. Otherwise, no.\n\nSo the code needs to check whether all elements in odd indices have the same parity, and all even indices have same parity.\n\nSo in the code provided, the code is:\n\nint[][] arr = new int[2][2];\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\n\n    int temp = in.nextInt();\n\n    arr[i%2][temp%2]++;\n\n}\n\nSo arr[0][0] is the count of odd-indexed elements (i%2 ==0 \u2192 original odd positions) with parity 0 (even).\n\narr[0][1] is the count of odd-indexed elements with parity 1 (odd).\n\nSimilarly, arr[1][0] is even-indexed elements (i%2 ==1) with parity even, etc.\n\nSo for the odd elements (i%2 ==0), their parities must all be the same. So either all are even (so arr[0][0] == count of odd elements, and arr[0][1] ==0) or all are odd (arr[0][1] == count, arr[0][0] ==0).\n\nSimilarly for even elements (i%2 ==1), their parities must all be same.\n\nSo the code needs to check:\n\nif ( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 && arr[0][1] == count_odds) || (arr[0][1]==0 && arr[0][0]==count_odds) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 && arr[1][1]==count_evens) || (arr[1][1]==0 && arr[1][0]==count_evens) ) )\n\nWait, but how to get count_odds and count_evens?\n\nThe count_odds is the number of elements at odd positions (i%2 ==0 \u2192 indices 0,2,4 etc. So the count is (n+1)/2 if n is odd, or n/2 if even? Wait, for n elements, the number of odd indices (original positions 1,3,5 etc.) is (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even.\n\nAlternatively, the count_odds is (i%2 ==0 \u2192 for i from 0 to n-1, the number of such i is (n+1)/2 if n is odd, else n/2. But perhaps it's easier to compute as (n +1)/2 rounded down?\n\nAlternatively, the count_odds is (n +1)/2 when n is odd, else n/2. But perhaps in code, it's easier to compute as (n+1)/2 when n is odd, but perhaps the code can compute it as (n+1)/2 ?\n\nWait, in code, for the array of size n, the number of elements in odd positions (original) is (n +1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. So for example, n=3 \u2192 2 elements (indices0 and2). Wait, n=3 \u2192 indices 0,1,2 \u2192 odd positions (indices0 and2 \u2192 2 elements. (3+1)/2 =2. So yes.\n\nSo count_odds = (n +1)/2 if n is odd, else n/2. But in code, perhaps it's better to compute it as (n+1)/2 when n is odd, but perhaps using (n+1)/2 for all n? Let's see:\n\nWait for n even:\n\nn=2 \u2192 count_odds is 1 (indices0). (2+1)/2 =1.5 \u2192 no, but integer division would be 1. So (n+1)/2 when using integer division would give correct for both even and odd.\n\nWait, in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is even:\n\nn=2 \u2192 (3)/2 \u21921.5 \u2192 but integer division gives 1. Which is correct (indices0 and1? No, for n=2, indices0 and1. The odd positions are indices0 (position1) \u2192 count_odds is 1. So yes.\n\nYes, so count_odds = (n+1)/2 (integer division).\n\nWait, in code, (n+1)/2 in integer division would give the correct count.\n\nSo in code, for the odd elements (i%2 ==0):\n\nthe count_odds = (n +1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, count_evens = n/2.\n\nSo in code, the condition is:\n\nif ( ( (arr[0][0] == count_odds && arr[0][1] ==0) || (arr[0][1] == count_odds && arr[0][0] ==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0] == count_evens && arr[1][1] ==0) || (arr[1][1] == count_evens && arr[1][0] ==0) ) )\n\nthen answer is yes, else no.\n\nWait, but how to compute count_odds and count_evens?\n\nAlternatively, in the code provided, the arr[0][0] + arr[0][1] is the count_odds, since those are the counts for the odd indices. Similarly, arr[1][0] + arr[1][1] is count_evens.\n\nSo count_odds = arr[0][0] + arr[0][1].\n\ncount_evens = arr[1][0] + arr[1][1].\n\nSo the condition can be written as:\n\n// Check if all odd indices have same parity.\n\nboolean oddOk = (arr[0][0] == 0 || arr[0][1] ==0);\n\n// Check if all even indices have same parity.\n\nboolean evenOk = (arr[1][0] ==0 || arr[1][1] ==0);\n\nif (oddOk && evenOk) then yes else no.\n\nAh! That's much simpler. Because for the odd indices, if either all are even (arr[0][1] is 0) or all are odd (arr[0][0] is 0). So the condition is (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0). Similarly for even indices.\n\nSo the code can check:\n\nif ( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 || arr[1][1]==0) ) )\n\nthen ans is yes, else no.\n\nWait, that's correct?\n\nYes. Because for the odd indices, if all are even \u2192 arr[0][1] is 0. Or all are odd \u2192 arr[0][0] is 0. So the condition is (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0).\n\nSame for even indices.\n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nif( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 || arr[1][1]==0) ) ) \n\nthen ans remains \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial ans is \"YES\", and if the condition is not met, then ans is set to \"NO\".\n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) ans = \"NO\";\n\nSo the condition inside the if should be the negation of the above. Because if the condition (oddOk && evenOk) is true \u2192 ans remains YES. Else, set to NO.\n\nSo the code's if condition should be:\n\nif( ! ( ( (arr[0][0] ==0 || arr[0][1]==0) ) && ( (arr[1][0]==0 || arr[1][1]==0) ) ) )\n\nthen ans = \"NO\".\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif( (arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0) )\n\nthen ans = \"NO\".\n\nBecause if either the odd indices have mixed parities (both counts non-zero) or even indices have mixed, then it's impossible.\n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\n(arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0)\n\nSo the if condition is:\n\nif( (arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0) )\n\nthen ans = \"NO\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif( (arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0) )\n\nthen set ans to \"NO\".\n\nSo that's the missing code.\n\nTesting with the second test case in the note, which must be a case where either the odd or even indices have mixed parities.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1,2,3], then:\n\narr[0][0] (odd indices even count) \u2192 elements 1 (parity1) and3 (parity1). So arr[0][0] is 0 (since they are odd), arr[0][1] is 2. So arr[0][0] is 0 \u2192 so the first condition (arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) is false. The even indices (position2, element2 \u2192 parity0. So arr[1][0] is1, arr[1][1] is0. So evenOk is true. So overall condition is false \u2192 ans is YES. But according to the note, the second test case is a NO. So perhaps the second test case is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case is [1,2,4]. Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (elements1 and4 \u2192 parities1 and0 \u2192 mixed. So arr[0][0] =1 (element4 is even), arr[0][1]=1 (element1 is odd). So arr[0][0] and arr[0][1] are both non-zero \u2192 so the condition is true \u2192 ans is NO. Which would fit the note's second test case.\n\nAh, so in that case, the code would output NO, which matches the note.\n\nSo the code's condition is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\n(arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0)\n\nSo the code should have that condition in the if statement."
