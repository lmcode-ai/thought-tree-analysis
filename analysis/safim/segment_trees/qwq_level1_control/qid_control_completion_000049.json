    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program. The problem is about finding the minimum total energy for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations in a grid using portals. Hmm.\n\nThe code provided has a main function that reads test cases. For each case, if n and m are both 1, it outputs 0. Otherwise, there's a condition where if something is true, they swap n and m (by adding and subtracting), then output n + n + m - 2. Wait, the line with the TODO is checking whether to perform that swap. So the key is to determine when to swap n and m.\n\nThe problem's main idea is to calculate the minimal energy considering their paths and the portals. Let me think about the movement. Both can use portals, which allows them to teleport between any portal cells with 1 energy. Since Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits, the portals are along her path. So the optimal path would involve using portals to minimize the total steps.\n\nLet me consider the paths. Stanley starts at (1,1) and goes to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) to (1,m). Their paths might cross, and using portals can save steps. The minimal total energy would be the sum of their individual minimal paths, but considering the portals they create along the way.\n\nWait, the note in the problem gives an example where they use portals. The example's total is 15. Let me see how that comes. The example's explanation mentions that Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). So her path is from (n,1) to (1,3) first, then to (1,m). Stanley uses the portal at (1,3) to teleport to (7,3), then proceeds. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total energy can be calculated by considering the best way to arrange their paths so that their portal usage overlaps optimally. \n\nThe formula in the code is n + n + m - 2. Wait, but when they swap n and m, that would be when m is smaller than n? Or maybe when the grid is taller than it is wide, so swapping makes m the larger dimension?\n\nWait, the code's line after the if statement does: if (some condition), then swap n and m. Because adding and subtracting like that is a way to swap variables without a temp. So the condition must be whether m is less than n. Because if m is smaller than n, then swapping would make n and m such that m becomes the larger one. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nSuppose original n and m. After doing n += m, m = n - m (which is original n + m - m = original n), then n = n - m (original n + m - original n) = m. So the code swaps n and m. So the condition is whether to swap them. The idea is probably that the formula works when m is the larger dimension, so if m is smaller than n, swap them so that m becomes the larger one. \n\nWait, the formula after swapping would be (new n) + (new n) + (new m) -2. Let me see. Let's suppose that the correct formula is 2*max(n,m) + min(n,m) - 2. Because if we have n and m, then after swapping to make m the larger, then the formula would be 2*m + n -2. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose original n and m. Let's say m is the larger. Then the formula would be n + n + m -2 \u2192 2n + m -2? Or wait, no. Wait, after swapping, if m was originally larger, then the code would not swap. So the formula would be n (original n) + n + m -2. Wait, maybe I need to think of the formula as 2*min(n,m) + max(n,m) - 2? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's take the first example from the note. The problem's first test case must be the example given. Let's see the note's example: they mention the cells (7,3), so perhaps n is 7 and m is 5? Because Megan's starting is (n,1) which would be (7,1), and her destination is (1,5). Stanley's destination is (7,5). The total energy in the example is 15. Let's plug into the formula.\n\nIf n=7, m=5. Then the code would check if m < n (5 <7 \u2192 yes). So it would swap them, making n=5 and m=7. Then the formula is 5 +5 +7 -2 \u2192 5+5 is 10, plus7 is 17, minus 2 \u2192 15. Which matches the example. So that works. So the condition is when m < n, we swap them so that m becomes the larger. Wait, no, the code's condition is \"if (/* condition */)\" then swap. So the condition should be if m < n, then swap so that m becomes the larger. Because in the example, m was 5, n was7. So m <n \u2192 swap, so after swapping, n becomes5, m becomes7. Then the formula gives 5+5+7-2 =15. So the condition is when m <n \u2192 swap. So the code's condition should be (m <n). \n\nWait, the code's line after the if is: if (condition) then swap n and m. So the condition should be (m <n). Because when m is smaller than n, we swap so that m becomes the larger. So the code's TODO should be \"m < n\".\n\nWait, but let me think of another case. Suppose n=1 and m=5. Then since m is larger, no swap. The formula would be 1+1 +5 -2 \u2192 5. Let's see what the minimal energy would be here. \n\nStanley starts at (1,1) to (1,5). His path is moving right 4 steps, so 4 energy. Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, so lower-left is (1,1)), but Megan's destination is (1,5) as well? Wait no, Megan's destination is (1,m) which is (1,5). Wait, Megan's start is (n,1) which is (1,1), and destination is (1, m) which is (1,5). So Megan's path is same as Stanley's. But they have to split up. Wait, but in this case, since they are both going to the same point, but starting from same point? Wait, no, Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1), same as Stanley's start. So they can't split. Wait, but the problem says they split up. Hmm, maybe in this case, the minimal path would be Stanley's path is 4, Megan's path is 0? Because she starts and ends at same point? Wait no, Megan's start and end are same? Wait no, Megan's start is (n,1) which is (1,1), and destination is (1, m) which is (1,5). So same as Stanley. So both need to go from (1,1) to (1,5). So their paths are same. So the total energy would be 4 (each) but using portals?\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the minimal total is 4 (Stanley's path) plus Megan's path. But since Megan can use portals. Let me think. Megan can move first, leaving portals. For example, Megan can go to (1,5) directly, using 4 steps. Then Stanley can use her portals. Wait, but Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). So she leaves portals along the way. So when Stanley starts, he can use the portal at (1,5) to teleport there with 1 energy. So his total would be 1. Megan's path is 4. So total is 5, which matches the formula's result of 1+1+5-2 \u2192 5. So that works. \n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3. Then since m equals n, no swap. The formula would be 3+3 +3 -2 \u2192 7. Let's see. The minimal total energy. \n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (3,3). Megan from (3,1) to (1,3). \n\nPossible paths: \n\nMegan could go to (1,1) first, but that's Stanley's start. Alternatively, they can use portals. Let's see. \n\nSuppose Megan moves to (1,1), then Stanley can teleport there. But maybe a better path. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total would be 7. Let me think. \n\nStanley's minimal path without portals is 4 steps (right, right, down, down). Megan's path is also 4 steps (up, up, right, right). But with portals, perhaps they can do better. \n\nSuppose Megan goes to (1,1) first. Then she can leave a portal there. Then Stanley can teleport there (but he's already there). Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they meet somewhere. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, the formula gives 3+3+3-2 =7. Let's see: \n\nStanley's path: he can go to (1,3) via moving right twice (cost 2), then use Megan's portal (if she has one there) to jump to her other portals. Wait, perhaps the optimal path is that Megan's path creates portals along a path that allows both to save steps. \n\nAlternatively, the formula's result is 7. Let's see: \n\nSuppose Megan's path is from (3,1) to (1,3). The minimal steps without portals would be 4 (up twice, right twice). But with portals, maybe she can do something else. \n\nAlternatively, the total energy is 7. So the formula works here. \n\nSo the condition is indeed to swap n and m when m <n, so that m becomes the larger. So the code's condition should be (m <n). \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO is \"m < n\".\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif(m < n) then swap n and m. \n\nThus, the code's TODO part is \"m < n\"."
