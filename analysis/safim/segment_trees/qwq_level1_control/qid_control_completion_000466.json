    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this Java code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. \n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The goal is to minimize the days required to ensure Keshi reaches city n.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be using a priority queue and some Dijkstra-like approach. Let me look at the code structure. \n\nThe code initializes an array dis to track distances, and adj is an adjacency list. The edges are stored in reverse (since adj[b].add(a)), which might be for topological sorting or something. The degree array is tracking the out-degree of each node? Wait, because when a road from a to b is added, they add it to adj[b], and increment degree[a]. So degree[a] is the original out-degree of node a. \n\nThe priority queue starts with node n (the destination) with cost 0. Then, it processes nodes, and for each neighbor p of the current node (which is in the reversed adjacency list), it adds p to the queue with cost temp.cost + degree[p]. Wait, but why degree[p]? \n\nLet me think about the algorithm here. The approach might be modeling the problem in reverse. Since we want the minimal days, perhaps the dis array represents the minimal required days from the destination back to the start. \n\nThe idea might be that for each node, the required days to reach the end is based on the maximum of the paths from its neighbors, plus some value. Since when Keshi is at a node, if he moves, he can choose any outgoing edge (that's not blocked). AmShZ wants to block roads in such a way to minimize the days. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a problem that can be modeled using the concept of the longest path in a DAG, but since the graph might have cycles, we need another approach. \n\nWait, the code is using a priority queue, which suggests Dijkstra's algorithm. The nodes are processed in order of increasing cost. The dis array is initialized to -1, and when a node is popped from the queue, if dis[temp.n] is already set, we skip. So the condition in the TODO is probably checking if dis[temp.n] is not -1, meaning we've already processed this node. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is: if (dis[temp.n] != -1) continue; \n\nWait, let me see. The code starts with node n (dis[n] is set to 0). Then, when processing node n, it looks at all its predecessors (since adj is built in reverse). For each p in adj[temp.n], which are the nodes that have edges pointing to temp.n (since adj[b] has a when a->b is an edge). \n\nThe cost for p is temp.cost + degree[p]. The degree[p] here is the original out-degree of p. \n\nHmm, why adding the degree[p]? Let me think. \n\nSuppose when Keshi is at node p, he can choose any outgoing edge (not blocked). The optimal strategy for AmShZ is to block all but one path each day, so that Keshi is forced to take the path that leads to the destination as quickly as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the cost for a node is the minimal days required from that node to reach n. The way the code is structured, the cost for p is the cost of the next node (temp, which is a neighbor of p in the reversed graph, meaning p has an edge to temp) plus the degree of p. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is that for each node u, the required days is 1 plus the maximum of the days required for all its neighbors, but since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, they can force Keshi to take the path with the minimal required days. Wait, perhaps it's the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: For each node u, the minimal days required to reach n is the maximum over all possible paths from u to n of the minimal steps needed. But since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, they can control the path Keshi takes. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to finding the longest path in some transformed graph. Because each time Keshi moves, he can choose any outgoing edge, but AmShZ can block edges to control the path. The worst-case scenario (which we need to account for to guarantee the meeting) would be the path that takes the longest possible time. \n\nWait, the problem requires that they can ensure to meet in at most d days, so we need to find the minimal d such that no matter how the roads are blocked (but optimally chosen by AmShZ), Keshi will reach n in d days. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach here is to model the problem as each node's required days is 1 plus the maximum of the required days of its neighbors. But since AmShZ can choose which edges to block, they can choose the path with the minimal required days. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the cost for a node u is the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. Let me think of the process: \n\nEach day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The strategy must ensure that after d days, Keshi is at n. \n\nThe key is that when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, Keshi will choose any outgoing edge (not blocked) and move to a reachable city. But since AmShZ knows Keshi's current location, they can block roads in a way to minimize the days. \n\nThe problem requires the minimal d such that regardless of Keshi's choices (when moving), they can ensure arrival in d days. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal strategy is to model this as for each node u, the required days is the maximum between the days required for each possible next step. Because AmShZ has to account for the worst case (i.e., Keshi might take the path that takes the longest time). \n\nWait, but since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, they can control the available paths. So perhaps the required days for a node u is 1 plus the minimal required days among all its neighbors. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except the one leading to the neighbor with the minimal required days. \n\nWait, but how does blocking work? Let me think step by step. \n\nSuppose Keshi is at u. AmShZ can choose to either block a road (so Keshi stays) or tell him to move. \n\nThe optimal strategy for AmShZ is to minimize the days. So when they tell Keshi to move, they want him to go to the neighbor with the minimal required days. But since Keshi chooses randomly, but AmShZ can block all other roads except that one. \n\nWait, but the problem says that when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, Keshi will choose uniformly at random among the reachable cities (those with outgoing edges not blocked). But since AmShZ can choose which roads to block each day, they can control which edges are available. \n\nTherefore, the strategy is: \n\nEach day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road (so Keshi stays) or let him move. To minimize the days, they would want to let Keshi move towards the path that leads to the destination as quickly as possible. \n\nThe key is that for each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u is the minimal number of days such that, considering the best possible path (i.e., the path that takes the least days when AmShZ optimally blocks roads). \n\nAlternatively, the required days for node u is the minimal number of days such that, for each outgoing edge from u to v, the required days for v plus 1 (for the day when Keshi moves) is considered, but since AmShZ can choose which edge to leave open, they can choose the minimal among those. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is: \n\nd(u) = 1 + min{d(v)} for all edges u->v. \n\nBut then, since each move takes a day, and blocking roads can be done in a way to choose the best path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the required days for u is the maximum over all possible paths, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe minimal days required to reach n from u is the minimal number of days such that, for each possible path from u to n, the days required along that path is accounted for, and AmShZ can choose the path with the least days. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a shortest path problem where the cost from u is 1 plus the minimal cost of its neighbors. \n\nWait, let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the first sample input, suppose the graph is such that from 1, there's only one path to n. Then the required days would be the length of that path. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the code provided. The code is using a priority queue and for each node, when processing it, it adds its predecessors (since the adjacency list is reversed). The cost for each predecessor is the current node's cost plus the degree of the predecessor. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to process nodes in reverse, starting from n. The dis array is storing the minimal days required. \n\nThe formula used here is that for each predecessor p of the current node (temp.n), the cost for p is temp.cost (the cost of the current node) plus the degree of p. \n\nHmm, why degree[p]? \n\nMaybe the idea is that when you are at node p, you have degree[p] outgoing edges. To force Keshi to take the path leading to the current node (temp.n), AmShZ needs to block all other edges except one. Each blocking takes a day. So the number of days required would be the number of edges to block (degree[p] - 1) plus the day when Keshi moves. \n\nWait, perhaps the cost for p is the cost of the next node (temp) plus the number of edges that need to be blocked. \n\nWait, let's think of it this way: \n\nSuppose you are at node p. To get to the next node (temp.n), which has a cost of temp.cost, you need to first block all other outgoing edges except the one leading to temp.n. Each blocked edge takes a day (since each day you can block one road). So the number of days needed to block (degree[p] - 1) edges, then on the next day, tell Keshi to move. \n\nSo total days would be (degree[p] - 1) + 1 (the move day) + temp.cost. \n\nWait, that would be (degree[p] -1 +1) = degree[p], plus temp.cost. \n\nAh! So the cost for p is temp.cost + degree[p]. \n\nThat makes sense. Because for each predecessor p of the current node (temp.n), the minimal days to reach n from p is the days needed to reach temp.n from p (which requires blocking all other edges except the one to temp.n, which takes (degree[p] -1) days, then one day to move, so total degree[p] days) plus the days needed from temp.n. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code is using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the minimal days required from each node to n, by processing nodes in reverse. \n\nThe missing part in the code is the condition to check if the node has already been processed. \n\nIn the while loop: \n\nwhile (!pq.isEmpty()) {\n    Node temp = pq.poll();\n    if (dis[temp.n] != -1) continue; // because once we set dis[temp.n], we don't process it again\n    dis[temp.n] = temp.cost;\n    for (int p : adj[temp.n]) { // adj[temp.n] contains all nodes p where there is an edge p -> temp.n\n        pq.offer(new Node(p, temp.cost + degree[p]));\n        --degree[p]; // Wait, why decrement degree[p] here?\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, after adding p to the queue, they decrement degree[p]. That's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, the degree array was initially the out-degree of each node. But in the code, when processing a predecessor p of temp.n (which is a node that has an edge to temp.n), they are decrementing the degree[p]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the degree array here is being used to track the remaining outgoing edges that haven't been considered yet. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to model the number of edges that can be blocked. Wait, perhaps the degree[p] is the number of outgoing edges from p that are still available. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a modified Dijkstra's approach where each time an edge is considered, the degree is decremented. But I'm not sure why that's done here. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but the problem is to fill in the missing part. The missing part is the condition in the TODO. \n\nThe code's dis array is initialized to -1. So when we poll a node from the priority queue, if dis[temp.n] is not -1, that means it was already processed, so we skip. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\nif (dis[temp.n] != -1) continue;\n\nSo that's the condition. \n\nThe rest of the code seems to be handling the processing. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nif (dis[temp.n] != -1) continue;\n\nSo the answer is that line."
