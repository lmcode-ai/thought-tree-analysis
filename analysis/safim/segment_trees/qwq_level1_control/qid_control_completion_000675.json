Hmm, the code provided has a loop that runs from i=1 to n-2, and inside that loop, there's a condition that sets flag to false if something is not met. The final output is YES or NO based on the flag. So I need to figure out what condition to put there. Wait, maybe I should think about the problem's requirements. Let's think about the operations. Each operation of type 1 adds 1 to all odd indices. Type 2 adds 1 to even indices. Each can be done any number of times. The key is to see if after some operations, all elements become even or all odd. Let's think in terms of parity. Since adding 1 changes parity, each operation toggles the parity of certain elements. Let me consider the parity of each element. Let's denote the initial parities of the first two elements.",

So this approach would work. So the condition in the loop would be:\n\nif ( (val[i]%2) ! = (val[i+2]%2) ) \u2192 then flag = false. Thus, the missing code in the loop's condition is:\n\nval[i]%2 ! = val[i+2]%2 So the code's loop is checking that every pair of elements two apart have the same parity. This ensures that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity. Because:\n\n- For odd indices (i=1,3,5...), the loop checks val[1] and val[3], then val[3] and val[5], etc. So all must be same.\n\n- For even indices (i=2,4,6...), the loop checks val[2] and val[4], etc. Thus, the condition is correct. Therefore, the missing code in the loop's if statement is:\n\nval[i]%2 ! = val[i+2]%2 So the code would be:\n\nfor(long long i=1;i<=n-2;i++) if( val[i]%2 != val[i+2]%2 )\n        flag=false;\n\nThis way, if any two elements two apart have different parity, flag is set to false. Thus, the final code would check that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity. Therefore, the missing code is the condition val[i]%2 ! = val[i+2]%2.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code for the given problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to determine if, after any number of operations (adding 1 to all odd indices or even indices), the array can have all elements with the same parity (all even or all odd).\n\nHmm, the code provided has a loop that runs from i=1 to n-2, and inside that loop, there's a condition that sets flag to false if something is not met. The final output is YES or NO based on the flag. So I need to figure out what condition to put there.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem's requirements. Let's think about the operations. Each operation of type 1 adds 1 to all odd indices. Type 2 adds 1 to even indices. Each can be done any number of times. \n\nThe key is to see if after some operations, all elements become even or all odd. Let's think in terms of parity. Since adding 1 changes parity, each operation toggles the parity of certain elements. \n\nLet me consider the parity of each element. Let's denote the initial parities of the first two elements. Because each operation affects either all odds or evens, the difference between the parities of elements at odd and even positions might be important.\n\nWait, maybe the parity of the elements can be adjusted by the number of times each operation is applied. Let's think of each element's parity as a variable that can be adjusted by the operations. \n\nSuppose we have variables x (number of type 1 operations) and y (number of type 2 operations). Each element's parity after x and y operations depends on their position. For an element at position i (1-based), the number of times it's incremented is:\n\n- If i is odd: x times (since each type 1 adds 1, so x increments)\n- If even: y times (each type 2 adds 1, so y increments)\n\nThe total added to the element is x (if odd) or y (if even). The parity of the element's value after operations is (original_parity + added) mod 2. \n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's say we want all to be even. Then for each element, (a_i + added) mod 2 must be 0. Alternatively, if all are odd, then mod 2 must be 1. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between the added counts for odd and even positions must satisfy certain conditions. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me consider two cases: all even or all odd. Let's see for each case.\n\nCase 1: All elements even.\n\nFor each element at position i (odd or even):\n\nIf i is odd: (a_i + x) mod 2 == 0 \u2192 (a_i mod 2) + x mod 2 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 (-a_i mod 2) mod 2.\n\nSimilarly for even positions: (a_j + y) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 y \u2261 (-a_j mod 2) mod 2.\n\nSo for all odd positions, x must be congruent to (1 - a_i%2) mod 2. Wait, no, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, (a_i + x) mod 2 =0 \u2192 (a_i mod2 + x mod2) mod2 =0 \u2192 x mod2 = ( - a_i mod2 ) mod2 \u2192 which is equivalent to ( (2 - a_i mod2) mod2 ). \n\nBut for all odd positions, the required x mod2 must be the same. Because all odd positions must have the same condition. Similarly, for even positions, all even positions must have the same required y mod2.\n\nWait, for example, take two odd positions i and j. The required x mod2 must be the same for both. Otherwise, there's no solution. So for all odd elements, their (a_i mod2) must have the same required x mod2. Similarly for even elements.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's suppose for all odd positions, the required x mod2 must be the same. Let's say for the first odd element, the required x mod2 is ( (0 - a_i mod2) ) mod2. Wait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\nSuppose for all odd indices, (a_i + x) mod2 must be equal to the desired parity (say 0 for even). So for each odd index, x mod2 must be equal to (desired_parity - a_i mod2) mod2. \n\nBut since all odd indices must have the same x mod2, the (desired_parity - a_i mod2) mod2 must be the same for all odd indices. Similarly for even indices and y mod2.\n\nSo for the case where all elements are even (desired_parity is 0):\n\nFor all odd indices i: (0 - a_i%2) mod2 must be the same for all i odd. Let's call this value x_mod.\n\nSimilarly, for all even indices j: (0 - a_j%2) mod2 must be the same for all even j. Let's call this y_mod.\n\nThen, the x and y must satisfy x \u2261 x_mod mod2 and y \u2261 y_mod mod2. \n\nBut since x and y can be any non-negative integers, as long as their mod2 is correct, it's possible. So the conditions are that for all odd indices, the required x_mod is the same, and for all even indices, the required y_mod is the same. \n\nSimilarly, for the case where all elements are odd (desired_parity is 1):\n\nFor all odd indices i: (1 - a_i%2) mod2 must be the same for all i odd \u2192 x_mod'.\n\nFor even indices j: (1 - a_j%2) mod2 must be the same for all even j \u2192 y_mod'.\n\nIf either of these two cases (all even or all odd) can be satisfied, then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether either of the two cases (all even or all odd) is possible. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck if either of the following is true:\n\n1. All odd indices can be adjusted to have the same x mod2, and all even indices can have the same y mod2 for desired_parity 0 (even).\n\nOR\n\n2. All odd indices can be adjusted to have the same x mod2, and all even indices can have the same y mod2 for desired_parity 1 (odd).\n\nIf either is possible, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the steps for each test case:\n\nFirst, compute the parities of all elements. Let's store a_i %2 for each element.\n\nThen, for the two cases (desired_parity 0 and 1), check if the conditions are met.\n\nLet me see for desired_parity = 0 (all even):\n\nFor all odd indices (positions 1,3,5 etc.), the required x mod2 must be (0 - a_i%2) mod2. Let's call this required_x. All these must be the same. So check if all the (0 - a_i%2) mod2 for odd indices are the same. Similarly for even indices, required_y must be (0 - a_j%2) mod2 for even indices, and all must be same.\n\nIf both conditions are true, then possible for desired_parity 0.\n\nSimilarly for desired_parity 1:\n\nFor odd indices, required_x is (1 - a_i%2) mod2. All must be same.\n\nFor even indices, required_y is (1 - a_j%2) mod2. All must be same.\n\nIf either of the two cases (0 or 1) is possible, then answer is YES.\n\nSo the code needs to check these conditions.\n\nNow, how to code this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead the array, compute the parities.\n\nThen check for both cases (desired_parity 0 and 1).\n\nIf either case is possible, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo in the code, perhaps the existing loop is not the right approach. The current code has a loop from i=1 to n-2, but that might not be the right way. The original code's loop is incomplete, so maybe the approach in the code is not correct, and I need to replace that part.\n\nWait, looking at the given code:\n\nThe code initializes flag as true, then loops from i=1 to n-2, and in each iteration, if some condition is true, sets flag to false. Then outputs YES if flag is true.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code's approach is incorrect, and the correct approach is to check the parity conditions as I thought.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to be rewritten. But the problem says to complete the code given, so perhaps the existing code's structure can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's current structure is not the right way, but the problem requires to fill in the missing part. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe code's main loop is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n, then read the array into val[1..n]\n\n   then loop for i from 1 to n-2:\n\n      if (some condition) \u2192 set flag to false.\n\n   then output YES/NO based on flag.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to check some condition between consecutive elements?\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that the difference between the parities of the first and second elements must be such that after some operations, they can be made same.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me think of the parity changes.\n\nEach operation of type 1 adds 1 to all odd indices. So each such operation toggles the parity of all odd indices. Similarly, type 2 toggles even indices.\n\nSuppose after x operations of type 1 and y of type 2, the parity of element i is:\n\noriginal_parity_i + x (if i is odd) + y (if even) mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's say that desired parity is P (0 or 1).\n\nSo for each element i:\n\n(original_parity_i + (x if i is odd else y)) mod2 = P.\n\nRearranged:\n\n(original_parity_i mod2) + (x if i is odd else y) mod2 = P mod2.\n\nLet me consider for all elements:\n\nFor an odd index i:\n\nx \u2261 (P - original_parity_i) mod2.\n\nFor even index j:\n\ny \u2261 (P - original_parity_j) mod2.\n\nSo for all odd indices, the required x mod2 must be the same. Similarly for even indices, the required y mod2 must be the same.\n\nTherefore, for a given P (0 or 1), the following must hold:\n\nAll odd indices must have (P - a_i%2) mod2 equal to the same value (x mod2).\n\nAll even indices must have (P - a_j%2) mod2 equal to the same value (y mod2).\n\nIf this is true for either P=0 or P=1, then it's possible.\n\nSo the code needs to check for both possibilities of P (0 and 1), and see if either is possible.\n\nTherefore, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute the parities of all elements (store in an array, say, parity[1..n]).\n\nCheck for P=0:\n\nCheck if all odd indices have (0 - parity[i]) mod2 the same. Let's call this x_required.\n\nCheck if all even indices have (0 - parity[j]) mod2 the same \u2192 y_required.\n\nIf both are true, then possible \u2192 return YES.\n\nElse, check for P=1:\n\nCheck if all odd indices have (1 - parity[i]) mod2 the same \u2192 x_required.\n\nCheck all even indices have (1 - parity[j]) mod2 the same \u2192 y_required.\n\nIf either case is true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this in the given code?\n\nThe current code's structure is using a flag and a loop from i=1 to n-2. That might not be the right approach, but perhaps the code can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to compute the required conditions for P=0 and P=1.\n\nWait, the current code's loop is from i=1 to n-2. Maybe the original code's approach is incorrect, and the correct way is to compute the parity conditions as above.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to be rewritten, but since the problem requires to fill in the missing part, perhaps the existing code's structure can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing condition in the loop is to check the parity differences between consecutive elements?\n\nHmm, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think of the parity differences between the first and second elements.\n\nSuppose after some operations, all elements have the same parity. Let's say that parity is P.\n\nThen, for the first element (odd index), its parity is (a1%2 + x) mod2 = P.\n\nSecond element (even index): (a2%2 + y) mod2 = P.\n\nSo, (a1%2 +x) \u2261 (a2%2 + y) mod2 \u2192 (x - y) \u2261 (a2%2 - a1%2) mod2.\n\nBut also, for other elements, similar conditions must hold.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each operation of type 1 adds 1 to all odds, and type 2 to evens, the difference between the parity of the first and second elements can be adjusted.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the difference between the parities of the first and second elements must be such that after some operations, they can be made equal, and this difference must be consistent for all elements.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the first element and second element must satisfy a certain condition.\n\nWait, let me think of the parity of the first and second elements after x and y operations.\n\nThe first element (odd) has parity (a1%2 +x) mod2.\n\nSecond (even) has (a2%2 + y) mod2.\n\nWe want these to be equal. So:\n\n(a1%2 +x) \u2261 (a2%2 + y) mod2 \u2192 x - y \u2261 (a2%2 - a1%2) mod2.\n\nBut also, for the third element (odd), its parity is (a3%2 +x) mod2. This must equal the same P as the first and second.\n\nSo (a3%2 +x) \u2261 (a1%2 +x) mod2 \u2192 a3%2 \u2261 a1%2 mod2. Wait, that would require that a3 and a1 have the same parity. But that's not necessarily true. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the earlier idea, perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute the parities of all elements.\n\nCheck for P=0:\n\nCheck all odd indices have (0 - parity[i]) mod2 equal to the first odd's required value.\n\nSimilarly for even indices.\n\nIf both are true, then possible.\n\nElse check for P=1.\n\nIf either is true, output YES.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nSo in code, perhaps:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nCompute the parities.\n\nThen check for P=0:\n\nbool possible0 = true;\n\nint req_x0 = (0 - parity[1]) %2; // first odd index (1)\n\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; i+=2) { // all odd indices\n\n    if ( ( (0 - parity[i]) %2 ) != req_x0 ) {\n\n        possible0 = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (possible0) {\n\n    // check even indices\n\n    int req_y0 = (0 - parity[2])%2; // first even index (2)\n\n    for (int j=2; j<=n; j+=2) {\n\n        if ( ( (0 - parity[j])%2 ) != req_y0 ) {\n\n            possible0 = false;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for P=1:\n\nbool possible1 = true;\n\nint req_x1 = (1 - parity[1])%2;\n\nfor (odd indices) check same.\n\nThen check even indices similarly.\n\nIf possible0 || possible1 \u2192 output YES.\n\nElse NO.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nBut the given code's structure is different. The current code has a loop from i=1 to n-2, and in each iteration, checks some condition. The flag is set to false if any condition is met. So perhaps the code's approach is not correct, and the correct way is to compute the above conditions.\n\nTherefore, the code provided is not following the correct approach, so the missing part in the loop is not the right way. Therefore, perhaps the code needs to be rewritten, but the problem requires to fill in the missing part in the existing code.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code's approach is to check that the difference between consecutive elements is even? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be simplified by noting that the parity of the first and second elements must have a certain relationship.\n\nWait, let me think of the parity of the first and second elements. Let me denote:\n\nAfter x operations of type 1 and y of type 2:\n\nparity of first (odd) is (a1%2 +x) mod2.\n\nparity of second (even) is (a2%2 + y) mod2.\n\nWe want these to be equal. So:\n\n(a1%2 +x) \u2261 (a2%2 + y) mod2 \u2192 x - y \u2261 (a2%2 - a1%2) mod2.\n\nBut also, for the third element (odd), its parity is (a3%2 +x) mod2. This must equal the same parity as first and second. So:\n\n(a3%2 +x) \u2261 (a1%2 +x) mod2 \u2192 a3%2 \u2261 a1%2 mod2.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So for all odd indices, their original parity must be the same modulo 2. Because the x is added to all of them, so their parity difference must be 0 mod2. Because (a_i%2 +x) mod2 must be same for all odd indices. So (a_i%2 - a_j%2) mod2 must be 0 for any two odd indices i,j. So all odd elements must have the same parity.\n\nSimilarly, all even elements must have the same parity. Because for even indices, their parity after y is (a_j%2 + y) mod2. So for any two even indices, their original parity must be same mod2. Because (a_j%2 - a_k%2) mod2 must be 0.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight! Because the x and y can be chosen freely, but the parity of the odd elements must all be the same after adding x. Since x is the same for all odd indices, the original parities of the odd elements must be the same. Otherwise, adding x can't make them all have the same parity. For example, if two odd indices have different parities, then adding x will make their parities differ by (a_i%2 - a_j%2) mod2, which is 1. So they can't be the same.\n\nSimilarly for even indices: all even elements must have the same parity.\n\nWait, this is a necessary condition. Because if the original parities of the odd indices are not all the same, then no matter what x you choose, their parities after adding x will still differ. Because (a_i%2 +x) mod2 and (a_j%2 +x) mod2 will differ if a_i%2 != a_j%2.\n\nSo the first condition is that all odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but that's a necessary condition, but is it sufficient?\n\nSuppose all odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity. Then, can we choose x and y such that all become same parity?\n\nYes. Let me see:\n\nLet the parity of odd elements be p (0 or 1), and even elements be q (0 or 1).\n\nWe want to choose x and y such that:\n\n(p +x) mod2 == (q + y) mod2 \u2192 because all odds must have same parity as evens.\n\nAlso, the desired parity can be either (p +x) mod2 or (q + y) mod2, which must be same for all.\n\nWait, the desired parity can be either even or odd. Let me see:\n\nWe can choose x and y such that (p +x) mod2 equals (q + y) mod2. Let's call this desired parity D.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that:\n\nx \u2261 (D - p) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (D - q) mod2.\n\nSo for any D (0 or 1), as long as the parities of odds and evens are uniform, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but what if the difference between the required x and y is possible?\n\nWait, since x and y can be any integers, their mod2 can be set freely. So for any D, we can choose x and y to satisfy the above equations. So the only condition is that the odds are all same parity and evens are all same parity. Then, it's possible to choose x and y to make all elements have same parity.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification! So the problem reduces to checking whether all odd-indexed elements have the same parity and all even-indexed elements have the same parity. If that's true, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nWait, let me test this with the examples given in the problem's notes.\n\nFirst test case example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the array is [1,2,1]. \n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have values 1 and 1 \u2192 both odd (parity 1). Even index (2) has 2 \u2192 even (parity 0). So odds are same, evens are same. So answer is YES. Which matches the note.\n\nSecond test case (output NO):\n\nSuppose the array has elements with varying parities in odds or evens. For example, if the array is [1,2,3], then the odd indices (1 and 3) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same. Even index (2) has 0. So it would be possible. Hmm, but the second test case's note says it's impossible. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the actual examples.\n\nWait the problem's note says for the second test case, after any operations, can't make all same parity. Let me think of an example where the condition is not met.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 3, 2]. \n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have parities 1 and 0 \u2192 different. So the condition (all odds same parity) is not met \u2192 answer is NO. Which would align with the note.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nAnother example from the note: third test case where all elements already have same parity. So odds and evens are same (since all same), so answer is YES.\n\nFourth test case: array like [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. The odds (positions 1,3,5) are even (parity 0), evens (2,4) are 0 (parity 0). So all odds and evens have same parity \u2192 possible. So answer is YES.\n\nSo the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to check whether all elements at odd indices have the same parity, and all elements at even indices have the same parity. If both are true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to check this.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code?\n\nThe given code has a loop from i=1 to n-2. Let me see:\n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n, then read the array into val[1..n]\n\n   flag is initialized to true.\n\n   for (i from 1 to n-2):\n\n      if (some condition) \u2192 set flag to false.\n\n   output YES/NO based on flag.\n\nHmm, perhaps the loop is intended to check the parity of consecutive elements, but that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the loop is checking the parity of the first element with others?\n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to check that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCheck for all odd indices (i from 1,3,5 etc.) that their parity matches the first odd's parity.\n\nSimilarly for even indices (starting from 2,4,6 etc.) that their parity matches the first even's parity.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nbool all_odds_same = true;\n\nint first_odd_parity = val[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != first_odd_parity) {\n\n        all_odds_same = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for evens:\n\nbool all_evens_same = true;\n\nif (n >=2) { // since n >=2 per input constraints.\n\n    int first_even_parity = val[2]%2;\n\n    for (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n        if (val[i]%2 != first_even_parity) {\n\n            all_evens_same = false;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n} else { // n is 1? but input says n >=2.\n\n    // but n is at least 2, so no need.\n\n}\n\nThen, if (all_odds_same && all_evens_same) \u2192 flag remains true, else flag is false.\n\nSo the code's current loop is not doing this. The existing code's loop is from i=1 to n-2, but perhaps the missing condition is to check the parity of the current element and the next?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be adjusted to use the above approach.\n\nBut given the problem's instruction to fill in the missing part in the existing code, perhaps the loop is intended to check the parity of the first and third elements, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is not the right approach, and the correct code should replace the loop with the above checks.\n\nBut since the problem requires to output only the missing code, perhaps the existing code's loop is not the right way, but the correct code would have to be written in the given structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking for the parity differences between consecutive elements. For example, the difference between a[i] and a[i+1] must be even?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem requires that after some operations, all elements have the same parity. So the difference between any two elements must be even, because if all are even or all odd, their differences are even.\n\nWait, but the operations can change the elements. So the initial differences don't matter. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the parity difference between elements can be adjusted via the operations. For example, adding 1 to all odds or evens can change the parities.\n\nWait, but the key condition is that all odds have same parity and evens have same parity. So the code needs to check that.\n\nSo the code's current structure is not correct, but the problem requires to fill in the missing part in the existing code. The existing code's loop is from i=1 to n-2, and in each iteration, it checks some condition. The flag is set to false if any condition is met. So perhaps the code is trying to check that the parity of the first element and the third element are the same, and similarly for even indices?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is intended to check that all elements except the last two have the same parity as the first, but that's not the right approach.\n\nHmm, given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the condition that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity. So the code needs to check that.\n\nIn the given code's structure, the loop from i=1 to n-2 is perhaps not the right way, but maybe the code can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nThe existing code has:\n\nfor (long long i=1; i<=n-2; i++)\n\n    if ( /* condition */ ) flag = false;\n\nPerhaps the condition is to check that the parity of the current element and the next element are the same? But that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check that all elements have the same parity as the first element, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and third elements are the same, and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is redundant and the correct condition is to check the parity of the first and second elements, and then all others must follow.\n\nWait, the key condition is that all odds have same parity and all evens have same parity. So the code can be written as:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nflag = true;\n\n// check all odds have same parity as first odd (val[1])\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[1]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check all evens have same parity as first even (val[2])\n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[2]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's structure, there is a loop from i=1 to n-2. So perhaps the code can be adjusted to use that loop to check the parity of the first and third elements, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is not the right approach, and the correct code would replace the loop with the above checks. But since the problem requires to fill in the missing part in the existing code, perhaps the code's loop is intended to check the parity of the first and third elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct code is to check that the parity of all odd indices are the same and all even indices are the same.

So perhaps the code can be adjusted to use that loop to check the parity of the first and third elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is not needed, and the missing condition is to check the parity of the first and second elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is intended to check that the difference between consecutive elements is even. For example, if the difference between a[i] and a[i+1] is even, then their parities are the same. But that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and third elements are the same, and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is redundant and the correct condition is to check that the first and second elements have the same parity, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the condition that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nflag = true;\n\n// Check all odd indices have same parity as first odd (val[1])\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[1]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Check all even indices have same parity as first even (val[2])\n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[2]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's structure, there is a loop from i=1 to n-2.

But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to replace the loop with the two for loops I mentioned earlier. But since the problem requires to fill in the missing part in the existing code, perhaps the code's loop is not the right approach, but the missing condition is to check that the parity of the first and third elements are the same, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and third elements are the same, and so on. For example, in the loop from i=1 to n-2, perhaps the condition is checking that val[i] and val[i+2] have the same parity. \n\nWait, let's think of the loop variable i as the current index. For each i from 1 to n-2, perhaps the code is checking that the parity of val[i] and val[i+2] are the same. Because for odd indices, the next odd is i+2. So for all odd indices, their parity must be the same as the first. So the loop could be checking that for each odd index i, the next odd index (i+2) has the same parity.\n\nSimilarly for even indices, but perhaps the loop is not handling that.\n\nAlternatively, the loop is from 1 to n-2, and for each i, it checks whether the parity of val[i] and val[i+1] are the same. But that's not the right condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is intended to check that all elements except the last two have the same parity as the first element, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the correct condition and see how to fit it into the existing code.\n\nThe correct condition is that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nflag = true;\n\n// Check all odd indices have same parity as first odd (val[1])\n\nfor (int i=3; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[1]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n// Check all even indices have same parity as first even (val[2])\n\nfor (int i=4; i<=n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (val[i]%2 != val[2]%2) {\n\n        flag = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the existing code has a loop from i=1 to n-2. So perhaps the code can be adjusted to use that loop to check the parity of the first and third elements, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is not needed, and the missing condition is to check the parity of the first and second elements. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's loop is not the right approach, and the correct code would replace the loop with the two for loops I mentioned. But since the problem requires to fill in the missing part in the existing code, perhaps the code's loop is intended to check the parity of the first and third elements, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and second elements are the same, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is checking that the parity of the first and third elements are the same, and so on. For example, in the loop from i=1 to n-2, perhaps the condition is checking that val[i] and val[i+2] have the same parity. \n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose the loop runs for i from 1 to n-2. For each i, check if val[i] and val[i+2] have the same parity. If not, set flag to false.\n\nThis would ensure that all odd indices (since i increments by 1 each time, but the step is 1) have the same parity as the next odd index. For example, i=1 checks val[1] and val[3], i=2 checks val[2] and val[4], etc. But the loop runs up to n-2, so for i= n-2, it checks val[n-2] and val[n].\n\nWait, but this would check that every pair of elements two apart have the same parity. That would ensure that all odd indices have the same parity (since they are spaced by 2), and similarly for even indices.\n\nWait, for example, for odd indices:\n\nval[1], val[3], val[5], etc. must all have the same parity. So checking that val[1] and val[3] have same parity, val[3] and val[5], etc. would ensure all are same.\n\nSimilarly for even indices: val[2], val[4], etc. must be same.\n\nBut the loop in the code is from i=1 to n-2. So for each i, it checks val[i] and val[i+2]. \n\nBut this would check for all pairs of elements two apart. For example, for i=1, check val[1] and val[3]. For i=2, check val[2] and val[4]. For i=3, check val[3] and val[5], etc. \n\nThis would ensure that all consecutive pairs in the odd indices are same, and similarly for even indices. Thus, all odd indices would have the same parity as the first, and all even indices same as the second.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nSo the condition in the loop would be:\n\nif ( (val[i]%2) != (val[i+2]%2) ) \u2192 then flag = false.\n\nThus, the missing code in the loop's condition is:\n\nval[i]%2 != val[i+2]%2\n\nSo the code's loop is checking that every pair of elements two apart have the same parity. This ensures that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nBecause:\n\n- For odd indices (i=1,3,5...), the loop checks val[1] and val[3], then val[3] and val[5], etc. So all must be same.\n\n- For even indices (i=2,4,6...), the loop checks val[2] and val[4], etc.\n\nThus, the condition is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the loop's if statement is:\n\nval[i]%2 != val[i+2]%2\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor(long long i=1;i<=n-2;i++)\n    if( val[i]%2 != val[i+2]%2 )\n        flag=false;\n\nThis way, if any two elements two apart have different parity, flag is set to false.\n\nThus, the final code would check that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the condition val[i]%2 != val[i+2]%2."
