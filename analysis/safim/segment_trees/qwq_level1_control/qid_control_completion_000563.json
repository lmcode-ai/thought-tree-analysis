The code given has some parts already. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it. So, the setup is that there are n+1 benches in a row. The distances between consecutive benches are given by the array a_i. The person starts with m energy. Each meter walked uses 1 energy. They can sit on benches to restore any amount of energy. The goal is to find the minimum total energy they need to restore to reach the end.",

Suppose the initial energy is m. Let's process each a_i step by step. Starting at bench 1, you have m energy. To walk the first a_1 meters, you need to have at least a_1 energy. If m >= a_1, then after walking, you have m - a_1 left. Then, you can sit on bench 2 to recharge, but maybe you don't need to if the next steps can be covered. Wait, but the minimal total energy added is the sum of all the times when you had to add energy. Wait, perhaps the minimal total is the sum of the deficits when you can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the minimal required is the maximum of (sum of a_i up to that point minus m) over each step. Because whenever the cumulative distance exceeds the initial m, you need to have added enough to cover that deficit. Wait, let me think of the example given. In the first test case example, maybe the input is like n=3, m=2, and a = [1,2,1]. The total distance is 4. The initial m is 2. The first step: walk 1, uses 1, remaining 1. Then you can sit on bench 2 and add 2, so total becomes 1 + 2 = 3. Then walk 2 meters, uses 2, leaving 1. Then sit on bench 3, add 1, making 2, then walk 1. The total added is 2 +1 =3. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is 3. Wait, but let's see another approach. Let's track the energy as we go. Start with m=2. First segment a1=1: energy after: 2-1=1. At bench 2, you can recharge. Let's say you recharge x. Then you have 1 +x. Next segment a2=2: need to have at least 2. So 1 +x -2 must be >=0?

Wait no, the recharging happens at the bench. So after arriving at bench 2, you can recharge. Ah! So the process is: \n\nStart at bench 1 with m energy. Walk to bench 2 (distance a1). After that, you are at bench 2, and can recharge. So the energy after arriving at bench 2 is (m - a1). Then, you can choose to add any amount (including zero) to your energy. Then, you must have enough to walk the next a2. So the energy after recharging must be >= a2. Wait, no. Because after recharging, you can have any amount. Wait, the next step is to walk a2. So before starting to walk a2, your energy must be >= a2. So after recharging at bench 2, your energy must be at least a2. Wait, that's the key. Ah! So the recharging can be done at each bench, but before proceeding to the next segment. So the steps are: At each bench i (starting from 1), you can choose to recharge. Wait, actually, the process is: \n\nStart at bench 1 with m energy. To go to bench 2, you must have enough energy to walk a1. After walking a1, you arrive at bench 2. At bench 2, you can recharge any amount (including zero). Then, to go to bench 3, you must have enough energy (after recharging) to walk a2. So the energy after recharging at bench 2 must be >= a2. Wait, no. The energy after recharging is (current energy after arriving at bench 2) plus the recharge. Wait, let me rephrase the steps: \n\n1. Start at bench 1 with m energy. 2. To walk to bench 2 (distance a1), you need to have at least a1 energy. So before starting, your energy is m. So m must be >= a1. After walking, energy is m - a1. 3. Arrive at bench 2. Here, you can recharge any amount (x1). So new energy is (m - a1) + x1. 4. Now, to walk to bench 3 (distance a2), you need to have at least a2 energy. So (m -a1 +x1) must be >= a2. After walking, energy is (m -a1 +x1) -a2. 5. Arrive at bench 3. Recharge x2. Energy becomes (m -a1 +x1 -a2) +x2. 6. And so on. The total added energy is x1 +x2 + ... +xn. We need to choose x1, x2, ... such that at each step, the energy before walking the next segment is sufficient. The goal is to minimize the sum of x_i. Hmm, so the problem is to choose the x_i's such that: \n\nAt each step i (from 1 to n), after arriving at bench i, the energy is (previous_energy - a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}), but wait, perhaps I need to track this step by step. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total x is the maximum deficit encountered along the path. Wait, let's think of it as a greedy approach. The idea is that whenever you arrive at a bench, you can choose to recharge just enough to cover the next steps.",

The initial energy is m. \n\nThe deficit at step i is (sum_{k=1 to i} a_k) - m. \n\nIf this deficit is positive, then you need to have added enough energy to cover it. The maximum of these deficits over all steps would be the minimal required. Wait, let's test this with the first example. First example: \n\nn=3, m=2 \n\na = [1,2,1]. sum after 1: 1 \u2192 deficit 1-2 = -1 \u2192 no. \n\nsum after 2: 3 \u2192 deficit 3-2 =1. sum after 3:4 \u2192 deficit 4-2=2. The maximum deficit is 2. So the minimal required would be 2. But the example's answer is 3. Hmm, so that approach is not correct. Hmm, so that approach gives 2, but the example requires 3. Hmm, so that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the deficit is calculated differently. Wait, perhaps the deficit is the cumulative a_i minus the current energy. Wait, let me think of the process step by step. Let me track the energy after each step and see where the required recharge is needed. Let me try the first example again. Test case 1: \n\nn=3, m=2 \n\na = [1,2,1]. We need to walk 3 segments. Start with m=2. Step 1: walk a1=1. Energy after: 2-1=1. At bench 2, can recharge. Suppose we recharge x1. Energy becomes 1 +x1. To proceed to a2=2, need 1+x1 >=2 \u2192 x1 >=1. After walking a2, energy is (1+x1) -2 = x1-1. At bench 3, recharge x2. Energy becomes (x1-1) +x2. To walk a3=1, need (x1-1 +x2) >=1 \u2192 x1 +x2 > =2. After walking, energy is (x1-1 +x2) -1 = x1 +x2 -2. Total added is x1 +x2. We need to minimize x1 +x2, with constraints: \n\nx1 > =1 \n\nx1 +x2 > =2 \n\nThe minimal is x1=1, x2=1 \u2192 total 2. But the example says 3. Hmm, so why the discrepancy? Ah! Wait, perhaps the problem requires that you can't have negative energy at any point. Wait, after walking a2, the energy is x1-1. But before recharging at bench 3, you can have negative energy? Wait, no. Because you are at bench 3, so you can recharge.",

But according to the first example, the sum is 4, m is 2 \u2192 exactRestore is 2. So the code would output 2, but the example's answer is 3. So the code is wrong. Hence, the problem requires a different approach. The code's current approach is to compute the total required energy (sum of a_i) minus m. If that's positive, that's the answer. But the example shows that this is incorrect. Hence, the code's approach is wrong. So the correct approach must be different. Hmm, so what's the correct approach? Let me think again. The problem requires that you can recharge at each bench. The minimal total added is the sum of all the times you had to add energy. The optimal strategy is to recharge just enough at each bench to cover the next segments. Wait, perhaps the minimal required is the maximum of (sum_{i=1 to k} a_i - m) for each k from 1 to n. \n\nWait let's see. In the first example, if the a array is [1,3,1], then the sum after 2 steps is 4, so 4-2=2. The maximum is 4 (sum after 3 steps is 5 \u2192 5-2=3). So the maximum is 3 \u2192 answer 3. Which matches the example. Ah! So perhaps the problem's first example has a different a array. So the correct approach is to compute the maximum of (current sum - m) over each step. If that maximum is negative, then 0. Else, that maximum is the answer. So the algorithm is: Initialize current_sum =0, max_deficit =0. For each a_i in the array: \n\ncurrent_sum += a_i if current_sum > m: \n\n   deficit = current_sum - m \n\n   if deficit > max_deficit: \n\n      max_deficit = deficit The answer is max_deficit. Wait, let's test this with the first example's a array [1,3,1], m=2. current_sum after first step:1 \u2192 1-2 =-1 \u2192 no. \n\nSecond step:4 \u21924-2=2 \u2192 max_deficit 2. Third step:5 \u21925-2=3 \u2192 max_deficit 3. Thus, answer is 3. Which matches the example. Another example: \n\nSuppose the first test case's a array is [1,2,1], m=2.",

So the problem's first example must have a different a array. Thus, the correct approach is to compute the maximum deficit. Hence, the code needs to be modified to track the current sum and the maximum deficit. Now, looking back at the given code: The code currently computes minFuelNeeded as the sum of all a_i. Then exactRestore is sum - m. But this is incorrect. The correct approach is to track the cumulative sum and the maximum deficit. So the code should be modified as follows: \n\nInside the loop for each test case: \n\nInitialize currentSum =0, maxDeficit=0. Then, for each a_i in the array: \n\ncurrentSum += a_i \n\nif currentSum > m: \n\n   deficit = currentSum - m \n\n   if deficit > maxDeficit: \n\n      maxDeficit = deficit \n\nAt the end, the answer is maxDeficit. Thus, the code should replace the current approach with this. Now, looking at the code provided: \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nfor(int i=0; i < sizeofArray; i++) \n\n   minFuelNeeded += arr[i]; \n\nexactRestore = minFuelNeeded - previousFuel; if ( ... ) \u2192 if (exactRestore <=0) \u2192 print 0 else print exactRestore. So the code is using the total sum minus m, which is wrong.",

But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. The problem is that the code's logic is incorrect. Hence, perhaps the correct code is to replace the entire block with the following: \n\nInside the test case loop: int n = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint m = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint [] a = new int[n]; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) a[i] = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint current = m; \n\nint ans =0; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n    if (current < a[i]) { \n\n        int needed = a[i] - current; \n\n        ans += needed; \n\n        current = a[i]; // after recharging needed \n\n    } \n\n    current -= a[i]; \n\n} \n\nSystem.out.println(ans); \n\nWait, this approach is different. Let me think: \n\nWe start with m energy. For each a_i: \n\nIf current energy is less than a_i, then we need to add (a_i - current) energy. Then, after adding, current becomes current + needed = a_i. Then subtract a_i \u2192 current becomes 0. Wait, but this way, after each step, the energy is 0. But maybe this is the minimal way. Let me test with the first example (assuming a array [1,3,1], m=2). Step 1: a_i=1. current is 2 >=1 \u2192 no need to add. current becomes 2-1=1. Step 2: a_i=3. current is 1 <3 \u2192 needed 2. \n\nans +=2 \u2192 ans=2. current becomes 3 \u2192 subtract 3 \u2192 0. Step3: a_i=1. current is 0 <1 \u2192 needed 1. \n\nans +=1 \u2192 total 3. current becomes 1 \u2192 subtract 1 \u21920. Thus, the answer is 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. Another example: a array [1,2,1], m=2. Step1: a=1 \u2192 current 2 \u2192 subtract \u21921. Step2: a=2 \u2192 current 1 <2 \u2192 needed 1 \u2192 ans=1. current becomes 2 \u2192 subtract \u21920. Step3: a=1 \u2192 current 0 <1 \u2192 needed 1 \u2192 ans=2. Thus, the answer is 2. \n\nWhich is correct. This approach seems to work. So the algorithm is: \n\nInitialize current energy to m. \n\nans =0. For each a_i in the array: \n\nif current < a_i: \n\n   needed = a_i - current \n\n   ans += needed \n\n   current += needed \n\ncurrent -= a_i Thus, the code would be: \n\nInside the test case loop: int n = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint m = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint [] a = new int[n]; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) a[i] = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint current = m; \n\nint ans =0; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n    if (current < a[i]) { \n\n        int needed = a[i] - current; \n\n        ans += needed; \n\n        current += needed; \n\n    } \n\n    current -= a[i]; \n\n} \n\nSystem.out.println(ans); \n\nThis would be the correct code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this Java program. The problem is about calculating the minimum energy to restore so that you can walk from bench 1 to n+1. \n\nThe code given has some parts already. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it. \n\nSo, the setup is that there are n+1 benches in a row. The distances between consecutive benches are given by the array a_i. The person starts with m energy. Each meter walked uses 1 energy. They can sit on benches to restore any amount of energy. The goal is to find the minimum total energy they need to restore to reach the end.\n\nHmm, the key here is that you can sit on benches along the way to recharge. So the strategy would be to recharge just enough at each bench to cover the next distance. Wait, but how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem says the minimum total energy to restore. So maybe the optimal way is to recharge whenever necessary so that after each recharge, you have enough energy to cover the next segments until the next bench where you can recharge again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal required is the maximum deficit that occurs as you walk each segment. Let me think. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the initial energy is m. Let's process each a_i step by step. \n\nStarting at bench 1, you have m energy. To walk the first a_1 meters, you need to have at least a_1 energy. If m >= a_1, then after walking, you have m - a_1 left. Then, you can sit on bench 2 to recharge, but maybe you don't need to if the next steps can be covered. \n\nWait, but the minimal total energy added is the sum of all the times when you had to add energy. Wait, perhaps the minimal total is the sum of the deficits when you can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal required is the maximum of (sum of a_i up to that point minus m) over each step. Because whenever the cumulative distance exceeds the initial m, you need to have added enough to cover that deficit. \n\nWait, let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the first test case example, maybe the input is like n=3, m=2, and a = [1,2,1]. The total distance is 4. The initial m is 2. \n\nThe first step: walk 1, uses 1, remaining 1. Then you can sit on bench 2 and add 2, so total becomes 1 + 2 = 3. Then walk 2 meters, uses 2, leaving 1. Then sit on bench 3, add 1, making 2, then walk 1. \n\nThe total added is 2 +1 =3. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is 3. \n\nWait, but let's see another approach. Let's track the energy as we go. \n\nStart with m=2. \n\nFirst segment a1=1: energy after: 2-1=1. \n\nAt bench 2, you can recharge. Let's say you recharge x. Then you have 1 +x. \n\nNext segment a2=2: need to have at least 2. So 1 +x -2 must be >=0? Or after walking, the energy can be anything as long as you have enough to walk. \n\nWait, the problem requires that you can't walk if you have no energy. So each step, the energy before walking the a_i must be at least a_i. \n\nWait, no. Wait, when you walk a distance of a_i, you need to have enough energy to cover that. So before starting to walk the a_i meters, your energy must be >= a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each meter takes 1 energy. So to walk a_i meters, you need to have at least a_i energy. So you can't start walking unless you have enough. \n\nTherefore, the process is: \n\nAt each step between bench i and i+1, you must have enough energy to cover a_i. \n\nSo the strategy is to choose when to recharge so that after each recharge, you have enough to cover the next segments until the next bench. \n\nThe minimal total added energy would be the sum of all the times when you had to add energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal required is the maximum deficit that occurs as you traverse each a_i. \n\nLet me think of the cumulative required. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nWe start with m energy. \n\nWe need to walk a1. So before that, energy is m. \n\nAfter walking a1, energy is m - a1. \n\nBut before walking a2, you can recharge on bench 2. \n\nWait, the recharging can be done at each bench. So after each step, you can choose to recharge. \n\nThe idea is that whenever you reach a bench, you can recharge as much as needed. So the optimal strategy is to recharge just enough at each bench to cover the next steps as far as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal required is the maximum of (sum of a_i from 1 to k) - m, for each k from 1 to n. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose that the total distance is sum(a_i). The minimal required is max(0, sum(a_i) - m). But that's not correct. Because in the first example, sum is 1+2+1=4. m is 2. 4-2=2, but the correct answer is 3. So that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so that approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, in the first example, the correct answer is 3. So why?\n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe first test case example's explanation says that the total added is 2 (on bench 2) plus 1 (on bench 3) totaling 3. \n\nSo the sum of the required additions is 3. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nStart with m=2. \n\nFirst segment a1=1: \n\nEnergy before: 2 >=1, so okay. After: 1. \n\nAt bench 2, you can recharge. Let's say you add x. \n\nThen, you need to walk a2=2. \n\nSo after recharging, energy is 1 +x. \n\nTo walk a2, you need 1+x >=2. So x >=1. \n\nAfter walking, energy is (1+x) -2 = x-1. \n\nThen, at bench 3, you can recharge again. Let's say add y. \n\nThen, you need to walk a3=1. \n\nSo after recharging, energy is (x-1) + y. \n\nThis must be >=1. \n\nSo (x-1 + y) >=1 \u2192 x + y >=2. \n\nThe total added is x + y. \n\nWe need to minimize x + y, with constraints: \n\nx >=1 (from first step), \n\nand x + y >=2. \n\nThe minimal x and y would be x=1, y=1 \u2192 total 2. But the example says 3. Wait, that's conflicting. \n\nWait the example's explanation says they added 2 on bench 2 and 1 on bench 3. So total 3. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my analysis is missing something. \n\nWait in the example's explanation: \n\nThey walked to bench 2 (using 1, left with 1). Then restored 2 units (so now 3). Then walked 2 (leaving 1). Then restored 1 (total 2), then walked 1. \n\nSo the total added is 2+1=3. \n\nBut according to my previous analysis, x=2 and y=1 gives total 3. \n\nWait, but why can't they choose x=1 and y=1? \n\nBecause after bench 2, they have 1 (original after first step) plus x=1 \u2192 2. Then walk 2, leaving 0. Then they can't walk the next segment. \n\nAh! Because after walking a2, the energy is (1 +x) -2. \n\nIf x=1, then after walking a2, energy is 0. \n\nThen, when they reach bench 3, they can recharge. But to walk a3, they need to have at least 1. \n\nSo after recharging y, the energy is 0 + y. \n\nSo they need y >=1. \n\nThus, the total x + y would be 1 +1 =2. \n\nBut in that case, the path would be possible. \n\nWait, but in that scenario, after bench 3, you have 0 + y =1, which allows you to walk the last 1. \n\nSo why does the example's explanation have a total of 3? \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's example. Let me check the problem's note again. \n\nThe first test case's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units on the second bench, walk to 3 (spending 2), restore 1, then go to 4. \n\nWait, that's adding 2 and 1, totaling 3. \n\nBut according to my analysis, there's a better way. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that you can only recharge at the benches. So after each step, you can choose to recharge. \n\nWait, in the scenario where x=1 and y=1, the steps would be: \n\nAfter bench 2, you have 1 (original after first step) +1 (recharge) =2. \n\nThen walk a2 (2 meters) \u2192 2-2=0. \n\nThen, at bench 3, you can recharge 1, making it 1. \n\nThen walk a3 (1 meter) \u2192 0 left. \n\nBut that's okay, because you just need to have enough to walk the distance. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. So when you start walking a segment, you must have enough energy. \n\nSo when you are at bench 3, you have 0 energy. You can recharge 1, so you have 1. Then you can walk the 1 meter. \n\nSo that works. So the total added would be 2 (1+1) but the example says 3. \n\nHmm, this discrepancy suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's example. \n\nWait maybe the example's first test case is different. Let me see. \n\nWait the problem's first example's note says that the first test case's answer is 3. So according to that, the minimal is 3. \n\nBut according to my analysis, there's a way to get 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate. \n\nWait in the scenario where x=1 and y=1: \n\nAfter bench 2, you have 1 (original after first step) plus x=1 \u2192 2. \n\nThen walk a2 (2 meters) \u2192 2-2 =0. \n\nThen, at bench 3, you can recharge y=1 \u2192 0 +1 =1. \n\nThen walk a3 (1 meter) \u2192 0. \n\nSo the total added is 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, so why is that? \n\nWait maybe the problem requires that you can't have zero energy after walking. Or perhaps the problem requires that you must have enough energy to walk the next segment before recharging. \n\nWait no, the recharging happens at the bench. So after arriving at bench 2, you can recharge before proceeding. \n\nWait the process is: \n\nStart at bench 1. \n\nWalk to bench 2 (using a1 meters). \n\nAt bench 2, you can recharge. \n\nThen walk to bench 3 (using a2). \n\nSo in the scenario where after bench 2, you have 2 energy (1 original after first step plus 1 recharge), then you can walk a2 (2 meters) which uses all 2, leaving 0. \n\nThen, at bench 3, you can recharge 1, so you have 1. \n\nThen walk a3 (1 meter) \u2192 0. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nSo the total added is 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case is different. Let me check the problem's example. \n\nWait the problem says in the first test case's note: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units on the second bench, walk to 3 (spending 2), restore 1 unit and go to 4. \n\nSo that's adding 2+1=3. \n\nBut according to my analysis, there's a better way. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that you can't have negative energy. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. So when you start walking a segment, you must have enough energy. \n\nIn the scenario where you have 0 energy after walking a2, that's okay because you are at bench 3. \n\nWait, but after walking a2, you are at bench 3. So you can recharge there. \n\nWait, the problem says you can restore energy by sitting on benches. So you can choose to sit on bench 3 and restore energy before proceeding. \n\nSo in that case, the scenario I described is valid, and the total added is 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem's input. \n\nWait maybe the first test case's a array is [1,3,1], not [1,2,1]. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you can't have negative energy at any point. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. So during the walk, you can't have negative. \n\nWait, the energy is spent as you walk. So when you start walking a segment of a_i meters, you must have at least a_i energy. \n\nSo in the scenario where you have 2 energy (after bench 2's recharge of 1), then walking a2 (2) is okay. \n\nAfter that, you have 0. \n\nThen, you can recharge at bench 3. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nHmm, so why does the example's first case require 3? \n\nWait maybe the example's first test case has a different input. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you must have at least some energy after each step. \n\nWait, the problem says you can restore any integer amount. So in the scenario where you have 0 after bench 2, you can choose to recharge 0, but then you can't walk the next segment. \n\nWait, no. Because after bench 2, you have 0 energy. To walk the next segment (a2=2), you need to have at least 2. \n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the walk from bench 2 to 3 is a2 meters. \n\nWait, the process is: \n\nAfter arriving at bench 2, you can recharge. \n\nSo after recharging, you have (previous energy after first step) + recharge. \n\nThen, you must have enough to walk a2. \n\nWait, the walk from bench 2 to 3 requires that before starting, you have enough energy. \n\nSo in the scenario where after bench 2, you have 2 (1 +1), then you can walk a2 (2). \n\nAfter that, you have 0. \n\nThen, at bench 3, you can recharge 1, so you have 1. \n\nThen walk a3 (1) \u2192 0. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nSo the total added is 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that you must have at least some energy after each step. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. So you can have zero after walking, but before walking the next segment, you can recharge. \n\nSo the example's explanation must be wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that you must have enough energy to walk the next segment before recharging. \n\nWait no, the recharging happens at the bench. So after arriving at bench 2, you can recharge. \n\nAh! So the process is: \n\nStart at bench 1 with m energy. \n\nWalk to bench 2 (distance a1). \n\nAfter that, you are at bench 2, and can recharge. \n\nSo the energy after arriving at bench 2 is (m - a1). \n\nThen, you can choose to add any amount (including zero) to your energy. \n\nThen, you must have enough to walk the next a2. \n\nSo the energy after recharging must be >= a2. \n\nWait, no. Because after recharging, you can have any amount. \n\nWait, the next step is to walk a2. So before starting to walk a2, your energy must be >= a2. \n\nSo after recharging at bench 2, your energy must be at least a2. \n\nWait, that's the key. \n\nAh! So the recharging can be done at each bench, but before proceeding to the next segment. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nAt each bench i (starting from 1), you can choose to recharge. \n\nWait, actually, the process is: \n\nStart at bench 1 with m energy. \n\nTo go to bench 2, you must have enough energy to walk a1. \n\nAfter walking a1, you arrive at bench 2. \n\nAt bench 2, you can recharge any amount (including zero). \n\nThen, to go to bench 3, you must have enough energy (after recharging) to walk a2. \n\nSo the energy after recharging at bench 2 must be >= a2. \n\nWait, no. The energy after recharging is (current energy after arriving at bench 2) plus the recharge. \n\nWait, let me rephrase the steps: \n\n1. Start at bench 1 with m energy. \n\n2. To walk to bench 2 (distance a1), you need to have at least a1 energy. \n\n   So before starting, your energy is m. \n\n   So m must be >= a1. \n\n   After walking, energy is m - a1. \n\n3. Arrive at bench 2. \n\n   Here, you can recharge any amount (x1). \n\n   So new energy is (m - a1) + x1. \n\n4. Now, to walk to bench 3 (distance a2), you need to have at least a2 energy. \n\n   So (m -a1 +x1) must be >= a2. \n\n   After walking, energy is (m -a1 +x1) -a2. \n\n5. Arrive at bench 3. Recharge x2. \n\n   Energy becomes (m -a1 +x1 -a2) +x2. \n\n6. And so on. \n\nThe total added energy is x1 +x2 + ... +xn. \n\nWe need to choose x1, x2, ... such that at each step, the energy before walking the next segment is sufficient. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of x_i. \n\nHmm, so the problem is to choose the x_i's such that: \n\nAt each step i (from 1 to n), after arriving at bench i, the energy is (previous_energy - a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}), but wait, perhaps I need to track this step by step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total x is the maximum deficit encountered along the path. \n\nWait, let's think of it as a greedy approach. \n\nThe idea is that whenever you arrive at a bench, you can choose to recharge just enough to cover the next steps. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal required is the maximum of (a1 + a2 + ... + a_i - m) for each i from 1 to n. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose that the total required energy up to step i is sum_{k=1 to i} a_k. \n\nThe initial energy is m. \n\nThe deficit at step i is (sum_{k=1 to i} a_k) - m. \n\nIf this deficit is positive, then you need to have added enough energy to cover it. \n\nThe maximum of these deficits over all steps would be the minimal required. \n\nWait, let's test this with the first example. \n\nFirst example: \n\nn=3, m=2 \n\na = [1,2,1]. \n\nsum after 1: 1 \u2192 deficit 1-2 = -1 \u2192 no. \n\nsum after 2: 3 \u2192 deficit 3-2 =1. \n\nsum after 3:4 \u2192 deficit 4-2=2. \n\nThe maximum deficit is 2. \n\nSo the minimal required would be 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, so that approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, so that approach gives 2, but the example requires 3. \n\nHmm, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the deficit is calculated differently. \n\nWait, perhaps the deficit is the cumulative a_i minus the current energy. \n\nWait, let me think of the process step by step. \n\nLet me track the energy after each step and see where the required recharge is needed. \n\nLet me try the first example again. \n\nTest case 1: \n\nn=3, m=2 \n\na = [1,2,1]. \n\nWe need to walk 3 segments. \n\nStart with m=2. \n\nStep 1: walk a1=1. \n\nEnergy after: 2-1=1. \n\nAt bench 2, can recharge. \n\nSuppose we recharge x1. \n\nEnergy becomes 1 +x1. \n\nTo proceed to a2=2, need 1+x1 >=2 \u2192 x1 >=1. \n\nAfter walking a2, energy is (1+x1) -2 = x1-1. \n\nAt bench 3, recharge x2. \n\nEnergy becomes (x1-1) +x2. \n\nTo walk a3=1, need (x1-1 +x2) >=1 \u2192 x1 +x2 >=2. \n\nAfter walking, energy is (x1-1 +x2) -1 = x1 +x2 -2. \n\nTotal added is x1 +x2. \n\nWe need to minimize x1 +x2, with constraints: \n\nx1 >=1 \n\nx1 +x2 >=2 \n\nThe minimal is x1=1, x2=1 \u2192 total 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, so why the discrepancy? \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem requires that you can't have negative energy at any point. \n\nWait, after walking a2, the energy is x1-1. \n\nBut before recharging at bench 3, you can have negative energy? \n\nWait, no. Because you are at bench 3, so you can recharge. \n\nThe energy before recharging is x1-1. \n\nBut you can choose to recharge any amount. \n\nSo even if it's negative, you can add enough to make it positive. \n\nSo the constraints are only that after recharging, you have enough to walk the next segment. \n\nSo in the scenario where x1=1 and x2=1, the energy after bench 3's recharge is (1-1) +1 =1, which is enough for a3. \n\nThus, the total added is 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait maybe the example's first test case is different. Let me see the problem's note again. \n\nThe first test case's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units, restore 1 unit and go to bench 4. \n\nSo in this scenario, the added is 2+1=3. \n\nBut according to my analysis, there's a better way. \n\nSo why is that? \n\nAh! Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's description. \n\nWait the problem says that the benches are numbered from 1 to n+1. So the distance between bench i and i+1 is a_i. \n\nSo for n=3, there are 4 benches. \n\nThe first segment is between 1 and 2 (a1), second between 2 and 3 (a2), third between 3 and 4 (a3). \n\nSo the total distance is a1+a2+a3. \n\nIn the example's scenario, the user chooses to add 2 at bench 2 and 1 at bench 3. \n\nTotal added is 3. \n\nBut according to my analysis, there's a way to do it with 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that you must have at least some energy after each step. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. \n\nBut after walking a segment, you can have zero energy. \n\nBecause you are at the next bench, and can recharge there. \n\nSo the only requirement is that before starting to walk a segment, you have enough energy. \n\nThus, the scenario with x1=1 and x2=1 is valid. \n\nSo why does the example's answer say 3? \n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's first example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the total added must be the sum of all the recharges, and in the example's scenario, the user added 2 and 1, but there's a better way. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example's first test case's answer is actually 2, but the problem's note is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem's constraints. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the minimum amount of energy you have to restore (by sitting on benches) to reach the bench n+1 from the bench 1\". \n\nSo the minimal possible. \n\nThus, according to my analysis, the correct answer should be 2, but the example says 3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nLet me think of another approach. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe minimal required is the maximum deficit encountered at any bench. \n\nWait, let's track the energy as we go, and see the minimal required. \n\nStart with m. \n\nAt each step, subtract a_i from current energy. \n\nIf the energy drops below zero, you need to add enough to cover the deficit. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to track the current energy, and whenever it becomes negative, you have to add enough to make it non-negative. \n\nWait, but you can choose when to add. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal required is the maximum of (sum_{i=1 to k} a_i - m) for all k from 1 to n. \n\nWait let's see. \n\nIn the first example: \n\nsum after 1:1 \u2192 1-2 =-1 \u2192 no. \n\nsum after 2:3 \u2192 3-2=1 \n\nsum after 3:4 \u21924-2=2 \n\nThe maximum is 2. \n\nSo the answer would be 2. \n\nBut the example says 3. \n\nHmm, so this approach would give 2, but the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the problem requires that the total added is the maximum deficit. \n\nBut the example contradicts that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the total added is the maximum deficit plus something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the example's input. \n\nWait maybe the first test case's a array is [1,3,1], making the sum after 2 steps 4, so the maximum deficit would be 4-2=2, but then the third step adds 1, so total 5-2=3. \n\nAh! That would make sense. \n\nWait let me recalculate with a different a array. \n\nSuppose the first test case's a array is [1,3,1]. \n\nThen sum after 1:1 \u2192 deficit -1 \n\nsum after 2:4 \u2192 deficit 2 \n\nsum after 3:5 \u2192 deficit 3 \n\nMaximum is 3 \u2192 so the answer would be 3. \n\nWhich matches the example's answer. \n\nAh! So perhaps I misread the example's a array. \n\nThe problem's first example's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case of the example, you can walk to the bench 2, spending 1 unit of energy, then restore 2 units on the second bench, walk to the bench 3, spending 2 units, restore 1 unit and go to bench 4. \n\nWait, the second segment is 2 units? \n\nWait the a array must be [1,2,1], but then the second segment is 2. \n\nWait the total distance would be 4. \n\nThe initial m is 2. \n\nThe maximum deficit would be 4-2=2. \n\nSo the answer should be 2. \n\nBut the example's answer is 3. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the energy can't go below zero at any point. \n\nWait, the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. \n\nBut after walking, you can have zero. \n\nWait, the problem says you can restore energy by sitting on benches. \n\nSo the only requirement is that before starting to walk a segment, you have enough energy. \n\nThus, the minimal required is the maximum deficit. \n\nBut the example's answer contradicts that. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the problem in terms of the code given. \n\nLooking at the code provided: \n\nThe code currently computes minFuelNeeded as the sum of all a_i. \n\nThen exactRestore is minFuelNeeded - previousFuel (which is m). \n\nThen, if (exactRestore <=0) \u2192 print 0 else print exactRestore. \n\nWait, that's the code's current approach. \n\nBut according to the first example, the sum is 4, m is 2 \u2192 exactRestore is 2. \n\nSo the code would output 2, but the example's answer is 3. \n\nSo the code is wrong. \n\nHence, the problem requires a different approach. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute the total required energy (sum of a_i) minus m. If that's positive, that's the answer. \n\nBut the example shows that this is incorrect. \n\nHence, the code's approach is wrong. \n\nSo the correct approach must be different. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach? \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that you can recharge at each bench. \n\nThe minimal total added is the sum of all the times you had to add energy. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to recharge just enough at each bench to cover the next segments. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required is the maximum of (sum_{i=1 to k} a_i - m) for each k from 1 to n. \n\nWait let's see. \n\nIn the first example, if the a array is [1,3,1], then the sum after 2 steps is 4, so 4-2=2. \n\nThe maximum is 4 (sum after 3 steps is 5 \u2192 5-2=3). \n\nSo the maximum is 3 \u2192 answer 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAh! So perhaps the problem's first example has a different a array. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the maximum of (current sum - m) over each step. \n\nIf that maximum is negative, then 0. \n\nElse, that maximum is the answer. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, max_deficit =0. \n\nFor each a_i in the array: \n\ncurrent_sum += a_i \n\nif current_sum > m: \n\n   deficit = current_sum - m \n\n   if deficit > max_deficit: \n\n      max_deficit = deficit \n\nThe answer is max_deficit. \n\nWait, let's test this with the first example's a array [1,3,1], m=2. \n\ncurrent_sum after first step:1 \u2192 1-2 =-1 \u2192 no. \n\nSecond step:4 \u21924-2=2 \u2192 max_deficit 2. \n\nThird step:5 \u21925-2=3 \u2192 max_deficit 3. \n\nThus, answer is 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose the first test case's a array is [1,2,1], m=2. \n\ncurrent_sum after 1:1 \u2192 deficit -1 \n\nafter 2:3 \u2192 deficit 1 \n\nafter 3:4 \u2192 deficit 2 \u2192 max is 2 \u2192 answer 2. \n\nWhich would be correct. \n\nSo the problem's first example must have a different a array. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute the maximum deficit. \n\nHence, the code needs to be modified to track the current sum and the maximum deficit. \n\nNow, looking back at the given code: \n\nThe code currently computes minFuelNeeded as the sum of all a_i. \n\nThen exactRestore is sum - m. \n\nBut this is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to track the cumulative sum and the maximum deficit. \n\nSo the code should be modified as follows: \n\nInside the loop for each test case: \n\nInitialize currentSum =0, maxDeficit=0. \n\nThen, for each a_i in the array: \n\ncurrentSum += a_i \n\nif currentSum > m: \n\n   deficit = currentSum - m \n\n   if deficit > maxDeficit: \n\n      maxDeficit = deficit \n\nAt the end, the answer is maxDeficit. \n\nThus, the code should replace the current approach with this. \n\nNow, looking at the code provided: \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nfor(int i=0; i < sizeofArray; i++) \n\n   minFuelNeeded += arr[i]; \n\nexactRestore = minFuelNeeded - previousFuel; \n\nif ( ... ) \u2192 if (exactRestore <=0) \u2192 print 0 else print exactRestore. \n\nSo the code is using the total sum minus m, which is wrong. \n\nHence, the correct code should replace this with the maximum deficit approach. \n\nSo the missing code in the problem's code is the condition for the if statement. \n\nWait, the code currently has: \n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */){ \n\n    System.out.println(0); \n\n} else { \n\n    System.out.println(exactRestore); \n\n} \n\nBut the exactRestore is sum - m. \n\nBut the correct condition is whether the maximum deficit is <=0. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are not tracking the maximum deficit. \n\nHence, the code needs to be rewritten. \n\nThe user's code is incorrect, so the correct code must be written. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code given has variables minFuelNeeded and exactRestore, which are sum and sum - m. \n\nThe code's current approach is wrong. \n\nHence, the correct code must replace the entire block. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\n\"Complete the code in java to solve this programming problem: \n\n... \n\nOutput only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nOutput the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. \n\nDo NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nSo the user wants us to fill in the missing parts. \n\nLooking at the code provided: \n\nThe code has variables minFuelNeeded and exactRestore. \n\nThe code computes minFuelNeeded as the sum of a_i. \n\nexactRestore is sum - m. \n\nThen, the if condition is missing. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\nif (exactRestore <=0) \u2192 print 0 else print exactRestore. \n\nBut this is wrong. \n\nHence, the correct condition is to compute the maximum deficit. \n\nBut the code currently doesn't track that. \n\nHence, the code must be modified to track the maximum deficit. \n\nBut the user's code has variables minFuelNeeded and exactRestore, which are not used correctly. \n\nHence, the code must be changed. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variables are not correct, but the user expects us to fill in the missing parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are minFuelNeeded and exactRestore, but the condition is wrong. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to compute the total required energy (sum) minus m. \n\nThe problem's first example's correct answer is 3, but with sum 4 and m 2, the code would output 2, which is wrong. \n\nHence, the code is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach requires changing the code to track the maximum deficit. \n\nHence, the code must be modified to compute the maximum deficit. \n\nBut the user's code currently has variables that are not tracking that. \n\nHence, the missing code is not just the condition, but the entire block. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nLooking back at the code provided: \n\nThe code has: \n\nfor(int j=1;j<=t;j++){ \n\n    int minFuelNeeded=0;

\n\n        ans += needed; \n\n        current = a[i]; // after recharging needed \n\n    } \n\n    current -= a[i]; \n\n} \n\nSystem.out.println(ans); \n\nWait, this approach is different. \n\nLet me think: \n\nWe start with m energy. \n\nFor each a_i: \n\nIf current energy is less than a_i, then we need to add (a_i - current) energy. \n\nThen, after adding, current becomes current + needed = a_i. \n\nThen subtract a_i \u2192 current becomes 0. \n\nWait, but this way, after each step, the energy is 0. \n\nBut maybe this is the minimal way. \n\nLet me test with the first example (assuming a array [1,3,1], m=2). \n\nStep 1: a_i=1. \n\ncurrent is 2 >=1 \u2192 no need to add. \n\ncurrent becomes 2-1=1. \n\nStep 2: a_i=3. \n\ncurrent is 1 <3 \u2192 needed 2. \n\nans +=2 \u2192 ans=2. \n\ncurrent becomes 3 \u2192 subtract 3 \u2192 0. \n\nStep3: a_i=1. \n\ncurrent is 0 <1 \u2192 needed 1. \n\nans +=1 \u2192 total 3. \n\ncurrent becomes 1 \u2192 subtract 1 \u21920. \n\nThus, the answer is 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother example: a array [1,2,1], m=2. \n\nStep1: a=1 \u2192 current 2 \u2192 subtract \u21921. \n\nStep2: a=2 \u2192 current 1 <2 \u2192 needed 1 \u2192 ans=1. \n\ncurrent becomes 2 \u2192 subtract \u21920. \n\nStep3: a=1 \u2192 current 0 <1 \u2192 needed 1 \u2192 ans=2. \n\nThus, the answer is 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThis approach seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nInitialize current energy to m. \n\nans =0. \n\nFor each a_i in the array: \n\nif current < a_i: \n\n   needed = a_i - current \n\n   ans += needed \n\n   current += needed \n\ncurrent -= a_i \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nInside the test case loop: \n\nint n = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint m = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint[] a = new int[n]; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) a[i] = scn.nextInt(); \n\nint current = m; \n\nint ans =0; \n\nfor (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n    if (current < a[i]) { \n\n        int needed = a[i] - current;

\n\nint ans =0; \n\nfor(int i=0; i < sizeofArray; i++){ \n\n    if(current < arr[i]){ \n\n        int needed = arr[i] - current; \n\n        ans += needed; \n\n        current += needed; \n\n    } \n\n    current -= arr[i]; \n\n} \n\nSystem.out.println(ans); \n\nThus, the missing code is this block. \n\nThe user's code currently has the for loop that sums the array and the if condition. \n\nHence, the missing code is the entire block from after the array is read, replacing the current code. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nHence, the correct answer is to replace the code after the array is read with the new code. \n\nThe user's code has: \n\nfor(int i=0;i<sizeofArray;i++){ \n\n    minFuelNeeded=minFuelNeeded+arr[i];
