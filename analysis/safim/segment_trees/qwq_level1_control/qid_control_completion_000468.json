So total is k + d[v]. Therefore, the minimal days for u is the minimal (k + d[v]) over all edges v. \n\nWait, but then for the second sample: Node 4 has one edge to n. So k=1, d[v] =0. So d[4] =1+0=1. Node 1 has two edges. Suppose one leads to 4 (d=1), and another to some node with d=0. Then the minimal would be min( (2+1), (2+0) ) \u2192 2. Which matches the sample's answer of 2. Ah! That makes sense. So the formula is d[u] = min over all edges u\u2192v of ( (number of edges from u) + d[v] ). Wait, but why is it the minimum? Because you can choose the path with the smallest (d[v] + k), so the minimal among all edges. Wait, but the number of edges from u is fixed. So it's (k + d[v]). So the minimal of that over all edges. Wait, but in the first sample, if there's only one edge from 1 to n, then d[1] =1 +0 =1, which matches the first sample's note. Yes, that seems correct. So the approach is to compute for each node u, the minimal (number of outgoing edges of u + d[v]) among all outgoing edges v. \n\nWait, but how do we compute this? We need to process the nodes in topological order, since the dependencies are on the edges' destinations. Wait, but the code in the problem is using a priority queue and Dijkstra's algorithm.

So d[u] = (number of outgoing edges of u) + (min d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). Wait, but then for node 4 in the second sample, it has one edge to n (d[v]=0). So d[4] =1 +0 =1. Node 1 has two edges. Suppose one leads to 4 (d=1), and another to some node with d=0. Then the minimal d[v] is 0. So d[1] =2 +0 =2, which matches the sample's answer. Yes! So that's the correct formula. Therefore, the approach is to compute for each node u, d[u] = (out_degree[u]) + (min d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). Wait, but how do we compute this? We can process the nodes in reverse topological order. Starting from n, which has d[n]=0. For each node u, once all its outgoing edges' destinations have their d[v] computed, we can compute d[u]. The problem is that the graph may have cycles, but since there's a path from 1 to n, but cycles can exist elsewhere.",

But the problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n, so all nodes on the path must have a valid d. Alternatively, the algorithm can be implemented using BFS or Dijkstra's. Wait, the code in the problem uses a priority queue, which suggests Dijkstra's algorithm. The code's current approach is to start from n and process nodes in a priority queue. The 'd' array is being filled with the distance. The code's current setup has: queue.add(new Point(0, n)); Then, for each node pos, when processed, it looks at its outgoing edges (map.get(pos)), and for each ele (the destination of the edge), it adds a new point with dis + num[ele], and then decrements num[ele]. Hmm, perhaps the 'num' array here is being used to track the number of outgoing edges of each node. Wait, but the 'num' array was initialized as the in-degree. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as:\n\nfor each road v->u, num[u] is incremented. So num[u] is the in-degree of u. But in the code's processing loop, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code uses num[ele], which is the in-degree of ele. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the code should have stored the out-degree for each node. The out-degree of a node v is the size of map.get(v). So perhaps the code should have an array out_degree where out_degree[v] = map.get(v).size().",

The code's current approach uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's trying to find the minimal d[u] first. Wait, the priority queue is ordered by 'dis', which is the current distance. The code starts with n (distance 0). When processing a node pos, it looks at its outgoing edges. For each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. Wait, but if the formula is d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v]), then the code's approach is not directly following that. Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the formula as d[u] = (number of edges from u) + d[v], and then taking the minimum over all edges. Wait, but how does the priority queue help here? Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach where the minimal d is computed first. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute d[u] as the maximum over edges of (d[v] + 1) plus the number of edges. Alternatively, maybe the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges that have been processed. This is getting too confusing. Let me look back at the code's variables.

The code uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's trying to find the minimal d first. The initial node is n with d=0. For each node pos processed, it looks at its outgoing edges. For each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. Wait, perhaps the 'num' array here is the out_degree of ele. Wait, no.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the graph is 1 \u21924 \u2192n. The reverse topological order would be n,4,1. Processing n first (d=0). Then 4: its outgoing edges are to n. \n\nd[4] = out_degree[4] (1) + min(d[n] (0)) \u2192 1. Then 1: outgoing edges to 4. \n\nd[1] = out_degree[1] (1) + min(d[4] (1)) \u2192 2. \n\nWait, but the sample's answer for this case would be 2, which matches. Wait, but in this case, the formula gives d[1] =1+1=2. Yes. Another example: the second sample where node 1 has two edges, one to 4 (d=1) and another to 2 (d= something). Assuming the other edge leads to a node with d=0, then d[1] =2 (out_degree) +0 \u21922. Yes. So the formula is correct. Thus, the code needs to compute for each node u, d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). To compute this, we can process nodes in reverse topological order. The steps are:\n\n1.

This is getting too stuck. Let me try to think of the correct code for the missing part. The missing part is the for loop over the outgoing edges of pos. The code currently has:\n\nfor(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nThe loop should iterate over each element in the list map.get(pos). So the loop should be:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    // process ele\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n} But why is 'num[ele]' used here? The 'num[ele]' is the in-degree of ele. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of incoming edges to ele, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges that are still available. Wait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as the in-degree. Then, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code subtracts 1 from num[ele].",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this Java code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. \n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee meeting after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly chooses a reachable city (via non-blocked roads) and moves there. The goal is to minimize the days needed to ensure Keshi reaches city n.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be using some kind of BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm. Let me look at the code structure. \n\nThe code reads n and m, then builds a map where for each city v, it has a list of outgoing edges (u's). Wait, wait, the input lines are v_i and u_i, which is a road from v_i to u_i. So in the code, they are storing for each v, the list of u's. But the 'num' array is tracking the in-degree? Because for each road v->u, they increment num[u]. Not sure yet.\n\nThen there's a priority queue of Points, which have a distance and position. The initial point is (0, n). The queue is a priority queue sorted by dis. The d array probably stores the minimal distance for each node. \n\nWait, the approach here might be working backwards. Because they start from node n and process backwards. Let me think: maybe they are trying to compute for each node the minimal required days needed to reach n, and then the answer is d[1].\n\nThe code uses a BFS-like approach but with a priority queue, so it's Dijkstra's. The 'num' array might be tracking the number of incoming edges? Or maybe outgoing edges? Let me see:\n\nIn the loop over m roads, for each road v->u, they add u to the list for v in the map. Then they increment num[u]. So num[u] is the in-degree of u? Because each incoming edge to u (from v) increments num[u]. \n\nWait, but the code's map is for outgoing edges. Because for each v, the list contains the u's that v points to. So the map is storing outgoing edges. The num array is counting the in-degree of each node. \n\nNow, looking at the queue processing part. The queue starts with (0, n). The visit array marks visited nodes. For each node pos, when processed, they check if it's in the map (i.e., has outgoing edges?), then loop over the elements in the list for pos. \n\nWait, the code's 'map' is keyed by v (the starting node of the road). So when pos is the current node, the map.get(pos) would give the list of outgoing edges from pos. So for each neighbor in that list, they are considering those edges. \n\nThe code inside the loop for the elements (ele) is adding a new Point with dis + num[ele], and then decrementing num[ele]. Wait, why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea here is that for each edge from pos to ele, when processing pos, the number of choices Keshi has when moving from ele is related to the in-degree of ele? Or maybe the 'num' array here is being used to track the number of outgoing edges from a node? Wait, no, because the num array was initialized as in-degree. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'num' array here is being used to track the number of outgoing edges. Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nThe code for each road v->u does:\n\nmap.get(v).add(u) \u2192 so for v's outgoing edges, adding u.\n\nThen num[u]++ \u2192 so num[u] is the in-degree of u. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach here is to model the problem in reverse. Since we want to find the minimal days required to get from 1 to n, but the code is starting from n and going backward. \n\nThe problem requires that AmShZ can choose to block roads or tell Keshi to move each day. The optimal strategy would involve blocking roads that are not on the critical path, so that Keshi is forced towards n as quickly as possible. \n\nThe key insight here might be that for each node, the minimal required days is the maximum over all incoming edges of (days required for the next node) plus the number of choices at that node. Because when Keshi is at a node, he can choose any outgoing edge, so AmShZ needs to block all but one path each day. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: For each node u, the minimal days required to reach n from u is equal to the maximum among all the days required for each outgoing edge's destination plus the number of outgoing edges from u. Because each time, AmShZ can block all but one edge, so each edge's path requires that many days. But since Keshi chooses randomly, the worst case is that he takes the path that requires the most days. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is: For a node u, the required days is (number of outgoing edges) + the minimal days of the next node. Wait, no, perhaps it's the maximum of the next nodes' days plus the number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal days required for node u is the maximum over all its outgoing edges of (days required for the destination node) plus the number of outgoing edges from u minus 1. Because each time you have to block all but one edge, so for each edge except one, you need a day to block it, and then one day to move. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the sample input. \n\nSuppose in the first sample, the code's approach would compute d[1] as 1, which matches the note. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first sample has a path where from 1 you can go directly to n. Then the number of outgoing edges from 1 is 1. So the days would be 0 (since you can just move, taking 1 day). Wait, but the note says the first sample's answer is 1? Or maybe I need to think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is that for each node u, the required days is (number of outgoing edges) + the maximum required days of the next nodes. \n\nWait, let's think of the second sample. The note says that blocking the first road (so that from 1 you can only go to 4, then moving the next day gets to n). So the path is 1 \u21924 \u2192n. The days needed would be 2. \n\nSuppose the code's approach would compute for node 4: it has one outgoing edge to n. So the days for 4 would be 1 (since 1 edge, so 1? Or 0? Because moving from 4 to n takes one day. So the days for 4 would be 0 (since n is the destination). Then for node 1, which has two edges (assuming the first sample has two roads?), but after blocking one, the remaining edge's path requires 0 days. So the days for 1 would be (number of edges -1) + (max days of next nodes). \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is: For each node u, the minimal required days is (number of outgoing edges from u) + the maximum required days among all its outgoing edges' destinations. \n\nWait, let's see the second sample. Let's say node 1 has two edges: to 2 and 4. Suppose the correct path is 1\u21924\u2192n. The other path is 1\u21922\u2192... but maybe that's a longer path. \n\nIf node 4's required days is 0 (since it can go directly to n in one move, so days needed is 0?), then node 1's required days would be (2 edges) + max(0, ...) \u2192 but that would be 2, which matches the sample's answer of 2. \n\nHmm, that seems plausible. So the formula would be for each node u, d[u] = (number of outgoing edges from u) + max(d[v] for all v in outgoing edges of u). \n\nWait, but then the base case is d[n] =0, since you are already there. \n\nSo the approach is to compute d[u] as the maximum of d[v] for all outgoing edges u\u2192v, plus the number of outgoing edges of u. \n\nWait, but why? Let me think of the process. \n\nEach time, when you are at u, you have to choose to either block roads or move. The optimal strategy would be to block all but one outgoing edge (the one leading to the path with the minimal required days?), but since we need to consider the worst case, perhaps we have to take the maximum. \n\nWait, the problem requires that they can guarantee to meet in at most d days, so we have to consider the worst possible path Keshi could take. So for each node u, the required days is the number of edges (since you have to block all but one, which takes (edges-1) days) plus the days required for the chosen path. But since Keshi chooses randomly, the worst case is that he takes the path that requires the most days. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is: \n\nd[u] = (number of outgoing edges of u) + max(d[v] for all v in outgoing edges of u). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor node n, d[n] =0. \n\nFor node 4 in the second sample, it has one outgoing edge to n. So d[4] =1 (number of edges) + 0 \u2192 1? But the sample's answer for that case is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nWait the second sample's answer is 2. Let me think again. \n\nIn the second sample, the path is 1 \u21924 \u2192n. \n\nThe days needed would be: \n\nOn day 1, block the first road (so that from 1, only the path to 4 is left). \n\nThen on day 2, tell Keshi to move. He moves from 1 to 4. \n\nThen on day 3, tell him to move again, moving to n. \n\nWait, but the sample's note says that the answer is 2. Wait the note says: \n\n\"In the second sample, on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road. So the only reachable city from city 1 will be city 4. Hence on the second day, AmShZ can tell Keshi to move and Keshi will arrive at AmShZ's house. It's also possible for AmShZ to tell Keshi to move for two days.\"\n\nWait, so the total days needed is 2. \n\nHmm, so in that case, the path from 1 to 4 to n takes two days. \n\nWait, how does that fit into the formula? \n\nLet me see:\n\nFor node 4, the outgoing edges are to n. So the number of edges is 1. So d[4] =1 (edges) + d[n] (0) \u2192 1. \n\nThen node 1 has two edges (assuming the first road is blocked, but in the formula, we need to consider all edges). \n\nWait, the formula would be for node 1: the number of edges (2) plus the maximum of d[4] (1) and whatever the other edge's d is. Let's say the other edge goes to a node with higher d. \n\nWait, but in the second sample, the other edge might lead to a node that has a longer path. But in the optimal path, they block that edge, so the maximum would be the d of 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d[u] = (number of outgoing edges of u -1) + (max d[v] for all v in outgoing edges). \n\nBecause, for each edge except one, you have to block it (each block takes a day), and then you have to take the path of the remaining edge, which takes d[v] days. So total days would be (edges-1) + d[v]. But since you have to choose the path with the minimal required days, but since we need to consider the worst case (i.e., the path that requires the most days), the maximum of (edges-1 + d[v]) over all v. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. \n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nd[u] = (number of outgoing edges of u) + (max d[v] for all v in outgoing edges of u). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose you have k outgoing edges. To force Keshi to take a particular path, you need to block k-1 edges, which takes k-1 days. Then, you spend one day to move along the chosen edge. The total days for that path would be (k-1) + (1 + d[v]). Wait, because moving takes a day, and then the path from v takes d[v] days. \n\nWait, maybe the total days for that path is (k-1) (days to block) + 1 (day to move) + d[v]. \n\nBut since you can choose which path to take (by blocking others), you would choose the path with the minimal (d[v] + 1). But since we need to consider the worst case (the path that requires the most days), the maximum over all (d[v] + 1 + (k-1)). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d[u] = (number of edges) + (max d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nWait let's see the second sample:\n\nFor node 4, it has one edge to n. So d[4] =1 (edges) + d[n] (0) \u2192 1. \n\nNode 1 has two edges. The max d[v] between the two edges (assuming one leads to 4 with d=1, and the other leads to some other node with higher d). Let's say the other edge leads to a node with d=0 (unlikely, but let's see). Then the max would be 1. So d[1] =2 (edges) +1 \u21923. But the sample's answer is 2. So that formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the days required for node u is the maximum over all its outgoing edges of (d[v] + 1) plus the number of edges minus 1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor node 4, d[v] (n) is 0. So (0 +1) =1. The number of edges is 1, so (1-1) =0. So total is 1+0=1. \n\nFor node 1, the edges are to 4 (d=1) and another node (say, 2 with d= something). Let's say the other edge leads to a node with d=0. Then the maximum (d[v]+1) would be max(1+1, 0+1) \u2192 2. Then the number of edges is 2, so (2-1) =1. So total is 2+1=3. Still not matching the sample's 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is d[u] = (number of edges) + (max d[v]). \n\nWait in the second sample, node 1's edges are two. The max d[v] is 1 (from 4). So 2+1=3. Not matching. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of the days as follows: \n\nEach time you can choose to block a road or move. The strategy is to block roads to reduce the options so that Keshi is forced to take the path with minimal days. \n\nThe minimal days required for node u is the minimal number of days needed to ensure that Keshi reaches n from u. \n\nThe key is that each time you can block a road, but you can also choose to move. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or let Keshi move. The goal is to minimize the maximum possible days needed. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choices (since he picks randomly), the days must be such that after d days, he must have reached n. \n\nWait, the problem says \"make sure that they will see each other after at most d days\". So they need a strategy that ensures that no matter what Keshi does (when moving, he chooses any available path), they will meet within d days. \n\nWait, but when Keshi moves, he chooses randomly. So the strategy must work for all possible choices. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a BFS where each node's distance is the minimal number of days required to reach n from that node. \n\nThe way to model this is that for each node u, the required days is the maximum over all possible next steps (since Keshi could choose any outgoing edge, so we have to account for the worst case) plus the number of edges (since each edge except one must be blocked, taking one day each). \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nSuppose you are at node u. You have k outgoing edges. To force Keshi to take a particular path, you need to block k-1 edges, which takes k-1 days. Then, you spend one day to move along the chosen edge. The total days for that path would be (k-1) + 1 + d[v], where d[v] is the days needed from v. \n\nBut since Keshi could choose any path, the worst case is the maximum over all possible paths. So the minimal required days for u is the minimal over all possible choices of which path to take (i.e., which edges to block), but since we have to account for the worst case (i.e., Keshi might choose the path that takes the longest time), the formula would be:\n\nd[u] = (number of edges) + (max d[v] for all edges u\u2192v)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nBecause, the number of edges is k. To block k-1 edges, that takes k-1 days. Then, moving takes 1 day, and then the path takes d[v]. So total is (k-1) +1 + d[v] = k + d[v]. \n\nBut since we have to choose the path with the minimal (k + d[v]), but since Keshi could choose any path, the worst case is the maximum of (k + d[v]) over all edges. \n\nWait, no. Because the AmShZ can choose which edges to block. So to minimize the required days, AmShZ would choose to block all edges except the one with the minimal (d[v] + 1). \n\nWait, but the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choice, so the AmShZ must choose the path that gives the minimal maximum. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd[u] = (number of edges) + (min d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nNo, that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal days required for u is the minimal over all possible choices of which edge to keep (so blocking others), and then the days would be (number of edges -1) (days to block) + 1 (day to move) + d[v]. \n\nThe minimal over all edges v of ( (k-1) +1 + d[v] ) \u2192 which is (k) + d[v]. \n\nSo the minimal possible days for u is the minimal (k + d[v]) over all edges. \n\nBut since the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choice, the days must be sufficient. Wait, no. Because if AmShZ chooses to keep the edge with minimal (d[v] +k), then even if Keshi takes that path, it's okay. But if he takes another path, that path wasn't blocked, so that's a problem. \n\nAh, right! Because when you block edges, you can only block one edge per day. Wait, no, each day, AmShZ can choose to block any one road. So over multiple days, they can block multiple roads. \n\nWait, the problem says that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. \n\nSo the strategy is to block roads in such a way that after some days, when Keshi is told to move, he has only one path left, leading to n. \n\nThe key is to find the minimal number of days required such that, through a sequence of blocking and moving, Keshi is forced to reach n in d days. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and compute for each node the minimal days required. \n\nThe formula for d[u] would be the maximum over all edges u\u2192v of (d[v] + 1) plus the number of edges from u minus 1. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose you have k edges from u. To force Keshi to take one particular edge (the one with the minimal d[v]), you need to block the other k-1 edges. Each block takes a day. Then, you spend a day to move along the chosen edge. The total days for that path would be (k-1) (blocking days) + 1 (move day) + d[v]. \n\nBut since you can choose which edge to keep (the one with minimal d[v]), the minimal required days for u would be (k-1 +1) + d[v] = k + d[v]. \n\nHowever, since you have to account for the worst case (i.e., the path that requires the most days), perhaps you have to take the maximum over all edges' (d[v] +1) plus the number of edges minus 1. \n\nWait, no. Because you can choose which edge to keep, so you can choose the edge with the smallest (d[v] +1). \n\nWait, the total days would be (number of edges -1) (days to block) + 1 (move day) + d[v]. \n\nThe minimal possible days for u is the minimal over all edges v of ( (k-1) +1 + d[v] ) \u2192 which is (k) + d[v]. \n\nBut since you can choose which edge to keep, you pick the edge with the smallest d[v], so the minimal days would be k + (min d[v]). \n\nBut the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choice, so if you block all edges except one, then Keshi has no choice but to take that path. \n\nAh! So the AmShZ can choose to block all other edges except one, so Keshi has to take that path. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days required for u is the minimal possible (k + d[v]) over all edges v. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nBecause you can choose to block all edges except the one with the minimal (d[v] +1). \n\nWait, the days needed would be (k-1) days to block the other edges, then one day to move (so total k days) plus d[v]. \n\nSo total is k + d[v]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for u is the minimal (k + d[v]) over all edges v. \n\nWait, but then for the second sample:\n\nNode 4 has one edge to n. So k=1, d[v] =0. So d[4] =1+0=1. \n\nNode 1 has two edges. Suppose one leads to 4 (d=1), and another to some node with d=0. \n\nThen the minimal would be min( (2+1), (2+0) ) \u2192 2. Which matches the sample's answer of 2. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo the formula is d[u] = min over all edges u\u2192v of ( (number of edges from u) + d[v] ). \n\nWait, but why is it the minimum? Because you can choose the path with the smallest (d[v] + k), so the minimal among all edges. \n\nWait, but the number of edges from u is fixed. So it's (k + d[v]). So the minimal of that over all edges. \n\nWait, but in the first sample, if there's only one edge from 1 to n, then d[1] =1 +0 =1, which matches the first sample's note. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo the approach is to compute for each node u, the minimal (number of outgoing edges of u + d[v]) among all outgoing edges v. \n\nWait, but how do we compute this? \n\nWe need to process the nodes in topological order, since the dependencies are on the edges' destinations. \n\nWait, but the code in the problem is using a priority queue and Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe code initializes the queue with (0, n). The d array is being filled. \n\nWait, the code is processing nodes in reverse. Because it starts from n and goes backward. \n\nWait, the formula for d[u] is the minimal (k + d[v]), but since we are going backward, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nWait, let me think of the direction. \n\nSuppose we are processing from n backwards. \n\nFor node n, d[n] =0. \n\nFor a node u that has an edge to v (so in the original graph, u\u2192v), then in the reversed graph, v is a predecessor of u. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the graph in reverse. \n\nWait, the code's map is storing outgoing edges for each node. \n\nThe code's queue starts with n. \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor each neighbor in map.get(pos) \u2192 which are the outgoing edges of pos. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the 'map' is the original graph's edges. So when processing node pos (starting from n), the code is looking at the outgoing edges of pos. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the code is processing the graph in the forward direction. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute d[u] as the minimal days required from u to n. \n\nWait, the code's d array is initialized as d[pos] = dis. \n\nThe queue is a priority queue sorted by dis. \n\nWait, the code uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's using Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nThe formula for d[u] is being computed as dis + num[ele], but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's look at the code's current state. \n\nThe code has a map which for each v stores the list of outgoing edges (u's). \n\nThe 'num' array is the in-degree of each node. \n\nWait, no, the 'num' array is initialized as num[u]++ for each road v->u. So num[u] is the in-degree of u. \n\nIn the code's processing loop:\n\nfor each element in map.get(pos) \u2192 which are the outgoing edges from pos. \n\nWait, the code is iterating over the outgoing edges of pos. \n\nWait, but the code's current code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\" in the for loop. \n\nThe current code is:\n\nfor(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the loop over the elements. \n\nThe code is trying to process each outgoing edge from pos. \n\nThe 'ele' would be the destination of the edge from pos. \n\nWait, but the code's 'map' is for each v, the list of outgoing edges (u's). So for pos (current node), the outgoing edges are the list stored in map.get(pos). \n\nSo for each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code is adding a new point with dis + num[ele], and then decrementing num[ele]. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'num' array here is being used to track the number of outgoing edges from a node. \n\nWait, no. Because the 'num' array was initialized as the in-degree. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the number of outgoing edges for each node. \n\nWait, perhaps the code has a mistake here. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as:\n\nfor each road v->u, num[u] is incremented. \n\nSo num[u] is the in-degree of u. \n\nBut in the code's processing loop, when processing pos, the code is using num[ele], where ele is the destination of an edge from pos. \n\nSo for each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code is adding dis + num[ele], and then decrementing num[ele]. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the 'num' array is being used to track the number of incoming edges to ele, but why? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of outgoing edges from ele. \n\nWait, maybe the code has a mistake in the way it's counting the number of outgoing edges. \n\nWait, the number of outgoing edges for a node v is the size of map.get(v). \n\nSo perhaps the code should have stored the number of outgoing edges for each node. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is the in-degree. So perhaps the code is using the wrong array here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the number of outgoing edges for each node. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should have a different array. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the in-degree for some reason. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the correct approach again. \n\nThe correct formula for d[u] is the minimal over all edges u\u2192v of ( (number of outgoing edges of u) + d[v] ). \n\nTo compute this, we can process the nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nStarting from n, which has d[n] =0. \n\nFor each node u, once all its outgoing edges' destinations have their d[v] computed, we can compute d[u] as the minimal (k + d[v]) for all edges u\u2192v, where k is the number of outgoing edges of u. \n\nWait, but the minimal? Or the maximum? \n\nWait, the formula is d[u] = (number of edges from u) + (min d[v] among all edges). \n\nWait, no. Because the minimal (d[v] + k) would be the minimal possible days. \n\nWait, the minimal days required for u is the minimal possible days over all possible paths. \n\nYes, because AmShZ can choose to block all edges except the one with the minimal d[v], so the total days would be k (number of edges) + d[v]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal among all edges' (k + d[v]). \n\nWait, but the number of edges k is fixed for u. So it's k + (min d[v]). \n\nWait, yes. \n\nSo d[u] = (number of outgoing edges of u) + (min d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nWait, but then for node 4 in the second sample, it has one edge to n (d[v]=0). So d[4] =1 +0 =1. \n\nNode 1 has two edges. Suppose one leads to 4 (d=1), and another to some node with d=0. Then the minimal d[v] is 0. So d[1] =2 +0 =2, which matches the sample's answer. \n\nYes! So that's the correct formula. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute for each node u, d[u] = (out_degree[u]) + (min d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nWait, but how do we compute this? \n\nWe can process the nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nStarting from n, which has d[n]=0. \n\nFor each node u, once all its outgoing edges' destinations have their d[v] computed, we can compute d[u]. \n\nThe problem is that the graph may have cycles, but since there's a path from 1 to n, but cycles can exist elsewhere. \n\nHmm, but in that case, the minimal d[u] would be infinity if there's a cycle that doesn't reach n. But the problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n, so all nodes on the path must have a valid d. \n\nAlternatively, the algorithm can be implemented using BFS or Dijkstra's. \n\nWait, the code in the problem uses a priority queue, which suggests Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\nThe code's current approach is to start from n and process nodes in a priority queue. \n\nThe 'd' array is being filled with the distance. \n\nThe code's current setup has:\n\nqueue.add(new Point(0, n));\n\nThen, for each node pos, when processed, it looks at its outgoing edges (map.get(pos)), and for each ele (the destination of the edge), it adds a new point with dis + num[ele], and then decrements num[ele]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'num' array here is being used to track the number of outgoing edges of each node. \n\nWait, but the 'num' array was initialized as the in-degree. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as:\n\nfor each road v->u, num[u] is incremented. \n\nSo num[u] is the in-degree of u. \n\nBut in the code's processing loop, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code uses num[ele], which is the in-degree of ele. \n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should have stored the out-degree for each node. \n\nThe out-degree of a node v is the size of map.get(v). \n\nSo perhaps the code should have an array out_degree where out_degree[v] = map.get(v).size(). \n\nThen, in the code's processing loop, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code would use out_degree[pos], not num[ele]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe formula for d[u] is (out_degree[u] ) + (min d[v] for edges u\u2192v). \n\nWait, but in the code's current approach, the code is trying to compute d[pos] as dis, and then for each edge pos\u2192ele, it adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute d[u] as the sum of the out_degree and the minimal d[v]. \n\nWait, but how does that fit into the code's current structure? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the code's current structure. \n\nThe code starts with n, and for each outgoing edge from n (if any), it adds to the queue with dis + num[ele]. \n\nWait, but the initial dis is 0. \n\nSuppose n has no outgoing edges (since it's the destination). So the code would process n, then for each edge from n (none), so nothing is added. \n\nThen, the d array for n is set to 0. \n\nThen, the next nodes would be processed. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute d[u] as the maximum over edges of (d[v] + out_degree[u]). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the formula d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v]). \n\nWait, but how would that be implemented with Dijkstra's algorithm? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to model the problem as a shortest path problem where the cost to go from u to v is (out_degree[u] + ...). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a reversed graph. \n\nWait, maybe the code is processing the graph in reverse. \n\nWait, the code starts from n and processes nodes in a way that for each node, it considers its outgoing edges (in the original graph), but perhaps the formula is being computed in reverse. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree as a way to track the number of edges that need to be blocked. \n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think of what the missing code should be. \n\nThe code's for loop is missing the loop over the elements in the outgoing edges of pos. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nThe loop should iterate over each element in the list map.get(pos). \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nSo the for loop should be over each element in the list. \n\nBut also, the code is using 'num[ele]', which is the in-degree of ele. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of outgoing edges of 'pos', which is the current node. \n\nWait, the number of outgoing edges of pos is map.get(pos).size(). \n\nBut the code is using num[ele], which is the in-degree of ele. \n\nThis suggests that the code is using the wrong array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be using the out_degree of pos. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should have an array for out_degree. \n\nLet me think of the correct approach again. \n\nThe correct formula is d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nTo compute this, we can process nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nStarting from n, which has d[n] =0. \n\nFor each node u, once all its outgoing edges' destinations have their d[v] computed, we can compute d[u] as out_degree[u] + min(d[v]). \n\nThe minimal d[v] can be found by iterating over all edges from u. \n\nThe problem is how to implement this efficiently. \n\nThe code's current approach uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's trying to find the minimal d[u] first. \n\nWait, the priority queue is ordered by 'dis', which is the current distance. \n\nThe code starts with n (distance 0). \n\nWhen processing a node pos, it looks at its outgoing edges. \n\nFor each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. \n\nWait, but if the formula is d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v]), then the code's approach is not directly following that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the formula as d[u] = (number of edges from u) + d[v], and then taking the minimum over all edges. \n\nWait, but how does the priority queue help here? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach where the minimal d is computed first. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute d[u] as the maximum over edges of (d[v] + 1) plus the number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges that have been processed. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me look back at the code's variables. \n\nThe code has a 'num' array which is initialized as the in-degree of each node. \n\nIn the loop over the edges, for each edge v->u, num[u] is incremented. \n\nThen, in the processing loop, for each edge pos \u2192 ele (since map.get(pos) is the outgoing edges of pos), the code uses num[ele], which is the in-degree of ele. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of incoming edges to ele, but that doesn't seem relevant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the number of outgoing edges of pos. \n\nWait, the number of outgoing edges of pos is map.get(pos).size(). \n\nBut the code is using num[ele], which is the in-degree of ele. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code has a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges remaining to be processed. \n\nWait, the code has a 'num' array which is initialized as the in-degree. \n\nThen, in the loop, after adding to the queue, it does num[ele]--. \n\nThis suggests that the 'num' array is being used to count something else. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the number of edges that are still available. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the number of edges that need to be blocked. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal days using a BFS approach where each step's cost is the in-degree of the next node. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let me try to think of the correct code. \n\nThe correct formula is d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nTo compute this, we can process nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nWe can compute the out_degree for each node. \n\nInitialize d[n] =0. \n\nFor all other nodes, we need to process them after all their outgoing edges' destinations have been processed. \n\nWait, no. Because the formula depends on the edges' destinations. \n\nSo for node u, to compute d[u], we need to know the d[v] for all edges u\u2192v. \n\nThus, the nodes must be processed in reverse topological order. \n\nBut how to implement this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. \n\nAlternatively, since the graph can have cycles, but the problem states there is a path from 1 to n, so all nodes on the path must be reachable from 1 and can reach n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code should be using a BFS approach where for each node, once all its outgoing edges' destinations have their d[v] computed, we can compute d[u]. \n\nBut this requires knowing when all dependencies are resolved. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a priority queue where the nodes with the least possible d are processed first. \n\nWait, the formula for d[u] is out_degree[u] + min(d[v]). \n\nThe minimal d[v] is needed to minimize the total. \n\nThus, the minimal d[u] can be computed once all edges' d[v] are known. \n\nAlternatively, the code can process nodes in a way that whenever a node's outgoing edges' d[v] are known, it can compute its own d. \n\nThis sounds like a topological sort approach. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's current approach. \n\nThe code uses a priority queue, which suggests that it's trying to find the minimal d first. \n\nThe initial node is n with d=0. \n\nFor each node pos processed, it looks at its outgoing edges. \n\nFor each edge pos \u2192 ele, the code adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'num' array here is the out_degree of ele. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of edges from pos. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is the in-degree. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and the correct approach is to use the out_degree. \n\nLet me try to think of the correct code. \n\nThe correct code should compute for each node u, d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nTo compute this, we can process nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nWe can compute the out_degree for each node. \n\nInitialize d[n] =0. \n\nFor all other nodes, we need to process them after all their outgoing edges' destinations have been processed. \n\nWait, no. Because the formula depends on the edges' destinations. \n\nThus, the nodes must be processed in reverse topological order. \n\nThe reverse topological order of the original graph is the topological order of the reversed graph. \n\nAlternatively, the topological order of the original graph is such that all edges go from earlier to later nodes. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the graph is 1 \u21924 \u2192n. \n\nThe reverse topological order would be n,4,1. \n\nProcessing n first (d=0). \n\nThen 4: its outgoing edges are to n. \n\nd[4] = out_degree[4] (1) + min(d[n] (0)) \u2192 1. \n\nThen 1: outgoing edges to 4. \n\nd[1] = out_degree[1] (1) + min(d[4] (1)) \u2192 2. \n\nWait, but the sample's answer for this case would be 2, which matches. \n\nWait, but in this case, the formula gives d[1] =1+1=2. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: the second sample where node 1 has two edges, one to 4 (d=1) and another to 2 (d= something). \n\nAssuming the other edge leads to a node with d=0, then d[1] =2 (out_degree) +0 \u21922. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nThus, the code needs to compute for each node u, d[u] = out_degree[u] + min(d[v] for all edges u\u2192v). \n\nTo compute this, we can process nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Compute the out_degree for each node. \n\n2. Compute the topological order of the graph in reverse (i.e., the topological order of the reversed graph). \n\n3. Process nodes in this order. \n\n4. For each node u, compute d[u] as out_degree[u] + the minimal d[v] among its outgoing edges. \n\nBut how to implement this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, since the graph can have cycles, but the problem states there is a path from 1 to n, perhaps we can use a BFS-like approach where we process nodes once all their outgoing edges' destinations have been processed. \n\nAlternatively, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a priority queue where the nodes are processed in the order of their current minimal possible d. \n\nWait, the code's current approach uses a priority queue sorted by 'dis'. \n\nThe initial node is n with dis=0. \n\nWhen processing node pos, for each outgoing edge to ele, the code adds a new point with dis + num[ele]. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'num' array here is the out_degree of pos. \n\nWait, but the 'num' array is initialized as the in-degree. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code has a mistake in the 'num' array. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should have stored the out_degree in the 'num' array. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor each road v->u, the code adds u to map.get(v). \n\nThen, the 'num[u]++' is counting the in-degree. \n\nBut if instead, the code wanted to store the out_degree, then for each v, the out_degree is the size of map.get(v). \n\nThus, the code should have an array out_degree where out_degree[v] = map.get(v).size(). \n\nThen, in the code's processing loop, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code would use out_degree[pos]. \n\nSo the code's missing loop is iterating over each ele in map.get(pos), and for each, the code would add a new point with dis + out_degree[pos], but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges remaining to be processed. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as the in-degree. \n\nThen, in the loop, after adding to the queue, it does num[ele]--. \n\nThis suggests that the 'num' array is being used to count the number of edges that need to be processed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal days using a BFS approach where each edge's contribution is added. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum possible days required, and thus uses the in-degree. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. \n\nLet me try to think of the correct code for the missing part. \n\nThe missing part is the for loop over the outgoing edges of pos. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nThe loop should iterate over each element in the list map.get(pos). \n\nSo the loop should be:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    // process ele\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nBut why is 'num[ele]' used here? \n\nThe 'num[ele]' is the in-degree of ele. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of incoming edges to ele, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree array to track the number of edges that are still available. \n\nWait, the code's 'num' array is initialized as the in-degree. \n\nThen, when processing an edge from pos to ele, the code subtracts 1 from num[ele]. \n\nThis suggests that the 'num' array is being used to count the number of edges that are still unprocessed. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of edges that can be blocked. \n\nThis is really confusing. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct missing code is to loop over the elements in the map.get(pos) list, and the code should be:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure why 'num[ele]' is used here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the out_degree of pos. \n\nThe out_degree of pos is map.get(pos).size(). \n\nSo the code should have an array out_degree where out_degree[v] = map.get(v).size(). \n\nThen, in the loop, the code would use out_degree[pos]. \n\nBut the current code doesn't have such an array. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and the correct approach is to use the out_degree. \n\nBut given the code's current structure, the missing loop is iterating over the elements in the map.get(pos) list. \n\nSo the correct missing code is:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure why 'num[ele]' is used here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree of ele as the number of edges that need to be blocked. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that the problem requires the minimal days, and the sample input's first case would have the code's d[1] =1, which would be the case if the code's formula is correct. \n\nAssuming that the code's approach is correct, the missing loop is iterating over the elements in the map.get(pos) list. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n\n    queue.add(new Point(dis + num[ele], ele));\n\n    num[ele]--;\n\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure why 'num[ele]' is used here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using the in-degree of ele as the number of edges coming into ele, but I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with this as the missing code."
