So for example, if n was 3, then the first iteration, n is 3, then after the --, it becomes 2. The condition is true. Then next iteration, 2>0, then 1, etc. So total 3 times. That would work. So the condition would be n-- >0, but written as while(n-- >0). Wait, but the order is important here. Let me see: the expression n-- is post-decrement. So the condition is evaluated first. So for n=3, the first check is 3>0, then n becomes 2. So the loop runs 3 times. Exactly what we need. So the missing code in the while condition is (n-- > 0). So the line would be while(n-- >0) { ... }, but in the code, the loop's body is the s += sc.nextInt();. So putting that together, the code would be:\n\nwhile(n-- > 0) s += sc.nextInt(); Yes, that makes sense. Because that loop will run exactly n times, each time reading an a_i and adding to s. Then, after that, the code prints m > s ? 0 : s - m. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem requires the minimum energy to restore. Let me re-read the problem statement to confirm. The problem says that you start with m energy. Each meter you walk uses 1 energy. You can restore energy by sitting on benches.",

But also, considering previous steps. Alternatively, the minimal required can be found by tracking the \"deficit\" at each step. Let me think of it as follows: \n\nWe start with current_energy = m. \n\ntotal_recharge = 0. For each a_i in a_1 to a_n: \n\n   if current_energy < a_i: \n\n       needed = a_i - current_energy \n\n       total_recharge += needed \n\n       current_energy += needed \n\n   current_energy -= a_i So this way, before moving over a_i, if you don't have enough, you add exactly the needed amount. This way, the total_recharge is the sum of all needed amounts. This seems like the correct approach. Let me test this with the first example given in the note. First test case: n=3, m=2, a = [1,2,1]. Processing each a_i: First a_i is 1. current_energy is 2. \n\n2 >=1, so no need to recharge. Subtract 1: current_energy becomes 1. Second a_i is 2. current_energy is 1 < 2. So needed is 2-1 =1. Add to total_recharge (now 1). current_energy becomes 1+1=2. Subtract 2: current_energy is 0. Third a_i is 1. current_energy is 0 <1. \n\nneeded is 1-0 =1. Add to total_recharge (now 2). current_energy becomes 1. Subtract 1: 0. Total recharge is 2, which matches the example's required 2 (the example's explanation says they restored 2+1=3, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the example). Wait the example says in the first test case, they restored 2 on bench 2 and 1 on bench 3, totaling 3. But according to this algorithm, it's 2. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait the example's first test case's explanation says: \n\nThey walk to bench 2 (distance 1, using 1 energy, so remaining 1. Then they restore 2 units (so now 3). Then walk 2 meters (using 2, remaining 1. Then restore 1, so 2, then walk 1. So total restored is 2+1=3. But according to the algorithm, the required is 2. Hmm, so there's a problem here. Wait let's re-calculate with the algorithm. Let me walk through the algorithm step by step for the first example. Test case 1: m=2, a = [1,2,1]. Initialize current_energy = 2, total_recharge =0. First a_i =1: \n\ncurrent_energy (2) >=1 \u2192 no recharge. current_energy becomes 2-1 =1. Second a_i =2: \n\ncurrent_energy (1) <2 \u2192 needed is 1. Add 1 to total_recharge (now 1). current_energy becomes 1+1=2. Subtract 2 \u2192 0. Third a_i =1: \n\ncurrent_energy (0) <1 \u2192 needed is 1. Add 1 \u2192 total_recharge is 2. current_energy becomes 0+1=1 \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 0. Total is 2. But the example's explanation says they had to restore 3. Wait the example's explanation says: \n\nThey restored 2 on bench 2 (after arriving there), then 1 on bench 3. Wait, but according to the algorithm, the minimal is 2. So why the discrepancy?",

If m >= S, then no recharge needed. Else, the algorithm's approach would require that the sum of all needed recharges equals (S - m). Because each time you add needed = a_i - current_energy, and then subtract a_i. The total of all needed plus m must equal the total energy used (S). Because the initial energy is m, plus the sum of x_i (recharges) equals the total energy used (S). So sum x_i = S - m. Therefore, the minimal required is indeed max(0, S - m). So the code's current approach is correct. Then why in the first example, the algorithm's approach gives 2, which is correct, and the code's formula would also give 4-2=2. So the code is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this Java code for the given problem. The problem is about finding the minimum energy to restore so that you can walk from bench 1 to n+1. \n\nThe code provided has a main method, and there's a loop for each test case. The variables n and m are read, then there's a while loop that's supposed to sum the a_i's into s. But the condition for the while loop is missing. Oh right, because the a_i's are n numbers, so the loop should run n times. \n\nWait, the current code has a while loop with a TODO. The idea is that for each test case, after reading n and m, we need to read n integers (the a_i's) and sum them into s. So the while loop's condition should be something that runs exactly n times. But how is that implemented here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a for loop would be better here. Like for(int i=0; i<n; i++) { s += sc.nextInt(); }, but the existing code uses a while loop. Let's see. The current code's while loop is empty in condition. So perhaps the original code intended to use a counter. Like, maybe initializing an index variable and incrementing until it reaches n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a loop that runs n times. Let me think. The code as written has s starting at 0, then the while loop adds each a_i to s. The problem is the loop's condition. So perhaps the loop should run n times. So the while loop's condition should be something like (n-- >0), but that might work. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code inside the while loop is s += sc.nextInt();. So each iteration reads one a_i and adds to s. So the loop needs to run exactly n times. So the condition should be that there are still a_i's left to read. \n\nHmm, perhaps the original code's while loop's condition is missing, and the correct condition is \"n-- >0\" or something similar. Let me think. Let's see: the variable n is read from input. So if we do while(n-- >0), then each time the loop runs, n decreases by 1. So for example, if n was 3, then the first iteration, n is 3, then after the --, it becomes 2. The condition is true. Then next iteration, 2>0, then 1, etc. So total 3 times. That would work. So the condition would be n-- >0, but written as while(n-- >0). Wait, but the order is important here. Let me see: the expression n-- is post-decrement. So the condition is evaluated first. So for n=3, the first check is 3>0, then n becomes 2. So the loop runs 3 times. Exactly what we need. \n\nSo the missing code in the while condition is (n-- > 0). So the line would be while(n-- >0) { ... }, but in the code, the loop's body is the s += sc.nextInt();. So putting that together, the code would be:\n\nwhile(n-- > 0) s += sc.nextInt();\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because that loop will run exactly n times, each time reading an a_i and adding to s. \n\nThen, after that, the code prints m > s ? 0 : s - m. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem requires the minimum energy to restore. Let me re-read the problem statement to confirm.\n\nThe problem says that you start with m energy. Each meter you walk uses 1 energy. You can restore energy by sitting on benches. The total distance is the sum of all a_i's (since the distance between bench 1 and 2 is a_1, 2-3 a_2, etc., up to a_n between n and n+1). So the total distance is s = a_1 + ... + a_n. \n\nThe total energy needed is s. If your initial m is >= s, then you don't need to restore any. Otherwise, you need to restore (s - m). So the code's current output line is correct. \n\nWait, but that's only if you can choose when to sit. But the problem allows you to sit on any bench, so you can choose optimal points to sit. Wait, but the minimal energy to restore is indeed s - m if s > m. Because the total required is s, and you start with m. So regardless of the path, you need to have at least s energy in total. Since you can restore any amount at each bench, the minimal total is max(0, s - m). \n\nWait, but maybe there's a scenario where the path requires more? Like, maybe you have to stop at certain points to recharge so that you don't run out of energy at any step. Wait, the problem says you can't walk if you have 0 energy. So you must ensure that at each step between benches, you have enough energy to cover the distance. \n\nOh wait, I think I made a mistake here. The initial approach is wrong. Because the problem isn't just about the total distance. It's about the path where between each pair of consecutive benches, you have enough energy to walk that distance. Because you can't walk if you have 0 energy. So you have to manage your energy such that after each step, you don't run out. \n\nFor example, suppose m is 3, and the distances are [4, 1]. The total distance is 5, which is more than 3, so you need to restore 2. But how? Let's see: the first distance is 4. Since you start with 3, you can't even cover the first step. So you have to sit on bench 1 first. So you need to restore at least 1 (so that you have 4, then walk 4, then you have 0, but then you can sit on bench 2 to restore 1, but then walk 1. Wait, but the problem says you can restore any amount by sitting. So the minimal total is the sum of the required recharges at each bench. \n\nHmm, so my initial approach is wrong. The code currently computes s - m if s > m, but that's only correct if the maximum required between any step is not more than the available energy. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that you can walk from bench 1 to n+1. To do this, you must have enough energy at each step. So for each a_i (the distance between bench i and i+1), you must have enough energy when you start walking that segment. \n\nThe key is that between each bench, you can choose to sit and recharge. So the strategy is to recharge just enough at each bench to cover the next steps. \n\nWait, the minimal total recharge is the sum of all the a_i's minus the initial m, but only if the maximum a_i is less than or equal to the available energy after recharging. Wait, no. Let me think of an example. \n\nTake the first example in the note: the first test case. Let's say n=3, m=2, and a = [1,2,1]. The total distance is 4. Since m is 2, the code's current approach would output 4-2=2. Which matches the example's explanation (they restored 2+1=3, but the total needed is 2. Wait, the example says they restored 2 and 1, totaling 3. But according to the code's formula, it would output 2. So that's a discrepancy. \n\nAh, so the code's current approach is wrong. So the problem is more complicated than just total distance minus m. \n\nSo the correct approach must consider that between each step, you can't have your energy drop below zero. So the problem is similar to a gas station problem where you need to have enough fuel to reach the next station. \n\nHmm, so the correct way to model this is to track the energy after each step. Let me think of the algorithm. \n\nWe start at bench 1 with m energy. We can choose to recharge here. Then walk to bench 2, which takes a_1 meters. Then recharge again, etc. \n\nThe minimal total recharge is the sum of all the required recharges at each bench. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to recharge as much as possible at each bench, but the minimal required is determined by the path. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal required is determined by the point where the cumulative required exceeds the available energy. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to track the current energy. We start with m. For each a_i in order, we need to have enough energy to walk a_i. \n\nWait, but you can recharge at each bench before moving. So the process is: \n\nAt each bench i (from 1 to n), you can choose to recharge some amount (could be zero). Then you must have enough energy to walk the a_i distance to bench i+1. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nStart at bench 1. \n\nAt bench 1, you can recharge some amount (let's say x1). Then your energy becomes (m + x1). Then you subtract a_1 to walk to bench 2. \n\nAt bench 2, you can recharge x2, so energy becomes (previous energy after a_1 step) + x2. Then subtract a_2, etc. \n\nThe total recharge is x1 + x2 + ... + xn. We need to find the minimal total x such that all steps can be done. \n\nThe minimal total x is the sum of all the required x_i's. \n\nTo find the minimal x, we can model this as follows: \n\nWe need to ensure that after each step, the energy doesn't drop below zero. \n\nWait, but the key is that before moving from bench i to i+1, you can recharge. So the process is: \n\nAt each step before moving to the next bench, you can choose to add some energy (x_i) to your current energy. Then you must have enough to cover the a_i distance. \n\nThe minimal total x is the sum of all x_i's. \n\nThe optimal way is to choose x_i such that after adding x_i, the current energy plus x_i is at least a_i. But also, considering previous steps. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal required can be found by tracking the \"deficit\" at each step. \n\nLet me think of it as follows: \n\nWe start with current_energy = m. \n\ntotal_recharge = 0. \n\nFor each a_i in a_1 to a_n: \n\n   if current_energy < a_i: \n\n       needed = a_i - current_energy \n\n       total_recharge += needed \n\n       current_energy += needed \n\n   current_energy -= a_i \n\nSo this way, before moving over a_i, if you don't have enough, you add exactly the needed amount. \n\nThis way, the total_recharge is the sum of all needed amounts. \n\nThis seems like the correct approach. \n\nLet me test this with the first example given in the note. \n\nFirst test case: n=3, m=2, a = [1,2,1]. \n\nProcessing each a_i: \n\nFirst a_i is 1. \n\ncurrent_energy is 2. \n\n2 >=1, so no need to recharge. \n\nSubtract 1: current_energy becomes 1. \n\nSecond a_i is 2. \n\ncurrent_energy is 1 < 2. \n\nSo needed is 2-1 =1. \n\nAdd to total_recharge (now 1). \n\ncurrent_energy becomes 1+1=2. \n\nSubtract 2: current_energy is 0. \n\nThird a_i is 1. \n\ncurrent_energy is 0 <1. \n\nneeded is 1-0 =1. \n\nAdd to total_recharge (now 2). \n\ncurrent_energy becomes 1. \n\nSubtract 1: 0. \n\nTotal recharge is 2, which matches the example's required 2 (the example's explanation says they restored 2+1=3, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the example). Wait the example says in the first test case, they restored 2 on bench 2 and 1 on bench 3, totaling 3. But according to this algorithm, it's 2. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait the example's first test case's explanation says: \n\nThey walk to bench 2 (distance 1, using 1 energy, so remaining 1. Then they restore 2 units (so now 3). Then walk 2 meters (using 2, remaining 1. Then restore 1, so 2, then walk 1. So total restored is 2+1=3. But according to the algorithm, the required is 2. \n\nHmm, so there's a problem here. \n\nWait let's re-calculate with the algorithm. \n\nLet me walk through the algorithm step by step for the first example. \n\nTest case 1: m=2, a = [1,2,1]. \n\nInitialize current_energy = 2, total_recharge =0. \n\nFirst a_i =1: \n\ncurrent_energy (2) >=1 \u2192 no recharge. \n\ncurrent_energy becomes 2-1 =1. \n\nSecond a_i =2: \n\ncurrent_energy (1) <2 \u2192 needed is 1. \n\nAdd 1 to total_recharge (now 1). \n\ncurrent_energy becomes 1+1=2. \n\nSubtract 2 \u2192 0. \n\nThird a_i =1: \n\ncurrent_energy (0) <1 \u2192 needed is 1. \n\nAdd 1 \u2192 total_recharge is 2. \n\ncurrent_energy becomes 0+1=1 \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 0. \n\nTotal is 2. But the example's explanation says they had to restore 3. \n\nWait the example's explanation says: \n\nThey restored 2 on bench 2 (after arriving there), then 1 on bench 3. \n\nWait, but according to the algorithm, the minimal is 2. So why the discrepancy? \n\nAh, perhaps the example's explanation is not the minimal. Let me see. \n\nWait in the first step, after arriving at bench 2, they have 1 energy left. Then they restore 2, making it 3. Then walk 2 (leaving 1). Then restore 1, making 2, then walk 1. \n\nTotal restored is 3. \n\nBut according to the algorithm, the minimal is 2. How? \n\nAlternative path: \n\nAt bench 1, before moving to bench 2, you can choose to recharge. \n\nWait the algorithm's approach is to recharge only when needed. \n\nLet me see: \n\nAlternative path using the algorithm's approach: \n\nStart at bench 1 with m=2. \n\nBefore moving to bench 2 (distance 1), you can choose to recharge 0. \n\nSo you have 2 energy. Walk 1 \u2192 1 left. \n\nAt bench 2, before moving to bench 3 (distance 2), current energy is 1. \n\nNeed to recharge 1 (so total_recharge +=1). Now energy is 2. \n\nWalk 2 \u2192 0. \n\nAt bench 3, before moving to bench4 (distance 1), current energy is 0. \n\nNeed to recharge 1 (total becomes 2). Now energy is 1. \n\nWalk 1 \u2192 0. \n\nTotal recharge is 2. \n\nSo that's possible. So the example's explanation's approach uses 3, but the minimal is 2. So perhaps the example's explanation is just one possible way, but the minimal is indeed 2. \n\nSo the code's current approach of outputting s - m (sum of a_i's minus m) would give 4-2=2, which matches the correct answer. So in that case, the code's current approach is correct. \n\nWait the first example's total distance is 1+2+1=4. m is 2. So 4-2=2, which is correct. \n\nThe example's explanation's total recharge is 3, but that's not minimal. So the code's approach is correct. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial thought was correct. The minimal required is max(0, total distance - m). \n\nWait why does the algorithm approach give the same result as the total distance minus m? \n\nBecause in the algorithm approach, the total recharge is exactly the sum of the needed amounts, which in the end adds up to (sum a_i - m) if sum a_i > m. \n\nWait let's see: \n\nSuppose the total distance is S. \n\nIf m >= S, then no recharge needed. \n\nElse, the algorithm's approach would require that the sum of all needed recharges equals (S - m). \n\nBecause each time you add needed = a_i - current_energy, and then subtract a_i. \n\nThe total of all needed plus m must equal the total energy used (S). \n\nBecause the initial energy is m, plus the sum of x_i (recharges) equals the total energy used (S). \n\nSo sum x_i = S - m. \n\nTherefore, the minimal required is indeed max(0, S - m). \n\nSo the code's current approach is correct. \n\nThen why in the first example, the algorithm's approach gives 2, which is correct, and the code's formula would also give 4-2=2. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nWait then why the initial confusion? Because I thought there was a step where you can't proceed, but the algorithm shows that the total is indeed S - m. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing part in the code is the while loop's condition. \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */) s += sc.nextInt();\n\nWe need to read n numbers, so the loop must run n times. \n\nThe way to do that is to have a loop that runs n times. \n\nThe current code uses a while loop. The variable n is read from input. \n\nSo the loop can be written as: \n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) s += sc.nextInt();\n\nBut since the code uses a while loop, perhaps the code can use a counter. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a while loop with n-- >0. \n\nSo the condition would be (n-- >0). \n\nSo the code's missing part is (n-- >0). \n\nThus, the line becomes: \n\nwhile(n-- >0) s += sc.nextInt();\n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is correct except for that line. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is \"n-- > 0\" in the while condition. \n\nSo the answer is to fill in the while loop's condition as (n-- >0). \n\nThus, the missing code is \"n-- > 0\"."
