The problem description says there are four divisions with specific rating ranges. The code provided has a main method that reads t test cases. For each case, it reads a rating and then checks some conditions. The current code has an if-else chain. Let me look at the existing conditions. The first condition is if tmp <= 1399, then it's division 4. That's correct because division 4 is for ratings \u22641399. Then else if tmp <=1599, which would be division 3. That's right since division 3 is 1400-1599. Now the next else if is commented with a TODO. The condition here should check for division 2. Division 2 is 1600 \u2264 rating \u22641899. So the current tmp needs to be between 1600 and 1899. Wait, but how does this fit into the existing structure?

Or maybe since the previous conditions have already eliminated lower values, perhaps a simpler condition. Wait, let's think step by step. Let's see the flow: First, if tmp <=1399 \u2192 division4. Else if tmp <=1599 \u2192 that would catch 1400-1599, which is division3. Correct. Then the next else if should be for division2, which is 1600-1899. So the condition here needs to check if tmp is between 1600 and 1899. Since the previous conditions have already handled the cases where tmp was less than 1600 (since after division3's condition, which was tmp <=1599, so the next check can be if tmp is <=1899, then division2. Because if it's not in division4 or 3, then if it's <=1899, it's division2. Otherwise, it's division1 (since division1 is 1900 and above). So the condition for division2's else if can be (tmp <= 1899). Because at this point, tmp is already greater than 1599 (since the previous else if was tmp <=1599, so if we reach this point, tmp is 1600 or higher. So if tmp is <=1899, then division2. Else, the else clause (division1) applies. So the code for the TODO part should be tmp <= 1899. Wait, let me check:\n\nSuppose tmp is 1600: then first two conditions (division4 and 3) are false. Then the next condition (division2's condition) is tmp <=1899 \u2192 yes. So division2. Correct. If tmp is 1900: division4 and 3 are no. Then division2's condition (1900 <=1899? No). So it goes to else, which is division1. Correct. So the condition for division2's else if is \"tmp <= 1899\". Therefore, the code in the TODO spot should be tmp <= 1899. So the line would be else if(tmp <= 1899) then print division2. So the missing code is \"tmp <= 1899\". Let me check the existing code structure again. The current code for the division2 part is:\n\nelse if(/* TODO: Your code here */)\n    System.out.println(ans + \" \" + 2);\n\nSo replacing the comment with tmp <= 1899. Yes, that should work. Let me test some examples. Test case 6: 1679 \u2192 division2. Let's see:\n\ntmp is 1679. First check 1399? No. Then check 1599? 1679>1599, so no. Then check if <=1899 \u2192 yes. So division2. Correct. Another test case: 1900 \u2192 division1. After division4 and 3 checks, then division2's condition: 1900 <=1899? No. So goes to else (division1). Correct.
