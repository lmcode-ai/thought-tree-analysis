So the first B (position 1) is from the first stamp, and the second B (position 2) is from the second stamp's B in RB (so position 2 is B, position 3 is R). Then the pair between 1 and 2 would be B (from first stamp) and B (from second stamp). So that's allowed as the final colors, even though their pair wasn't set by a single stamp. Ah! So the key is that the adjacent pair doesn't have to be set by a single stamp. The two B's can be from different stamps, so their pair doesn't have to be RB or BR. So my previous idea is incorrect.",

Another idea inspired by the code snippet provided:\n\nThe code given in the problem's code skeleton has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe code is incomplete, but the loop is over each test case's string s. The variable b is set to 0, then for each something, it does b |= len({*i}) %2. Then the output is 'YNEOS'[b::2], which would be 'YES' if b is 0, and 'NO' otherwise.",

So what are the groups here? The code's loop is missing, but the original code's incomplete part is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nPerhaps the groups are the runs of non-W characters. For each such run, the set of characters must have even size? Or perhaps the groups are pairs of consecutive characters? Alternatively, perhaps the groups are every pair of consecutive characters in the string. For each pair, the set of their characters must have even size (i.e., they are the same or different?). Wait, the set of two characters can have size 1 (if they are the same) or 2 (if different). So len({*i})%2 would be 1 if they are the same, 0 if different. So if any pair of consecutive characters are the same (and non-W), then the set size is 1, which is odd \u2192 b becomes 1 \u2192 output NO. Ah!

But in the example's string B R B B, the last two B's are consecutive and same \u2192 so the code would output NO, but the example says it's possible. So this can't be right. Hmm, this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem's sample must be handled correctly. Wait, perhaps the groups are the runs of non-W characters. For each such run, the length must be even? Because the set of characters in the run would be {R,B}, which has size 2 (even), but if the run has length 1, then the set size is 1 (odd). So the code is checking that all non-W runs have even length and their characters alternate between R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the groups are the non-W runs, and for each run, the set of characters must be size 2 (i.e., both R and B present), and the length must be even. But the example's run is B R B B \u2192 the set is {B, R}, size 2 (even). The length is 4, which is even. So the code would allow it. Ah! So the code's logic is: For each non-W run:\n\n   the set of characters in the run must have even size (i.e., contains both R and B). Or perhaps the length of the run must be even?",

The length can be any as long as the set has both. But the problem requires that the run has at least two characters. Because a run of length 1 would have set size 1 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 thus, the code's condition catches it. A run of length 3 with both R and B is allowed. For example, \"RBR\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nThus, the code is correct.",

So this seems to fit the example. So the correct conditions are:\n\n- All non-W runs must have length \u2265 2.\n\n- Each non-W run must contain both R and B.\n\nThus, the code's approach is to split the string into non-W runs, and for each run:\n\n   if the set of characters in the run has size 1 \u2192 then it's invalid.\n\n   also, if the length is less than 2 \u2192 invalid. So the code's missing part is iterating over each non-W run, and for each run:\n\n   if the length is less than 2 \u2192 set b to 1.\n\n   else, check if the set of characters has size 1 \u2192 set b to 1. Thus, the code should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   s = the string. split into non-W runs. for each run in runs:\n\n       if len(run) < 2:\n\n           b = 1\n\n       else:\n\n           chars = set(run)\n\n           if len(chars) == 1:\n\n               b = 1\n\n   then output YES or NO based on b. So the code's missing loop is over the runs of non-W characters. The original code's loop is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nPerhaps the code is iterating over each run, and for each run, it checks the set of characters in the run. The code's 'i' is the run. So the code should be:\n\nfor run in runs:\n\n    if len(run) < 2: b = 1\n\n    else:\n\n        s = set(run)\n\n        if len(s) % 2 == 1:\n\n            b = 1\n\nWait, but the code uses len({*i})%2. The set of the run's characters. If the set has size 1 \u2192 1%2=1 \u2192 contributes to b. So the code is correct in that sense. Thus, the missing code is to split the string into runs of non-W characters and loop over them. The code's initial part is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b=0\n\n    for run in (non-W runs):\n\n        if len(run) <2 or len(set(run)) ==1:\n\n            b|=1\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nSo the code needs to split the string into non-W runs. To implement this in Python: The code can be completed as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    runs = []\n\n    current = []\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        if c == 'W':\n\n            if current:\n\n                runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n                current = []\n\n        else:\n\n            current.append(c)\n\n    if current:\n\n        runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n    b = 0\n\n    for run in runs:\n\n        if len(run) < 2 or len(set(run)) == 1:\n\n            b = 1\n\n            break\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2]) Wait, but the code in the problem's template has the loop as:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nSo perhaps the code is written in a way that loops over the runs and for each run, checks the set's length modulo 2. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nfor run in (the runs of non-W characters):\n\n    b |= (len(set(run)) % 2)\n\n    also check the length. Wait, but the code's current approach in the template may not be exactly this. Let me see:\n\nThe original code's loop is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2 The variable 'i' is probably each run. So for each run, the code computes len({*i})%2. The set of characters in the run. If the set has size 1 \u2192 1%2=1 \u2192 contributes to b.\n\nBut this doesn't check the length of the run. So the code as written would miss the case where a run has length 1 but contains both R and B (which is impossible, since length 1 can't have two chars).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells. Each stamp can be either RB or BR, and each application changes both cells to those colors. The key is to find out if the target string can be achieved through any number of such stamp applications.\n\nHmm, the main idea here is to model the possible transitions and see if the target string is reachable. But how?\n\nLet me think of the constraints. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. Each time you stamp, those two cells are set to either RB or BR. But since you can stamp multiple times on the same cells, maybe the order matters, but perhaps there's a pattern in the final string that must hold.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to look at the parity of certain color counts or some pattern in the string. Let me think of possible invariants or necessary conditions.\n\nLet me consider the possible cases:\n\nFirst, note that every stamp operation changes two cells. Each stamp can be thought of as applying either RB or BR to a pair. But since you can do this multiple times, overlapping, maybe the final colors have to satisfy some conditions.\n\nWait, but each time you stamp, you overwrite the previous colors. So the order of stamping might not matter in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the final colors must follow a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the colors must alternate in some way, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of some examples.\n\nTake the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W. The steps show that it's possible. Let's see:\n\nAnother example where the answer is NO: like a single cell that's not W. Since you can't stamp a single cell, so if n=1 and the cell is R or B, it's impossible. So that's a case where the answer is NO.\n\nAnother test case: if the string has a single R and B next to each other. Like \"RB\". Then that can be achieved with one stamp (either way). So that's possible.\n\nWait, but what about \"BR\"? That's also possible with one stamp.\n\nWhat about \"RR\"? Let's see. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose you first stamp at positions 1-2 as BR, making B and R. Then stamp again on the same positions as RB. Wait, each stamp overwrites both cells. So first stamp gives B R. Then stamping again on the same positions would set them to R and B. So that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe \"RR\" is not possible?\n\nWait, let's think of \"RR\". Let's see:\n\nSuppose the initial is WW. To get RR, can we do that?\n\nFirst, stamp at positions 1-2 as RB. That gives B R. Then, stamp again on the same positions as BR. That would set the first to B and second to R again. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible. So the string \"RR\" would return NO.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nLet me think of the possible transitions. Each stamp on a pair of cells can set them to either RB or BR. So each pair must be in a state that can be built by some combination of these operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that every pair of adjacent cells must be part of some overlapping stamps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the colors must follow a certain pattern where no two same colors are adjacent except in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary condition is that every occurrence of a non-white color must be part of a pair that can be formed by the stamps. Wait, but since the stamps can be applied multiple times, maybe overlapping, perhaps the colors can be in any configuration as long as certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the parity of the colors. Let me think of each cell's color as being determined by an even or odd number of stamps affecting it.\n\nWait, each time a cell is under a stamp, its color is set to either R or B, depending on the direction of the stamp. But since each stamp overwrites the previous color, the final color depends on the last stamp that affected it. So the order of stamps matters in a way that the last stamp on each cell determines its color.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Because the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. So, for example, if a cell is part of multiple stamps, only the last one's effect remains.\n\nThis makes it tricky to model. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the final string. Let's denote the final string as s[0..n-1].\n\nEach stamp affects two consecutive cells. Let's think of each pair of consecutive cells. For the entire string to be achievable, perhaps the following must hold:\n\nFor every position i from 0 to n-2, the pair (s[i], s[i+1]) must be achievable through some combination of stamps. But since each stamp can be applied multiple times, perhaps overlapping, maybe the pairs can be in any combination except certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, any two adjacent cells must not both be white. Wait no, because the initial state is all white, and you can choose not to stamp any cells. So if the target is all white, that's allowed (since zero stamps). But if the target has two adjacent non-white cells, that's okay.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach: Let's consider that each stamp operation can be thought of as toggling the colors of two adjacent cells in a specific way. But since each stamp overwrites the previous colors, perhaps the final colors must form a pattern where every non-white cell is part of a pair that can be formed by some stamp.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that there are no two consecutive cells that are both R or both B. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is B R B B W. The third and fourth cells are both B. So that's allowed. So that condition is not correct.\n\nHmm, so that idea is wrong.\n\nAnother thought: Let's consider that each stamp can be applied in either direction (RB or BR). So for any two adjacent cells, their colors must be either R and B in some order, or one of them could be white? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that any occurrence of a non-white color must be part of a pair that can be formed by a stamp. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, maybe overlapping, perhaps the colors can be in any configuration except when there's an isolated single non-white cell.\n\nWait, like if n is 1 and the cell is non-white, then it's impossible. That's one case.\n\nAnother case: if there's a single non-white cell, then it's impossible. Because every stamp affects two cells. So you can't have a single R or B. So any occurrence of a single non-white cell (with all others white) would be impossible.\n\nSo for example, the string \"R\" (n=1) is impossible. \"B\" is also impossible. \"W\" is possible (zero stamps).\n\nAnother example: \"RW\" (n=2). To get R and W, can that be done?\n\nWait, let's see. The initial is WW. To get RW, you need to have the first cell R and second W. But each stamp on positions 1-2 would set them to either RB or BR. So after one stamp, you can't have W in the second cell. So \"RW\" is impossible. So the answer would be NO.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that any non-white cell must be part of a pair that was stamped. So perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All non-white cells must form pairs in such a way that they can be covered by overlapping or adjacent stamps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the colors must alternate in a way that no two same non-white colors are adjacent except in certain cases. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the parity of the number of times each cell is stamped. Wait, but since each stamp overwrites the cell's color, the final color depends only on the last stamp applied to it. So maybe the problem can be modeled by considering that each cell's color is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach: For each position i, the color must be either R or B only if it was the last stamp's effect. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the colors must form a sequence where every non-white cell is part of a pair of adjacent non-white cells. Because each stamp affects two cells. So if there's a single non-white cell, it's impossible. So the first condition is that all non-white cells must be in pairs or longer sequences.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem, the final string is B R B B W. The first three cells are B, R, B. The first and second form a BR pair (from a stamp), the second and third form RB (from another stamp?), but the third and fourth are both B. Hmm, how did that happen?\n\nWait, in the example's steps:\n\nThe third step is after applying the stamp on positions 2-3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but perhaps the exact steps aren't important. The key is that the final string has two B's in a row, which is allowed.\n\nSo, two B's in a row is okay. So the condition isn't that adjacent non-white must be different.\n\nHmm, so maybe the key is that any occurrence of a non-white color must be part of a pair that can be formed by some stamp, but overlapping with others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: the entire string must be such that every non-white cell is part of at least one pair of adjacent cells that are either RB or BR. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, maybe overlapping, perhaps the colors can form any pattern except when there's an isolated single non-white.\n\nWait, but how to formalize this?\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the stamps as operations that can set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. Each time you apply a stamp, you can choose either of the two options for those two cells. The order of operations doesn't matter except for the last one on each cell.\n\nThe final colors must be such that for every cell, its color is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. So for each cell, it must have been part of a stamp's pair, and the direction (RB or BR) of that last stamp determines its color.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking whether there exists a way to assign directions (RB or BR) to overlapping pairs such that the final colors match the target string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model this as a graph or some kind of constraints between adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the string as a sequence of colors. Let's process it from left to right and see if we can assign the direction of each pair such that the colors are consistent.\n\nSuppose we have the string s. Let's consider each pair of consecutive cells s[i] and s[i+1]. For each such pair, the last stamp applied to them must have been either RB or BR. So the pair (s[i], s[i+1]) must be either RB, BR, or one of them could be white? Wait no, because the stamp can only set them to RB or BR. So if either of them is white, that would mean that no stamp was applied to that pair in the last step. But maybe a previous stamp was applied, but then overwritten by another stamp that didn't involve this pair.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern in the colors that must hold.\n\nLet me think of the following: For the entire string, every occurrence of a non-white color must be part of a pair with its neighbor. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that there are no two consecutive white cells followed by a non-white, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: Each stamp affects two cells. So the total number of non-white cells must be even? Because each stamp adds two non-white cells. Wait, but you can stamp the same pair multiple times. For example, stamping a pair twice would set them to the second stamp's colors, so the first stamp's effect is erased. So the total number of non-white cells can be anything, even or odd.\n\nHmm, so that idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each cell's color is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. For each cell, it must have been part of at least one stamp (unless it's white). Wait, no. Because if a cell is white, that means that the last stamp applied to it (if any) must have set it back to white? No, because stamps can't set a cell back to white. Once a cell is set to R or B by a stamp, it can only be changed again by another stamp that affects it. So a cell can only be white if no stamp has been applied to it at all. Because once a stamp is applied to it, it becomes R or B, and subsequent stamps can change it again, but never back to white.\n\nAh! That's an important point. So any cell that is white in the final string must have never been part of any stamp. Because once a stamp is applied to it, it can't be white again. So, for the final string, all white cells must not have been part of any stamp. But the non-white cells must have been part of at least one stamp (the last one that affected them).\n\nTherefore, the white cells must form intervals where no stamp was applied over them. Because if a stamp was applied to any pair overlapping a white cell, that would have set that cell to R or B, contradicting it being white.\n\nSo, the white cells must form contiguous blocks where no stamp was applied over them. But how does this help?\n\nWait, the key insight here is that any white cell must not be part of any stamp's application. Because once a stamp is applied to a pair including that cell, it can't be white anymore. So, the white cells must be in regions where no stamp was ever applied. So, the non-white regions must be such that they can be covered by overlapping pairs of stamps, but the white regions must be between these non-white regions and not be touched by any stamp.\n\nHmm, so the white regions must be such that they are not covered by any stamp. So, the non-white regions must be in such a way that they can be formed by overlapping stamps, and the white regions are separated by these non-white regions.\n\nAlternatively, the white cells must form intervals where between any two non-white regions, there are no white cells. Wait, perhaps the white cells can't be between two non-white regions unless they are part of a stamp's pair?\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to formalize the conditions.\n\nFirst condition: All white cells must not be part of any stamp's application. So, any white cell must not be in any pair that was stamped. Therefore, the white cells must form blocks where no stamp was applied over them. So, the non-white regions must be such that they can be covered by overlapping pairs of stamps, and the white regions are in between.\n\nWait, but how can the non-white regions be covered by stamps? Let's think of the non-white regions as sequences of R and B. Each such sequence must be formed by a series of overlapping stamps.\n\nAnother thought: The non-white regions must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive cells is either RB or BR. Because each stamp can set a pair to either of those. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, perhaps the entire non-white region must be a sequence where each adjacent pair is either RB or BR. Because otherwise, there's no way to form that sequence with the stamps.\n\nWait, that might be the key. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the non-white part of the string must form a sequence where every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. Because each stamp can set a pair to either of those, and overlapping stamps can build up the sequence.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is B R B B W. The non-white part is B R B B. Let's look at the pairs:\n\nB and R: that's BR (so possible from a stamp).\n\nR and B: RB (possible).\n\nB and B: that's BB. Which is not allowed as a pair from a single stamp. So how does that happen?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The B and B pair can't be formed by a single stamp. So how is that possible?\n\nHmm, so maybe my previous idea is wrong. Let me see the example again.\n\nIn the example's final string, the third and fourth characters are both B. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the steps provided:\n\nThe third step is after applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (assuming 0-based?), but let me retrace the steps:\n\nThe example's steps:\n\nStart with W W W W W.\n\nFirst stamp applied on positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), resulting in W W W R B.\n\nThen, the next stamp is applied on positions 0-1, making B R R B W.\n\nWait, maybe the exact steps aren't important, but the final string has B R B B W. The third and fourth are B and B.\n\nSo how did that happen?\n\nPerhaps the last stamp applied to positions 2-3 was BR, which would set them to B and R. But then another stamp on positions 3-4 as BR would set the third to B and fourth to R? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe overlapping stamps can lead to such a situation.\n\nWait, let's think of the B B pair. To get two B's in a row, perhaps the last stamp applied to the first B was part of a BR pair (so the first B is the B in BR), and the second B was part of an RB pair (so the second B is the B in RB). But then the pair between them would be R and B, which is allowed. Wait, but the two B's are adjacent. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first B is from a stamp that set it as the B in BR (so the previous cell was R), and the second B is from a stamp that set it as the B in RB (so the next cell is R). But then between them, the first B and the second B would have to be part of some overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two B's are part of a pair that was not the last stamp. For example, suppose the first B was set by a stamp as the B in BR, and then another stamp on the next pair (positions 2-3) as RB, which would set the second B as the B in RB. So the two B's are adjacent, but their last stamps are from different pairs. So the pair between them (positions 1-2) would have been set by the first stamp (BR) and then overwritten by the second stamp (RB) on positions 2-3? Wait, no. The second stamp on positions 2-3 would affect cells 2 and 3. So the first B (position 1) is from the first stamp, and the second B (position 2) is from the second stamp's B in RB (so position 2 is B, position 3 is R). Then the pair between 1 and 2 would be B (from first stamp) and B (from second stamp). So that's allowed as the final colors, even though their pair wasn't set by a single stamp.\n\nAh! So the key is that the adjacent pair doesn't have to be set by a single stamp. The two B's can be from different stamps, so their pair doesn't have to be RB or BR. So my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. So the adjacent pairs can be anything, as long as each individual cell's color is set by some stamp's application.\n\nSo perhaps the only constraints are:\n\n1. All white cells must not be part of any stamp's application. So any white cell must be such that neither it nor its neighbors (except possibly the ends) were part of any stamp's pair. Wait, no. Because if a white cell is at position i, then any stamp applied to positions i-1 and i would have set it to R or B, so that can't happen. Similarly for i and i+1. So the white cells must be isolated in the sense that no stamp was applied to any pair that includes them.\n\nTherefore, the white cells must form blocks where between any two non-white regions, there are no white cells except in regions that are not covered by any stamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the white regions must be such that they are not between any two non-white regions. Because if there is a white cell between two non-white regions, then that white cell must not be part of any stamp. But the non-white regions on either side must be formed by stamps that don't include the white cell. So the non-white regions must be separated by white cells, but those white cells can't be part of any stamp.\n\nAlternatively, the white cells can be anywhere, but the non-white regions must form sequences where each non-white cell is part of at least one stamp, and the stamps can be arranged such that their overlapping covers the non-white regions.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells. The final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that was applied to it. So for a cell to be white, no stamp was ever applied to it. For a cell to be R or B, it must have been part of at least one stamp, and the last stamp's direction determined its color.\n\nTherefore, the white cells must form intervals where no stamp was applied to any pair that includes them. So, the white cells must be in regions where no stamp was applied. The non-white regions must be covered by some stamps, possibly overlapping.\n\nNow, the non-white regions must form a sequence where each cell is part of at least one stamp. Moreover, the sequence of non-white cells must be such that they can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps.\n\nWait, but how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is that in the non-white regions, every pair of consecutive cells must be part of at least one stamp. But since each stamp can be applied multiple times, perhaps the sequence can be any combination except when there's an isolated single non-white cell.\n\nWait, but the non-white regions can have any length as long as they are covered by overlapping stamps. For example, a sequence of three non-white cells can be covered by two overlapping stamps (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Each of those stamps sets their pair to either RB or BR. The middle cell (position 1) is part of both stamps, so its final color depends on the last stamp applied there.\n\nHmm, but how to ensure that the entire sequence can be built up by such stamps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-white regions must form a sequence where every two consecutive cells are either RB or BR. Because each pair must have been set by a stamp. But overlapping pairs can allow for longer sequences.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the final string has B R B B. The last two B's are adjacent. So their pair is BB, which can't be set by a single stamp. But since they are part of different stamps, maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, the pair of the two B's (positions 2 and 3 in the example) must have been set by some stamp. But a stamp on positions 2-3 would set them to either RB or BR. So to have both B's, the last stamp applied to that pair must have been BR (so position 2 is B and 3 is R?), but then the third B would have to come from another stamp. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-white region must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive cells is either RB or BR. Because each pair must have been set by a stamp. But overlapping pairs can allow for longer sequences.\n\nWait, let's see the example's non-white part: B R B B.\n\nBreaking it down into pairs:\n\nB and R: BR (okay, from a stamp).\n\nR and B: RB (okay).\n\nB and B: BB (not allowed by a single stamp). So this pair can't be set by a single stamp. So how is this possible?\n\nAh, perhaps the last stamp applied to the third and fourth cells (the two B's) was not the one that set them both. For example, the third B could have been set by a stamp on positions 1-2 (as B in BR), and the fourth B could have been set by a stamp on positions 3-4 (as B in RB). But then the pair between them (positions 2-3) would have been set by the first stamp (position 2 is B) and the second stamp (position 3 is R?), so the pair would be B and R, which is allowed. Wait, but the third cell is B and the fourth is B. So that would require that the fourth cell's last stamp was something else.\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following necessary conditions:\n\n1. All white cells must not be part of any stamp. So any white cell must be such that neither it nor its neighbors (except possibly the ends) were part of any stamp. Wait, no. For example, a white cell at position i can have a stamp applied to i-1 and i, but that would set the white cell to R or B, which contradicts it being white. So the white cell must not be part of any stamp's pair. So for a white cell at position i, there can be no stamp applied to (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). So the white cells must be isolated in the sense that they are not part of any stamped pair.\n\nTherefore, the white cells must form blocks where between any two non-white regions, there are no white cells except in regions that are not covered by any stamp.\n\nWait, perhaps the white cells can be anywhere, but the non-white regions must be such that they form a single contiguous block? No, because the example has a white at the end.\n\nAlternatively, the non-white regions can be multiple, but separated by white regions. But each non-white region must be a sequence that can be formed by overlapping stamps.\n\nSo the key is that each non-white region must be a sequence where every pair of consecutive cells is either RB or BR. Because each pair must have been set by a stamp. Because even if they are part of overlapping stamps, each pair must have been set by at least one stamp (the last one affecting them).\n\nWait, that's an important point. For any two consecutive non-white cells, the pair must have been set by a stamp. Because otherwise, how did they get their colors? Because each cell's color is set by the last stamp applied to it, but the pair between them must have been set by some stamp (the last one affecting either of them).\n\nWait, suppose two consecutive non-white cells are not part of any stamp's pair. Then their colors were set by stamps applied to other pairs. But that's impossible because the only way a cell's color is set is by being in a stamped pair. So for two consecutive non-white cells, the pair must have been set by at least one stamp (the last one affecting either of them). But the stamp that set the pair must have set them to either RB or BR. So the pair must be either RB or BR.\n\nAh! So this is the key condition. For any two consecutive non-white cells, their pair must be either RB or BR. Because otherwise, there's no way they could have been set to those colors.\n\nSo the necessary and sufficient condition is:\n\n- All white cells are not part of any stamped pair (so they are isolated as per the earlier condition).\n\n- For every pair of consecutive non-white cells, their colors must be either RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, any non-white cell must be part of at least one stamped pair (so that it's not white).\n\nWait, but how do we handle the white cells?\n\nLet me formalize the conditions:\n\nThe string is possible if and only if:\n\n1. All white cells are not part of any pair of consecutive non-white cells. Wait, no. The white cells can be anywhere, but between non-white regions, but the non-white regions must satisfy the pair condition.\n\nWait, the white cells can be anywhere, but the non-white regions must form sequences where every two consecutive characters are RB or BR.\n\nSo the steps to check are:\n\n- For every position i where s[i] is not W, check that either:\n\n   a. It is the first character and the next is W or part of a valid pair.\n\n   b. The previous character (if non-W) forms a valid pair with it (either RB or BR).\n\n   c. The next character (if non-W) forms a valid pair with it.\n\nWait, no. The key is that in the non-white regions, every consecutive pair must be RB or BR.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor the entire string:\n\n- Check that every occurrence of a non-W character is part of a non-W region where every consecutive pair in that region is either RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, any W must not be between two non-W regions in a way that would require it to be part of a stamped pair.\n\nWait, but the W's can be anywhere, as long as they are not part of any stamped pair. So the non-W regions must be such that they are sequences where every consecutive pair is RB or BR, and the W's are in between or at the ends.\n\nSo the steps to check are:\n\n1. Split the string into segments of non-W characters separated by W's.\n\n2. For each such segment, check that it is a valid sequence where every consecutive pair is either RB or BR.\n\n3. Additionally, any single non-W character (a segment of length 1) is invalid, because you can't have a single non-W (since it would require a stamp that affects it and its neighbor, but the neighbor is W, which can't be part of a stamp).\n\nWait, exactly! Because a single non-W character would mean that it was part of a stamp, but its neighbor (which is W) must also be part of that stamp. But the W can't be part of any stamp. Contradiction. So any segment of non-W characters must have even length? No, wait, no. Because a segment of length 1 is impossible. Because to have a single non-W, you must have applied a stamp to it and its neighbor, but the neighbor is W, which would have to be part of the stamp, making it non-W. So a single non-W is impossible.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W segments must have length at least 2.\n\n- Each non-W segment must be a sequence where every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\n- Additionally, the entire string can have W's anywhere, but the non-W segments must satisfy the above.\n\nWait, but what about a segment of length 3? Like RBR. Let's see:\n\nThe pairs are R-B (okay), B-R (okay). So that's allowed.\n\nAnother example: RBRB. The pairs are all okay.\n\nA segment of length 2: RB or BR is okay.\n\nA segment of length 3: like RBR is okay.\n\nA segment of length 4: like RBRB is okay.\n\nBut a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nFor each non-W segment:\n\n- Its length is at least 2.\n\n- Every consecutive pair in the segment is either RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string can have W's anywhere else.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nThe steps for each test case:\n\nRead the string s.\n\nSplit it into non-W segments. For each segment:\n\n   if the length is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\n   else, check every consecutive pair in the segment is RB or BR.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, output NO. Else YES.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping segments? No, the segments are separated by W's, so they are independent.\n\nWait, but the segments are separated by W's, so each segment is a maximal run of non-W characters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n and s.\n\n   Split s into non-W segments.\n\n   For each segment in the segments:\n\n      if len(segment) < 2 \u2192 return NO.\n\n      for i from 0 to len(segment)-2:\n\n          pair = segment[i], segment[i+1]\n\n          if pair not in {'RB', 'BR'} \u2192 return NO.\n\n   If all passed \u2192 YES else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a segment has length 1? Then it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example from the problem:\n\nThe final string is B R B B W \u2192 the non-W segments are \"BRBB\".\n\nCheck the length is 4 \u22652.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nB R \u2192 BR \u2192 okay.\n\nR B \u2192 RB \u2192 okay.\n\nB B \u2192 BB \u2192 not allowed. So according to this logic, this would return NO, but the example says it's possible.\n\nWait, this is a problem. The example's segment is \"BRBB\".\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B. Their pair is BB, which is invalid. So according to this logic, the answer would be NO, but the example says it's possible. So my logic is wrong.\n\nHmm, so this approach is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W. The segment is \"BRBB\".\n\nThe pairs are BR, RB, BB. The last pair is BB which is invalid. But according to the problem statement, this is a valid case. So my condition is wrong.\n\nSo my previous reasoning is incorrect. So I need to rethink.\n\nHmm, so why is the example allowed even though there's a BB pair?\n\nBecause the BB pair doesn't have to be set by a single stamp. The two B's could have been set by different stamps.\n\nFor instance, the first B could be from a stamp that set it as the B in BR (so the previous cell was R), and the second B could be from a stamp that set it as the B in RB (so the next cell is R). But in this case, the two B's are adjacent, so their pair is BB, but they were set by different stamps.\n\nSo the condition that every consecutive pair must be RB or BR is not necessary.\n\nSo my previous approach is wrong. Need to think differently.\n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition?\n\nAlternative idea: The entire sequence of non-W must form a sequence where every character except the first and last can be part of two pairs (with previous and next), but each pair must be RB or BR. But that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must alternate between R and B. But the example has B R B B, which ends with two B's, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as a graph where each state is the current color of the last cell, and transitions are based on the next color.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-W segments must form a sequence where each character is either R or B, and the entire sequence can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. Each stamp contributes a pair of R/B or B/R.\n\nThe key is that the sequence can be built by overlapping pairs. For example, the sequence BRBB can be formed as follows:\n\nFirst stamp: positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp: positions 2-3 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R. But then the third character would be B, and fourth R. So the sequence would be B R B R. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nSuppose the sequence is B R B B.\n\nLet me see how this could be formed:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is applied to positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp applied to positions 1-2 \u2192 RB \u2192 R B. So after this, the sequence is B (from first stamp's B), then R and B from the second stamp's RB. So the first three characters are B R B.\n\nThird stamp applied to positions 2-3 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R. So the fourth character becomes R. So the sequence is B R B R. Not matching.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\nFirst stamp on positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R.\n\nSecond stamp on positions 1-2 \u2192 BR \u2192 R B. So the second and third are R B. So the first three are B R B.\n\nThird stamp on positions 2-3 \u2192 RB \u2192 B R. So fourth is R. Still not.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third and fourth B's are from a stamp applied to positions 2-3 as RB, which would set them to R and B. But then the third character would be B from the second stamp and R from the third? No, the last stamp on position 2 would be the third stamp's R, so the third character would be R. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's final string is formed by overlapping stamps in a way that the two B's are allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence B R B B can be formed by the following steps:\n\nInitial: W W W W W.\n\nStamp 1: positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R W W W.\n\nStamp 2: positions 1-2 \u2192 RB \u2192 B R B W W.\n\nStamp 3: positions 2-3 \u2192 BR \u2192 B R B B W.\n\nAh! There we go. So the third stamp is applied to positions 2-3, setting them to B and R. Wait no, BR would set them to B and R. So the third character would be B (from stamp 2's RB) and the fourth would be B (from stamp 3's BR's first position? No, the third stamp on positions 2-3 would set position 2 to B and 3 to R. So after stamp 3, the fourth character (position 3) would be R. So the sequence would be B R B R W. Not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the example's final string is B R B B W. Let me see the steps given in the problem:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: W W W W W.\n\nFirst stamp applied to positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based) as RB \u2192 W W W R B.\n\nSecond stamp applied to positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R R B W.\n\nThird stamp applied to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 B R B B W.\n\nAh! So the third stamp is applied to positions 1-2 (which are R and R after the second step). The third stamp is RB, so it sets them to R and B. Wait, no: the stamp can be either RB or BR. So applying RB to positions 1-2 would set them to R and B. But the second character was R (from the first stamp's BR?), so after the third stamp, position 1 becomes R (same as before?), and position 2 becomes B. So the sequence after third step is:\n\nPosition 0: B (from second stamp's BR).\n\nPosition 1: R (from third stamp's first part).\n\nPosition 2: B (from third stamp's second part).\n\nPosition 3: R (from first stamp's RB).\n\nPosition 4: B (from first stamp's RB).\n\nWait, but the third stamp is applied to positions 1-2. So after that, positions 1 and 2 are set to R and B (if using RB) or B and R (if using BR). The example's final string after third step is B R B B W. So positions 2 and 3 must be B and B.\n\nAh, so perhaps the third stamp was applied as BR to positions 1-2:\n\nStamp 3: positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 so position 1 becomes B and position 2 becomes R. But that would change the second character from R to B, which would not match the example's final string.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the example's steps. The problem's example says:\n\nThe third step is after applying the stamp on positions 1-2 (assuming the second step was on 0-1 and first on 3-4). The third stamp is applied to positions 1-2 as RB, which would set them to R and B. But the second character was already R (from the second stamp's BR), so after the third stamp, position 1 is R (unchanged?), and position 2 becomes B. So the third character (position 2) is B, and the fourth (position 3) is R from the first stamp. So the fourth character would be R, not B. So the final string would be B R B R B, but the example's final string is B R B B W. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third stamp is applied to positions 2-3. Let's see:\n\nAfter the second step (B R R B W), applying a stamp to positions 2-3 as BR would set them to B and R. So position 2 becomes B, position 3 becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R W. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should think of another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be represented as a series of overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R. So the sequence can be any length, but every character except the first and last must be part of two pairs (with previous and next), and each pair must be either RB or BR.\n\nWait, but the example's sequence B R B B has the third and fourth as B B. The third B is part of the pair with the second R (RB) and the fourth B (BB). The fourth B has no next character (since it's the last), but the third and fourth pair is BB, which is invalid. So this would violate the condition, but the example says it's possible. So this approach is also wrong.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nEach stamp affects two cells. The final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp applied to it. So for each cell, it must have been part of at least one stamp (if it's non-W), and the last stamp's direction determines its color.\n\nThe key is that for any two adjacent cells, their colors must be compatible with being set by some stamp. But since they could have been set by different stamps, their pair doesn't have to be RB or BR. However, there must be a way to choose the stamps such that all the colors are explained.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a greedy approach or by checking certain parity conditions.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the entire string and see if it can be covered by a series of overlapping pairs of R/B or B/R.\n\nEach pair must be either RB or BR. The pairs can overlap, and the entire sequence must be covered by these pairs such that every non-W cell is covered by at least one pair, and the overlapping pairs' colors agree.\n\nThis sounds like the problem of tiling the string with overlapping tiles of size 2, where each tile is either RB or BR, and the tiles must cover all non-W cells.\n\nThe tiles can overlap, but the colors must be consistent.\n\nThis is similar to a string being covered by overlapping pairs of RB or BR.\n\nSo the question reduces to whether the non-W parts of the string can be covered by such tiles.\n\nTo check this, we can model it as follows:\n\nFor the non-W segments, we can try to cover them with overlapping pairs of RB or BR.\n\nThe first two characters must be either RB or BR.\n\nThe next character must form a valid pair with the previous one, and so on.\n\nWait, this is similar to the previous approach but perhaps the condition is that the entire sequence must alternate between R and B, but allowing for some flexibility.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor the example's segment BRBB:\n\nThe first two are BR (okay).\n\nThe next pair is RB (positions 1-2: R and B \u2192 RB).\n\nThe next pair is BB (positions 2-3: B and B \u2192 invalid).\n\nSo this would fail, but the example says it's possible. So this approach is also incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the sample:\n\nThe example's final string is B R B B W.\n\nThe non-W part is B R B B.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\nB R \u2192 BR (okay).\n\nR B \u2192 RB (okay).\n\nB B \u2192 BB (invalid).\n\nBut the example is possible. So the condition must allow for such a case.\n\nSo what's different here?\n\nThe third and fourth B's are part of a pair that was not the last stamp applied to them. For example, the fourth B could have been set by a stamp applied to positions 3-4 (but that would require the fifth character to be non-W, which it is W, so that's not possible).\n\nAlternatively, the fourth B could be the result of a stamp applied to positions 2-3 as BR, which would set position 2 to B and 3 to R. But then the third character would be R, not B.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: The colors must alternate between R and B, but with possibly two consecutive B's or R's allowed if they are part of overlapping stamps.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the entire non-W sequence must be such that every R is followed by a B or preceded by a B, and every B is followed by an R or preceded by an R, except possibly at the ends.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of R's and B's must be equal? No, in the example there are two B's and one R in the non-W part (B R B B has three B's and one R).\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea inspired by the code snippet provided:\n\nThe code given in the problem's code skeleton has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe code is incomplete, but the loop is over each test case's string s. The variable b is set to 0, then for each something, it does b |= len({*i}) %2. Then the output is 'YNEOS'[b::2], which would be 'YES' if b is 0, and 'NO' otherwise.\n\nThe code seems to be checking for some condition where for each group, the length of the set of characters in that group is even or odd.\n\nThe line 'YNEOS'[b::2] is a clever way to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on b being 0 or not. For example, if b is 0, then [0::2] is 'YNEOS'[0], 'YNEOS'[2], etc. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe string 'YNEOS' is length 5. The slice [b::2] starts at index b and takes every second character.\n\nIf b is 0: 'YNEOS'[0::2] is 'YNS' \u2192 but the code uses 'YNEOS'[b::2], then the print statement is 'YNEOS'[b::2], which would be 'YNS' but the desired output is 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written as:\n\nprint('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nIf b is 0: the slice starts at 0, step 2 \u2192 characters 0,2,4 \u2192 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 'YES'.\n\nIf b is 1: starts at 1 \u2192 'N', 'O' \u2192 'NO'.\n\nAh, right! So the code is using this trick to output 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether b is 0 or not.\n\nThe code's loop is for each test case's string s, then for some iteration over parts of the string, it computes whether the length of the set of characters in each part is even or odd, and sets b to 1 if any such set has an odd length.\n\nSo the condition is that for every group, the set of characters in the group must have even size. Because if any group has an odd-sized set (like a single character), then b becomes 1 and the answer is NO.\n\nSo what are the groups here?\n\nThe code's loop is missing, but the original code's incomplete part is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nPerhaps the groups are the runs of non-W characters. For each such run, the set of characters must have even size? Or perhaps the groups are pairs of consecutive characters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the groups are every pair of consecutive characters in the string. For each pair, the set of their characters must have even size (i.e., they are the same or different?).\n\nWait, the set of two characters can have size 1 (if they are the same) or 2 (if different). So len({*i})%2 would be 1 if they are the same, 0 if different.\n\nSo if any pair of consecutive characters are the same (and non-W), then the set size is 1, which is odd \u2192 b becomes 1 \u2192 output NO.\n\nAh! So the code is checking that no two consecutive non-W characters are the same. Because if they are the same, then the set size is 1 (odd), so the condition is violated.\n\nSo the condition is that in the entire string, there are no two consecutive non-W characters that are the same. Because if there are, then the answer is NO.\n\nBut in the example's string B R B B, the last two B's are consecutive and same \u2192 so the code would output NO, but the example says it's possible. So this can't be right.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem's sample must be handled correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the groups are the runs of non-W characters. For each such run, the length must be even?\n\nBecause the set of characters in the run would be {R,B}, which has size 2 (even), but if the run has length 1, then the set size is 1 (odd).\n\nSo the code is checking that all non-W runs have even length and their characters alternate between R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the groups are the non-W runs, and for each run, the set of characters must be size 2 (i.e., both R and B present), and the length must be even.\n\nBut the example's run is B R B B \u2192 the set is {B, R}, size 2 (even). The length is 4, which is even. So the code would allow it.\n\nAh! So the code's logic is:\n\nFor each non-W run:\n\n   the set of characters in the run must have even size (i.e., contains both R and B).\n\n   Or perhaps the length of the run must be even?\n\nWait, the code's loop is for each group (perhaps each run of non-W characters), and for each group, compute the set of characters in the group. If the size of the set is odd (i.e., only one type of non-W), then b is set to 1.\n\nSo the condition is that every non-W run must contain both R and B. Because if a run has only R's or only B's, then the set size is 1 (odd), which would set b to 1 \u2192 output NO.\n\nIn the example's run B R B B:\n\nThe set is {B, R} \u2192 size 2 (even), so okay.\n\nA run of all B's would have set size 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nA run of length 1 (e.g., 'R') would have set size 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All non-W runs must have length \u2265 2.\n\n- Each non-W run must contain both R and B.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nFor each non-W run:\n\n   if the set of characters in the run has size 1 \u2192 then it's invalid.\n\nSo the code is checking that every non-W run has both R and B.\n\nThis would explain the example's case being valid.\n\nAnother test case: the string \"BB\" \u2192 the run has set size 1 \u2192 invalid \u2192 output NO.\n\nThe string \"BR\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 valid \u2192 YES.\n\nThe string \"BRRB\" \u2192 the set is {B, R} \u2192 valid.\n\nThe string \"BRBR\" \u2192 valid.\n\nThe string \"B\" \u2192 run length 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nThe string \"W\" \u2192 no non-W runs \u2192 valid (YES).\n\nThe string \"RBRB\" \u2192 valid.\n\nThe string \"BRBB\" \u2192 the run has B and R \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo this seems to fit the example.\n\nSo the correct conditions are:\n\n- All non-W runs must have length \u2265 2.\n\n- Each non-W run must contain both R and B.\n\nThus, the code's approach is to split the string into non-W runs, and for each run:\n\n   if the set of characters in the run has size 1 \u2192 then it's invalid.\n\n   also, if the length is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the code's missing part is iterating over each non-W run, and for each run:\n\n   if the length is less than 2 \u2192 set b to 1.\n\n   else, check if the set of characters has size 1 \u2192 set b to 1.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   s = the string.\n\n   split into non-W runs.\n\n   for each run in runs:\n\n       if len(run) < 2:\n\n           b = 1\n\n       else:\n\n           chars = set(run)\n\n           if len(chars) == 1:\n\n               b = 1\n\n   then output YES or NO based on b.\n\nSo the code's missing loop is over the runs of non-W characters.\n\nThe original code's loop is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nPerhaps the code is iterating over each run, and for each run, it checks the set of characters in the run. The code's 'i' is the run.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor run in runs:\n\n    if len(run) < 2:\n\n        b = 1\n\n    else:\n\n        s = set(run)\n\n        if len(s) % 2 == 1:\n\n            b = 1\n\nWait, but the code uses len({*i})%2. The set of the run's characters. If the set has size 1 \u2192 1%2=1 \u2192 contributes to b.\n\nSo the code is correct in that sense.\n\nThus, the missing code is to split the string into runs of non-W characters and loop over them.\n\nThe code's initial part is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b=0\n\n    for run in (non-W runs):\n\n        if len(run) <2 or len(set(run)) ==1:\n\n            b|=1\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nSo the code needs to split the string into non-W runs.\n\nTo implement this in Python:\n\nThe code can be completed as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    runs = []\n\n    current = []\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        if c == 'W':\n\n            if current:\n\n                runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n                current = []\n\n        else:\n\n            current.append(c)\n\n    if current:\n\n        runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n    b = 0\n\n    for run in runs:\n\n        if len(run) < 2 or len(set(run)) == 1:\n\n            b = 1\n\n            break\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's template has the loop as:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nSo perhaps the code is written in a way that loops over the runs and for each run, checks the set's length modulo 2.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor run in (the runs of non-W characters):\n\n    b |= (len(set(run)) % 2)\n\n    also check the length.\n\nWait, but the code's current approach in the template may not be exactly this. Let me see:\n\nThe original code's loop is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nThe variable 'i' is probably each run. So for each run, the code computes len({*i})%2. The set of characters in the run. If the set has size 1 \u2192 1%2=1 \u2192 contributes to b.\n\nBut this doesn't check the length of the run. So the code as written would miss the case where a run has length 1 but contains both R and B (which is impossible, since length 1 can't have two chars).\n\nWait, a run of length 1 can only have one character, so the set size is 1. So the code's condition of checking the set size's parity would catch that.\n\nBut the code also needs to check that the run length is at least 2.\n\nAh, right! Because a run of length 1 will have set size 1 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 so the code's condition would catch it.\n\nThus, the code's logic is sufficient:\n\nFor each run:\n\n   if the set size is odd \u2192 which happens when the run has only one type of non-W character (set size 1) or three types (but there are only two non-W types).\n\nThus, the code's condition of checking whether the set size is odd covers both cases:\n\n- runs of length 1 (set size 1 \u2192 odd).\n\n- runs with all R's or all B's (set size 1 \u2192 odd).\n\n- runs with both R and B (set size 2 \u2192 even \u2192 okay).\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo the missing code is to split the string into runs of non-W characters and loop over them.\n\nThe code's initial part is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b=0\n\n    for # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe missing part is the loop over the runs of non-W characters.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    runs = []\n\n    current = []\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        if c == 'W':\n\n            if current:\n\n                runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n                current = []\n\n            else:\n\n                continue\n\n        else:\n\n            current.append(c)\n\n    if current:\n\n        runs.append(''.join(current))\n\n    b = 0\n\n    for run in runs:\n\n        b |= len(set(run)) % 2\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nWait, but the code in the problem's template uses 'b|= ...' inside the loop. So the initial code's loop is:\n\nfor run in runs:\n\n    b |= len(set(run)) %2\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the missing code is the part that splits the string into runs of non-W characters and loops over them.\n\nThe code's initial loop is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    b=0\n\n    for # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe missing code is the loop over the runs.

(code to build runs)\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written more concisely.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written using a generator expression to split the string into runs.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that generates the runs and loops over them.\n\nThus, the missing code is the part that splits the string into runs of non-W characters and loops over them, applying the condition.\n\nThe code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ncurrent = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'W':\n        if current:\n            runs.append(''.join(current))\n            current = []\n    else:\n        current.append(c)\nif current:\n    runs.append(''.join(current))\nfor run in runs:\n    b |= len({*run})%2\n\nBut the problem's code template has the loop as:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code hereb|=len({*i})%2\n\nSo the code must be written as:\n\ncurrent = []\nruns = []\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'W':\n        if current:\n            runs.append(''.join(current))\n            current = []\n        else:\n            continue\n    else:\n        current.append(c)\nif current:\n    runs.append(''.join(current))\nfor run in runs:\n    b |= len({*run})%2\n\nThus, the missing code is the code to generate the runs and loop over them.\n\nThe final code would look like this:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    current = []\n    runs = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == 'W':\n            if current:\n                runs.append(''.join(current))\n                current = []\n            else:\n                continue\n        else:\n            current.append(c)\n    if current:\n        runs.append(''.join(current))\n    for run in runs:\n        b |= len({*run})%2\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThis should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nExample's string is \"BRBB\" (non-W part):\n\nThe run is \"BRBB\".\n\nThe set is {'B', 'R'}, size 2 \u2192 even \u2192 contributes 0 to b.\n\nThus, b remains 0 \u2192 output YES.\n\nAnother test case: \"BB\" \u2192 run is \"BB\" \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 contributes 1 \u2192 output NO.\n\nA single 'R' \u2192 run length 1 \u2192 set size 1 \u2192 contributes 1 \u2192 NO.\n\nA run of \"RB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nA run of \"RBRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nA run of \"BRRB\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nA run of \"BRBR\" \u2192 okay.\n\nA run of \"BRB\" \u2192 length 3, set size 2 \u2192 allowed? The code would allow it because the set size is even. But the length is 3, which is odd. But the code doesn't check the length. Wait, the code's condition is only based on the set size. But the length can be any as long as the set has both R and B.\n\nWait, the code's condition is that the set size is even (i.e., contains both R and B). The length can be any as long as the set has both.\n\nBut the problem requires that the run has at least two characters. Because a run of length 1 would have set size 1 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 thus, the code's condition catches it.\n\nA run of length 3 with both R and B is allowed. For example, \"RBR\" \u2192 set size 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nThus, the code is correct."
